goodnight  the fray of suport  lord maxwells goodnight  the lads of wamphray     introduction   from the remote period when the roman province was contracted by the ramparts of severus until the union of the kingdoms the borders of scotland formed the stage upon which were presented the most memorable conflicts of two gallant nations the inhabitants at the commencement of this aera formed the first wave of the torrent which assaulted and finally overwhelmed the barriers of the roman power in britain the subsequent events in which they were engaged tended little to diminish their military hardihood or to reconcile them to a more civilized state of society we have no occasion to trace the state of the borders during the long and obscure period of scottish history which preceded the accession of the stuart family to illustrate a few ballads the earliest of which is hardly coeval with james v such an enquiry would be equally difficult and vain if we may trust the welch bards in their account of the wars betwixt the saxons and danes of deira and the cumraig imagination can hardly form sidenote 570 any idea of conflicts more desperate than were maintained on the borders between the ancient british and their teutonic invaders thus the gododin describes the waste and devastation of mutual havoc in colours so glowing as strongly to recall the words of tacitus et ubi solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant1  footnote 1 in the spirited translation of this poem by jones the following verses are highly descriptive of the exhausted state of the victor army    at madocs tent the clarion sounds   with rapid clangour hurried far   each echoing dell the note resounds   but when return the sons of war   thou born of stern necessity   dull peace the desert yields to thee   and owns thy melancholy sway  at a later period the saxon families who fled from the exterminating sword of the conqueror with many of the normans themselves whom discontent and intestine feuds had driven into exile began to rise into eminence upon the scottish borders they brought with them arts both of peace and of war unknown in scotland and among their descendants we soon number the most powerful border chiefs such during the reign of the sidenote 1249 last alexander were patrick earl of march and lord soulis renowned in tradition and such were also the powerful comyns who early acquired the principal sway upon the scottish marches sidenote 1300 in the civil wars betwixt bruce and baliol all those powerful chieftains espoused the unsuccessful party they were forfeited and exiled and upon their ruins was founded the formidable house of douglas the borders from sea to sea were now at the devotion of a succession of mighty chiefs whose exorbitant power threatened to place a new dynasty upon the scottish throne it is not my intention to trace the dazzling career of this race of heroes whose exploits were alike formidable to the english and to their sovereign  the sun of douglas set in blood the murders of the sixth earl and his brother in the castle of edinburgh were followed by that of their successor poignarded at stirling by the hand of his prince his brother earl james appears neither to have possessed the abilities nor the ambition of his ancestors he drew indeed against his prince the formidable sword of douglas but with a timid and hesitating hand procrastination ruined his cause and he was deserted at abercorn by the knight of cadyow chief of the hamiltons and by his most active adherents after they had ineffectually exhorted him to commit sidenote 1453 his fate to the issue of a battle the border chiefs who longed for independence shewed little sidenote 1455 inclination to follow the declining fortunes of douglas on the contrary the most powerful clans engaged and defeated him at arkinholme in annandale when after a short residence in england he again endeavoured to gain a footing in his native country2 the spoils of douglas were liberally distributed among his conquerors and royal grants of his forfeited domains effectually interested them in excluding his return an sidenote 1457 attempt on the east borders by the percy and the douglas both together was equally unsuccessful the earl grown old in exile longed once more to see his native country and vowed that sidenote 1483 upon saint magdalens day he would deposit his offering on the high altar at lochmabenaccompanied by the banished earl of albany with his usual ill fortune he entered scotlandthe borderers assembled to oppose him and he suffered a final defeat at burnswark in dumfriesshire the aged earl was taken in the fight by a son of kirkpatrick of closeburn one of his own vassals a grant of lands had been offered for his person carry me to the king said douglas to kirkpatrick thou art well entitled to profit by my misfortune for thou wast true to me while i was true to myself the young man wept bitterly and offered to fly with the earl into england but douglas weary of exile refused his proffered liberty and only requested that kirkpatrick would not deliver him to the king till he had secured his own reward3 kirkpatrick did more he stipulated for the personal safety of his old master his generous intercession prevailed and the last of the douglasses was permitted to die in monastic seclusion in the abbey of lindores  footnote 2 at the battle of arkinholme the earl of angus a near kinsman of douglas commanded the royal forces and the difference of their complexion occasioned the saying that the black douglas had put down the red the maxwells the johnstones and the scotts composed his army archibald earl of murray brother to douglas was slain in the action and hugh earl of ormond his second brother was taken and executed his

interfectorum  similar grants of land were made to finnart and arran the two branches of the house of hamilton to the chiefs of the battisons but above all to the earl of angus who obtained from royal favour a donation of the lordship of douglas and many other lands now held by lord douglas as his representative there appears however to be some doubt whether in this division the earl of angus received more than his natural right our historians indeed say that william i earl of douglas had three sons 1 james the 2d earl who died in the field of otterburn 2 archibald the grim 3d earl and 3 george in right of his mother earl of angus whether however this archibald was actually the son of william seems very doubtful and sir david dalrymple has strenuously maintained the contrary now if archibald the grim intruded into the earldom of douglas without being a son of that family it follows that the house of angus being kept out of their just rights for more than a century were only restored to them after the battle of arkinholme perhaps this may help to account for the eager interest taken by the earl of angus against his kinsmanremarks on history of scotland edinburgh 1773 p 121  footnote 3 a grant of the king dated 2d october 1484 bestowed upon kirkpatrick for this acceptable service the lands of kirkmichael  after the fall of the house of douglas no one chieftain appears to have enjoyed the same extensive supremacy over the scottish borders the various barons who had partaken of the spoil combined in resisting a succession of uncontrouled domination the earl of angus alone seems to have taken rapid steps in the same course of ambition which had been pursued by his kinsmen and rivals the earls of douglas archibald sixth earl of angus called bellthecat was at once warden of the east and middle marches lord of liddisdale and jedwood forest and possessed of the strong castles of douglas hermitage and tantallon highly esteemed by the ancient nobility a faction which he headed shook the throne of the feeble james iii whose person they restrained and whose minions they led to an ignominious death the king failed not to shew his sense of these insults though unable effectually to avenge them this hastened his fate and the field of bannockburn once the scene of a more glorious conflict beheld the combined chieftains of the border counties arrayed against their sovereign under the banners of his own son the king was supported by almost all the barons of the north but the tumultuous ranks of the highlanders were ill able to endure the steady and rapid charge of the men of annandale and liddisdale who bare spears two ells longer than were used by the rest of their countrymen the yells with which they accompanied their onset caused the heart of james to quail within him he deserted his host sidenote 1488 and fled towards stirling but falling from his horse he was murdered by the pursuers  james iv a monarch of a vigorous and energetic character was well aware of the danger which his ancestors had experienced from the preponderance of one overgrown family he is supposed to have smiled internally when the border and highland champions bled and died in the savage sports of chivalry by which his nuptials were solemnized upon the waxing power of angus he kept a wary eye and embracing the occasion of a casual slaughter he compelled that earl and his son to exchange the lordship of liddisdale and the castle of hermitage for the castle and lordship of bothwell4 by this policy he prevented the house of angus mighty as it was from rising to the height whence the elder branch of their family had been hurled  footnote 4 spens of kilspindie a renowned cavalier had been present in court when the earl of angus was highly praised for strength and valour it may be answered spens if all be good that is upcome insinuating that the courage of the earl might not answer the promise of his person shortly after angus while hawking near borthwick with a single attendant met kilspindie what reason had ye said the earl for making question of my manhood thou art a tall fellow and so am i and by st bride of douglas one of us shall pay for itsince it may be no better answered kilspindie i will defend myself against the best earl in scotland with these words they encountered fiercely till angus with one blow severed the thigh of his antagonist who died upon the spot the earl then addressed the attendant of kilspindie go thy way tell my gossip the king that here was nothing but fair play i know my gossip will be offended but i will get me into liddisdale and remain in my castle of the hermitage till his anger be abatedgodscroft vol ii p 59 the price of the earls pardon seems to have been the exchange

the byres when about to engage in single combat with bothwell at carberryhillgodscroft vol ii p 175  nor did james fail in affording his subjects on the marches marks of his royal justice and protection sidenote 1510 the clan of turnbull having been guilty of unbounded excesses the king came suddenly to jedburgh by a night march and executed the most rigid justice upon the astonished offenders their submission was made with singular solemnity two hundred of the tribe met the king at the water of rule holding in their hands the naked swords with which they had perpetrated their crimes and having each around his neck the halter which he had well merited a few were capitally punished many imprisoned and the rest dismissed after they had given hostages for their future peaceable demeanourholinsheds chronicle lesly  the hopes of scotland excited by the prudent and spirited conduct of james were doomed to a sudden and fatal reverse why should we recapitulate the painful tale of the defeat and death of a highspirited prince prudence policy the prodigies of superstition and the advice of his most experienced counsellors were alike unable to subdue in james the blazing zeal of romantic chivalry the monarch and the flower of his nobles sidenote 1513 precipitately rushed to the fatal field of flodden whence they were never to return  the minority of james v presents a melancholy scene scotland through all its extent felt the truth of the adage that the country is hapless whose prince is a child but the border counties exposed from their situation to the incursions of the english deprived of many of their most gallant chiefs and harassed by the intestine struggles of the survivors were reduced to a wilderness inhabited only by the beasts of the field and by a few more brutal warriors lord home the chamberlain and favourite of james iv leagued with the earl of angus who married the widow of his sovereign held for a time the chief sway upon the east border albany the regent of the kingdom bred in the french court and more accustomed to wield the pen than the sword feebly endeavoured to controul a lawless nobility to whom his manners appeared strange and his person sidenote 1516 despicable it was in vain that he inveigled the lord home to edinburgh where he was tried and executed this example of justice or severity only irritated the kinsmen and followers of the deceased baron for though in other respects not more sanguinary than the rest of a barbarous nation the borderers never dismissed from their memory a deadly feud till blood for blood had been exacted to the uttermost drachm5 of this the fate of anthony darcey seigneur de la bastie affords a melancholy example this gallant french cavalier was appointed warden of the east marches by albany at his first disgraceful retreat to france though de la bastie was an able statesman and a true son of chivalry the choice of the regent was nevertheless unhappy the new warden was a foreigner placed in the office of lord home as sidenote 1517 the delegate of the very man who had brought that baron to the scaffold a stratagem contrived by home of wedderburn who burned to avenge the death of his chief drew de la bastie towards langton in the merse here he found himself surrounded by his enemies in attempting by the speed of his horse to gain the castle of dunbar the warden plunged into a morass where he was overtaken and cruelly butchered wedderburn himself cut off his head and in savage triumph knitted it to his saddlebow by the long flowing hair which had been

proved too strong for him upon the sidenote 1520 border he was routed by these clans at kelso and afterwards in a sharp skirmish fought betwixt his faction and that of angus in the highstreet of the metropolis7  footnote 7 the particulars of this encounter are interesting the hamiltons were the most numerous party drawn chiefly from the western counties their leaders met in the palace of archbishop beaton and resolved to apprehend angus who was come to the city to attend the convention of estates gawain douglas bishop of dunkeld a near relation of angus in vain endeavoured to mediate betwixt the factions he appealed to beaton and invoked his assistance to prevent bloodshed on my conscience answered the archbishop i cannot help what is to happen as he laid his hand upon his breast at this solemn declaration the hauberk concealed by his rocket was heard to clatter ah my lord retorted douglas your conscience sounds hollow he then expostulated with the secular leaders and sir patrick hamilton brother to arran was convinced by his remonstrances but sir james the natural son of the earl upbraided his uncle with reluctance to fight false bastard answered sir patrick i will fight to day where thou darest not be seen with these words they rushed tumultuously towards the highstreet where angus with the prior of coldinghame and the redoubted wedderburn waited their assault at the head of 400 spearmen the flower of the east marches who having broke down the gate of the netherbow had arrived just in time to the earls assistance the advantage of the ground and the disorder of the hamiltons soon gave the day to angus sir patrick hamilton and the master of montgomery were slain arran and sir james hamilton escaped with difficulty and with no less difficulty was the

have revived and after a slumber of near a century again to threaten destruction to the scottish monarchypinkerton vol 11 p 277  in fact the time now returned when no one durst strive with a douglas or with his follower for although angus used the outward pageant of conducting the king around the country for punishing thieves and traitors yet says pitscottie none were found greater than were in his own company the high spirit of the young king was galled by the ignominious restraint under which he found himself and in a progress to the border for repressing the armstrongs he probably gave such signs of dissatisfaction as excited the sidenote 1526 laird of buccleuch to attempt his rescue  this powerful baron was the chief of a hardy clan inhabiting ettrick forest eskdale ewsdale the higher part of tiviotdale and a portion of liddesdale in this warlike district he easily levied a thousand horse comprehending a large body of elliots armstrongs and other broken clans over whom the laird of buccleuch exercised an extensive authority being termed by lord dacre chief maintainer of all misguided men on the borders of scotlandletter to wolsey july 18 1528 the earl of angus with his reluctant ward had slept at melrose and the clans of home and kerr under the lord home and the barons of cessford and fairnihirst had taken their leave of the king when in the gray of the morning buccleuch and his band of cavalry were discovered hanging like a thundercloud upon the neighbouring hill of haliden10 a herald was sent to demand his purpose and to charge him to retire to the first point he answered that he came to shew his clan to the king according to the custom of the borders to the second that he knew the kings mind better than anguswhen this haughty answer was reported to the earl sir said he to the king yonder is buccleuch with the thieves of annandale and liddesdale to bar your graces passage i vow to god they shall either fight or flee your grace shall tarry on this hillock with my brother george and i will either clear your road of yonder banditti or die in the attempt the earl with these words alighted and hastened to the charge while the earl of lennox at whose instigation buccleuch made the attempt remained with the king an inactive spectator buccleuch and his followers likewise dismounted and received the assailants with a dreadful shout and a shower of lances the encounter was fierce and obstinate but the homes and kerrs returning at the noise of battle bore down and dispersed the left wing of buccleuchs little army the hired banditti fled on all sides but the chief himself surrounded by his clan fought desperately in the retreat the laird of cessford chief of the roxburgh kerrs pursued the chace fiercely till at the bottom of a steep path elliot of stobs a follower of buccleuch turned and slew him with a stroke of his lance when cessford fell the pursuit ceased but his death with those of buccleuchs friends who fell in the action to the number of eighty occasioned a deadly feud betwixt the names of scott and kerr which cost much blood upon the marches11see pitscottie lesly and godscroft  footnote 10 near darnick by a corruption

december 1526   sidenote 1528 stratagem at length effected what force had been unable to accomplish and the king emancipated from the iron tutelage of angus made the first use of his authority by banishing from the kingdom his late lieutenant and the whole race of douglas this command was not enforced without difficulty for the power of angus was strongly rooted in the east border where he possessed the castle of tantallon and the hearts of the homes and kerrs the former whose strength was proverbial12 defied a royal army and the latter at the pass of pease baffled the earl of argyles

the shattered ruins of this celebrated fortress still overhang a tremendous rock on the coast of east lothian  footnote 13 edgebucklin near musselburgh  the pertinacious opposition of angus to his doom irritated to the extreme the fiery temper of james and he swore in his wrath that a douglas should never serve him an oath which he kept in circumstances under which the spirit of chivalry which he worshipped14 should have taught him other feelings  footnote 14 i allude to the affecting story of douglas of kilspindie uncle to the earl of angus this gentleman had been placed by angus about the kings person who when a boy loved him much on account of his singular activity of body and was wont to call him his graysteil after a champion of chivalry in the romance of sir eger and sir grime he shared however the fate of his chief and for many years served in france weary at length of exile the aged warrior recollecting the kings personal attachment to him resolved to throw himself on his clemency as james returned from hunting in the park at stirling he saw a person at a distance and turning to his nobles exclaimed yonder is my graysteil archibald of kilspindie as he approached douglas threw himself on his knees and implored permission to lead an obscure life in his native land but the name of douglas was an amulet which steeled the kings heart against the influence of compassion and juvenile recollection he passed the suppliant without an answer and rode briskly up the steep hill towards the castle kilspindie though loaded with a hauberk under his cloaths kept pace with the horse in vain endeavouring to catch a glance from the implacable monarch he sat down at the gate weary and exhausted and asked for a draught of water even this was refused by the royal attendants the king afterwards blamed their discourtesy but kilspindie was obliged to return to france where he died of a broken heart the same disease which afterwards brought to the grave his unrelenting sovereign even the stern henry viii blamed his nephews conduct quoting the generous saying a kings face should give gracegodscroft vol ii p 107  while these transactions by which the fate of scotland was influenced were passing upon the eastern border the lord maxwell seems to have exercised a most uncontrouled domination in dumfriesshire even the power of the earl of angus was exerted in vain against the banditti of liddesdale protected and bucklered by this mighty chief repeated complaints are made by the english residents of the devastation occasioned by the depredations of the elliots scotts and armstrongs connived at and encouraged by maxwell sidenote 1528 buccleuch and fairnihirst at a convention of border commissioners it was agreed that the king of england in case the excesses of the liddesdale freebooters were not duly redressed should be at liberty to issue letters of reprisal to his injured subjects granting power to invade the said inhabitants of liddesdale to their slaughters burning heirships robbing reifing despoiling and destruction and so to continue the same at his graces pleasure till the attempts of the inhabitants were fully atoned for this impolitic expedient by which the scottish prince unable to execute justice on his turbulent subjects committed to a rival sovereign the power of unlimited chastisement was a principal cause of the savage state of the borders for the inhabitants finding that the sword of revenge was substituted for that of justice were loosened from their attachment to scotland and boldly threatened to carry on their depredations in spite of the efforts of both kingdoms  james v however was not backward in using more honourable expedients to quell the banditti sidenote 1529 on the borders the imprisonment of their chiefs and a noted expedition in which many of the principal thieves were executed see introduction to the ballad called johnie armstrong produced such good effects that according to an ancient picturesque history thereafter there was great peace and rest a long time where through the king had great profit for he had ten thousand sheep going in the ettrick forest in keeping by andrew bell

northumberland a formidable name to scotland ravaged the middle marches and burned branxholm the abode of buccleuch the hereditary enemy of the english name buccleuch with the barons of cessford and fairnihirst retaliated by a raid into england sidenote 1533 where they acquired much spoil on the east march fowberry was destroyed by the scots and dunglass castle by darcey and the banished angus  a short peace was quickly followed by another war which proved fatal to scotland and to her king in the battle of haddenrig the english and the exiled douglasses were defeated by the lords huntly and home but this was a transient gleam of success kelso was burned and the borders sidenote 1542 ravaged by the duke of norfolk and finally the rout of solway moss in which ten thousand men the flower of the scottish army were dispersed and defeated by a band of five hundred english cavalry or rather by their own dissentions broke the proud heart of james a death more painful a hundred fold than was met by his father in the field of flodden  when the strength of the scottish army had sunk without wounds and without renown the principal chiefs were led captive into englandamong these was the lord maxwell who was compelled by the menaces of henry to swear allegiance to the english monarch there is still in existence the spirited instrument of vindication by which he renounces his connection with england and the honours and estates which had been proffered him as the price of treason to his infant sovereign from various bonds of manrent it appears that all the western marches were swayed sidenote 1543 by this powerful chieftain with maxwell and the other captives returned to scotland the banished earl of angus and his brother sir george douglas after a banishment of fifteen years this powerful family regained at least a part of their influence upon the borders and grateful to the kingdom which had afforded them protection during their exile became chiefs of the english faction in scotland whose object it was to urge a contract of marriage betwixt the young queen and the heir apparent of england the impetuosity of henry the ancient hatred betwixt the nations and the wavering temper of the governor arran prevented the success of this measure the wrath of the disappointed monarch discharged itself in a widewasting and furious invasion of the east marches conducted by the earl of hertford seton home and buccleuch hanging on the mountains of lammermoor saw with ineffectual regret the fertile plains of merse and lothian and the metropolis itself reduced to a smoking desert hertford had scarcely retreated with the main army when evers and latoun laid waste the whole vale of tiviot with a ferocity of devastation hitherto unheard of15 the same lion mode of wooing being pursued during the minority of edward vi totally alienated the affections even of those scots who were most attached to the english interest the earl of angus in particular united himself to the governor and gave the english a sharp defeat at ancram moor sidenote 1545 a particular account of which action is subjoined to the ballad entituled the eve of st john even the fatal defeat at pinky

65    the arrival of french auxiliaries and of french gold rendered vain the splendid successes of the english one by one the fortresses which they occupied were recovered by force or by stratagem and the vindictive cruelty of the scottish borderers made dreadful retaliation for the injuries they had sustained an idea may be conceived of this horrible warfare from the memoirs of beaugé a french officer serving in scotland  the castle of fairnihirst situated about three miles above jedburgh had been taken and garrisoned by the english the commander and his followers are accused of such excesses of lust and cruelty as would says beaugé have made to tremble the most savage moor in africa a band of frenchmen with the laird of fairnihirst and sidenote 1549 his borderers assaulted this fortress the english archers showered their arrows down the steep ascent leading to the castle and from the outer wall by which it was surrounded a vigorous escalade however gained the base court and the sharp fire of the french arquebusiers drove the bowmen into the square keep or dungeon of the fortress here the english defended themselves till a breach in the wall was made by mining through this hole the commandant creeped forth and surrendering himself to de la motherouge implored protection from the vengeance of the borderers but a scottish marchman eyeing in the captive the ravisher of his wife approached him ere the french officer could guess his intention and at one blow carried his head four paces from the trunk above a hundred scots rushed to wash their hands in the blood of their oppressor bandied about the severed head and expressed their joy in such shouts as if they had stormed the city of london the prisoners who fell into their merciless hands were put to death after their eyes had been torn out the victors contending who should display the greatest address in severing their legs and arms before inflicting a mortal wound when their own prisoners were slain the scottish with an unextinguishable thirst for blood purchased those of the french parting willingly with their very arms in exchange for an english captive i myself says beaugé with military sangfroid i myself sold them a prisoner for a small horse they laid him down upon the ground galloped over him with their lances in rest and wounded him as they passed when slain they cut his body in pieces and bore the mangled gobbets in triumph on the points of their spears i cannot greatly praise the scottish for this practice but the truth is that the english tyrannized over the borders in a most barbarous manner and i think it was but fair to repay them according to the proverb in their own coin  campagnes de beaugé  a peace in 1551 put an end to this war the most destructive which for a length of time had ravaged scotland some attention was paid by the governor and queenmother to the administration of justice on the border and the chieftains who had distinguished themselves during the late troubles received the honour of knighthood17 sidenote 1522 at this time also the debateable land a tract of country situated betwixt the esk and sarke claimed by both kingdoms was divided by royal commissioners appointed by the two crownsby their award this land of contention was separated by a line drawn from east to west betwixt the rivers the upper half was adjudged to scotland and the more eastern part to england yet the debateable land continued long after to be the residence of the thieves and banditti to whom its dubious state had afforded a desirable refuge18  footnote 17 these were the lairds of buccleuch cessford and fairnihirst littleden grenehed and coldingknows buccleuch whose gallant exploits we have noticed did not long enjoy his new honours he was murdered in the streets of edinburgh by his hereditary enemies the kerrs anno 1552  footnote 18 the jest of james vi is well known who when a favourite cow had found her way from london back to her native country of fife observed that nothing surprised him so much as her passing uninterrupted through the debateable land  in 1557 a new war broke out in which rencounters on the borders were as usual numerous and with varied success in some of these the too famous bothwell is said to have given proofs of his courage which was at other times very questionable19 about this time the scottish borderers seem to have acquired some ascendency over their southern neighboursstrype vol iii p 437in 1559 peace was again restored  footnote 19 he was lord of liddesdale and keeper of the hermitage castle but he had little effective power over that country and was twice defeated by the armstrongs its lawless inhabitantsborder history p 584 yet the unfortunate mary in her famous apology says that in the weiris againis ingland he gaif proof of his vailyentnes courage and gude conduct and praises him especially for subjugating the rebellious subjectis inhabiting the cuntreis lying ewest the marches of inglandkeith p 388 he appears actually to have defeated sir henry percy in a skirmish called the raid of haltweilswire  the flame of reformation long stifled in scotland now burst forth with the violence of a volcanic eruption the siege of leith was commenced by the combined forces of the congregation and of england the borderers cared little about speculative points of religion but they shewed themselves much interested in the treasures which passed through their country for payment of the english forces at edinburgh much alarm was excited lest the marchers should intercept these weighty protestant arguments and it was probably by voluntarily imparting a share in them to lord home that he became a sudden convert to the new faith20  footnote 20 this nobleman had shortly before threatened to spoil the english east march but says the duke of norfolk we have provided such sauce for him that i think he will not deal in such matter but if he do fire but one haygoff he shall not go to home again without torchlight and peradventure may find a lanthorn at his own house  upon the arrival of the illfated mary in her native country she found the borders in a state of great disorder the exertions of her natural brother afterwards the famous regent murray were necessary to restore some degree of tranquillity he marched to jedburgh executed twenty or thirty of the transgressors burned many houses and brought a number of prisoners to edinburgh the chieftains of the principal clans were also obliged to grant pledges for their future obedience a noted convention for the particulars of which see border laws p 84 adopted various regulations which were attended with great advantage to the marches21  footnote 21 the commissioners on the english side were the elder lord scroope of bolton sir john foster sir thomas gargrave and dr rookby on the scottish side appeared sir john maxwell of terreagles and sir john ballenden  the unhappy match betwixt henry darnley and his sovereign led to new dissentions on the border the homes kerrs and other east marchers hastened to support the queen against murray chatelherault and other nobles whom her marriage had offended for the same purpose the johnstones jardines and clans of annandale entered into bonds of confederacy but liddesdale was under the influence of england in so much that randolph the english minister proposed to hire a band of strapping elliots to find home business at home in looking after his corn and cattlekeith p 265 app 133  this storm was hardly overblown when bothwell received the commission of lieutenant upon the borders but as void of parts as of principle he could not even recover to the queens allegiance his own domains in liddesdalekeith app 165 the queen herself advanced to the borders to remedy this evil and to hold courts at jedburgh bothwell was already in liddesdale where he had been severely wounded in an attempt to seize john elliot of the parke a desperate freebooter and happy had it been for mary had the dagger of the mosstrooper struck more home bothwell being transported to his castle of hermitage the queen upon hearing the tidings hastened thither a dangerous morass still called the queens mire22 is pointed out by tradition as the spot where the lovely mary and her white palfrey were in danger of perishing the distance betwixt hermitage and jedburgh by the way of hawick is nearly twentyfour english miles the queen went and returned the same day whether she visited a wounded subject or a lover in danger has been warmly disputed in our latter days  footnote 22 the queens mire is still a pass of danger exhibiting in many places the bones of the horses which have been entangled in it for what reason the queen chose to enter liddesdale by the circuitous route of hawick does not appear there are two other passes from jedburgh to hermitage castle the one by the note of the gate the other over the mountain called winburgh either of these but especially the latter is several miles shorter than that by hawick and the queens mire but by the circuitous way of hawick the queen could traverse the districts of more friendly clans than by going directly into the disorderly province of liddesdale  to the death of henry darnley it is said some of the border lords were privy but the subsequent marriage betwixt the queen and bothwell alienated from her the affections of the chieftains of the marches most of whom aided the association of the insurgent barons a few gentlemen of the merse however joined the army which mary brought to carberryhill but no one was willing to fight for the detested bothwell nor did bothwell himself shew any inclination to put his person in jeopardy the result to mary was a rigorous captivity in lochleven castle and the name of bothwell scarcely again pollutes the page of scottish history  the distress of a beautiful and afflicted princess softened the hearts of her subjects and when she escaped from her severe captivity the most powerful barons in scotland crowded around her standard among these were many of the west border men under the lords maxwell and herries23 but the defeat at langside was a deathblow to her interest in scotland  footnote 23 the followers of these barons are said to have stolen the horses of their friends while they were engaged in the battle  the death of the regent murray in 1569 excited the party of mary to hope and to exertion it seems that the design of bothwelhaugh who slew him was well known upon the borders for the very day on which the slaughter happened buccleuch and fairnihirst with their clans broke into england and spread devastation along the frontiers with unusual ferocity it is probable they well knew that the controuling hand of the regent was that day palsied by death buchanan exclaims loudly against this breach of truce with elizabeth charging queen marys party with having houndit furth proude and uncircumspecte young men to hery burne and slay and tak prisoneris in her realme and use all misordour and crueltie not only usit in weir but detestabil to all barbar and wild tartaris in slaying of prisoneris and

as well as borderers buccleuch and fairnihirst the johnstons and armstrongs the grants and the clan chattan besides these powerful clans mary numbered among her adherents the maxwells and almost all the west border leaders excepting drumlanrig and jardine of applegirth on the eastern border the faction of the infant king was more powerful for although deserted by lord home the greater part of his clan under the influence of wedderburn remained attached to that party the laird of cessford wished them well and the earl of angus naturally followed the steps of his uncle morton a sharp and bloody invasion of the middle march under the command of the earl of sussex avenged with interest the raids of buccleuch and fairnihirst the domains of these chiefs were laid waste their castles burned and destroyed the narrow vales of beaumont and kale belonging to buccleuch were treated with peculiar severity and the forrays of hertford were equalled by that of sussex in vain did the chiefs request assistance from the government to defend their fortresses through the predominating interest of elizabeth in the scottish councils this was refused to all but home whose castle nevertheless again received an english garrison while buccleuch and fairnihirst complained bitterly that those who had instigated their invasion durst not even come so far as lauder to shew countenance to their defence against the english the bickerings which followed distracted the whole kingdom one celebrated exploit may be selected as an illustration of the border fashion of war  the earl of lennox who had succeeded murray in the regency held a parliament at stirling in 1571 the young king was exhibited to the great council of his nation he had been tutored to repeat a set speech composed for the occasion but observing that the roof of the building was a little decayed he interrupted his recitation and exclaimed with childish levity that there was a hole in the parliamentwords which in these days were held to presage the deadly breach shortly to be made in that body by the death of him in whose name it was convoked  amid the most undisturbed security of confidence the lords who composed this parliament were roused at daybreak by the shouts of their enemies in the heart of the town god and the queen resounded from every quarter and in a few minutes the regent with the astonished nobles of his party were prisoners to a band of two hundred border cavalry led by scott of buccleuch and to the lord claud hamilton at the head of three hundred infantry these enterprising chiefs by a rapid and well concerted manoeuvre had reached stirling in a night march from edinburgh and without so much as being bayed at by a watchdog had seized the principal street of the townthe fortunate obstinacy of morton saved his party stubborn and undaunted he defended his house till the assailants set it in flames and then yielded with reluctance to his kinsman buccleuch but the time which he had gained effectually served his cause the borderers had dispersed to plunder the stables of the nobility the infantry thronged tumultuously together on the main street when the earl of mar issuing from the castle placed one or two small pieces of ordnance in his own halfbuilt house24 which commands the market place hardly had the artillery begun to scour the street when the assailants surprised in their turn fled with precipitation their alarm was increased by the townsmen thronging to arms those who had been so lately triumphant were now in many instances asking the protection of their own prisoners in all probability not a man would have escaped death or captivity but for the characteristic rapacity of buccleuchs marauders who having seized and carried off all the horses in the town left the victors no means of following the chace the regent was slain by an officer named caulder in order to prevent his being rescued spens of ormeston to whom he had surrendered lost his life in a generous attempt to protect him25 hardly does our history present another enterprise so well planned so happily commenced and so strangely disconcerted to the licence of the marchmen the failure was attributed but the same cause ensured a safe retreatspottiswoode godscroft robertson melville  footnote 24 this building still remains in the unfinished state which it then presented  footnote 25 birrel says that the regent was shot by an unhappy fellow while sitting on horseback behind the laird of buccleuchthe following curious account of the whole transaction is extracted from a journal of principal events in the years 1570 1571 1572 and part of 1573 kept by richard bannatyne amanuensis to john knox the fourt of september they of edinburgh horsemen and futmen and as was reported the

esq  the wily earl of morton who after the short intervening regency of mar succeeded to the supreme authority contrived by force or artifice to render the party of the king every where superior even on the middle borders he had the address to engage in his cause the powerful though savage and licentious clans of rutherford and turnbull as well as the citizens of jedburgh he was thus enabled to counterpoise his powerful opponents buccleuch and fairnihirst in their own country and after an unsuccessful attempt to surprise jedburgh even these warm adherents of mary relinquished her cause in despair  while morton swayed the state his attachment to elizabeth and the humiliation which many of the border chiefs had undergone contributed to maintain good order on the marches till james vi himself assumed the reigns of governmentthe intervening skirmish of the reidswire see the ballad under that title was but a sudden explosion of the rivalry and suppressed hatred of the borderers of both kingdoms in truth the stern rule of morton and of his delegates men unconnected with the borders by birth maintained in that country more strict discipline than had ever been there exercised perhaps this hastened his fall  the unpopularity of morton acquired partly by the strict administration of justice and partly by avarice and severity forced him from the regency in 1578 he retired apparently from state affairs to his castle of dalkeith which the populace emphatically expressing their awe and dread of his person termed the lions den but morton could not live in retirement and early in the same year the aged lion again rushed from his cavern by a mixture of policy and violence he possessed himself of the fortress of stirling and of the person of james his nephew angus hastened to his assistance against him appeared his follower cessford with many of the homes and the citizens of edinburgh alluding to the restraint of the kings person they bore his effigy on their banners with a rude rhyme demanding liberty or deathbirrels diary ad annum 1578 the earl of morton marched against his foes as far as falkirk and a desperate action must have ensued but for the persuasions of bowes the english ambassador the only blood then spilt was in a duel betwixt tait a follower of cessford and johnstone a west border man attending upon angus they fought with lances and on horseback according to the fashion of the bordersthe former was unhorsed and slain the latter desperately woundedgodscroft vol ii p 261 the prudence of the late regent appears to have abandoned him when he was decoyed into a treaty upon this occasion it was not long before morton the veteran warrior and the crafty statesman was forced bend his neck to an engine of death26 the use of which he himself had introduced into scotland  footnote 26 a rude sort of guillotine called the maiden the implement is now in possession of the society of scottish antiquaries  released from the thraldom of morton the king with more than youthful levity threw his supreme power into the hands of lennox and arran the religion of the first and the infamous character of the second favourite excited the hatred of the commons while their exclusive and engrossing power awakened the jealousy of the other nobles james doomed to be the sport of contending factions was seized at stirling by the nobles confederated in what was termed the raid of ruthven but the conspirators soon suffered their prize to escape and were rewarded for their enterprize by exile or death  in 1585 an affray took place at a border meeting in which lord russel the earl of bedfords eldest son chanced to be slain queen elizabeth imputed the guilt of this slaughter to thomas kerr of fairnihirst instigated by arran upon the imperious demand of the english ambassador both were committed to prison but the minion arran was soon restored to liberty and favour while fairnihirst the dread of the english borderers and the gallant defender of queen mary died in his confinement of a broken heartspottiswoode p 341  the tyranny of arran becoming daily more insupportable the exiled lords joined by maxwell home bothwell and other border chieftains seized the town of stirling which was pillaged by their disorderly followers invested the castle which surrendered at discretion and drove the favourite from the kings council27  footnote 27 the associated nobles seem to have owed their success chiefly to the border spearmen for though they had a band of mercenaries who used fire arms yet they were such bad masters of their craft their captain was heard to observe that those who knew his soldiers as well as he did would hardly chuse to march before themgodscroft v ii p 368  the king perceiving the earl of bothwell among the armed barons to whom he surrendered his person addressed him in these prophetic words francis francis what moved thee to come in arms against thy prince who never wronged thee i wish thee a more quiet spirit else i foresee thy destructionspottiswoode p 343  in fact the extraordinary enterprizes of this nobleman disturbed the next ten years of jamess reign francis stuart son to a bastard of james v had been invested with the titles and estates belonging to his maternal uncle james hepburn earl of bothwell upon the forfeiture of that infamous man and consequently became lord of liddesdale and of the castle of hermitagethis acquisition of power upon the borders where he could easily levy followers willing to undertake the most desperate enterprize joined to the mans native daring and violent spirit rendered bothwell the most turbulent insurgent that ever disturbed the tranquillity of a kingdom during the kings absence in denmark bothwell swayed by the superstition of his age had tampered with certain soothsayers and witches by whose pretended art he hoped to atchieve the death of his monarch in one of the courts of inquisition which james delighted to hold upon the professors of the occult sciences some of his cousins proceedings were brought to light for which he was put in ward in the castle of edinburgh burning with revenge he broke from his confinement and lurked for some time upon the borders where he hoped for the countenance of his soninlaw buccleuch undeterred by the absence of that chief who in obedience to the royal command had prudently retired to france bothwell attempted the desperate enterprize of seizing the person of the king while residing in his metropolis at the dead of night followed by a band of borderers he occupied the court of the palace of holyrood and began to burst open the doors of the royal apartments the nobility distrustful of each other and ignorant of the extent of the conspiracy only endeavoured to make good the defence of their separate lodgings but darkness and confusion prevented the assailants from profiting by their disunion melville who was present gives a lively picture of the scene of disorder transiently illuminated by the glare of passing torches while the report of fire arms the clatter of armour the din of hammers thundering on the gates mingled wildly with the warcry of the borderers who shouted incessantly justice justice a bothwell a bothwell the citizens of edinburgh at length began to assemble for the defence of their sovereign and bothwell was compelled to retreat which he did without considerable lossmelville p 356 a similar attempt on the person of james while residing at faulkland also misgave but the credit which bothwell obtained on the borders by these bold and desperate enterprizes was incredible all tiviotdale says spottiswoode ran after him so that he finally obtained his object and at edinburgh in 1593 he stood before james an unexpected apparition with his naked sword in his hand strike said james with royal dignitystrike and end thy work i will not survive my dishonour but bothwell with unexpected moderation only stipulated for remission of his forfeiture and did not even insist on remaining at court whence his party was shortly expelled by the return of the lord home and his other enemies incensed at this reverse bothwell levied a body of four hundred cavalry and attacked the kings guard in broad day upon the borough moor near edinburghthe ready succour of the citizens saved james from falling once more into the hands of his turbulent subject28 on a subsequent day bothwell met the laird of cessford riding near edinburgh with whom he fought a single combat which lasted for two hours29 but his credit was now fallen he retreated to england whence he was driven by elizabeth and then wandered to spain and italy where he subsisted in indigence and obscurity on the bread which he earned by apostatizing to the faith of rome so fell this agitator of domestic broils whose name passed into a proverb denoting a powerful and turbulent demagogue30  footnote 28 spottiswoode says the king awaited this charge with firmness but birrell avers that he fled upon the gallop the same author instead of the firm deportment of james when seized by bothwell describes the kings majestie as flying down the back stair with his breeches in his hand in great fearbirrell apud dalyell p 30 such is the difference betwixt the narrative of the courtly archbishop and that of the presbyterian burgess of

combatant parted from pure fatigue  footnote 30 sir walter raleigh in writing of essex then in prison says let the queen hold bothwell while she hath himmurdin vol ii p 812 it appears from crichtons

passing in the metropolis the borders were furiously agitated by civil discord the families of cessford and fairnihirst disputed their right to the wardenry of the middle marches and to the provostry of jedburgh and william kerr of ancram a follower of the latter was murdered by the young chief of cessford at the instigation of his motherspottiswoode p 383 but this was trifling compared to the civil war waged on the western frontier between the johnstones and maxwells of which there is a minute account in the introduction to the ballad entitled maxwells goodnight prefixed to that termed kinmont willie the reader will find an account of the last warden raids performed upon the border  my sketch of border history now draws to a close the accession of james to the english crown

inhabitants to the arts of agricultureeven in the days of lesley the nobles and barons of the merse differed in manners from the other borderers administered justice with regularity and abstained from plunder and depredationde moribus scotorum p 7 but on the middle and western marches the inhabitants were unrestrained mosstroopers and cattle drivers knowing no measure of law says camden but the length of their swords the sterility of the mountainous country which they inhabited offered little encouragement to industry and for the long series of centuries which we have hastily reviewed the hands of rapine were never there folded in inactivity nor the sword of violence returned to the scabbard various proclamations were in vain issued for interdicting the use of horses and arms upon the

the debateable land by a very summary exertion of authority was transported to ireland and their return prohibited under pain of death against other offenders measures equally arbitrary were without hesitation pursued numbers of border riders were executed without even the formality of a trial and it is even said that in mockery of justice assizes were held upon them after they had suffered for

already acquainted with the mixture of courage and rapacity by which they were distinguished and has reviewed some of the scenes in which they acted a principal part it is therefore only necessary to

lose their whole substance by an incursion of the english on a sudden breach of truce they cared little to waste their time in cultivating crops to be reaped by their foes their cattle was therefore their chief property and these were nightly exposed to the southern borderers as rapacious and active as themselves hence robbery assumed the appearance of fair reprisal the fatal privilege of pursuing the marauders into their own country for recovery of stolen goods led to continual skirmishes the warden also himself frequently the chieftain of a border horde when redress was not instantly granted by the opposite officer for depredations sustained by his district was entitled to retaliate upon england by a warden raid in such cases the mosstroopers who crowded to his standard found themselves pursuing their craft under legal authority and became the favourites and followers of the military magistrate whose duty it was to have checked and suppressed them see the curious history of geordie bourne app no ii equally unable and unwilling to make nice distinctions they were not to be convinced that what was today fair booty was tomorrow a subject of theft national animosity usually gave an additional stimulus to their rapacity although it must be owned that their depredations extended also to the more cultivated parts of their own country33  footnote 33 the armorial bearings adopted by many of the border tribes shew how little they were ashamed of their trade of rapine like falstaff they were gentlemen of the night minions of the moon under whose countenance they

this introduction  the borderers had in fact little reason to regard the inland scots as their fellow subjects or to respect the power of the crown they were frequently resigned by express compact to the bloody retaliation of the english without experiencing any assistance from their prince and his more immediate subjects if they beheld him it was more frequently in the character of an avenging judge than of a protecting sovereign they were in truth during the time of peace a kind of outcasts against whom the united powers of england and scotland were often employed hence the men of the borders had little attachment to the monarchs whom they termed in derision the kings of fife and lothian provinces which they were not legally entitled to inhabit34 and which therefore they pillaged with as little remorse as if they had belonged to a foreign country this strange precarious and adventurous mode of life led by the borderers was not without its pleasures and seems in all probability hardly so disagreeable to us as the monotony of regulated society must have been to those who had been long accustomed to a state of rapine well has it been remarked by the eloquent burke that the shifting tides of fear and hope the flight and pursuit the peril and escape alternate famine and feast of the savage and the robber after a time render all course of slow steady progressive unvaried occupation and the prospect only of a limited mediocrity at the end of long labour to the last degree tame languid and insipid the interesting nature of their exploits may be conceived from the account of camden  footnote 34 by act 1587 c 96 borderers are expelled from the inland counties unless they can find security for their quiet deportment  what manner of cattle stealers they are that inhabit these valleys in the marches of both kingdoms john lesley a scotchman himself and bishop of ross will inform you they sally out of their own borders in the night in troops through unfrequented byeways and many intricate windings all the daytime they refresh themselves and their horses in lurking holes they had pitched upon before till they arrive in the dark at those places they have a design upon as soon as they have seized upon the booty they in like manner return home in the night through blind ways and fetching many a compass the more skilful any captain is to pass through those wild deserts crooked turnings and deep precipices in the thickest mists and darkness his reputation is the greater and he is looked upon as a man of an excellent headand they are so very cunning that they seldom have their booty taken from them unless sometimes when by the help of bloodhounds following them exactly upon the tract they may chance to fall into the hands of their adversaries when being taken they have so much persuasive eloquence and so many smooth insinuating words at command that if they do not move their judges nay and even their adversaries notwithstanding the severity of their natures to have mercy yet they incite them to admiration and compassioncamdens britannia the reader is requested to compare this curious account given by lesley with the ballad called hobble noble35  footnote 35 the following tradition is also illustrative of lesleys account veitch of dawyk a man of great strength and bravery who flourished in the 16th century was upon bad terms with a neighbouring proprietor tweedie of drummelziar by some accident a flock of dawyks sheep had strayed over into drummelziars grounds at the time when dickie of the den a liddesdale outlaw was making his rounds in tweeddale seeing this flock of sheep he drove them off without ceremony next morning veitch perceiving his loss summoned his servants and retainers laid a bloodhound upon the traces of the robber by whom they were guided for many miles till on the banks of liddel he staid upon a very large haystack the pursuers were a good deal surprised at the obstinate pause of the bloodhound till dawyk pulled down some of the hay and discovered a large excavation containing the robbers and their spoil he instantly flew upon dickie and was about to poniard him when the marauder with the address noticed by lesley protested that he would never have touched a cloot hoof of them had he not taken them for drummelziars property this dexterous appeal to veitchs passions saved the life of the freebooter  the inroads of the marchers when stimulated only by the desire of plunder were never marked with cruelty and seldom even with bloodshed unless in the case of opposition they held that property was common to all who stood in want of it but they abhorred and avoided the crime of unnecessary homicidelesley p 63 this was perhaps partly owing to the habits of intimacy betwixt the borderers of both kingdoms notwithstanding their mutual hostility and reciprocal depredations a natural intercourse took place between the english and scottish marchers at border meetings and during the short intervals of peace they met frequently at parties of the chace and football and it required many and strict regulations on both sides to prevent them from forming intermarriages and from cultivating too close a degree of intimacyscottish acts 1587 c 105 whartons regulations 6th edward vi the custom also of paying blackmail or protectionrent introduced a connection betwixt the countries for a scottish borderer taking blackmail from an english inhabitant was not only himself bound to abstain from injuring such person but also to maintain his quarrel and recover his property if carried off by others hence an union arose betwixt the parties founded upon mutual interest which counteracted in many instances the effects of national prejudice the similarity of their manners

little difference between the northumbrian and the border scottish a circumstance interesting in itself and decisive of the occasional friendly intercourse among the marchmen from all those combining circumstances arose the lenity of the borderers in their incursions and the equivocal moderation which they sometimes observed towards each other in open war36  footnote 36 this practice of the marchmen was observed and reprobated by patten anoother maner have they the english borderers amoong them of wearyng handkerchers rolld about their armes and letters brouderd embroidered upon their

in the case of deadly feud either against an englishman or against any neighbouring tribe the whole force of the offended clan was bent to avenge the death of any of their number their vengeance not only vented itself upon the homicide and his family but upon all his kindred on his whole tribe on every one in fine whose death or ruin could affect him with regretlesley p 63 border laws passim scottish acts 1594 c 231 the reader will find in the following collection many allusions to this infernal custom which always overcame the marchers general reluctance to shed human blood and rendered him remorselessly savage  for fidelity to their word lesley ascribes high praise to the inhabitants of the scottish frontier when an instance happened to the contrary the injured person at the first border meeting rode through the field displaying a glove the pledge of faith upon the point of his lance and proclaiming the perfidy of the person who had broken his word so great was the indignation of the assembly against the perjured criminal that he was often slain by his own clan to wipe out the disgrace he had brought on them in the same spirit of confidence it was not unusual to behold the victors after an engagement dismiss their prisoners upon parole who never failed either to transmit the stipulated ransom or to surrender themselves to bondage if unable to do so but the virtues of a barbarous people being founded not upon moral principle but upon the dreams of superstition or the capricious dictates of antient custom can seldom be uniformly relied on we must not therefore be surprised to find these very men so true to their word in general using upon other occasions various resources of cunning and chicane against which the border laws were in vain directed  the immediate rulers of the borders were the chiefs of the different clans who exercised over their respective septs a dominion partly patriarchal and partly feudal the latter bond of adherence was however the more slender for in the acts regulating the borders we find repeated mention of clannes having captaines and chieftaines whom on they depend ofttimes against the willes of their landeslordesstat 1587 c 95 and the roll thereto annexed of course these laws looked less to the feudal superior than to the chieftain of the name for the restraint of the disorderly tribes and it is repeatedly enacted that the head of the clan should be first called upon to deliver those of his sept who should commit any trespass and that on his failure to do so he should be liable to the injured party in full redress ibidem and stat 1594 c 231 by the same statutes the chieftains and landlords presiding over border clans were obliged to find caution and to grant hostages that they would subject themselves to the due course of law such clans as had no chieftain of sufficient note to enter bail for their quiet conduct became broken men outlawed to both nations  from these enactments the power of the border chieftains may be conceived for it had been hard and useless to have punished them for the trespasses of their tribes unless they possessed over them unlimited authority the abode of these petty princes by no means corresponded to the extent of their power we do not find on the scottish borders the splendid and extensive baronial castles which graced and defended the opposite frontier the gothic grandeur of alnwick of raby and of naworth marks the wealthier and more secure state of the english nobles the scottish chieftain however extensive his domains derived no advantage save from such parts as he could himself cultivate or occupy payment of rent was hardly known on the borders till after the union37 all that the landlord could gain from those residing upon his estate was their personal service in battle their assistance in labouring the land retained in his natural possession some petty quitrents of a nature resembling the feudal casualties and perhaps a share in the spoil which they acquired by rapine38 this with his herds of cattle and of sheep and with the black mail which he exacted from his neighbours constituted the revenue of the chieftain and from funds so precarious he could rarely spare sums to expend in strengthening or decorating his habitation another reason is found in the scottish mode of warfare it was early discovered that the english surpassed their neighbours in the arts of assaulting or defending fortified places the policy of the scottish therefore deterred them from erecting upon the borders buildings of such extent and strength as being once taken by the foe would have been capable of receiving a permanent garrison39 to themselves the woods and hills of their country were pointed out by the great bruce as their safest bulwarks and the maxim of the douglasses that it was better to hear the lark sing than the mouse cheep was adopted by every border chief for these combined reasons the residence of the chieftain was commonly a large square battlemented40 tower called a keep or peel placed on a precipice or on the banks of a torrent and if the ground would permit surrounded by a moat in short the situation of a border house surrounded by woods and rendered almost inaccessible by torrents by rocks or by morasses sufficiently indicated the pursuits and apprehensions of its inhabitantlocus horroris et vastae solitudinis

outer wall with some slight fortifications served as a protection for the cattle at night the walls of these fortresses were of an immense thickness and they could easily be defended against any small force more especially as the rooms being vaulted each story formed a separate lodgement capable of being held out for a considerable time on such occasions the usual mode adopted by the assailants was to expel the defenders by setting fire to wet straw in the lower apartments but the border chieftains seldom chose to abide in person a siege of this nature and i have not observed a single instance

observes that in battle the laird could not be distinguished from the serf all wearing the same coat armour called a jack and the baron being only distinguished by his sleeves of mail and his headpiece the borderers in general acted as light cavalry riding horses of a small size but astonishingly nimble and trained to move by short bounds through the morasses with which scotland abounds their offensive weapons were a lance of uncommon length a sword either twohanded or of the modern light size sometimes a species of battleaxe called a jedburghstaff and latterly dags or pistols although so much accustomed to act on horseback that they held it even mean to appear otherwise the marchmen occasionally acted as infantry nor were they inferior to the rest of scotland in forming that impenetrable phalanx of spears whereof it is said by an english historian that sooner shall a bare finger pierce through the skin of an angry hedgehog than any one encounter the brunt of their pikes at the battle of melrose for example buccleuchs army fought upon foot but the habits of the borderers fitted them particularly to distinguish themselves as light cavalry and hence the name of prickers and hobylers so frequently applied to them at the blaze of their beacon fires they were wont to assemble ten thousand horsemen in the course of a single day thus rapid in their warlike preparations they were alike ready for attack and defence each individual carried his own provisions consisting of a small bag of oatmeal and trusted to plunder or the chace for ekeing out his precarious meal beaugé remarks that nothing surprised the scottish cavalry so much as to see their french auxiliaries encumbered with baggagewaggons and attended by commissaries before joining battle it seems to have been the scottish practice to set fire to the litter of their camp while under cover of the smoke the hobylers or border cavalry executed their manoeuvresthere is a curious account of the battle of mitton fought in the year 1319 in a valuable ms chronicle of england in the collection of the marquis of douglas from which this stratagem seems to have decided the engagement in meyn

therefore the skottes called that battell the white battell  for smaller predatory expeditions the borderers had signals and places of rendezvous peculiar to each tribe if the party set forward before all the members had joined a mark cut in the turf or on the bark of a tree pointed out to the stragglers the direction which the main body had pursued43  footnote 43 in the parish of linton in roxburghshire there is a circle of stones surrounding a smooth plot of turf called the tryst or place of appointment which tradition avers to have been the rendezvous of the neighbouring warriors the name of the leader was cut in the turf and the arrangement of the letters announced to his followers the course which he had taken see statistical account of the parish of linton  their warlike convocations were also frequently disguised under pretence of meetings for the purpose of sport the game of football in particular which was anciently and still continues to be a favourite border sport was the means of collecting together large bodies of mosstroopers previous to any military exploit when sir robert carey was warden of the east marches the knowledge that there was a great match of football at kelso to be frequented by the principal scottish riders was sufficient to excite his vigilance and his apprehension44 previous also to the murder of sir john carmichael see notes on the raid of the reidswire it appeared at the trial of the perpetrators that they had assisted at a grand football meeting where the crime was concerted  footnote 44 see appendix  upon the religion of the borderers there can very little be said we have already noticed that they remained attached to the roman catholic faith rather longer than the rest of scotland this probably arose from a total indifference upon the subject for we no where find in their character the respect for the church which is a marked feature of that religion in 1528 lord dacre complains heavily to cardinal wolsey that having taken a notorious freebooter called dyk irwen the brother and friends of the outlaw had in retaliation seized a man of some property and a relation of lord dacre called jeffrey middleton as he returned from a pilgrimage to st ninians in galloway and that notwithstanding the sanctity of his character as a true pilgrim and the scottish monarchs safe conduct they continued to detain him in their fastnesses until he should redeem the said arrant thief dyk irwen the abbeys which were planted upon the border neither seem to have been much respected by the english nor by the scottish barons they were repeatedly burned by the former in the course of the border wars and by the latter they seem to have been regarded chiefly as the means of endowing a needy relation or the subject of occasional plunder thus andrew home of fastcastle about 1488 attempted to procure a perpetual feu of certain possessions belonging to the abbey of coldinghame and being baffled by the king bestowing that opulent benefice upon the royal chapel at stirling the humes and hepburns started into rebellion asserting that the priory should be conferred upon some younger son of their families according to ancient custom after the fatal battle of flodden one of the kerrs testified his contempt for clerical immunities and privileges by expelling from his house the abbot of kelso these bickerings betwixt the clergy and the barons were usually excited by disputes about their temporal interest it was common for the churchmen to grant lands in feu to the neighbouring gentlemen who becoming their vassals were bound to assist and protect them45 but as the possessions and revenues of the benefices became thus intermixed with those of the laity any attempts rigidly to enforce the claims of the church were usually attended by the most scandalous disputes a petty warfare was carried on for years betwixt james abbot of dryburgh and the family of halliburton of mertoun or newmains who held some lands from that abbey these possessions were under various pretexts seized and laid waste by both parties and some bloodshed took place in the contest betwixt the lay vassals and their spiritual superior the matter was at length thought of sufficient importance to be terminated by a reference to his majesty whose decree arbitral dated at stirling the 8th of may 1535 proceeds thus whereas we having

with other instances of the discord which prevailed anciently upon the borders betwixt the spiritual shepherd and his untractable flock  footnote 45 these vassals resembled in some degree the vidames in france and the vogten or vizedomen of the german abbeys but the system was never carried regularly into effect in britain and this circumstance facilitated the dissolution of the religious houses  footnote 46 this decree was followed by a marriage betwixt the abbots daughter elizabeth stewart and walter halliburton one of the family of newmains but even this alliance did not secure peace between the venerable father and his vassals the offspring of the marriage was an only daughter named elizabeth halliburton as this young lady was her fathers heir the halliburtons resolved that she should marry one of her cousins to keep her property in the clan but as this did not suit the views of the abbot he carried off by force the intended bride and married her at stirling to alexander

make some diversion in this matter the influence of the reformed preachers among the borders seems also to have been but small for upon all occasions of dispute with the kirk james vi was wont to call

retained to a late period their indifference about religious matters after having been licensed at haughhead in teviotdale he was according to his biographer sent first to preach in annandale he said

doctrine of insubordination joined to their vagrant and lawless habits was calculated strongly to conciliate their border hearers  but though the church in the border counties attracted little veneration no part of scotland teemed with superstitious fears and observances more than they did the dalesmen48 says lesley never count their beads with such earnestness as when they set out upon a predatory expedition penances the composition betwixt guilt and conscience were also frequent upon the borders of this we have a record in many bequests to the church and in some more lasting monuments such as the tower of repentance in dumfriesshire and according to vulgar tradition the church of linton49 in roxburghshire in the appendix to this introduction no iv the reader will find a curious league or treaty of peace betwixt two hostile clans by which the heads of each became bound to make the four pilgrimages of scotland for the benefit of the souls of those of the opposite clan who had fallen in the feud these were superstitions flowing immediately from the nature of the catholic religion but there was upon the border no lack of others of a more general nature such was the universal belief in spells of which some traces may yet remain in the wild parts of the country these were common in the time of the learned bishop nicolson who derives them from the time of the pagan danes this conceit was the more heightened by reflecting upon the natural superstition of our borderers at this day who were much better acquainted with and do more firmly believe their old legendary stories of fairies and witches than the articles of their creed and to convince me yet farther that they are not utter strangers to the black art of their forefathers i met with a gentleman in the neighbourhood who shewed me a book of spells and magical receipts taken two or three days before in the pocket of one of our mosstroopers wherein among many other conjuring feats was prescribed a certain remedy for an ague by applying a few barbarous characters to the body of the party distempered these methought were very near akin to wormiuss ram runer which he says differed wholly in figure and shape from the common runae for though he tells us that these ram runer were so called eo quod molestias dolores morbosque hisce infligere inimicis soliti sunt magi yet his great friend arng jonas more to our purpose says thathis etiam usi sunt ad benefaciendum juvandum medicandum tam animi quam corporis morbis atque ad ipsos cacodaemones pellendos et fugandos i shall not trouble you with a draught of this spell because i have not yet had an opportunity of learning whether it may not be an ordinary one and to be met with among others of the same nature in paracelsus or cornelius agrippaletter from bishop nicolson to mr walker vide camdens britannia cumberland even in the editors younger days he can remember the currency of certain spells for curing sprains burns or dislocations to which popular credulity ascribed unfailing efficacy50 charms however against spiritual enemies were yet more common than those intended to cure corporeal complaints this is not surprising as a fantastic remedy well suited an imaginary disease  footnote 48 this small church is founded upon a little hill of sand in which no stone of the size of an egg is said to have been found although the neighbouring soil is sharp and gravelly tradition accounts for this by informing us that the foundresses were two sisters upon whose account much blood had been spilt in that spot and that the penance imposed on the fair causers of the slaughter was an order from the pope to sift the sand of the hill upon which their church was to be erected this story may perhaps have some foundation for in the churchyard was discovered a single grave containing no fewer than fifty skulls most of which bore the marks of having been cleft by violence  footnote 49 an epithet bestowed upon the borderers from the names of their various districts as tiviotdale liddesdale eskdale ewsdale annandale c hence an old ballad distinguishes the north as the country    where every river gives name to a dale  exaletation of ale  footnote 50 among these may be reckoned the supposed influence of irish earth in curing the poison of adders or other venomous reptilesthis virtue is extended by popular credulity to the natives and even to the animals of hibernia a gentleman bitten by some reptile so as to occasion a great swelling seriously assured the editor that he ascribed his cure to putting the affected finger into the mouth of an irish mare  there were upon the borders many consecrated wells for resorting to which the peoples credulity is severely censured by a worthy physician of the seventeenth century who himself believed in a shower of living herrings having fallen near dumfries many run superstitiously to other wells and there obtain as they imagine health and advantage and there they offer bread and cheese or money by throwing them into the well in another part of the ms occurs the following passage in the bounds of the lands of eccles belonging to a lyneage of the name of maitland there is a loch called the dowloch of old resorted to with much superstition as medicinal both for men and beasts and that with such ceremonies as are shrewdly suspected to have been begun with witchcraft and increased afterward by magical directions for burying of a cloth or somewhat that did relate to the bodies of men and women and a shackle or teather belonging to cow or horse and these being cast into the loch if they did float it was taken for a good omen of recovery and a part of the water carried to the patient though to remote places without saluting or speaking to any they met by the way but if they did sink the recovery of the party was hopeless this custom was of late much curbed and restrained but since the discovery of many medicinal fountains near to the place the vulgar holding that it may be as medicinal as these are at this time begin to reassume their former practiceaccount of presbytery of penpont in macfarlanes mss  the idea that the spirits of the deceased return to haunt the place where on earth they have suffered or have rejoiced is as dr johnson has observed common to the popular creed of all nations the just and noble sentiment implanted in our bosoms by the deity teaches us that we shall not slumber for ever as the beasts that perishhuman vanity or credulity chequers with its own inferior and base colours the noble prospect which is alike held out to us by philosophy and by religion we feel according to the ardent expression of the poet that we shall not wholly die but from hence we vainly and weakly argue that the same scenes the same passions shall delight and actuate the disembodied spirit which affected it while in its tenement of clay hence the popular belief that the soul haunts the spot where the murdered body is interred that its appearances are directed to bring down vengeance on its murderers or that having left its terrestrial form in a distant clime it glides before its former friends a pale spectre to warn them of its decease such tales the foundation of which is an argument from our present feelings to those of the spiritual world form the broad and universal basis of the popular superstition regarding departed spirits against which reason has striven in vain and universal experience has offered a disregarded testimony these legends are peculiarly acceptable to barbarous tribes and on the borders they were received with most unbounded faith it is true that these supernatural adversaries were no longer opposed by the sword and battleaxe as among the unconverted scandinavians prayers spells and exorcisms particularly in the greek and hebrew languages were the weapons of the borderers or rather of their priests and cunning men against their aërial enemy51 the belief in ghosts which has been well termed the last lingering phantom of superstition still maintains its ground upon the borders  footnote 51 one of the most noted apparitions is supposed to haunt spedlins castle near lochmaben the ancient baronial residence of the jardines of applegirth it is said that in exercise of his territorial jurisdiction one of the ancient lairds had imprisoned in the massy more or dungeon of the castle a person named porteous being called suddenly to edinburgh the laird discovered as he entered the west port that he had brought along with him the key of the dungeon struck with the utmost horror he sent back his servant to relieve the prisoner but it was too late the wretched being was found lying upon the steps descending from the door of the vault starved to death in the agonies of hunger he had gnawed the flesh from one of his arms that his spectre should haunt the castle was a natural consequence of such a tragedy indeed its visits became so frequent that a clergyman of eminence was employed to exorcise it after a contest of twentyfour hours the man of art prevailed so far as to confine the goblin to the massy more of the castle where its shrieks and cries are still heard a part at least of the spell depends upon the preservation of the ancient blacklettered bible employed by the exorcist it was some years ago thought necessary to have this bible rebound but as soon as it was removed from the castle the spectre commenced his nocturnal orgies with tenfold noise and it is verily believed that he would have burst from his confinement had not the sacred volume been speedily replaced  a mass john scott minister of peebles is reported to have been the last renowned exorciser and to have lost his life in a contest with an obstinate spirit this was owing to the conceited rashness of a young clergyman who commenced the ceremony of laying the ghost before the arrival of mass john it is the nature it seems of spirits disembodied as well as embodied to increase in strength and presumption in proportion to the advantages which they may gain over the opponent the young clergyman losing courage the horrors of the scene were increased to such a degree that as mass john approached the house in which it passed he beheld the slates and tiles flying from the roof as if dispersed by a whirlwind at his entry he perceived all the waxtapers the most essential instruments of conjuration extinguished except one which already burned blue in the socket the arrival of the experienced sage changed the scene he brought the spirit to reason but unfortunately while addressing a word of advice or censure to his rash brother he permitted the ghost to obtain the last word a circumstance which in all colloquies of this nature is strictly to be guarded against this fatal oversight occasioned his falling into a lingering disorder of which he never recovered  a curious poem upon the laying of a ghost forms article no v of the appendix   it is unnecessary to mention the superstitious belief in witchcraft which gave rise to so much cruelty and persecution during the seventeenth century there were several executions upon the borders for this imaginary crime which was usually tried not by the ordinary judges but by a set of country gentlemen acting under commission from the privy council52  footnote 52 i have seen penes hugh scott esq of harden the record of the trial of a witch who was burned at ducove she was tried in the manner above mentioned  besides these grand articles of superstitious belief the creed of the borderers admitted the existence of sundry classes of subordinate spirits to whom were assigned peculiar employments the chief of these were the fairies concerning whom the reader will find a long dissertation in volume second the brownie formed a class of beings distinct in habit and disposition from the freakish and mischievous elves he was meagre shaggy and wild in his appearance thus cleland in his satire against the highlanders compares them to    faunes or brownies if ye will   or satyres come from atlas hill  in the day time he lurked in remote recesses of the old houses which he delighted to haunt and in the night sedulously employed himself in discharging any laborious task which he thought might be acceptable to the family to whose service he had devoted himself his name is probably derived from the portuni whom gervase of tilbury describes thus ecce enim in anglia daemones quosdam habent daemones inquam nescio dixerim an secretae et ignotae generationis effigies quos galli neptunos angli portunos nominant istis insitum est quod simplicitatem fortunatonum colonorum amplectuntur et cum nocturnas propter domesticas operas agunt vigilias subito clausis januis ad ignem califiunt et

aut onerosi opens agendum ad operandum se jungunt citius humana facilitate expediunt id illis insitum est ut obsequi possint et obesse non possintotia imp p 980 in every respect saving only the feeding upon frogs which was probably an attribute of the gallic spirits alone the above description corresponds with that of the scottish brownie but the latter although like miltons lubbar fiend he loves to stretch himself by the fire53 does not drudge from the hope of recompence on the contrary so delicate is his attachment that the offer of reward but particularly of food infallibly occasions his disappearance for ever54 we learn from olaus magnus that spirits somewhat similar in their operations to the brownie were supposed to haunt the swedish mines the passage in the translation of 1658 runs thus this is collected in briefe that in northerne kingdomes there are great armies of devils that have their services which they perform with the inhabitants of these countries but they are most frequent in rocks and mines where they break cleave and make them hollow which also thrust in pitchers and buckets and carefully fit wheels and screws whereby they are drawn upwards and they shew themselves to the labourers when they list like phantasms and ghosts it seems no improbable conjecture that the brownie is a legitimate descendant of the lar familiaris of the ancients  footnote 53    how the drudging goblin swet   to earn the creambowl duly set   when in one night ere glimpse of morn   his shadowy flail had threshd the corn   that ten daylabrers could not end   then lies him down the lubbar fiend   and stretchd out all the chimneys length   basks at the fire his hairy strength   and cropfull out of doors he flings   eer the first cock his matin rings  lallegro  when the menials in a scottish family protracted their vigils around the kitchen fire brownie weary of being excluded from the midnight hearth sometimes appeared at the door seemed to watch their departure and thus admonished themgang a to your beds sirs and dinna put out the wee grieshoch embers  footnote 54 it is told of a brownie who haunted a border family now extinct that the lady having fallen unexpectedly in labour and the servant who was ordered to ride to jedburgh for the sage femme shewing no great alertness in setting out the familiar spirit slipt on the greatcoat of the lingering domestic rode to the town on the lairds best horse and returned with the midwife en croupe daring the short space of his absence the tweed which they must necessarily ford rose to a dangerous height brownie who transported his charge with all the rapidity of the ghostly lover of lenoré was not to be stopped by this obstacle he plunged in with the terrified old lady and landed her in safety where her services were wanted having put the horse into the stable where it was afterwards found in a woeful plight he proceeded to the room of the servant whose duty he had discharged and finding him just in the act of drawing on his boots he administered to him a most merciless drubbing with his own horsewhip such an important service excited the gratitude of the laird who understanding that brownie had been heard to express a wish to have a green coat ordered a vestment of that colour to be made and left in his haunts brownie took away the green coat but never was seen more we may suppose that tired of his domestic drudgery he went in his new livery to join the fairiessee appendix no vi  the last brownie known in ettrick forest resided in bodsbeck a wild and solitary spot where he exercised his functions undisturbed till the scrupulous devotion of an old lady induced her to hire him away as it was termed by placing in his haunt a porringer of milk and a piece of money after receiving this hint to depart he was heard the whole night to howl and cry farewell to bonny bodsbeck which he was compelled to abandon for ever  a being totally distinct from those hitherto mentioned is the bogle or goblin a freakish spirit who delights rather to perplex and frighten mankind than either to serve or seriously to hurt them this is the esprit follet of the french and puck or robin goodfellow though enlisted by shakespeare among the fairy band of oberon properly belongs to this class of phantoms shellycoat a spirit who resides in the waters and has given his name to many a rock and stone upon the scottish coast belongs also to the class of bogles55 when he appeared he seemed to be decked with marine productions and in particular with shells whose clattering announced his approach from this circumstance he derived his name he may perhaps be identified with the goblin of the northern english which in the towns and cities durham and newcastle for example had the name of barquest but in the country villages was more frequently termed brag he usually ended his mischievous frolics with a horselaugh  footnote 55 one of his pranks is thus narrated two men in a very dark night approaching the banks of the ettrick heard a doleful voice from its waves repeatedly exclaimlost lostthey followed the sound which seemed to be the voice of a drowning person and to their infinite astonishment they found that it ascended the river still they continued during a long and tempestuous night to follow the cry of the malicious sprite and arriving before mornings dawn at the very sources of the river the voice was now heard descending the opposite side of the mountain in which they arise the fatigued and deluded travellers now relinquished the pursuit and had no sooner done so than they heard shellycoat applauding in loud bursts of laughter his successful roguery the spirit was supposed particularly to haunt the old house of gorrinberry situated on the river hermitage in liddesdale  shellycoat must not be confounded with kelpy a water spirit also but of a much more powerful and malignant nature his attributes have been the subject of a poem in lowland scottish by the learned dr jamieson of edinburgh which adorns the third volume of this collection of kelpy therefore it is unnecessary to say any thing at present  of all these classes of spirits it may be in general observed that their attachment was supposed to be local and not personal they haunted the rock the stream the ruined castle without regard to the persons or families to whom the property belonged hence they differed entirely from that species of spirits to whom in the highlands is ascribed the guardianship or superintendance of a particular clan or family of distinction and who perhaps yet more than the brownie resemble the classic household gods thus in an ms history of moray we are informed that the family of gurlinbeg is haunted by a spirit called garlin bodacher that of the baron of kinchardin by lamhdearg56 or redhand a spectre one of whose hands is as red as blood that of tullochgorm by may moulach a female figure whose left hand and arm were covered with hair who is also mentioned in aubreys miscellanies pp 211 212 as a familiar attendant upon the elan grant these superstitions were so ingrafted in the popular creed that the clerical synods and presbyteries were wont to take cognizance of them57  footnote 56 the following notice of lamhdearg occurs in another account of strathspey apud macfarlanes mssthere is much talke of a spirit called lyerg who frequents the glenmore he appears with a red hand in the habit of a souldier and challenges men to fight with him as lately as 1669 he fought with three brothers one after another who immediately died thereafter  footnote 57 there is current in some parts of germany a fanciful superstition concerning the stille volke or silent people these they suppose to be attached to houses of eminence and to consist of a number corresponding to that of the mortal family each person of which has thus his representative amongst these domestic spirits when the lady of the family has a child the queen of the silent people is delivered in the same moment they endeavour to give warning when danger approaches the family assist in warding it off and are sometimes seen to weep and wring their hands before inevitable calamity  various other superstitions regarding magicians spells prophecies c will claim our attention in the progress of this work for the present therefore taking the advice of an old scottish rhymer let us    leave bogles brownies gyre carlinges and ghaists58  footnote 58 so generally were these tales of diablerie believed that one william lithgow a bon vivant who

economy of the borderers next engages our attention that the revenue of the chieftain should be expended in rude hospitality was the natural result of his situation his wealth consisted chiefly in herds of cattle which were consumed by the kinsmen vassals and followers who aided him to acquire and to protect them59 we learn from lesley that the borderers were temperate in the use of intoxicating liquors and we are therefore left to conjecture how they occupied the time when winter or when accident confined them to their habitations the little learning which existed in the middle ages glimmered a dim and a dying flame in the religious houses and even in the sixteenth century when its beams became more widely diffused they were far from penetrating the recesses of the border mountains the tales of tradition the song with the pipe or harp of the minstrel were probably the sole resources against ennui during the short intervals of repose from military adventure  footnote 59 we may form some idea of the stile of life maintained by the border warriors from the anecdotes handed down by tradition concerning walter scott of harden who flourished towards the middle of the sixteenth century this ancient laird was a renowned freebooter and used to ride with a numerous band of followers the spoil which they carried off from england or from their neighbours was concealed in a deep and impervious glen on the brink of which the old tower of harden was situated from thence the cattle were brought out one by one as they were wanted to supply the rude and plentiful table of the laird when the last bullock was killed and devoured it was the ladys custom to place on the table a dish which on being uncovered was found to contain a pair of clean spurs a hint to the riders that they must shift for their next meal upon one occasion when the village herd was driving out the cattle to pasture the old laird heard him call loudly to drive out hardens cow hardens cow echoed the affronted chiefis it come to that pass by my faith they shall sune say hardens kye cows accordingly he sounded his bugle mounted his horse set out with his followers and returned next day with a bow of kye and a bussend brindled bull on his return with this gallant prey he passed a very large haystack it occurred to the provident laird that this would be extremely convenient to fodder his new stock of cattle but as no means of transporting it occurred he was fain to take leave of it with this apostrophe now proverbial by my soul had ye but four feet ye should not stand lang there in short as froissard says of a similar class of feudal robbers nothing came amiss to them that was not too heavy or too hot the same mode of housekeeping characterized most border families on both sides an ms

the present publication  lesley who dedicates to the description of border manners a chapter which we have already often quoted notices particularly the taste of the marchmen for music and ballad poetry placent admodum sibi sua musica et rythmicis suis cantionibus quas de majorum suorum gestis aut ingeniosis predandi precandive stratagematis ipsi confingunt leslaeus in capitulo de moribus eorum qui scotiae limites angliam versus incolunt the more rude and wild the state of society the more general and violent is the impulse received from poetry and music the muse whose effusions are the amusement of a very small part of a polished nation records in the lays of inspiration the history the laws the very religion of savageswhere the pen and the press are wanting the low of numbers impresses upon the memory of posterity the deeds and sentiments of their forefathers verse is naturally connected with music and among a rude people the union is seldom broken by this natural alliance the lays steeped in the stream of harmony are more easily retained by the reciter and produce upon his audience a more impressive effect hence there has hardly been found to exist a nation so brutishly rude as not to listen with enthusiasm to the songs of their bards recounting the exploits of their forefathers recording their laws and moral precepts or hymning the praises of their deities but where the feelings are frequently stretched to the highest pitch by the vicissitudes of a life of danger and military adventure this predisposition of a savage people to admire their own rude poetry and music is heightened and its tone becomes peculiarly determined it is not the peaceful hindu at his loom it is not the timid esquimaux in his canoe whom we must expect to glow at the war song of tyrtaeus the music and the poetry of each country must keep pace with their usual tone of mind as well as with the state of society  the morality of their compositions is determined by the same circumstances those themes are necessarily chosen by the bard which regard the favourite exploits of the hearers and he celebrates only those virtues which from infancy he has been taught to admire hence as remarked by lesley the music and songs of the borders were of a military nature and celebrated the valour and success of their predatory expeditions razing like shakespeares pirate the eighth commandment from the decalogue the minstrels praised their chieftains for the very exploits against which the laws of the country denounced a capital dooman outlawed freebooter was to them a more interesting person than the king of scotland exerting his power to punish his depredations and when the characters are contrasted the latter is always represented as a ruthless and sanguinary tyrantspensers description of the bards of ireland applies in some degree to our ancient border poets there is among the irish a certain kinde of people called bardes which are to them instead of poets whose profession is to set forth the praises or dispraises of men in their poems or rhymes the which are had in such high regard or esteem amongst them that none dare displease them for fear of running into reproach through their offence and to be made infamous in the mouths of all men for their verses are taken up with a general applause and usually sung at all feasts and meetings by certain other persons whose proper function that is who also receive for the same great rewardes and reputation amongst them spenser having bestowed due praise upon the poets who sung the praises of the good and virtuous informs us that the bards on the contrary seldom use to chuse unto themselves the doings of good men for the arguments of their poems but whomsoever they finde to be most licentious of life most bold and lawless in his doings most dangerous and desperate in all parts of disobedience and rebellious disposition him they set up and glorify in their rhythmes him they praise to the people and to young men make an example to followeudoxusi marvail what kind of speeches they can find or what faces they can put on to praise such bad persons as live so lawlessly and licentiously upon stealths and spoyles as most of them do or how they can think that any good mind will applaud or approve the same in answer to this question irenaeus after remarking the giddy and restless disposition of the ill educated youth of ireland which made them prompt to receive evil counsel adds that such a person if he shall find any to praise him and to give him any encouragement as those bards and rhythmers do for little reward or a share of a stolen cow60 then waxeth he most insolent and halfmad with the love of himself and his own lewd deeds and as for words to set forth such lewdness it is not hard for them to give a goodly and painted show thereunto borrowed even from the praises which are proper to virtue itself as of a most notorious thief and wicked outlaw which had lived all his lifetime of spoils and robberies one of their bardes in his praise will say that he was none of the idle milksops that was brought up by the fireside but that most of his days he spent in arms and valiant enterprizes that he never did eat his meat before he had won it with his sword that he lay not all night slugging in his cabin under his mantle but used commonly to keep others waking to defend their lives and did light his candle at the flames of their houses to lead him in the darkness that the day was his night and the night his day that he loved not to be long wooing of wenches to yield to him but where he came he took by force the spoil of other mens love and left but lamentations to their lovers that his music was not the harp nor lays of love but the cries of people and clashing of armour and finally that he died not bewailed of many but made many wail when he died that dearly bought his death do not you think eudoxus that many of these praises might be applied to men of best deserts yet are they all yielded to a most notable traitor and amongst some of the irish not smally accounted ofstate of ireland the same concurrence of circumstances so well pointed out by spenser as dictating the topics of the irish bards tuned the border harps to the praise of an outlawed armstrong or murray  footnote 60 the reward of the welch bards and perhaps of those upon the border was very similar it was enacted by howel dha that if the kings bard played before a body of warriors upon a predatory excursion be should receive in recompence the best cow which the party carried offleges walliae i 1 cap 19  for similar reasons flowing from the state of society the reader must not expect to find in the border ballads refined sentiment and far less elegant expression although the stile of such compositions has in modern hands been found highly susceptible of both but passages might be pointed out in which the rude minstrel has melted in natural pathos or risen into rude energy even where these graces are totally wanting the interest of the stories themselves and the curious picture of manners which they frequently present authorise them to claim some respect from the public but it is not the editors present intention to enter upon a history of border poetry a subject of great difficulty and which the extent of his information does not as yet permit him to engage in he will therefore now lay before the reader the plan of the present publication pointing out the authorities from which his materials are derived and slightly noticing the nature of the different classes into which he has arranged them   the minstrelsy of the scottish border contains three classes of poems      i historical ballads ii romantic iii imitations of these     compositions by modern authors  the historical ballad relates events which we either know actually to have taken place or which at least making due allowance for the exaggerations of poetical tradition we may readily conceive to have had some foundation in history for reasons already mentioned such ballads were early current upon the border barbour informs us that he thinks it unnecessary to rehearse the account of a victory gained in eskdale over the english because    whasa liks thai may her   young women when thai will play   syng it among thaim ilk day  the bruce book xvi  godscroft also in his history of the house of douglas written in the reign of james vi alludes more than once to the ballads current upon the border in which the exploits of those heroes were celebrated such is the passage relating to the death of william douglas lord of liddesdale slain by the earl of douglas his kinsman his godson and his chief61 similar strains of lamentation were poured by the border poets over the tomb of the hero of otterbourne and over the unfortunate youths who were dragged to an ignominious death from the very table at which they partook of the hospitality of their sovereign the only stanza preserved of this last ballad is uncommonly animated    edinburgh castle towne and toure   god grant thou sink for sinne   and that even for the black dinoure   erl douglas gat therein  who will not regret with the editor that compositions of such interest and antiquity should be now irrecoverable but it is the nature of popular poetry as of popular applause perpetually to shift with the objects of the time and it is the frail chance of recovering some old manuscript which can alone gratify our curiosity regarding the earlier efforts of the border muse some of her later strains composed during the sixteenth century have survived even to the present day but the recollection of them has of late years become like that of a tale which was told in the sixteenth century these northern tales appear to have been popular even in london for the learned mr ritson has obligingly pointed out to me the following passages respecting the noted ballad of dick o the cow p 157 dick o the cow that mad demilance northern borderer who plaid his prizes with the lord jockey so bravelynashes have with you to saffrenwalden or gabriell harveys hunt is

gradually decaying whether they were originally the composition of minstrels professing the joint arts of poetry and music or whether they were the occasional effusions of some selftaught bard is a question into which i do not here mean to enquire but it is certain that till a very late period the pipers of whom there was one attached to each border town of note and whose office was often hereditary were the great depositaries of oral and particularly of poetical tradition about spring time and after harvest it was the custom of these musicians to make a progress through a particular district of the country the music and the tale repaid their lodging and they were usually gratified with a donation of seed corn63 this order of minstrels is alluded to in the comic song of maggy lauder who thus addresses a piper    live ye upo the border  by means of these men much traditional poetry was preserved which must otherwise have perished other itinerants not professed musicians found their welcome to their nights quarters readily insured by their knowledge in legendary lore john graeme of sowport in cumberland commonly called the long quaker64 a person of this latter description was very lately alive and several of the songs now published have been taken down from his recitation the shepherds also and aged persons in the recesses of the border mountains frequently remember and repeat the warlike songs of their fathers this is more especially the case in what are called the south highlands where in many instances the same families have occupied the same possessions for centuries  footnote 63 these town pipers an institution of great antiquity upon the borders were certainly the last remains of the minstrel race robin hastie townpiper of jedburgh perhaps the last of the order died nine or ten years ago his family was supposed to have held the office for about three centuries old age had rendered robin a wretched performer but he knew several old songs and tunes which have probably died along with him the townpipers received a livery and salary from the community to which they belonged and in some burghs they had a small allotment of land called the pipers croft for further particulars regarding them see introduction to complaynt of scotland edinburgh 1801 p 142  footnote 64 this person perhaps the last of our professed ballad reciters died since the publication of the first edition of this work he was by profession an itinerant cleaner of clocks and watches but a stentorian voice and tenacious memory qualified him eminently for remembering accurately and reciting with energy the border gathering songs and tales of war his memory was latterly much impaired yet the number of verses which he could pour forth and the animation of his tone and gestures formed a most extraordinary contrast to his extreme feebleness of person and dotage of mind  it is chiefly from this latter source that the editor has drawn his materials most of which were collected many years ago during his early youth but he has been enabled in many instances to supply and correct the deficiencies of his own copies from a collection of border songs frequently referred to in the work under the title of glenriddells ms this was compiled from various sources by the late mr riddell of glenriddel a sedulous border antiquary and since his death has become the property of mr jollie bookseller at carlisle to whose liberality the editor owes the use of it while preparing this work for the press no liberties have been taken either with the recited or written copies of these ballads farther than that where they disagreed which is by no means unusual the editor in justice to the author has uniformly preserved what seemed to him the best or most poetical reading of the passage such discrepancies must very frequently occur wherever poetry is preserved by oral tradition for the reciter making it a uniform principle to proceed at all hazards is very often when his memory fails him apt to substitute large portions from some other tale altogether distinct from that which he has commenced besides the prejudices of clans and of districts have occasioned variations in the mode of telling the same story some arrangement was also occasionally necessary to recover the rhyme which was often by the ignorance of the reciters transposed or thrown into the middle of the line with these freedoms which were essentially necessary to remove obvious corruptions and fit the ballads for the press the editor presents them to the public under the complete assurance that they carry with them the most indisputable marks of their authenticity  the same observations apply to the second class here termed romantic ballads intended to comprehend such legends as are current upon the border relating to fictitious and marvellous adventures such were the tales with which the friends of spenser strove to beguile his indisposition    some told of ladies and their paramours   some of brave knights and their renowned squires   some of the fairies and their strange attires   and some of giants hard to be believed  these carrying with them a general and not merely a local interest are much more extensively known among the peasantry of scotland than the borderraid ballads the fame of which is in general confined to the mountains where they were originally composed hence it has been easy to collect these tales of romance to a number much greater than the editor has chosen to insert in this publication65 with this class are now intermingled some lyric pieces and some ballads which though narrating real events have no direct reference to border history or manners to the politeness and liberality of mr herd of edinburgh the editor of the first classical collection of scottish songs and ballads edinburgh 1774 2 vols the editor is indebted for the use of his mss containing songs and ballads published and unpublished to the number of ninety and upwards to this collection frequent references are made in the course of the following pages two books of ballads in ms have also been communicated to me by my learned and respected friend alexander fraser tytler esq66 i take the liberty of transcribing mr tytlers memorandum respecting the manner in which they came into his hands my father67 got the following songs from an old friend mr thomas gordon professor of philosophy kings college aberdeen the following extract of a letter of the professor to me explains how he came by theman aunt of my children mrs farquhar now dead who was married to the proprietor of a small estate near the sources of the dee in braemar a good old woman who spent the best part of her life among flocks and herds resided in her latter days in the town of aberdeen she was possest of a most tenacious memory which retained all the songs she had heard from nurses and countrywomen in that sequestered part of the country being maternally fond of my children when young she had them much about her and delighted them with her songs and tales of chivalry my youngest daughter mrs brown at falkland is blest with a memory as good as her aunt and has almost the whole of her songs by heart in conversation i mentioned them to your father at whose request my grandson mr scott wrote down a parcel of them as his aunt sung them being then but a mere novice in music he added in the copy such musical notes as he supposed might give your father some notion of the airs or rather lilts to which they were sung  footnote 65 mr jamieson of macclesfield a gentleman of literary and poetical accomplishment has for some years been employed in a compilation of scottish ballad poetry which is now in the press and will probably be soon given to the public i have therefore as far as the nature of my work permitted sedulously avoided anticipating any of his materials as i am very certain he himself will do our common cause the most ample justice  footnote 66 now a senator of the college of justice by the title of lord woodhouselee  footnote 67 william tytler esq the ingenious defender of queen mary and author of a dissertation upon scotish music which does honour to his memory  from this curious and valuable collection the editor has procured very material assistance at the same time it contains many beautiful legendary poems of which he could not avail himself as they seemed to be the exclusive property of the bards of angus and aberdeenshire but the copies of such as were known on the borders have furnished him with various readings and with supplementary stanzas which he has frequent opportunities to acknowledge the mss are cited under the name of mrs brown of falkland the ingenious lady to whose taste and memory the world is indebted for the preservation of the tales which they contain the other authorities which occur during the work are particularly referred to much information has been communicated to the editor from various quarters since the work was first published of which he has availed himself to correct and enlarge the present edition  in publishing both classes of ancient ballads the editor has excluded those which are to be found in the common collections of this nature unless in one or two instances where he conceived it possible to give some novelty by historical or critical illustration  it would have been easy for the editor to have given these songs an appearance of more indisputable antiquity by adopting the rude orthography of the period to which he is inclined to refer them but this unless when mss of antiquity can be referred to seemed too arbitrary an exertion of the privileges of a publisher and must besides have unnecessarily increased the difficulties of many readers on the other hand the utmost care has been taken never to reject a word or phrase used by a reciter however uncouth or antiquated such barbarisms which stamp upon the tales their age and their nation should be respected by an editor as the hardy emblem of his country was venerated by the poet of scotland    the rough burthistle spreading wide   amang the bearded bear   i turnd the weederclips aside   and spared the symbol dear  burns  the meaning of such obsolete words is usually given at the bottom of the page for explanation of the more common peculiarities of the scottish dialect the english reader is referred to the excellent glossary annexed to the last edition of burns works  the third class of ballads are announced to the public as modern imitations of the ancient style of composition in that department of poetry and they are founded upon such traditions as we may suppose in the elder times would have employed the harps of the minstrels this kind of poetry has been supposed capable of uniting the vigorous numbers and wild fiction which occasionally charm us in the ancient ballad with a greater equality of versification and elegance of sentiment than we can expect to find in the works of a rude age but upon my ideas of the nature and difficulty of such imitations i ought in prudence to be silent lest i resemble the dwarf who brought with him a standard to measure his own stature i may however hint at the difference not always attended to betwixt legendary poems and real imitations of the old ballad the reader will find specimens of both in the modern part of this collection the legendary poem called glenfinlas and the ballad entituled the eve of st john were designed as examples of the difference betwixt these two kinds of composition  it would have the appearance of personal vanity were the editor to detail the assistance and encouragement which he has received during his undertaking from some of the first literary characters of our age the names of stuart mackenzie ellis currie and ritson with many others are talismans too powerful to be used for bespeaking the worlds favour to a collection of old songs even although a veteran bard has remarked that both the great poet of italian rhyme petrarch and our chaucer and other of the upper house of the muses have thought their canzons honoured in the title of a ballad to my ingenious friend dr john leyden my readers will at once perceive that i lie under extensive obligations for the poetical pieces with which he has permitted me to decorate my compilation but i am yet farther indebted to him for his uniform assistance in collecting and arranging materials for the work  in the notes and occasional dissertations it has been my object to throw together perhaps without sufficient attention to method a variety of remarks regarding popular superstitions and legendary history which if not now collected must soon have been totally forgotten by such efforts feeble as they are i may contribute

lively illustration of the sketch given of border manners in the preceding introduction  having thus ended with my brother i then beganne to thinke of the charge i had taken upon mee which was the government of the east march in my fathers absence i wrote to sir robert kerr68 who was my opposite warden a brave active young man and desired him that hee would appoint a day when hee and myselfe might privately meet in some part of the border to take some good order for the quieting the borders till my retourne from london which journey i was shortly of necessity to take hee stayed my man all night and wrote to mee back that hee was glad to have the happinesse to be acquainted with mee and did not doubt but the country would be better governed by our good agreements i wrote to him on the monday and the thursday after hee appointed the place and hour of meeting  footnote 68 sir robert kerr of cessford warden of the middle marches and ancestor of the house of roxburghe  after hee had filled my man with drinke and putt him to bed hee and some halfe a score with him gott to horse and came into england to a little village there hee broke up a house and tooke out a poore fellow who hee pretended had done him some wrong and before the doore cruelly murthered him and so came quietly home and went to bed the next morning hee delivered my man a letter in answer to mine and retourned him to mee it pleased mee well at the reading of his kinde letter but when i heard what a brave hee had put upon mee i quickly resolved what to do which was never to have to do with him till i was righted for the greate wrong hee had done mee upon this resolution the day i should have mett with him i tooke post and with all the haste i could rode to london leaving him to attend my coming to him as was appointed there hee stayed from one till five but heard no news of mee finding by this that i had neglected him hee retourned home to his house and so things rested with greate dislike the one of the other till i came back which was with all the speede i could my businesse being ended the first thing i did after my retourne was to ask justice for the wrong hee had done mee but i could gett none the borderers seeing our disagreement they thought the time wished for of them was come the winter being beganne their was roades made out of scotland into the east march and goods were taken three or foure times a weeke i had no other meanes left to quiet them but still sent out of the garrison horsemen of berwick to watch in the fittest places for them and it was their good hap many times to light upon them with the stolen goods driving before them they were no sooner brought before mee but a jury went upon them and being found guilty they were frequently hanged a course which hath been seldom used but i had no way to keep the country quiet but to do so for when the scotch theeves found what a sharp course i tooke with them that were found with the bloody hand i had in a short time the country more quiet all this while wee were but in jest as it were but now beganne the greate quarrell betweene us  there was a favorite of his a greate theife called geordie bourne this gallant with some of his associates would in a bravery come and take goods in the east march i had that night some of the garrison abroad they met with this geordie and his fellowes driving of cattle before them the garrison set upon them and with a shott killed geordie bournes unckle and hee himselfe bravely resisting till he was sore hurt in the head was taken after hee was taken his pride was such as hee asked who it was that durst avow that nightes worke but when hee heard it was the garrison he was then more quiet but so powerfull and awfull was this sir robert kerr and his favourites as there was not a gentleman in all the east march that durst offend them presently after hee was taken i had most of the gentlemen of the march come to mee and told mee that now i had the ball at my foote and might bring sir robert kerr to what conditions i pleased for that this mans life was so neere and deare unto him as i should have all that my heart could desire for the good and quiet of the country and myselfe if upon any condition i would give him his life i heard them and their reasons notwithstanding i called a jury the next morning and hee was found guilty of march treason then they feared that i would cause him to be executed that afternoone which made them come flocking to mee humbly entreating mee that i would spare his life till the next day and if sir robert kerr came not himselfe to mee and made mee not such proffers as i could not but accept that then i should do with him what i pleased and further they told mee plainly that if i should execute him before i had heard from sir robert kerr they must be forced to quitt their houses and fly the country for his fury would be such against mee and the march i commanded as hee would use all his power and strength to the utter destruction of the east march they were so earnest with mee that i gave them my word hee should not dye that day there was post upon post sent to sir robert kerr and some of them rode to him themselves to advertise him in what danger geordie bourne was how he was condemned and should have been executed that afternoone but by their humble suite i gave them my word that he should not dye that day and therefore besought him that hee would send to mee with all the speede hee could to let mee know that hee would be the next day with mee to offer mee good conditions for the safety of his life when all things were quiet and the watch set at night after supper about ten of the clock i tooke one of my mens liveryes and putt it about mee and tooke two other of my servants with mee in their liveryes and we three as the wardens men came to the provost marshalls where bourne was and were lett into his chamber wee sate down by him and told him that wee were desirous to see him because wee heard hee was stoute and valiant and true to his friend and that wee were sorry our master could not be moved to save his life he voluntarily of himselfe said that hee had lived long enough to do so many villainies as hee had done and withal told us that hee had layne with about forty mens wives what in england what in scotland and that hee had killed seven englishmen with his own hands cruelly murthering them that hee had spent his whole time in whoreing drinking stealing and taking deep revenge for slight offences hee seemed to be very penitent and much desired a minister for the comfort of his soule wee promised him to lett our master know his desire who wee knew would presently grant it wee tooke our leaves of him and presently i tooke order that mr selby a very worthy honest preacher should go to him and not stirre from him till his execution the next morning for after i had heard his own confession i was resolved no conditions should save his life and so tooke order that at the gates opening the next morning hee should be carried to execution which accordingly was performed the next morning i had one from sir robert kerr for a parley who was within two miles staying for mee i sent him word i would meet him where hee pleased but i would first know upon what termes and conditions before his man was retourned hee had heard that in the morning very early geordie bourne had been executed many vowes hee made of cruell revenge and retourned home full of griefe and disdaine and from that time forward still plotted revenge hee knew the gentlemen of the country were altogether sacklesse and to make open road upon the march would but shew his malice and lay him open to the punishment due to such offences but his practice was how to be revenged on mee or some of mine  it was not long after that my brother and i had intelligence that there was a great match made at footeball and the chiefe ryders were to be there the place they were to meet at was kelsy and that day wee heard it was the day for the meeting wee presently called a counsaile and after much dispute it was concluded that the likeliest place hee was to come to was to kill the scoutes and it was the more suspected for that my brother before my coming to the office for the cattaile stolne out of the bounds and as it were from under the walles of barwicke being refused justice upon his complaint or at least delaid sent off the garrison into liddisdale and killed there the chiefe offender which had done the wrong  upon this conclusion there was order taken that both horse and foote should lye in ambush in diverse parts of the boundes to defend the scoutes and to give a sound blow to sir robert and his company before the horse and foote were sett out with directions what to do it was almost darke night and the gates ready to be lockt wee parted and as i was by myselfe comeing to my house god put it into my mind that it might well be hee meant destruction to my men that i had sent out to gather tithes for mee at norham and their rendezvous was every night to lye and sup at an alehouse in norham i presently caused my page to take horse and to ride as fast as his horse could carry him and to command my servants which were in all eight that presently upon his coming to them they should all change their lodging and go streight to the castle there to lye that night in strawe and hay some of them were unwilling thereto but durst not disobey so altogether left their alehouse and retired to the castle they had not well settled themeselves to sleep but they heard in the town a great alarm for sir robert and his company came streight to the alehouse broke open the doors and made enquiry for my servants they were answered that by my command they were all in the castle after they had searched all the house and found none they feared they were betrayed and with all the speede they could made haste homewards again thus god blessed me from this bloody tragedy  all the whole march expected nightly some hurt to be done but god so blessed mee and the government i held as for all his fury hee never drew drop of blood in all my march neither durst his theeves trouble it much with stealing for fear of hanging if they were taken thus wee continued a yeare and then god sent a meanes to bring thinges to better quiet by this occasion  there had been commissioners in barwicke chosen by the queene and king of scottes for the better quieting of our borders by their industry they found a great number of malefactors guilty both in england and scotland and they tooke order that the officers of scotland should deliver such offenders as were found guilty in their jurisdictions to the opposite officers in england to be detained prisoners till they had made satisfaction for the goods they had taken out of england the like order was taken with the wardens of england and days prefixed for the delivery of them all and in case any of the officers on either side should omit their duties in not delivering the prisoners at the dayes and places appointed that then there should a course be taken by the soveraignes that what chiefe officer soever should offend herein he himself should be delivered and detained till he had made good what the commissioners had agreed upon  the english officers did punctually at the day and place deliver their prisoners and so did most of the officers of scotland only the lord of bocleuch and sir robert kerr were faultie they were complained of and new dayes appointed for the delivery of their prisoners bocleuch was the first that should deliver and hee failing entered himselfe prisoner into barwicke there to remaine till those officers under his charge were delivered to free him he chose for his guardian sir william selby master of the ordinance at barwicke when sir robert kerrs day of delivery came he failed too and my lord hume by the kings command was to deliver him prisoner into barwicke upon the like termes which was performed sir robert kerr contrary to all mens expectation chose mee for his guardian and home i brought him to my own house after hee was delivered to mee i lodged him as well as i could and tooke order for his diet and men to attend on him and sent him word that although by his harsh carriage towards mee ever since i had that charge he could not expect any favour yet hearing so much goodness of him that hee never broke his word if hee should give mee his hand and credit to be a true prisoner hee would have no guard sett upon him but have free liberty for his friends in scotland to have ingresse and regresse to him as oft as hee pleased he tooke this very kindly at my handes accepted of my offer and sent me thankes  some four dayes passed all which time his friends came into him and hee kept his chamber then hee sent to mee and desired mee i would come and speake with him which i did and after long discourse charging and recharging one another with wrong and injuries at last before our parting wee became good friends with greate protestations on his side never to give mee occasion of unkindnesse again after our reconciliation hee kept his chamber no longer but dined and supt with mee i tooke him abroad with mee at the least thrice a weeke a hunting and every day wee grew better friends bocleuch in a few

scottish superstitions omitted by collins in his ode upon that subject and which if the editor can judge with impartiality of the production of a valued friend will be found worthy of the sublime

                           one edition of the present ballad is well known having appeared in the reliques of ancient poetry and having been inserted in almost every subsequent collection of scottish songs but it seems to have occurred to no editor that a more complete copy of the song might be procured that with which the public is now presented is taken from two ms copies76 collated with several verses recited by the editors friend robert hamilton esq advocate being the 16th and the four which follow but even with the assistance of the common copy the ballad seems still to be a fragment the cause of sir patrick spens voyage is however pointed out distinctly and it shews that the song has claim to high antiquity as referring to a very remote period in scottish history  footnote 76 that the public might possess this carious fragment as entire as possible the editor gave one of these copies which seems the most perfect to mr robert jamieson to be inserted in his collection  alexander iii of scotland died in 1285 and for the misfortune of his country as well as his own he had been bereaved of all his children before his decease the crown of scotland descended upon his granddaughter margaret termed by our historians the maid of norway she was the only offspring of a marriage betwixt eric king of norway and margaret daughter of alexander iii the kingdom had been secured to her by the parliament of scotland held at scone the year preceding her grandfathers death the regency of scotland entered into a congress with the ministers of the king of norway and with those of england for the establishment of good order in the kingdom of the infant princess shortly afterwards edward i conceived the idea of matching his eldest son edward prince of wales with the young queen of scotland the plan was eagerly embraced by the scottish nobles for at that time there was little of the national animosity which afterwards blazed betwixt the countries and they patriotically looked forward to the important advantage of uniting the island of britain into one kingdom but eric of norway seems to have been unwilling to deliver up his daughter and while the negociations were thus protracted the death of the maid of norway effectually crushed a scheme the consequences of which might have been that the distinction betwixt england and scotland would in our day have been as obscure and uninteresting as that of the realms of the heptarchyhailes annals fordun c  the unfortunate voyage of sir patrick spens may really have taken place for the purpose of bringing back the maid of norway to her own kingdom a purpose which was probably defeated by the jealousy of the norwegians and the reluctance of king eric i find no traces of the disaster in scottish history but when we consider the meagre materials whence scottish history is drawn this is no conclusive argument against the truth of the tradition that a scottish vessel sent upon such an embassy must as represented in the ballad have been freighted with the noblest youth in the kingdom is sufficiently probable and having been delayed in norway till the tempestuous season was come on its fate can be no matter of surprise the ambassadors finally sent by the scottish nation to receive their queen were sir david wemyss of wemyss and sir michael scot of balwearie the same whose knowledge surpassing that of his age procured him the reputation of a wizard but perhaps the expedition of sir patrick spens was previous to their embassy the introduction of the king into the ballad seems a deviation from history unless we suppose that alexander was before his death desirous to see his grandchild and heir  the scottish monarchs were much addicted to sit in dumfermline town previous to the accession of the bruce dynasty it was a favourite abode of alexander himself who was killed by a fall from his horse in the vicinity and was buried in the abbey of dumfermline  there is a beautiful german translation of this ballad as it appeared in the reliques in the volklieder of professor herder an elegant work in which it is only to be regretted that the actual popular songs of the germans form so trifling a proportion  the tune of mr hamiltons copy of sir patrick spens is different from that to which the words are commonly sung being less plaintive and having a bold nautical turn in the close     sir

ballad notwithstanding its present appearance has a claim to very high antiquity it has been preserved by tradition and is perhaps the most authentic instance of a long and very old poem exclusively thus preserved it is only known to a few old people upon the sequestered banks of the ettrick and is published as written down from the recitation of the mother of mr james hogg83 who sings or rather chaunts it with great animation she learned the ballad from a blind man who died at the advanced age of ninety and is said to have been possessed of much traditionary knowledge although the language of this poem is much modernised yet many words which the reciters have retained without understanding them still preserve traces of its antiquity such are the words springals corruptly pronounced springwalls sowies portcullize and many other appropriate terms of war and chivalry which could never have been introduced by a modern balladmaker the incidents are striking and wellmanaged and they are in strict conformity with the manners of the age in which they are placed the editor has therefore been induced to illustrate them at considerable length by parallel passages from froissard and other historians of the period to which the events refer  footnote 83 this old woman is still alive and at present resides at craig of douglas in selkirkshire  the date of the ballad cannot be ascertained with any degree of accuracy sir richard maitland the hero of the poem seems to have been in possession of his estate about 1250 so that as he survived the commencement of the wars betwixt england and scotland in 1296 his prowess against the english in defence of his castle of lauder or thirlestane must have been exerted during his extreme old age he seems to have been distinguished for devotion as well as valour for ad 1249 dominus ricardus de mautlant gave to the abbey of dryburgh terras suas de haubentside in territorio suo de thirlestane pro salute animae suae et sponsae suae

patrick was abbot of kelso betwixt 1258 and 1260  from the following ballad and from the family traditions referred to in the maitland mss auld maitland appears to have had three sons but we learn

such were the heroes of the ballad the castle of thirlestane is situated upon the leader near the town of lauder whether the present building which was erected by chancellor maitland and improved by the duke of lauderdale occupies the site of the ancient castle i do not know but it still merits the epithet of a darksome house i find no notice of the siege in history but there is nothing improbable in supposing that the castle during the stormy period of the baliol wars may have held out against the english the creation of a nephew of edward i for the pleasure of slaying him by the hand of young maitland is a poetical licence88 and may induce us to place the date of the composition about the reign of david ii or of his successor when the real exploits of maitland and his sons were in some degree obscured as well as magnified by the lapse of time the inveterate hatred against the english founded upon the usurpation of edward i glows in every line of the ballad  footnote 88

histories of the poets day seem to be noticed the preceding stanza describes the sports of the field and that which follows refers to the tricks of jugailrie so that the three verses comprehend the whole pastimes of the middle ages which are aptly represented as the furniture of dame venuss chamber the verse referring to maitland is obviously corrupted the true reading was probably with his auld beird gray indeed the whole verse is full of errors and corruptions which is the greater pity as it conveys information to be found no where else  footnote 90 peirs plowman is well known under the uncouth names of gow mac morn and of fyn maccowl the admirers of ossian are to recognise gaul the son of morni and fingal himself heu quantum mutatus ab illo  to illustrate the familiar character of

lethington seems to have been frequently complimented on the popular renown of his great ancestor we have already seen one instance and in an elegant copy of verses in the maitland mss in praise of sir richards seat of lethingtoun which he had built or greatly improved this obvious topic of flattery does not escape the poet from the terms of his panegyric we learn that the exploits of auld sir richard with the gray beard and of his three sons were sung in many far countrie albeit in rural rhyme from which we may infer that they were narrated rather in the shape of a popular ballad than in a romance of price if this be the case the song now published may have undergone little variation since the date of the maitland mss for divesting the poem in praise of lethington of its antique spelling it would run as smoothly and appear as modern as any verse in the following ballad the lines alluded to are addressed to the castle of lethington    and happie art thou sic a place   that few

authors should be now recovered in so perfect a state and many readers may be pleased to see the following sensible observations made by a person born in ettrick forest in the humble situation of a shepherd i am surprised to hear that this song is suspected by some to be a modern forgery the contrary will be best proved by most of the old people hereabouts having a great part of it by heart many indeed are not aware of the manners of this country till this present age the poor illiterate people in these glens knew of no other entertainment in the long winter nights than repeating and listening to the feats of their ancestors recorded in songs which i believe to be handed down from father to son for many generations although no doubt had a copy been taken at the end of every fifty years there must have been some difference occasioned by the gradual change of language i believe it is thus that many very ancient songs have been gradually modernised to the common ear while to the connoisseur they present marks of their genuine antiquityletter to the editor from mr james hogg to the observations of my ingenious correspondent i have nothing to add but that in this and a thousand other instances they accurately coincide with my personal knowledge     auld maitland                                          there lived a king in southern land   king edward hight his name

accurately and concisely the sow was a military engine resembling the roman testudo it was framed of wood covered with hides and mounted on wheels so that being rolled forwards to the foot of the besieged wall it served as a shed or cover to defend the miners or those who wrought the battering ram from the stones and arrows of the garrison in the course of the famous defence made by black agnes countess of march of her husbands castle of dunbar montague earl of salisbury who commanded the besiegers caused one of these engines to be wheeled up to the wall the countess who with her damsels kept her station on the battlements and affected to wipe off with her handkerchief the dust raised by the stones hurled from the english machines awaited the approach of this new engine of

either necessity or cause was a peculiar and perhaps the most prominent feature of chivalry it was not merely the duty but the pride and delight of a true knight to perform such exploits as no one but a madman would have undertaken i think it is in the old french romance of erec and eneide that an adventure the access to which lay through an avenue of stakes garnished with the bloody heads of the knights who had attempted and failed to atchieve it is called by the inviting title of la joie de la cour to be first in advancing or last in retreating to strike upon the gate of a certain fortress of the enemy to fight blindfold or with one arm tied up to carry off a banner or to defend one were often the subjects of a particular vow among the sons of chivalry until some distinguishing exploit of this nature a young knight was not said to have won his spurs and upon some occasions he was obliged to bear as a mark of thraldom a chain upon his arm which was removed with great ceremony when his merit became conspicuous these chains are noticed in the romance of jehan de saintré in the language of german chivalry they were called ketten des gelubdes fetters of duty lord herbert of cherbury informs us that the knights of the bath were obliged to wear certain strings of silk and gold upon their left arm until they had atchieved some noble deed of arms when edward iii commenced his french wars many of the young bachelors of england bound up one of their eyes with a silk ribband and swore before the peacock and the ladies that they would not see with both eyes until they had accomplished certain deeds of arms in francefroissart cap 28  a remarkable instance of this chivalrous frenzy occurred during the expedition of sir robert knowles who in 1370 marched through france and laid waste the country up to the very gates of paris there was a knighte in their companye had made a vowe the day before that he wolde ryde to the walles or gates of parys and stryke at the barryers with his speare and for the fournyshing of his vowe he departed fro his companye his spear in his fyst his shelde about his neck armed at all pecesse on a good horsse his squyer on another behinde him with his bassenet and whan he approached neare to parys he toke and dyde on his helme and left his squyer behind hym and dashed his spurres to his horsse and came gallopynge to the barryers the whiche as then were opyn and the lordes that were there had wened he wolde have entred into the towne but that was not his mynde for when he hadde stryken at the barryers as he had before avowed he towrned his reyne and drue back agayne and departed than the knightes of france that sawe hym depart sayd to hym go your waye you have ryghte well acquitted yourself i can nat tell you what

founde before hym a bocher a bigge man who had well sene this knighte pass by and he helde in his handes a sharpe hevy axe with a longe poynt and as the knyght returned agayne and toke no hede this bocher came on his side and gave the knyghte suche a stroke betwene the neck and the shulders that he reversed forwarde heedlynge to the neck of his horsse and yet he recovered agayne and than the bocher strake hym agayne so that the axe entered into his body so that for payne the knyghte fell to the erthe and his horsse ran away and came to the squyer who abode for his mayster at the stretes

bush of thorns and guarded by sixty men at arms who defended it gallantly there were many rescues and many a one hurt and cast to the earth and many feats of armes done and many gret strokes given with good axes of steel that it was wonder to behold the battle did not cease until the captalls standard was taken and torn to pieces  we learn from the following passage in stowes chronicle that the standard of edward i was a golden dragon the king entred wales with an army appointing the footmen to occupie the enemies in fight whiles his horsemen in a wing set on the rere battell himselfe with a

ages in 1359 edward iii entered france to improve the success of the battle of poictiers two french knights sir galahaut of rybamont and sir roger of cologne rode forth with their followers to survey the english host and in short to seek adventures it chanced that they met a foraging party of germans retained in king edwards service under the command of reynold of boulant a knight of that nation

frequently afforded opportunity for single combat of which the scene was usually the drawbridge or barriers of the town the former as the more desperate place of battle was frequently chosen by knights who chose to break a lance for honour and their ladies love in 1387 sir william douglas lord of nithisdale upon the drawbridge of the town of carlisle consisting of two beams hardly two feet

mode of attack and defence was early taught to the future knight and continued long to be practised in the games of chivalry the custom therefore of defying the inhabitants of a besieged town to this sort of contest was highly fashionable in the middle ages and an army could hardly appear before a place without giving rise to a variety of combats at the barriers which were in general conducted without any unfair advantage being taken on either part  the following striking example of this romantic custom occurs in froissart during the french wars of edward the black prince and in the year 1370 a body of english and of adventurers retained in his service approached the city of noyon then occupied by a french garrison and arrayed themselves with displayed banners before the town defying the defenders to battle there was a scottysh knyghte96 dyde there a goodly feate of armes for he departed fro his companye hys speare in hys hand and mounted on a good horse hys page behynde hyme and

stones at hym and also the french knyghtes charged them to let hym and them alone togyder so long they foughte that at last his page came near to the barryers and spake in his langage and sayd sir come awaye it is time for you to departe for your cumpanye is departyng hens the knyghte harde hym well and than gave a two or three strokes about him and so armed as he was he lepte out of the

a scottish champion noted for his courage and gigantic stature  the barriers so often alluded to are described by the same admirable historian to be grated pallisades the grates being about half a foot wide in a skirmish before honycourt sir henry of flanders ventured to thrust his sword so far through one of those spaces that a sturdy abbot who was within seized his swordarm and drew it through the harriers up to the shoulder in this aukward situation he remained for some time being unwilling to dishonour himself by quitting his weapon he was at length rescued but lost his sword

conquered his immediate antagonist was at liberty if he pleased to come to the assistance of his companions the play of the little french lawyer turns entirely upon this circumstance and it may be remarked throughout the poems of boiardo and ariosto particularly in the combat of three christian and three pagan champions in the 42d canto of orlando furioso but doubtless a gallant knight was often unwilling like young maitland to avail himself of this advantage something of this kind seems to have happened in the celebrated combat fought in the presence of james ii at stirling in 1449

land that they can gie to me  in slaying edward maitland acts pitilessly but not contrary to the laws of arms which did not enjoin a knight to shew mercy to his antagonist until he yielded him rescue or no rescue thus the seigneur de languerant came before the walls of an english garrison in gascony and defied any of the defenders to run a course with a spear his challenge being accepted by bertrand courant the governor of the place they couched their spears like good knights and dashed on their horses their spears were broke to pieces and languerant was overthrown and lost his helmet among the horses feet his attendants were coming up but bernard drew his dagger and said sir yield ye my prisoner rescue or no rescue else ye are but dead the dismounted champion spoke not a word on which bertrand entering into fervent ire dashed his dagger into his skull besides the battle was not always finished by one warrior obtaining this advantage over the other in the battle of nejara the famous sir john chandos was overthrown and held down by a gigantic spanish cavalier named martino fernandez then sir johan chandos remembred of a knyfe that he had in his bosome and drew it out and

is published in the reliques of ancient poetry vol i and being obviously of scottish composition claims a place in the present collection the particulars of that noted action are related by froissard with the highest encomium upon the valour of the combatants on each side james earl of douglas with his brother the earl of murray in 1387 invaded northumberland at the head of 3000 men while the earls of fife and strathern sons to the king of scotland ravaged the western borders of england with a still more numerous army douglas penetrated as far as newcastle where the renowned hotspur lay in garrison in a skirmish before the walls percys lance with the pennon or guidon attached to it was taken by douglas as most authors affirm in a personal encounter betwixt the two heroes the earl shook the pennon aloft and swore he would carry it as his spoil into scotland and plant it upon his castle of dalkeith that answered percy shalt thou neveraccordingly having collected the forces of the marches to a number equal or according to the scottish historians much superior to the army of douglas hotspur made a night attack upon the scottish camp at otterbourne about thirtytwo miles from newcastle an action took place fought by moonlight with uncommon gallantry and desperation at length douglas armed with an iron mace which few but he could wield rushed into the thickest of the english battalions followed only by his chaplain and two squires of his body98 before his followers could come up their brave leader was stretched on the ground with three mortal wounds his squires lay dead by his side the priest alone armed with a lance was protecting his master from farther injury i die like my forefathers said the expiring hero in a field of battle and not on a bed of sickness conceal my death defend my standard99 and avenge my fall it is an old prophecy that a dead man shall gain a field100 and i hope it will be accomplished this nightgodscroftwith these words he expired and the fight was renewed with double obstinacy around his body when morning appeared however victory began to incline to the scottish side ralph percy brother to hotspur was made prisoner by the earl marischal and shortly after harry percy101 himself was taken by lord montgomery the number of captives according to wyntoun nearly equalled that of the victors upon this the english retired and left the scots masters of the dearbought honours of the field but the bishop of durham approaching at the head of a body of fresh forces not only checked the pursuit of the victors but made prisoners some of the stragglers who had urged the chase too far the battle was not however renewed as the bishop of durham did not venture to attempt the rescue of percy the field was fought 15th

to wintown was a knight that historian says no one knew how douglas fell  footnote 99 the banner of douglas upon this memorable occasion was borne by his natural son archibald douglas ancestor of the family of cavers hereditary sheriffs of teviotdale amongst whose archives this glorious relique is still preserved the earl at his onset is said to have charged his son to defend it to the last drop

percys cross has been erected upon the spot where the gallant earl of douglas is supposed to have fallen these particulars were communicated to the editor in the most obliging manner by the present proprietor of otterbourne  the ballad published in the reliques is avowedly an english production and the author with a natural partiality leans to the side of his countrymen yet that ballad or some one similar modified probably by national prejudice must have been current in scotland during the reign of james vi for godscroft in treating of this battle mentions its having been the subject of popular song and proceeds thus but that which is commonly sung of the hunting of chiviot seemeth indeed poetical and a mere fiction perhaps to stir up virtue yet a fiction whereof there is no mention either in the scottish or english chronicle neither are the songs that are made of them both one for the scots song made of otterbourne telleth the time about lammas and also the occasion to take preys out of england also the dividing the armies betwixt the earls of fife and douglas and their several journeys almost as in the authentic history it beginneth thus    it fell about the lammas tide

ballad alluded to by godscroft but they come much nearer to his description than the copy published in the first edition which represented douglas as falling by the poignard of a faithless page yet we learn from the same author that the story of the assassination was not without foundation in traditionthere are that say that he douglas was not slain by the enemy but by one of his own men a groom of his chamber whom he had struck the day before with a truncheon in ordering of the battle because he saw him make somewhat slowly to and they name this man john bickerton of luffness who left a part of his armour behind unfastened and when he was in the greatest conflict this servant of his came behind his back and slew him thereatgodscroft ut suprabut this narration adds the historian is not so probable102 indeed it seems to have no foundation but the common desire of assigning some remote and extraordinary cause for the death of a great man the following ballad is also inaccurate in many other particulars and is much shorter and more indistinct than that printed in the reliques although many verses are almost the same hotspur for instance is called earl percy a title he never enjoyed neither was douglas buried on the field of battle but in melrose abbey where his tomb is still shown  footnote 102 wintown assigns another cause for douglas being carelessly armed    the erle jamys

circumstance of douglas omitting to put on his helmet occurs in the ballad  this song was first published from mr herds collection of scottish songs and ballads edin 1774 2 vols octavo but two recited copies have fortunately been obtained from the recitation of old persons residing at the head of ettrick forest by which the story is brought out and completed in a manner much more correspondent to the true history  i cannot dismiss the subject of the battle of otterbourne without stating with all the deference due to the father of this species of literature a doubt which occurs to me as to the account given of sir john of agurstone one of the scottish warriors in the learned and excellent notes subjoined to the ballad in the reliques of ancient poetry this personage is there supposed to have been one of the haggerstons of haggerston a northumbrian family who according to the fate of war were sometimes subjects of scotland i cannot however think that at this period while the english were in possession both of berwick and roxburgh with the intermediate fortresses of wark cornwall and norham the scots possessed any part of northumberland much less a manor which lay within that strong chain of castles i should presume the person alluded to rather to have been one of the rutherfords barons of edgerstane or adgerston a warlike family which has long flourished on the scottish borders and who were at this very period retainers of the house of douglas the same notes contain an account of the other scottish warriors of distinction who were present at the battle these were the earls of monteith buchan and huntley the barons of maxwell and johnston swinton of that ilk an ancient family which about that period produced several distinguished warriors sir david or rather as the learned editor well remarks sir walter scott of buccleuch stewart of garlies and murray of cockpool    regibus et legibus scotici constantes   vos clypeis et gladiis pro patria pugnantes   vestra est

gordons and the graemesp 64 v 2  the illustrious family of gordon was originally settled upon the lands of gordon and huntly in the shire of berwick and are therefore of border extraction the steps by which they removed from thence to the shires of aberdeen and inverness are worthy notice in 1300 adam de gordon was warden of the marchesrymer vol ii p 870 he obtained from robert the bruce a grant of the forfeited estate of david de strathbolgie earl of athol but no possession followed the earl having returned to his allegiancejohn de gordon his greatgrandson obtained from robert ii a new charter of the lands of strathbolgie which had been once more and finally forfeited by david earl of athol slaine in the battle of kilblene this grant is dated 13th july 1376 john de gordon who was destined to transfer from the borders of england to those of the highlands a powerful and martial race was himself a redoubted warrior and many of his exploits occur in the annals of that turbulent period in 13712 the english borderers invaded and plundered the lands of gordon on the scottish east march sir john of gordon retaliated by an incursion on northumberland where he collected much spoil but as he returned with his booty he was attacked at unawares by sir john lillburne a northumbrian who with a superior force lay near carham in ambush to intercept him gordon harangued and cheered his followers charged the english gallantly and after having himself been five times in great peril gained a complete victory slaying many southerns and taking their leader and his brother captive according to the prior of lochlevin he was desperately wounded but    thare rays a welle gret renowne   and gretly prysyd wes gud gordown  shortly after this exploit sir john of gordon encountered and routed sir thomas musgrave a renowned english marchman whom he made prisoner the lord of johnstone had about the same time gained a great advantage on the west border and hence says wynton    he and the lord of gordowne   had a soverane gud renown   of ony that war of thare degré   for full thai war of gret bounté  upon another occasion john of gordon is said to have partially succeeded in the surprisal of the town of berwick although the superiority of the garrison obliged him to relinquish his enterprise  the ballad is accurate in introducing this warrior with his clan into the host of douglas at otterbourne perhaps as he was in possession of his extensive northern domains he brought to the field the northern broadswords as well as the lances of his eastern borderers with his gallant leader he lost his life in the deadly conflict the english ballad commemorates his valour and prudence    the erle of huntley cawte and kene  but the title is a premature designation the earldom of huntly was first conferred on alexander seaton who married the granddaughter of the hero of otterbourne and assumed his title from huntly in the north besides his eldest son adam who carried on the line of the family sir john de gordon left two sons known in tradition by the familiar names of jock and tam the former was the ancestor of the gordons of pitlurg the latter of those of lesmoir and of craiggordon this last family is now represented by james gordon esq of craig being the eleventh in direct descent from sir john de gordon   the graemes  the clan of graeme always numerous and powerful upon the border were of scottish origin and deduce the descent of their chieftain graeme of netherby from john with the bright sword a son of malice graeme earl of menteith who flourished in the fourteenth century latterly they became englishmen as the phrase went and settled upon the debateable land whence they were transported to ireland by james vi with the exception of a very few respectable families because said his majesty in a proclamation they do all but especially the graemes confess themselves to be no meet persons to live in these countries and also to the intent their lands may be inhabited by others of good and honest conversation but in the reign of henry iv the graemes of the border still adhered to the scottish allegiance as appears from the tower of graeme in annandale graemes walls in tweeddale and other castles within scotland to which they have given their name the reader is however at liberty to suppose that the graemes of the lennox and menteith always ready to shed their blood in the cause of their country on this occasion joined douglas    with them the lindsays light and gayp 64 v 2  the chief of this ancient family at the date of the battle of otterbourne was david liudissay lord of glenesk afterwards created earl of crawford he was after the manner of the times a most accomplished knight he survived the battle of otterbourne and the succeeding carnage of homildon in may 1390 he went to england to seek adventures of chivalry and justed upon london bridge against the lord of wells an english knight with so much skill and success as to excite among the spectators a suspicion that he was tied to his saddle which he removed by riding up to the royal chair vaulting out of his saddle and resuming his seat without assistance although loaded with complete armour in 1392 lindsay was nearly slain in a strange manner a band of catterans or wild highlanders had broken down from the grampian hills and were engaged in plundering the county of angus walter ogilvy the sheriff with sir patrick gray marched against them and were joined by sir david lindsay their whole retinue did not exceed sixty men and the highlanders were above three hundred nevertheless trusting to the superiority of arms and discipline the knights rushed on the invaders at gasclune in the stormont the issue was unfortunate ogilvy his brother and many of his kindred were overpowered and slain lindsay armed at all points made great slaughter among the naked catterans but as he pinned one of them to the earth with his lance the dying mountaineer writhed upwards and collecting his force fetched a blow with his broadsword which cut through the knights stirrupleather and steelboot and nearly severed his leg the highlander expired and lindsay was with difficulty borne out of the field by his followerswyntown lindsay is also noted for a retort made to the famous hotspur at a marchmeeting at haldanestank he happened to observe that percy was sheathed in complete armour it is for fear of the english horsemen said percy in explanation for he was already meditating the insurrection immortalised by shakespeare ah sir harry answered lindsay i have seen you more sorely bestad by scottish footmen than by english horsewyntown such was the leader of the lindsays light and guy  according to froissard there were three lindsays in the battle of otterbourne whom he calls sir william sir james and sir alexander to sir james lindsay there fell a strange chance of war which i give in the words of the old historian i shall shewe you of sir mathewe reedman an

with a swerde a longe season and no man to lette them fynally sir james limsay gave the knyght such strokes and helde him so shorte that he was putte out of brethe in such wyse that he yelded himselfe

of durham with 500 horse whom he rode towards believing them to be scottish until he was too near them to escape the bysshoppe stepte to him and sayde limsay ye are taken yelde ye to mewho be you quod

james v it commemorates a transaction supposed to have taken place betwixt a scottish monarch and an ancestor of the ancient family of murray of philiphaugh in selkirkshire the editor is unable to ascertain the historical foundation of the tale nor is it probable that any light can be thrown upon the subject without an accurate examination of the family charter chest it is certain that during the civil wars betwixt bruce and baliol the family of philiphaugh existed and was powerful for their ancestor archibald de moravia subscribes the oath of fealty to edward iad 1296 it is therefore not unlikely that residing in a wild and frontier country they may have at one period or other during these commotions refused allegiance to the feeble monarch of the day and thus extorted from him some grant of territory or jurisdiction it is also certain that by a charter from james iv dated november 30 1509 john murray of philiphaugh is vested with the dignity of heritable sheriff of ettrick forest an office held by his descendants till the final abolition of such jurisdictions by 28th george ii cap 23 but it seems difficult to believe that the circumstances mentioned in the ballad could occur under the reign of so vigorous a monarch as james iv it is true that the dramatis personae introduced seem to refer to the end of the fifteenth or beginning of the sixteenth century but from this it can only be argued that the author himself lived soon after that period it may therefore be supposed unless farther evidence can be produced tending to invalidate the conclusion that the bard willing to pay his court to the family has connected the grant of the sheriffship by james iv with some further dispute betwixt the murrays of philiphaugh and their sovereign occurring either while they were engaged upon the side of baliol or in the subsequent reigns of david ii and robert ii and iii when the english possessed great part of the scottish frontier and the rest was in so lawless a state as hardly to acknowledge any superior at the same time this reasoning is not absolutely conclusive james iv had particular reasons for desiring that ettrick forest which actually formed part of the jointure lands of margaret his queen should be kept in a state of tranquillityrymer vol xiii p 66 in order to accomplish this object it was natural for him according to the policy of his predecessors to invest one great family with the power of keeping order among the rest it is even probable that the philiphaugh family may have had claims upon part of the lordship of ettrick forest which lay intermingled with their own extensive possessions and in the course of arranging not indeed the feudal superiority but the property of these lands a dispute may have arisen of sufficient importance to be the groundwork of a balladit is farther probable that the murrays like other border clans were in a very lawless state and held their lands merely by occupancy without any feudal right indeed the lands of the various proprietors in ettrick forest being a royal demesne were held by the possessors not in property but as the kindly tenants or rentallers of the crown and it is only about 150 years since they obtained charters striking the feuduty of each proprietor at the rate of the quitrent which he formerly paid this state of possession naturally led to a confusion of rights and claims the kings of scotland were often reduced to the humiliating necessity of compromising such matters with their rebellious subjects and james himself even entered into a sort of league with johnie faa the king of the gypsiesperhaps therefore the tradition handed down in this song may have had more foundation than it would at present be proper positively to assert  the merit of this beautiful old tale it is thought will be fully acknowledged it has been for ages a popular song in selkirkshire the scene is by the common people supposed to have been the castle of newark upon yarrow this is highly improbable because newark was always a royal fortress indeed the late excellent antiquarian mr plummer sheriffdepute of selkirkshire has assured the editor that he remembered the insignia of the unicorns c so often mentioned in the ballad in existence upon the old tower at hangingshaw the seat of the philiphaugh family although upon first perusing a copy of the ballad he was inclined to subscribe to the popular opinion the tower of hangingshaw has been demolished for many years it stood in a romantic and solitary situation on the classical banks of the yarrow when the mountains around hangingshaw were covered with the wild copse which constituted a scottish forest a more secure stronghold for an outlawed baron can hardly be imagined  the tradition of ettrick forest bears that the outlaw was a man of prodigious strength possessing a batton or club with which he laid lee ie waste the country for many miles round and that he was at length slain by buccleuch or some of his clan at a little mount covered with firtrees adjoining to newark castle and said to have been a part of the garden a varying tradition bears the place of his death to have been near to the house of the duke of buccleuchs gamekeeper beneath the castle and that the fatal arrow was shot by scot of haining from the ruins of a cottage on the opposite side of the yarrow there was extant within these twenty years some verses of a song on his death the feud betwixt the outlaw and the scotts may serve to explain the asperity with which the chieftain of that clan is handled in the ballad  in publishing the following ballad the copy principally resorted to is one apparently of considerable antiquity which was found among the papers of the late mrs cockburn of edinburgh a lady whose memory will be long honoured by all who knew her another copy much more imperfect is to be found in glenriddels mss the names are in this last miserably mangled as is always the case when ballads are taken down from the recitation of persons living at a distance from the scenes in which they are laid mr plummer also gave the editor a few additional verses not contained in either copy which are thrown into what seemed their proper place there is yet another copy in mr herds mss which has been occasionally made use of two verses are restored in the present edition from the recitation of mr mungo park whose toils during his patient and intrepid travels in africa have not eradicated from his recollection the legendary lore of his native country  the arms of the philiphaugh family are said by tradition to allude to their outlawed state they are indeed those of a huntsman and are blazoned thus argent a hunting horn sable stringed and garnished gules on a chief azure three stars of the

the family did not enjoy that title till 1503   james boyd the earl of arran his brother cp 87 v 2  thomas boyd earl of arran was forfeited with his father and uncle in 1469 for an attempt on the person of james iii he had a son james who was restored and in favour with james iv about 1482 if this be the person here meant we should read the earl of arran his son was he glenriddels copy reads a

ancestors of the murrays earls of annandale but the name of the representative in the time of james iv was william not andrew glenriddels ms reads the countrykeeper    to sir james murray of traquairp 94 v 3  before the barony of traquair became the property of the stewarts it belonged to a family of murrays afterwards murrays of blackbarony and ancestors of lord elibank the old castle was situated on the tweed the lands of traquair were forfeited by willielmus de moravia previous to 1464 for in that year a charter proceeding upon his forfeiture was granted by the crown willielmo douglas de cluny sir james was perhaps the heir of william murray it would farther seem that the grant in 1464 was not made effectual by douglas for another charter from the crown dated the 3d february 1478 conveys the estate of traquair to james stewart earl of buchan son to the black knight of lorne and maternal uncle to james iii from whom is descended the present earl of traquair the first royal grant not being followed by possession it is very possible that the murrays may have continued to occupy traquair long after the date of that charter hence sir james might have reason to say as in the ballad the king has gifted my lands lang syne    james hop pringle of torsonsep 97 v 1  the honourable name of pringle or hoppringle is of great antiquity in roxburghshire and selkirkshire the old

    he learned kings to lie   for to fetch me here frae amang my men   here like a dog for to die  i believe the reader will think with me that the catastrophe is better as now printed from mrs

or sept of the armstrongs that the editor finds it necessary to prefix to this ballad some general account of that tribe  the armstrongs appear to have been at an early period in possession of great part of liddesdale and of the debateable land their immediate neighbourhood to england rendered them the most lawless of the border depredators and as much of the country possessed by them was claimed by both kingdoms the inhabitants protected from justice by the one nation in opposition to the other securely preyed upon both110 the chief was armstrong of mangertoun but at a later period they are declared a broken clan ie one which had no lawful head to become surety for their good behaviour the rapacity of this clan and of their allies the elliots occasioned the popular saying elliots and armstrongs ride thieves allbut to what borderfamily of note in former days would not such an adage have been equally applicable all along the river liddel may still be discovered the ruins of towers possessed by this numerous clan they did not however entirely trust to these fastnesses but when attacked by a superior force abandoned entirely their dwellings and retired into morasses accessible by paths known to themselves alone one of their most noted places of refuge was the tarras moss a desolate and horrible marsh through which a small river takes its course upon its banks are found some dry spots which were occupied by these outlaws and their families in cases of emergency the stream runs furiously among huge rocks which has occasioned a popular saying    was neer are drownd in tarras nor yet in doubt   for eer the head can win down the harns brains are out  the morass itself is so deep that according to an old historian two spears tied together would not reach the bottom in this retreat the armstrongs anno 1588 baffled the earl of angus when lieutenant on the border although he reckoned himself so skilful in winding a thief that he declared he had the same pleasure in it as others in a hunting a hare on this occasion he was totally unsuccessful and nearly lost his relation douglas of ively whom the freebooters made prisonergodscroft vol ii p 411  footnote 110 in illustration of this position the reader is referred to a long correspondence betwixt lord dacre and the privy council of england in 1550 concerning one sandye armstrang a partizan of england and an inhabitant of the debateable land who had threatened to become a scottishman if he was not protected by the english warden against the lord maxwellsee introduction to nicholson and burns history of cumberland and westmoreland  upon another occasion the armstrongs were less fortunate they had in one of their incursions plundered the town of haltwhistle on the borders of cumberland sir robert carey warden of the west marches demanded satisfaction from the king of scotland and received for answer that the offenders were no subjects of his and that he might take his own revenge the english warden accordingly entered llddesdale and ravaged the lands of the outlaws on which occasion sim of the cathill an armstrong was killed by one of the ridleys of haltwhistle this incident procured haltwhistle another visit from the armstrongs in which they burnt great part of the town but not without losing one of their leaders by a shot from a window  the death of this young man says sir robert carey wrote wrought so deep an impression upon them the outlaws as many vowes were made that before the end of next winter they would lay the whole border waste this the murder was done about the end of may 1598 the chiefe of all these outlaws was old sim of whittram111 he had five or six sonnes as able men as the borders had this old man and his sonnes had not so few as two hundred at their commands that were ever ready to ride with them to all actions at their beck  footnote 111 whittram is a place in liddesdale it is mistaken by the noble editor for whithern in galloway as is hartwesel haltwhistle on the borders of cumberland for twisel a village on the english side of the tweed near wark  the high parts of the marsh march towards scotland were put in a mighty fear and the chiefe of them for themselves and the rest petitioned to mee and did assure mee that unless i did take some course with them by the end of that summer there was none of the inhabitants durst or would stay in their dwellings the next winter but they would fley the countrey and leave their houses and lands to the fury of the outlawes upon this complaint i called the gentlemen of the countrey together and acquainted them with the misery that the highest parts of the marsh towards scotland were likely to endure if there were not timely prevention to avoid it and desired them to give mee their best advice what course were fitt to be taken they all showed themselves willing to give mee their best counsailles and most of them were of opinion that i was not well advised to refuse the hundred horse that my lord euers had and that now my best way was speedily to acquaint the quene and counsaile with the necessity of having more soldiers and that there could not be less than a hundred horse sent downe for the defence of the countrey besides the forty i had already in pay and that there was nothing but force of soldiers could keep them in awe and to let the counsaile plainly understand that the marsh of themselves were not able to subsist whenever the winter and long nights came in unlesse present cure and remedy were provided for them i desired them to advise better of it and to see if they could find out any other meanes to prevent their mischievous intentions without putting the quene and countrey to any further charge they all resolved that there was no second meanes then i told them my intention what i meant to do which was that myselfe with my two deputies and the forty horse that i was allowed would with what speede wee could make ourselves ready to go up to the wastes and there wee would entrench ourselves and lye as near as wee could to the outlawes and if there were any brave spirits among them that would go with us they should be very wellcome and fare and lye as well as myselfe and i did not doubte before the summer ended to do something that should abate the pride of these outlawes those that were unwilling to hazard themselves liked not this motion they said that in so doing i might keep the countrey quiet the time i lay there but when the winter approached i could stay there no longer and that was the theeves time to do all their mischiefe but there were divers young gentlemen that offered to go with mee some with three some with four horses and to stay with mee as long as i would there continue i took a list of those that offered to go with mee and found that with myself my officers the gentlemen and our servants wee should be about two hundred good men and horse a competent number as i thought for such a service  the day and place was appointed for our meeting in the wastes and by the help of the foot of liddisdale112 and risdale wee had soone built a pretty fort and within it wee had all cabines made to lye in and every one brought beds or matresses to lye on there wee stayed from the middest of june till almost the end of august we were betweene fifty and sixty gentlemen besides their servants and my horsemen so that wee were not so few as two hundred horse wee wanted no provisions for ourselves nor our horses for the countrey people were well payed for any thing they brought us so that wee had a good market every day before our fort to buy what we lacked the chiefe outlawes at our coming fled their houses where they dwelt and betooke themselves to a large and great forest with all their goodes which was called the tarras it was of that strength and so surrounded with bogges and marish grounds and thicke bushes and shrubbes as they feared not the force nor power of england nor scotland so long as they were there they sent me word that i was like the first puffe of a haggasse113 hottest at the first and bade me stay there as long as the weather would give me leave they would stay in the tarras wood till i was weary of lying in the waste and when i had had my time and they no whit the worse they would play their parts which should keep mee waking the next winter those gentlemen of the countrey that came not with mee were of the same minde for they knew or thought at least that my force was not sufficient to withstand the furey of the outlawes the time i stayed at the fort i was not idle but cast by all meanes i could how to take them in the great strength they were in i found a meanes to send a hundred and fifty horsemen into scotland conveighed by a muffled man114 not known to any of the company thirty miles within scotland and the businesse was carried so that none in the countrey tooke any alarm at this passage they were quietly brought to the backside of the tarras to scotlandward there they divided themselves into three parts and tooke up three passages which the outlawes made themselves secure of if from england side they should at any time be put at  footnote 112 the foot of liddisdale were the garrison of king james in the castle of hermitage who assisted carey on this occasion as the armstrongs were outlaws to both nations  footnote 113 a haggis according to burns the chieftain of the puddingrace is an olio composed of the liver heart c of a sheep minced down with oatmeal onions and spices and boiled in the stomach of the animal by way of bag when the bag is cut the contents if this savoury dish be well made should spout out with the heated air this will explain the allusion  footnote 114 a muffled man means a person in disguise a very necessary precaution for the guides safety for could the outlaws have learned who played them this trick beyond all doubt it must have cost him dear  they had their scoutes on the tops of hills on the english side to give them warning if at any time any power of men should come to surprise them the three ambushes were safely laid without being discovered and about four oclock in the morning there were three hundred horse and a thousand foote115 that came directly to the place where the scoutes lay they gave the alarm our men brake down as fast as they could into the wood the outlawes thought themselves safe assuring themselves at any time to escape but they were so strongly set upon on the english side as they were forced to leave their goodes and betake themselves to their passages towards scotland there was presently five taken of the principall of them the rest seeing themselves as they thought betrayed retired into the thicke woodes and bogges116 that our men durst not follow them for fear of loosing themselves the principall of the five that were taken were two of the eldest sonnes of sim of whitram these five they brought to mee to the fort and a number of goodes both of sheep and kine which satisfied most part of the countrey that they had stolen them from  footnote 115 from this it would appear that carey although his constant attendants in his fort consisted only of 200 horse had upon this occasion by the assistance probably of the english and scottish royal garrisons collected a much greater force  footnote 116 there are now no trees in liddesdale except on the banks of the rivers where they are protected from the sheep but the stumps and fallen timber which are every where found in the morasses attest how well the country must have been wooded in former days  the five that were taken were of great worth and value amongst them insomuch that for their liberty i should have what conditions i should demand or desire first all english prisoners were set at liberty then had i themselves and most part of the gentlemen of the scottish side so strictly bound in bondes to enter to mee in fifteen dayes warning any offendour that they durst not for their lives break any covenant that i made with them and so upon these conditions i set them at liberty and was never after troubled with these kind of people thus god blessed me in bringing this great trouble to so quiet an end wee brake up our fort and every man retired to his owne housecareys memoirs p 151  the people of liddesdale have retained by tradition the remembrance of careys raid as they call it they tell that while he was besieging the outlaws in the tarras they contrived by ways known only to themselves to send a party into england who plundered the wardens lands on their return they sent carey one of his own cows telling him that fearing he might fall short of provision during his visit to scotland they had taken the precaution of sending him some english beef the anecdote is too characteristic to be suppressed  from this narrative the power and strength of the armstrongs at this late period appear to have been very considerable even upon the death of queen elizabeth this clan associated with other banditti of the west marches to the number of two or three hundred horse entered england in a hostile manner and extended their ravages as far as penrith james vi then at berwick upon his journey to his new capital detached a large force under sir william selby captain of berwick to bring these depredators to order their raid remarkable for being the last of any note occurring in history was avenged in an exemplary manner most of the strongholds upon the liddel were razed to the foundation and several of the principal leaders executed at carlisle after which we find little mention of the armstrongs in history the precautions adopted by the earl of dunbar to preserve peace on the borders bore peculiarly hard upon a body of men long accustomed to the most ungoverned licence they appear in a great measure to have fallen victims to the strictness of the new enactmentsridpath p 703stow 819laing vol i the lands possessed by them in former days have chiefly come into the hands of the buccleuch family and of the elliots so that with one or two exceptions we may say that in the country which this warlike clan once occupied there is hardly left a landholder of the name one of the last border reivers was however of this family and lived within the beginning of the last century after having made himself dreaded over the whole country he at last came to the following end one a man of large property having lost twelve cows in one night raised the country of tiviotdale and traced the robbers into liddesdale as far as the house of this armstrong commonly called willie of westburnflat from the place of his residence on the banks of the hermitage water fortunately for the pursuers he was then asleep so that he was secured along with nine of his friends without much resistance he was brought to trial at selkirk and although no precise evidence was adduced to convict him of the special fact the cattle never having been recovered yet the jury brought him in guilty on his general character or as it is called in our law on habite and repute when sentence was pronounced willie arose and seizing the oaken chair in which he was placed broke it into pieces by main strength and offered to his companions who were involved in the same doom that if they would stand behind him he would fight his way out of selkirk with these weapons but they held his hands and besought him to let them die like christians they were accordingly executed in form of law this was the last trial at selkirk the people of liddesdale who perhaps not erroneously still consider the sentence as iniquitous remarked that the prosecutor never throve afterwards but came to beggary and ruin with his whole family  johnie armstrong of gilnockie the hero of the following ballad is a noted personage both in history and tradition he was it would seem from the ballad a brother of the laird of mangertoun chief of the name his place of residence now a roofless tower was at the hollows a few miles from langholm where its ruins still serve to adorn a scene which in natural beauty has few equals in scotland at the head of a desperate band of freebooters this armstrong is said to have spread the terror of his name almost as far as newcastle and to have levied black mail or protection and forbearance money for many miles around james v of whom it was long remembered by his grateful people that he made the rushbush keep the cow about 1529 undertook an expedition through the border counties to suppress the turbulent spirit of the marchmen but before setting out upon his journey he took the precaution of imprisoning the different border chieftains who were the chief protectors of the marauders the earl of bothwell was forfeited and confined in edinburgh castle the lords of home and maxwell the lairds of buccleuch fairniherst and johnston with many others were also committed to ward cockburn of henderland and adam scott of tushielaw called the king of the border were publicly executedlesley p 430 the king then marched rapidly forward at the head of a flying army of ten thousand men through ettrick forest and ewsdale the evil genius of our johnie armstrong or as others say the private advice of some courtiers prompted him to present himself before james at the head of thirtysix horse arrayed in all the pomp of border chivalry pitscottie uses nearly the words of the ballad in describing the splendour of his equipment and his high expectations of favour from the king but james looking upon him sternly said to his attendants what wants that knave that a king should have and ordered him and his followers to instant executionbut john armstrong continues this minute historian made great offers to the king that he should sustain himself with forty gentlemen ever ready at his service on their own cost without wronging any scottishman secondly that there was not a subject in england duke earl or baron but within a certain day he should bring him to his majesty either quick or dead117 at length he seeing no hope of favour said very proudly it is folly to seek grace at a graceless face but said he had i known this i should have lived upon the borders in despite of king harry and you both for i know king harry would downweigh my best horse with gold to know that i were condemned to die this daypitscotties history p 145 johnie with all his retinue was accordingly hanged upon growing trees at a place called carlenrig chapel about ten miles above hawick on the high road to langholm the country people believe that to manifest the injustice of the execution the trees withered away armstrong and his followers were buried in a deserted churchyard where their graves are still shewn  footnote 117 the borderers from their habits of life were capable of most extraordinary exploits of this nature in the year 1511 sir robert ker of cessford warden of the middle marches of scotland was murdered at a bordermeeting by the bastard heron starhead and lilburn the english monarch delivered up lilburn to justice in scotland but heron and starhead escaped the latter chose his residence in the very centre of england to baffle the vengeance of kers clan and followers two dependants of the deceased called tait were deputed by andrew ker of cessford to revenge his fathers murder they travelled through england in various disguises till they discovered the place of starheads retreat murdered him in his bed and brought his head in triumph to edinburgh where ker caused it to be exposed at the cross the bastard heron would have shared the same fate had he not spread abroad a report of his having died of the plague and caused his funeral obsequies to be performedridpaths

gilnockie tower the news of the bloody catastrophe  this song was first published by allan ramsay in his evergreen who says he copied it from the mouth of a gentleman called armstrong who was in the sixth generation from this john the reciter assured him that this was the genuine old ballad the common one false by the common one ramsay means an english ballad upon the same subject but differing

by john armstrong had been the price of his release from the feudal penalty arising from his having neglected to procure a regular investiture from his superior as johnie only touched the pen it appears that he could not write  christopher armstrong abovementioned is the person alluded to in the conclusion of the balladgod be with thee kirsty my son he was the father or grandfather of william armstrong called christies will a renowned freebooter some of whose exploits the reader will find recorded in the third volume of this work     the lochmaben harper  now first published                                        the castle of lochmaben was formerly a noble building situated upon a peninsula projecting into one of the four lakes which are in the neighbourhood of the royal burgh and is said to have been the residence of robert bruce while lord of annandale accordingly it was always held to be a royal fortress the keeping of which according to the custom of the times was granted to some powerful lord with an allotment of lands and fishings for the defence and maintenance of the place there is extant a grant dated 16th march 1511 to robert lauder of the bass of the office of captain and keeper of lochmaben castle for seven years with many perquisites among others the land stolen frae the king is bestowed upon the captain as his proper landswhat shall we say of a country where the very ground was the subject of theft                                         o heard ye na o the silly blind harper   how lang he lived in lochmaben town   and how he wad gang to fair england   to steal the lord wardens wanton brown    but first he gaed to his gude wyfe   wi a the haste that he could thole   this wark quo he will neer gae weel   without a mare that has a foal    quo shethou hast a gude gray mare   that can baith lance oer laigh and hie   sae set thee on the gray mares back   and leave the foal at hame wi me    so he is up to england gane   and even as fast as he may drie   and when he cam to carlisle gate   o whae was there but the warden he    come into my hall thou silly blind harper   and of thy harping let me hear   o by my sooth quo the silly blind harper   i wad rather hae stabling for my mare    the warden lookd ower his left shoulder   and said unto his stable groom   gae take the silly blind harpers mare   and tie her beside my wanton brown    then aye he harped and aye he carped127   till a the lordlings footed the floor   but an the music was sae sweet   the groom had nae mind of the stable door    and aye he harped and aye he carped   till a the nobles were fast asleep   then quickly he took aff his shoon   and saftly down the stair did creep    syne to the stable door he hied   wi tread as light as light could be   and when he opened and gaed in   there he fand thirty steeds and three    he took a cowt halter128 frae his hose   and o his purpose he did na fail   he slipt it ower the wantons nose   and tied it to his gray mares tail    he turned them loose at the castle gate   ower muir and moss and ilka dale   and she neer let the wanton bait   but kept him agalloping hame to her foal    the mare she was right swift o

could they do     notes on the lochmaben harper                                        the only remark which offers itself on the foregoing ballad seems to be that it is the most modern in which the harp as a border instrument of music is found to occur  i cannot dismiss the subject of lochmaben without noticing an extraordinary and anomalous class of landed proprietors who dwell in the neighbourhood of that burgh these are the inhabitants of four small villages near the ancient castle called the four towns of lochmaben they themselves are termed the kings rentallers or kindly tenants under which denomination each of them has a right of an allodial nature to a small piece of ground it is said that these people are the descendants of robert bruces menials to whom he assigned in reward of their faithful service these portions of land burdened only with the payment of certain quitrents and grassums or fines upon the entry of a new tenant the right of the rentallers is in essence a right of property but in form only a right of lease of which they appeal for the foundation on the rentrolls of the lord of the castle and manor this possession by rental or by simple entry upon the rentroll was anciently a common and peculiarly sacred species of property granted by a chief to his faithful followers the connection of landlord and tenant being esteemed of a nature too formal to be necessary where there was honour upon one side and gratitude upon the other but in the case of subjects granting a right of this kind it was held to expire with the life of the granter unless his heir chose to renew it and also upon the death of the rentaller himself unless especially granted to his heirs by which term only his first heir was understood hence in modern days the kindly tenants have entirely disappeared from the land fortunately for the inhabitants of the four towns of lochmaben the maxim that the king can never die prevents their right of property from reverting to the crown the viscount of stormonth as royal keeper of the castle did indeed about the beginning of last century make an attempt to remove the rentallers from their possessions or at least to procure judgment finding them obliged to take out feudal investitures and subject themselves to the casualties thereto annexed but the rentallers united in their common defence and having stated their immemorial possession together with some favourable clauses in certain old acts of parliament enacting that the kings poor kindly tenants of lochmaben should not be hurt they finally prevailed in an action before the court of session from the peculiar state of their right of property it follows that there is no occasion for feudal investitures or the formal entry of an heir and of course when they chuse to convey their lands it is done by a simple deed of conveyance without charter or sasine  the kindly tenants of lochmaben live or at least lived till lately much sequestered from their neighbours marry among themselves and are distinguished from each other by soubriquets according to the ancient border custom repeatedly noticed you meet among their writings with such names as john outbye will inbye whitefish redfish c they are tenaciously obstinate in defence of their privileges of commonty c which are numerous their lands are in general neatly inclosed and well cultivated and they form a contented and industrious little community  many of these particulars are extracted from the mss of mr syme writer to the signet those who are desirous of more information may consult craig de feudis lib ii dig 9 sec 24 it is hoped the reader will excuse this digression though somewhat professional especially as there can be little doubt that this diminutive republic must soon share the fate of mightier states for in consequence of the increase of commerce lands possessed under this singular tenure being now often brought to sale and purchased by the neighbouring proprietors will in process of time be included in their investitures and the right of rentallage be entirely forgotten     jamie telfer of the fair dodhead                                        there is another ballad under the same title as the following in which nearly the same incidents are narrated with little difference except that the honour of rescuing the cattle is attributed to the liddesdale elliots headed by a chief there called martin elliot of the preakin tower whose son simon is said to have fallen in the action it is very possible that both the tiviotdale scotts and the elliots were engaged in the affair and that each claimed the honour of the victory  the editor presumes that the willie scott here mentioned must have been a natural son of the laird of buccleuch

have been taken by him in transcribing it and what is altogether unpardonable the ms which is itself rather inaccurate has been interpolated to favour his readings of which there remain obvious marks  the skirmish of the reidswire happened upon the 7th of june 1575 at one of the meetings held by the wardens of the marches for arrangements necessary upon the border sir john carmichael ancestor of the present earl of hyndford was the scottish warden and sir john forster held that office on the english middle marchin the course of the day which was employed as usual in redressing wrongs a bill or indictment at the instance of a scottish complainer was fouled ie found a true bill against one farnstein a notorious english freebooter forster alleged that he had fled from justice carmichael considering this as a pretext to avoid making compensation for the felony bade him play fair to which the haughty english warden retorted by some injurious expressions respecting carmichaels family and gave other open signs of resentment his retinue chiefly men of reesdale and tynedale the most ferocious of the english borderers glad of any pretext for a quarrel discharged a flight of arrows among the scots a warm conflict ensued in which carmichael being beat down and made prisoner success seemed at first to incline to the english side till the tynedale men throwing themselves too greedily upon the plunder fell into disorder and a body of jedburgh citizens arriving at that instant the skirmish terminated in a complete victory on the part of the scots who took prisoners the english warden james ogle cuthbert collingwood francis russel son to the earl of bedford and soninlaw to forster some of the fenwicks and several other border chiefs they were sent to the earl of morton then regent who detained them at dalkeith for some days till the heat of their resentment was abated which prudent precaution prevented a war betwixt the two kingdoms he then dismissed them with great expressions of regard and to satisfy queen elizabeth142 sent up carmichael to york whence he was soon after honourably dismissed the field of battle called the reidswire is a part of the

brother to auchinleck of auchiuleck one of his dependants by such arbitrary practices morton meant to strengthen his authority on the borders instead of which he hastened his fall by giving disgust to his kinsman the earl of angus and his other friends who had been established in the country for agesgodscroft vol ii pages 238 246 sir john carmichael the warden was murdered 16th june 1600 by a party

all our books of genealogy deduce their descent from the scotts of balwearie in fife whom they represent the first of this family settled in roxburghshire is stated in douglas baronage to have been

be accurate in his genealogy the person meant must be the young laird of buccleuch afterwards distinguished for his surprise of carlisle castlesee kinmont willie i am the more confirmed in this opinion because kerr of ancrum was at this time a fugitive for slaying one of the rutherfords and the tower of ancrum given in keeping to the turnbulls his hereditary enemies his mother however a

atchievements performed upon the border the reader will find in the subjoined extract from spottiswoode a minute historical account of the exploit which is less different from that contained in the ballad than might perhaps have been expected  anno 1596the next year began with a trouble in the borders which was like to have destroyed the peace betwixt the two realms and arose upon this occasion the lord scroop being the warden of the west marches of england and the laird of bacleuch having the charge of liddesdale they sent their deputies to keep a day of truce for redress of some ordinary mattersthe place of meeting was at the dayholme of kershop where a small brook divideth england from scotland and liddesdale from bawcastle there met as deputy for the laird of bacleuch robert scott of hayninge and for the lord scroop a gentleman within the west wardenry called mr salkeld these two after truce taken and proclaimed as the custom was by sound of trumpet met friendly and upon mutual redress of such wrongs as were then complained of parted in good terms each of them taking his way homewards meanwhile it happened one william armstrong commonly called will of kinmonth to be in company with the scottish deputy against whom the english had a quarrel for many wrongs he had committed as he was indeed a notorious thief this man having taken his leave of the scots deputy and riding down the river of liddel on the scottish side towards his own house was pursued by the english who espied him from the other side of the river and after a chase of three or four miles taken prisoner and brought back to the english deputy who carried him away to the castle of carlisle  the laird of bacleuch complaining of the breach of truce which was always taken from the time of meeting unto the next day at sunrising wrote to mr salkeld and craved redress he excused himself by the absence of the lord scroop whereupon bacleuch sent to the lord scroop and desired the prisoner might be set at liberty without any bond or condition seeing he was unlawfully taken scroop answered that he could do nothing in the matter it having so happened without a direction from the queen and council of england considering the man was such a malefactorbacleuch loth to inform the king of what was done lest it might have bred some misliking betwixt the princes dealt with mr bowes the resident ambassador of england for the prisoners liberty who wrote very seriously to the lord scroop in that business advising him to set the man free and not to bring the matter to a farther hearing but no answer was returned the matter thereupon was imparted to the king and the queen of england solicited by letters to give direction for his liberty yet nothing was obtained which bacleuch perceiving and apprehending both the king and himself as the kings officer to be touched in honour he resolved to work the prisoners relief by the best means he could  and upon intelligence that the castle of carlisle wherein the prisoner was kept was surprisable he employed some trusty persons to take a view of the postern gate and measure the height of the wall which he meant to scale by ladders and if those failed to break through the wall with some iron instruments and force the gates this done so closely as he could he drew together some two hundred horse assigning the place of meeting at the tower of morton some ten miles from carlisle an hour before sunset with this company passing the water of esk about the falling two hours before day he crossed eden beneath carlisle bridge the water through the rain that had fallen being thick and came to the sacery a plain under the castle there making a little halt at the side of a small bourn which they call cadage he caused eighty of the company to light from their horses and take the ladders and other instruments which he had prepared with them he himself accompanying them to the foot of the wall caused the ladders to be set to it which proving too short he gave order to use the other instruments for opening the wall nigh the postern and finding the business likely to succeed retired to the rest whom he had left on horseback for assuring those that entered upon the castle against any eruption from the town with some little labor a breach was made for single men to enter and they who first went in broke open the postern for the rest the watchmen and some few the noise awaked made a little restraint but they were quickly repressed and taken captive after which they passed to the chamber wherein the prisoner was kept and having brought him forth sounded a trumpet which was a signal to them without that the enterprize was performed my lord scroope and mr salkeld were both within the house and to them the prisoner cried a good night the captives taken in the first encounter were brought to bacleuch who presently returned them to their master and would not suffer any spoil or booty as they term it to be carried away he had straitly forbidden to break open any door but that where the prisoner was kept though he might have made prey of all the goods within the castle and taken the warden himself captive for he would have it seen that he did intend nothing but the reparation of his majestys honor by this time the prisoner was brought forth the town had taken the alarm the drums were beating the bells ringing and a beacon put on the top of the castle to give warning to the country whereupon bacleuch commanded those that entered the castle and the prisoner to horse and marching again by the sacery made to the river at the stonybank on the other side whereof certain were assembled to stop his passage but he causing to sound the trumpet took the river day being then broken and they choosing to give him way he retired in order through the grahams of esk men at that time of great power and his unfriends and came back into scottish ground two hours after sunrising and so homewards  this fell out the 13th of april 1596 the queen of england having notice sent her of what was done stormed not a little one of her chief castles surprised a prisoner taken forth of the hands of the warden and carried away so far within england she esteemed a great affront the lieger mr bowes in a frequent convention kept at edinburgh the 22d of may did as he was charged in a long oration aggravate the heinousness of the fact concluding that peace could not longer continue betwixt the two realms unless bacleuch were delivered in england to be punished at the queens pleasure bacleuch compearing and charged with the fact made answerthat he went not into england with intention to assault any of the queens houses or to do wrong to any of her subjects but only to relieve a subject of scotland unlawfully taken and more unlawfully detained that in the time of a general assurance in a day of truce he was taken prisoner against all order neither did he attempt his relief till redress was refused and that he had carried the business in such a moderate manner as no hostility was committed nor the least wrong offered to any within the castle yet was he content according to the ancient treaties observed betwixt the two realms when as mutual injuries were alleged to be tried by the commissioners that it should please their majesties to appoint and submit himself to that which they should decernthe convention esteeming the answer reasonable did acquaint the ambassador therewith and offered to send commissioners to the borders with all diligence to treat with such as the queen should be pleased to appoint for her part  but she not satisfied with the answer refused to appoint any commissioners whereupon the council of england did renew the complaint in july thereafter and the business being of new agitated it was resolved of as before and that the same should be remitted to the trial of commissioners the king protesting that he might with great reason crave the delivery of lord scroope for the injury committed by his deputy it being less favourable to take a prisoner than relieve him that is unlawfully taken yet for the continuing of peace he would forbear to do it and omit nothing on his part that could be desired either in equity or by the laws of friendshipthe borders in the mean time making daily incursions one upon another filled all their parts with trouble the english being continually put to the worse neither were they made quiet till for satisfying the queen the laird of bacleuch was first committed in st andrews and afterwards entered in england where he remained not long158spottiswoods history of the church of scotland p 414 416 ed 1677  scott of satchells in the extraordinary poetical performance which he has been pleased to entitle a history of the name of scott published 1688 dwells with great pleasure upon this gallant achievement at which it would seem his father had been present he also mentions that the laird of buccleuch employed the services of the younger sons and brothers only of his clan lest the name should have been weakened by the landed men incurring forfeiture but he adds that three gentlemen of estate insisted upon attending their chief notwithstanding this prohibition these were the lairds of harden and commonside and sir gilbert elliot of the stobbs a relation of the laird of buccleuch and ancestor to the present sir william elliot bart in many things satchells agrees with the ballads current in his time from which in all probability he derived most of his information as to past events and from which he sometimes pirates whole verses as noticed in the annotations upon the raid of the reidswire in the present instance he mentions the prisoners large spurs alluding to the fetters and some other little incidents noticed in the ballad which was therefore probably well known in his days  footnote 158 the bishop is in this last particular rather inaccurate buccleuch was indeed delivered into england but this was done in consequence of the judgment of commissioners of both nations who met at berwick this same year and his delivery took place less on account of the raid of carlisle than of a second exploit of the same nature to be noticed hereafter  all contemporary historians unite in extolling the deed itself as the most daring and wellconducted atchievement of that age audax facinus

following ballad and as tending to shew the light in which the men of the border were regarded even at this late period by their fellow subjects the author is talking of the kings return to edinburgh

james obtained a quiet hearing for one of his favourite orisones or harangues and was finally enabled to prescribe terms to his fanatic metropolis good discipline was however maintained by the chiefs upon this occasion although the fears of the inhabitants were but too well grounded considering what had happened in stirling ten years before when the earl of angus attended by home buccleuch and other border chieftains marched thither to remove the earl of arran from the kings councils the town was miserably pillaged by the borderers particularly by a party of armstrongs under this very kinmont willie who not only made prey of horses and cattle but even of the very iron grating of the windowsjohnstoni historia p 102 ed amstaelmoyses memoirs p 100  the renown of kinmont willie is not surprising since in 1588 the apprehending that freebooter and robert maxwell naturalbrother to the lord maxwell was the main but unaccomplished object of a royal expedition to dumfries rex  robertum

retainer to buccleuch the enemy of that tribe at least the editor finds that in a bond of manrent granted by simon elliot of whytheuch in liddesdale to lord maxwell styled therein earl of morton dated

willie was not the only occasion upon which the undaunted keeper of liddesdale gave offence to the haughty elizabeth for even before this business was settled certain of the english borderers having invaded liddesdale and wasted the country the laird of buccleuch retaliated the injury by a raid into england in which he not only brought off much spoil but apprehended thirtysix of the tynedale

inserted betwixt the subscription and the address of the letterrymer vol xvi p 318 indeed so deadly was the resentment of the english on account of the affronts put upon them by this formidable chieftain that there seems at one time to have been a plan formed not as was alleged without elizabeths privity to assassinate buccleuchrymer vol xvi p 107 the matter was at length arranged by the commissioners of both nations in berwick by whom it was agreed that delinquents should be delivered up on both sides and that the chiefs themselves should enter into ward in the opposite countries

sequenwhen at length they appeared for the purpose of delivering themselves up to be warded at berwick an incident took place which nearly occasioned a revival of the deadly feud which formerly subsisted between the scots and the kers buccleuch had chosen for his guardian during his residence in england sir william selby master of the ordnance at berwick and accordingly gave himself into his hands sir robert ker was about to do the same when a pistol was discharged by one of his retinue and the cry of treason was raised had not the earl of home been present with a party of merse men to preserve order a dreadful tumult would probably have ensued as it was the english commissioners returned in dismay to berwick much disposed to wreak their displeasure on buccleuch and he on his side mortally offended with cessford by whose means as he conceived he had been placed in circumstances of so much danger sir robert ker however appeased all parties by delivering himself up to ward in england on which occasion he magnanimously chose for his guardian sir robert carey deputywarden of the east marches notwithstanding various causes of animosity which existed betwixt them the hospitality of carey equalled the generous confidence of cessford and a firm friendship was the consequence159  footnote 159 such traits of generosity illuminate the dark period of which we treat careys conduct on this occasion almost atones for the cold and unfeeling policy with which he watched the closing moments of his benefactress elizabeth impatient till remorse and sorrow should extort

hostage i understand saith he that the gentleman is wise and valiant but somewhat haughty here and resolute i would pray your lordship that i may have directions whether he may not go with his keeper in my company to sermons and whether he may not sometimes dine with the council as the last hostages did and thirdly whether he may sometimes be brought to sitting to the commonhall where he may see how careful her majesty is that the poorest subject in her kingdom may have their right and that her people seek remedy by law and not by avenging themselves perhaps it may do him good as long as he livethstrypes annals ad annum 1597 it would appear from this letter that the treatment of the hostages was liberal though one can hardly suppress a smile at the zeal of the good bishop for the conversion of the scottish chieftain to a more christian mode of thinking than was common among the borderers of that day the date is february 25 1597 which is somewhat difficult to reconcile with those given by the scottish historiansanother letter follows stating that sir robert having been used to open air prayed for more liberty for his healths sake offering his word which it is said he

to ancient family tradition buccleuch was presented to elizabeth who with her usual rough and peremptory address demanded of him how he dared to undertake an enterprize so desperate and presumptuous

favourable to the peace of the border they may be seen at large in the border laws p 103 by article sixth all wardens and keepers are discharged from seeking reparation of injuries in the ancient hostile mode of riding or causing to ride in warlike manner against the opposite march and that under the highest penalty unless authorized by a warrant under the hand of their sovereign the mention of the word keeper alludes obviously to the abovementioned reprisals made by buccleuch in the capacity of keeper of liddesdale  this ballad is preserved by tradition on the west borders but much mangled by reciters so that some conjectural emendations have been absolutely necessary to render it intelligible in particular the eden has been substituted for the eske p 193 the latter name being

woodhouselee a house on the border belonging to buccleuch                                       the salkeldes or sakeldes were a powerful family in cumberland possessing among other manors that of corby before it came into the possession of the howards in the beginning of the seventeenth century a strange stratagem was practised by an outlaw called jock grame of the peartree upon mr salkelde sheriff of cumberland who is probably the person alluded to in the ballad as the fact is stated to have happened late in elizabeths time the brother of this freebooter was lying in carlisle jail for execution when jock of the peartree came riding past the gate of corby castle a child of the sheriff was playing before the door to whom the outlaw gave an apple saying master will you ride the boy willingly consenting grame took him up before him carried him into scotland and would never part with him till he had his brother safe from the gallows there is no historical ground for supposing either that salkelde or any one else lost his life in the raid of carlisle  in the list of border clans 1597 will of kinmonth with kyrstie armestrange and john skynbanke are mentioned as leaders of a band of armstrongs called sandies barnes inhabiting the debateable land the ballad itself has never before been published     dick o the cow                                        this ballad and the two which immediately follow it in the collection were published 1784 in the hawick museum a provincial miscellany to which they were communicated by john elliot esq of reidheugh a gentleman well skilled in the antiquities of the western border and to whose friendly assistance the editor is indebted for many valuable communications  these ballads are connected with each other and appear to have been composed by the same author the actors seem to have flourished while thomas lord scroope of bolton was warden of the west marches of england and governor of carlisle castle which offices he acquired upon the death of his father about 1590 and retained it till the union of the crowns  dick of the cow from the privileged insolence which he assumes seems to have been lord scroopes jester in the preliminary dissertation the reader will find the border custom of assuming noms de guerre particularly noticed it is exemplified in the following ballad where one armstrong is called the lairds jock ie the lairds son jock another fair johnie a third billie willie brother willie c the lairds jock son to the laird of mangerton appears as one of the men of name in liddesdale in the list of border clans 1597  dick of the cow is erroneously supposed to have been the same with one ricardus coldall de plumpton a knight and celebrated warrior who died in 1462 as appears from his epitaph in the church of penrithnicolsons history of westmoreland and cumberland vol ii p 408  this ballad is very popular in liddesdale and the reciter always adds at the conclusion that poor dickies cautious removal to burgh under stanemore did not save him from the clutches of the armstrongs for that having fallen into their power several years after this exploit he was put to an inhuman death the ballad was well known in england so early as 1556 an allusion to it likewise occurs in parrots laquei ridiculosi or springes for woodcocks london 1613    owenus wondreth since he came to wales   what the

the horses left unhurt belonged to fair johnie armstrang his brother willie and the lairds jock of which dickie carried off two and left that of the lairds jock probably out of gratitude for the

those troublesome and disorderly times became a favourite theme of the balladmakers there are in this collection no fewer than three poems on the rescue of prisoners the incidents in which nearly resemble each other though the poetical description is so different that the editor did not think himself at liberty to reject any one of them as borrowed from the others as however there are several verses which in recitation are common to all these three songs the editor to prevent unnecessary and disagreeable repetition has used the freedom of appropriating them to that in which they seem to have the best poetic effect  the reality of this story rests solely upon the foundation of tradition jock o the side seems to have been nephew to the laird of mangertoun cousin to the lairds jock one

armstrongs made him for his faithful services180 halbert or hobbie noble appears to have been one of those numerous english outlaws who being forced to fly their own country had established themselves on the scottish borders as hobbie continued his depredations upon the english they bribed some of his hosts the armstrongs to decoy him into england under pretence of a predatory expedition he was there delivered by his treacherous companions into the hands of the officers of justice by whom he was conducted to carlisle and executed next morning the laird of mangerton with whom hobbie was in high favour is said to have taken a severe revenge upon the traitors who betrayed him the principal contriver of the scheme called here sim o the maynes fled into england from the resentment of his chief but experienced there the common fate of a traitor being himself executed at carlisle about two months after hobbies death such is at least the tradition of liddesdale sim o the maynes appears among the armstrongs of whitauch in liddesdale in the list of clans so often alluded to  footnote 180 the original editor of the reliques of ancient poetry has noticed the perfidy of this clan in another instance the delivery of the banished earl of northumberland into the hands of the scottish regent by hector of harelaw an armstrong with whom he had taken refugereliques of ancient poetry vol i p 283 this hector of harelaw seems to have been an englishman or under english assurance for he is one of those against whom bills were exhibited by the scottish commissioners to the lordbishop of carlisleintroduction to the history of westmoreland and cumberland p 81 in the list of borderers 1597 hector of harelaw with the griefs and cuts of harelaw also figures as an inhabitant of the debateable land it would appear from a spirited invective in the maitland mss against the regent and those who delivered up the unfortunate earl to elizabeth that hector had been guilty of this treachery to redeem the pledge which had been exacted from him for his peaceable demeanour the poet says that the perfidy of morton and lochlevin was worse than even that of    the traitour eckie of harelaw   that says he sould him to redeem his pledge   your deed is war as all the world does know   you nothing can but covatice alledge  pinkertons maitland poems vol ii p 290  eckie is the

anciently a borderkeep near castletoun on the north side of the liddel but is now totally demolished  askerton is an old castle now ruinous situated in the wilds of cumberland about seventeen miles northeast of carlisle amidst that mountainous and desolate tract of country bordering upon liddesdale emphatically termed the waste of bewcastle conscouthart green and rodrichaugh and the foulbogshiel are the names of places in the same wilds through which the scottish plunderers generally made their raids upon england as appears from the following passage in a letter from william lord dacre to

liddel below castletoun in the wall of a neighbouring mill which has been entirely built from the ruins of the tower there is a remarkable stone bearing the arms of the lairds of mangertoun and a long broadsword with the figures 1583 probably the date of building or repairing the castle on each side of the shield are the letters sa and ee standing probably for simon armstrong and elizabeth elliot such is the only memorial of the laird of mangertoun except those rude ballads which the editor now offers to the public     hobbie noble                                          foul fa the breast first treason bred in   that liddesdale may safely say   for in it there was baith meat and drink   and corn unto our geldings gay    and we were a stouthearted men   as england she might often say   but now we may turn our backs and flee   since brave noble is sold away    now hobbie was an english man   and born into bewcastle dale   but his misdeeds they were sae great   they banishd him to liddesdale    at kershope foot the tryst was set   kershope of the lilye lee   and there was traitor sim o the mains   and with him a private companie    then hobbie has graithed his body fair   baith

recitative except the burden which swells into a long and varied howl not unlike to a view hollo the words and the very great irregularity of the stanza if it deserves the name sufficiently point out its intention and origin an english woman residing in suport near the foot of the kershope having been plundered in the night by a band of the scottish mosstroopers is supposed to convoke her servants and friends for the pursuit or hot trod upbraiding them at the same time in homely phrase for their negligence and security the hot trod was followed by the persons who had lost goods with bloodhounds and horns to raise the country to help they also used to carry a burning wisp of straw at a spear head and to raise a cry similar to the indian warwhoop it appears from articles made by the wardens of the english marches september 12th in 6th of edward vi that all on this cry being raised were obliged to follow the fray or chace under pain of death with these explanations the general purport of the ballad may be easily discovered though particular passages have become inexplicable probably through corruptions introduced by reciters the present copy is corrected from four copies which differed

tradition it alludes to one of the most remarkable feuds upon the west marches  ad 1585 john lord maxwell or as he styled himself earl of morton having quarrelled with the earl of arran reigning favourite of james vi and fallen of course under the displeasure of the court was denounced rebel a commission was also given to the laird of johnstone then warden of the westmarches to pursue and apprehend the ancient rival and enemy of his house two bands of mercenaries commanded by captains cranstoun and lammie who were sent from edinburgh to support johnstone were attacked and cut to pieces at crawfordmuir by robert maxwell natural brother to the chieftain195 who following up his advantage burned johnstones castle of lochwood observing with savage glee that he would give lady johnstone light enough by which to set her hood in a subsequent conflict johnstone himself was defeated and made prisoner and is said to have died of grief at the disgrace which he sustainedsee spottiswoode and johnstones histories and moyses memoirs ad annum 1585  by one of the revolutions common in those days maxwell was soon after restored to the kings favour in his turn and obtained the wardenry of the west marches a bond of alliance was subscribed by him and by sir james johnstone and for some time the two clans lived in harmony in the year 1593 however the hereditary feud was revived on the following occasion a band of marauders of the clan johnstone drove a prey of cattle from the lands belonging to the lairds of crichton sanquhar and drumlanrig and defeated with slaughter the pursuers who attempted to rescue their propertysee the following ballad and introduction the injured parties being apprehensive that maxwell would not cordially embrace their cause on account of his late reconciliation with the johnstones endeavoured to overcome his reluctance by ottering to enter into bonds of manrent and so to become his followers and liegemen he on the other hand granting to them a bond of maintenance or protection by which he bound himself in usual form to maintain their quarrel against all mortals saving his loyalty thus the most powerful and respectable families in dumfriesshire became for a time the vassals of lord maxwell this secret alliance was discovered to sir james johnstone by the laird of cummertrees one of his own clan though a retainer to maxwell cummertrees even contrived to possess himself of the bonds of manrent which he delivered to his chief the petty warfare betwixt the rival barons was instantly renewed buccleuch a near relation of johnstone came to his assistance with his clan the most renowned freebooters says a historian the fiercest and bravest warriors among the border tribes196 with buccleuch also came the elliots armstrongs and graemes thus reinforced johnstone surprised and cut to pieces a party of the maxwells stationed at lochmaben on the other hand lord maxwell armed with the royal authority and numbering among his followers all the barons of nithesdale displayed his banner as the kings lieutenant and invaded annandale at the head of 2000 men in those days however the royal auspices to have carried as little good fortune as effective strength with them a desperate conflict still renowned in tradition took place at the dryffe sands not far from lockerby in which johnstone although inferior in numbers partly by his own conduct partly by the valour of his allies gained a decisive victory lord maxwell a tall man and heavily armed was struck from his horse in the flight and cruelly slain after the hand which he stretched out for quarter had been severed from his body many of his followers were slain in the battle and many cruelly wounded especially by slashes in the face which wound was thence termed a lockerby lick the barons of lag closeburn and drumlanrig escaped by the fleetness of their horses a circumstance alluded to in the following ballad  footnote 195 it is devoutly to be wished that this lammie who was killed in the skirmish may have been the same miscreant who in the day of queen marys distress hes ensigne being of quhyt taffitae had painted one it ye creuell murther

this worthy personage did not go down to the grave in peace  footnote 196 inter accolas latrociniis famosos scotos buccleuchi clientesfortissimos tributium et ferocissimosjohnstoni historia ed amstael p 182  this fatal battle was followed by a long feud attended with all the circumstances of horror proper to a barbarous age johnstone in his diffuse manner describes it thus ab eo die ultro citroque

battle of dryffe sands and is said to have early vowed the deepest revenge for his fathers death such indeed was the fiery and untameable spirit of the man that neither the threats nor entreaties of the king himself could make him lay aside his vindictive purpose although johnstone the object of his resentment had not only reconciled himself to the court but even obtained the wardenry of the middlemarches in room of sir john carmichael murdered by the armstrongs lord maxwell was therefore prohibited to approach the border counties and having in contempt of that mandate excited new disturbances he was confined in the castle of edinburgh from this fortress however he contrived to make his escape and having repaired to dumfriesshire he sought an amicable interview with johnstone under pretence of a wish to accommodate their differences sir robert maxwell of orchardstane mentioned in the ballad verse 1 who was married to a sister of sir james johnstone persuaded his brotherinlaw to accede to maxwells proposal the two chieftains met each with a single attendant at a place called achmanhill 6th april 1608 a quarrel arising betwixt the two gentlemen who attended them charles maxwell brother to the laird of kirkhouse and johnstone of lockerby and a pistol being discharged sir james turned his horse to separate the combatants at which instant lord maxwell shot him through the back with a brace of bullets of which wound he died on the spot after having for some time gallantly defended himself against maxwell who endeavoured to strike him with his sword a fact saith spottiswoode detested by all honest men and the gentlemans misfortune severely lamented for he was a man full of wisdom and couragespottiswoode edition 1677 pages 467 504 johnstoni historia ed amstael pp 254 283 449  lord maxwell the murderer made his escape to france but having ventured to return to scotland he was apprehended lurking in the wilds of caithness and brought to trial at edinburgh the royal authority was now much strengthened by the union of the crowns and james employed it in staunching the feuds of the nobility with a firmness which was no attribute of his general character but in the best actions of that monarch there seems to have been an unfortunate tincture of that meanness so visible on the present occasion lord maxwell was indicted for the murder of johnstone but this was combined with a charge of fireraising which according to the ancient scottish law if perpetrated by a landed man constituted a species of treason and inferred forfeiture thus the noble purpose of public justice was sullied by being united with that of enriching some needy favourite john lord maxwell was condemned and beheaded 21st may 1613 sir gideon murray treasurerdepute had a great share of his forfeiture but the attainder was afterwards reversed and the honours and estate were conferred upon the brother of the deceasedlaings history of scotland vol i p 62johnstoni historia p 493  the lady mentioned in the ballad was sister to the marquis of hamilton and according to johnstone the historian had little reason to regret being separated from her husband whose harsh treatment finally occasioned her death but johnstone appears not to be altogether untinctured with the prejudices of his clan and is probably in this instance guilty of exaggeration as the active share taken by the marquis of hamilton in favour of maxwell is a circumstance inconsistent with such a report  thus was finally ended by a salutary example of severity the foul debate betwixt the maxwells and johnstones in the course of which each family lost two chieftains one dying of a broken heart one in the field of battle one by assassination and one by the sword of the executioner  it seems reasonable to believe that the following ballad must have been written before the death of lord maxwell in 1613 otherwise there would have been some allusion to that event it must therefore have been composed betwixt 1608 and that period     lord maxwells goodnight                                          adieu madame my mother dear   but and my sisters three   adieu fair robert of

by murray of cockpool ancestor of the murrays lords annandale by grierson of lagg gordon of lochmaben and many other of the most ancient and respectable barons in the southwest of scotland binding themselves in the most submissive terms to become the liegemen and the vassals of the house of maxwell a circumstance which must highly excite our idea of the power of that family nay even the rival chieftain johnstone of johnstone seems at one time to have come under a similar obligation to maxwell by a bond dated 11th february 1528 in which reference is made to the counterobligation of the patron in these words forasmeikle as the said lord has oblist him to supple maintene and defend me in the peciabill brouking and joysing of all my landis rentis c and to take my aefald leill and trew

these bonds are dated many barons for the sake of maintaining unanimity and good order may have chosen to enroll themselves among the clients of lord maxwell then warden of the border from which at a less turbulent period personal considerations would have deterred them  adieu my castle of the thrievep 268 v 2  this fortress is situated in the stewartry of kirkcudbright upon an island about two acres in extent formed by the river dee the walls are very thick and strong and bear the marks of great antiquity it was a royal castle but the keeping of it agreeable to the feudal practice was granted by charter or sometimes by a more temporary and precarious right to different powerful families together with lands for their good service in maintaining and defending the place this office of heritable keeper remained with the nithesdale family chief of the maxwells till their forfeiture 1715 the garrison seems to have been victualled upon feudal principles for each parish in the stewartry was burdened with the yearly payment of a lardner mart cow ie a cow fit for being killed and salted at martinmas for winter provisions the right of levying these cattle was retained by the nithesdale family when they sold the castle and estate in 1704 and they did not cease to exercise it till their attainderfountainhalls decisions vol i p 688  this same castle of the thrieve was ad 14512 the scene of an outrageous and cruel insult upon the royal authority the fortress was then held by william viii earl of douglas who in fact possessed a more unlimited authority over the southern districts of scotland than the reigning monarch the earl had on some pretence seized and imprisoned a baron called maclellan tutor of bombie whom he threatened to bring to trial by his power of hereditary jurisdiction the uncle of this gentleman sir patrick gray of foulis who commanded the bodyguard of james ii obtained from that prince a warrant requiring from earl douglas the body of the prisoner when gray appeared the earl instantly suspected his errand you have not dined said he without suffering him to open his commission it is ill talking between a full man and a fasting while gray was at meat the unfortunate prisoner was by douglass command led forth to the courtyard and beheaded when the repast was finished the kings letter was presented and opened sir patrick says douglas leading gray to the court right glad had i been to honour the kings messenger but you have come too late yonder lies your sisters son without the head you are welcome to his dead body gray having mounted his horse turned to the earl and expressed his wrath in a deadly oath that he would requite the injury with douglass hearts bloodto horse cried the haughty baron and the messenger of his prince was pursued till within a few miles of edinburgh gray however had an opportunity of keeping his vow for being upon guard in the kings antichamber at stirling when james incensed at the insolence of the earl struck him with his dagger sir patrick rushed in and dispatched him with a poleaxe the castle of thrieve was the last of the fortresses which held out for the house of douglas after their grand rebellion in 1553 james ii writes an account of the exile of this potent family to charles vii of france 8th july 1555 and adds that all their castles had been yielded to him excepto duntaxat castro

noted feud betwixt the families of maxwell and johnstone the following song celebrates the skirmish in 1593 betwixt the johnstones and crichtons which led to the revival of the ancient quarrel betwixt johnstone and maxwell and finally to the battle of dryffe sands in which the latter lost his life wamphray is the name of a parish in annandale lethenhall was the abode of johnstone of wamphray and continued to be so till of late years william johnstone of wamphray called the galliard was a noted freebooter a place near the head of tiviotdale retains the name of the galliards faulds folds being a valley where he used to secrete and divide his spoil with his liddesdale and eskdale associates his nom de guerre seems to have been derived from the dance called the galliard the word is still used in scotland to express an active gay dissipated character199 willie of the kirkhill nephew to the galliard and his avenger was also a noted border robber previous to the battle of dryffe sands so often mentioned tradition reports that maxwell had offered a tenpoundland to any of his party who should bring him the head or hand of the laird of johnstone this being reported to his antagonist he answered he had not a tenpoundland to offer but would give a fivemerkland to the man who should that day cut off the head or hand of lord maxwell willie of the kirkhill mounted upon a young gray horse rushed upon the enemy and earned the reward by striking down their unfortunate chieftain and cutting off his right hand  leverhay stefenbiggin girthhead c are all situated in the parish of wamphray
