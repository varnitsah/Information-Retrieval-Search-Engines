xxxii conclusion     chapter i  the remnants of the amedroz family   mrs amedroz the wife of bernard amedroz esq of belton castle and mother of charles and clara amedroz died when those children were only eight and six years old thereby subjecting them to the greatest misfortune which children born in that sphere of life can be made to suffer and in the case of this boy and girl the misfortune was aggravated greatly by the peculiarities of the fathers character mr amedroz was not a bad manas men are held to be bad in the worlds esteem he was not viciouswas not a gambler or a drunkardwas not selfindulgent to a degree that brought upon him any reproach nor was he regardless of his children but he was an idle thriftless man who at the age of sixtyseven when the reader will first make his acquaintance had as yet done no good in the world whatever indeed he had done terrible evil for his son charles was now deadhad perished by his own handand the state of things which had brought about this woful event had been chiefly due to the fathers neglect  belton castle is a pretty country seat standing in a small but beautifully wooded park close under the quantock hills in somersetshire and the little town of belton clusters round the park gates few englishmen know the scenery of england well and the prettinesses of somersetshire are among those which are the least known but the quantock hills are very lovely with their rich valleys lying close among them and their outlying moorlands running off towards dulverton and the borders of devonshiremoorlands which are not flat like salisbury plain but are broken into ravines and deep watercourses and rugged dells hither and thither where old oaks are standing in which life seems to have dwindled down to the last spark but the last spark is still there and the old oaks give forth their scanty leaves from year to year  in among the hills somewhat off the high road from minehead to taunton and about five miles from the sea stands the little town or village of belton and the modern house of mr amedroz which is called belton castle the villagefor it is in truth no more though it still maintains a charter for a market and there still exists on tuesdays some pretence of an open sale of grain and butchers meat in the square before the churchgatecontains about two thousand persons that and the whole parish of belton did onceand that not long agobelong to the amedroz family they had inherited it from the beltons of old an amedroz having married the heiress of the family and as the parish is large stretching away to exmoor on one side and almost to the sea on the other containing the hamlet of redicote lying on the taunton high roadredicote where the postoffice is placed a town almost in itself and one which is now much more prosperous than beltonas the property when it came to the first amedroz had limits such as these the family had been considerable in the county but these limits had been straitened in the days of the grandfather and the father of bernard amedroz and he when he married a miss winterfield of taunton was thought to have done very well in that mortgages were paid off the property with his wifes money to such an extent as to leave him in clear possession of an estate that gave him two thousand a year as mr amedroz had no grand neighbours near him as the place is remote and the living therefore cheap and as with this income there was no question of annual visits to london mr and mrs amedroz might have done very well with such of the good things of the world as had fallen to their lot and had the wife lived such would probably have been the case for the winterfields were known to be prudent people but mrs amedroz had died young and things with bernard amedroz had gone badly  and yet the evil had not been so much with him as with that terrible boy of his the father had been nearly forty when he married he had then never done any good but as neither had he done much harm the friends of the family had argued well of his future career after him unless he should leave a son behind him there would be no amedroz left among the quantock hills and by some arrangement in respect to that winterfield money which came to him on his marriagethe winterfields having a longdated connection with the beltons of oldthe amedroz property was at bernards marriage entailed back upon a distant belton cousin one will belton whom no one had seen for many years but who was by blood nearer to the squire in default of children of his own than any other of his relatives and now will belton was the heir to belton castle for charles amedroz at the age of twentyseven had found the miseries of the world to be too many for him and had put an end to them and to himself  charles had been a clever fellowa very clever fellow in the eyes of his father bernard amedroz knew that he himself was not a clever fellow and admired his son accordingly and when charles had been expelled from harrow for some boyish freakin his vengeance against a neighbouring farmer who had reported to the school authorities the doings of a few beagles upon his land charles had cut off the heads of all the trees in a young fir plantationhis father was proud of the exploit when he was rusticated a second time from trinity and when the father received an intimation that his sons name had better be taken from the college books the squire was not so well pleased but even then he found some delight in the stories which reached him of his sons vagaries and when the young man commenced bohemian life in london his father did nothing to restrain him then there came the old storydebts endless debts and lies endless lies during the two years before his death his father paid for him or undertook to pay nearly ten thousand pounds sacrificing the life assurances which were to have made provision for his daughter sacrificing to a great extent his own life incomesacrificing everything so that the property might not be utterly ruined at his death that charles amedroz should be a brighter greater man than any other amedroz had still been the fathers pride at the last visit which charles had paid to belton his father had called upon him to pledge himself solemnly that his sister should not be made to suffer by what had been done for him within a month of that time he had blown his brains out in his london lodgings thus making over the entire property to will belton at his fathers death at that last pretended settlement with his father and his fathers lawyer he had kept back the mention of debts as heavy nearly as those to which he had owned and there were debts of honour too of which he had not spoken trusting to the next event at newmarket to set him right the next event at newmarket had set him more wrong than ever and so there had come an end to everything with charles amedroz  this had happened in the spring and the afflicted fatherafflicted with the double sorrow of his sons terrible death and his daughters ruinhad declared that he would turn his face to the wall and die but the old squires health though far from strong was stronger than he had deemed it and his feelings sharp enough were less sharp than he had thought them and when a month had passed by he had discovered that it would be better that he should live in order that his daughter might still have bread to eat and a house of her own over her head though he was now an impoverished man there was still left to him the means of keeping up the old home and he told himself that it must if possible be so kept that a few pounds annually might be put by for clara the old carriagehorses were sold and the park was let to a farmer up to the hall door of the castle so much the squire could do but as to the putting by of the few pounds any dependence on such exertion as that on his part would we may say be very precarious  belton castle was not in truth a castle immediately before the front door so near to the house as merely to allow of a broad road running between it and the entrance porch there stood an old tower which gave its name to the residencean old square tower up which the amedroz boys for three generations had been able to climb by means of the ivy and broken stones in one of the inner cornersand this tower was a remnant of a real castle that had once protected the village of belton the house itself was an ugly residence three stories high built in the time of george ii with low rooms and long passages and an immense number of doors it was a large unattractive houseunattractive that is as regarded its own attributesbut made interesting by the beauty of the small park in which it stood belton park did not perhaps contain much above a hundred acres but the land was so broken into knolls and valleys in so many places was the rock seen to be cropping up through the verdure there were in it so many stunted old oaks so many points of vantage for the lover of scenery that no one would believe it to be other than a considerable domain the farmer who took it and who would not under any circumstances undertake to pay more than seventeen shillings an acre for it could not be made to think that it was in any way considerable but belton park since first it was made a park had never before been regarded after this fashion farmer stovey of the grange was the first man of that class who had ever assumed the right to pasture his sheep in belton chaseas the people around were still accustomed to call the woodlands of the estate  it was full summer at belton and four months had now passed since the dreadful tidings had reached the castle it was full summer and the people of the village were again going about their ordinary business and the shopgirls with their lovers from redicote were again to be seen walking among the oaks in the park on a sunday evening and the world in that district of somersetshire was getting itself back into its grooves the fate of the young heir had disturbed the grooves greatly and had taught many in those parts to feel that the world was coming to an end they had not loved young amedroz for he had been haughty when among them and there had been wrongs committed by the dissolute young squire and grief had come from his misdoings upon more than one household but to think that he should have destroyed himself with his own hand and then to think that miss clara would become a beggar when the old squire should die all the neighbours around understood the whole history of the entail and knew that the property was to go to will belton now will belton was not a gentleman so at least said the belton folk who had heard that the heir had been brought up as a farmer somewhere in norfolk will belton had once been at the castle as a boy now some fifteen years ago and then there had sprung up a great quarrel between him and his distant cousin charlesand will who was rough and large of stature had thrashed the smaller boy severely and the thing had grown to have dimensions larger than those which generally attend the quarrels of boys and will had said something which had shown how well he understood his position in reference to the estateand charles had hated him so will had gone and had been no more seen among the oaks whose name he bore and the people in spite of his name regarded him as an interloper to them with their short memories and scanty knowledge of the past amedroz was more honourable than belton and they looked upon the coming man as an intruder why should not miss clara have the property miss clara had never done harm to any one  things got back into their old grooves and at the end of the third month the squire was once more seen in the old family pew at church he was a large man who had been very handsome and who now in his yellow leaf was not without a certain beauty of manliness he wore his hair and his beard long before his sons death they were grey but now they were very white and though he stooped there was still a dignity in his slow stepa dignity that came to him from nature rather than from any effort he was a man who in fact did little or nothing in the worldwhose life had been very useless but he had been gifted with such a presence that he looked as though he were one of gods nobler creatures though always dignified he was ever affable and the poor liked him better than they might have done had he passed his time in searching out their wants and supplying them they were proud of their squire though he had done nothing for them it was something to them to have a man who could so carry himself sitting in the family pew in their parish church they knew that he was poor but they all declared that he was never mean he was a real gentlemanwas this last amedroz of the family therefore they curtsied low and bowed on his reappearance among them and made all those signs of reverential awe which are common to the poor when they feel reverence for the presence of a superior  clara was there with him but she had shown herself in the pew for four or five weeks before this she had not been at home when the fearful news had reached belton being at that time with a certain lady who lived on the further side of the county at perivalea certain mrs winterfield born a folliott a widow who stood to miss amedroz in the place of an aunt mrs winterfield was in truth the sister of a gentleman who had married claras auntthere having been marriages and intermarriages between the winterfields and the folliotts and the beltonamedroz families with this lady in perivale which i maintain to be the dullest little town in england miss amedroz was staying when the news reached her father and when it was brought direct from london to herself instantly she had hurried home making the journey with all imaginable speed though her heart was all but broken within her bosom she had found her father stricken to the ground and it was the more necessary therefore that she should exert herself it would not do that she also should yield to that longing for death which terrible calamities often produce for a season  clara amedroz when she first heard the news of her brothers fate had felt that she was for ever crushed to the ground she had known too well what had been the nature of her brothers life but she had not expected or feared any such termination to his career as this which had now come upon himto the terrible affliction of all belonging to him she felt at first as did also her father that she and he were annihilated as regards this world not only by an enduring grief but also by a disgrace which would never allow her again to hold up her head and for many a long year much of this feeling clung to herclung to her much more strongly than to her father but strength was hers to perceive even before she had reached her home that it was her duty to repress both the feeling of shame and the sorrow as far as they were capable of repression her brother had been weak and in his weakness had sought a cowards escape from the ills of the world around him she must not also be a coward bad as life might be to her henceforth she must endure it with such fortitude as she could muster so resolving she returned to her father and was able to listen to his railings with a fortitude that was essentially serviceable both to him and to herself  both of you both of you the unhappy father had said in his woe the wretched boy has destroyed you as much as himself no sir she had answered with a forbearance in her misery which terrible as was the effort she forced herself to accomplish for his sake it is not so no thought of that need add to your grief my poor brother has not hurt menot in the way you mean he has ruined us all said the father root and branch man and woman old and young house and land he has brought the family to an endah me to such an end after that the name of him who had taken himself from among them was not mentioned between the father and daughter and clara settled herself to the duties of her new life striving to live as though there was no great sorrow around heras though no cloudstorm had burst over her head  the family lawyer who lived at taunton had communicated the fact of charless death to mr belton and belton had acknowledged the letter with the ordinary expressions of regret the lawyer had alluded to the entail saying that it was improbable that mr amedroz would have another son to this belton had replied that for his cousin claras sake he hoped that the squires life might be long spared the lawyer smiled as he read the wish thinking to himself that luckily no wish on the part of will belton could influence his old client either for good or evil what man let alone what lawyer will ever believe in the sincerity of such a wish as that expressed by the heir to a property and yet where is the man who will not declare to himself that such under such circumstances would be his own wish  clara amedroz at this time was not a very young lady she had already passed her twentyfifth birthday and in manners appearance and habits was at any rate as old as her age she made no pretence to youth speaking of herself always as one whom circumstances required to take upon herself age in advance of her years she did not dress young or live much with young people or correspond with other girls by means of crossed letters nor expect that for her young pleasures should be provided life had always been serious with her but now we may say since the terrible tragedy in the family it must be solemn as well as serious the memory of her brother must always be upon her and the memory also of the fact that her father was now an impoverished man on whose behalf it was her duty to care that every shilling spent in the house did its full twelve pennies worth of work there was a mixture in this of deep tragedy and of little care which seemed to destroy for her the poetry as well as the pleasure of life the poetry and tragedy might have gone hand in hand together and so might the cares and pleasures of life have done had there been no black sorrow of which she must be ever mindful but it was her lot to have to scrutinize the butchers bill as she was thinking of her brothers fate and to work daily among small household things while the spectre of her brothers corpse was ever before her eyes  a word must be said to explain how it had come to pass that the life led by miss amedroz had been more than commonly serious before that tragedy had befallen the family the name of the lady who stood to clara in the place of an aunt has been already mentioned when a girl has a mother her aunt may be little or nothing to her but when the mother is gone if there be an aunt unimpeded with other family duties then the family duties of that aunt beginand are assumed sometimes with great vigour such had been the case with mrs winterfield no woman ever lived perhaps with more conscientious ideas of her duty as a woman than mrs winterfield of prospect place perivale and this as i say it is intended to convey no scoff against that excellent lady she was an excellent ladyunselfish given to selfrestraint generous pious looking to find in her religion a safe path through lifea path as safe as the facts of adams fall would allow her feet to find she was a woman fearing much for others but fearing also much for herself striving to maintain her house in godliness hating sin and struggling with the weakness of her humanity so that she might not allow herself to hate the sinners but her hatred for the sin she found herself bound at all times to pronounceto show it by some act at all seasons to fight the devil was her workwas the appointed work of every living soul if only living souls could be made to acknowledge the necessity of the task now an aunt of that kind when she assumes her duties towards a motherless niece is apt to make life serious  but it will be said clara amedroz could have rebelled and claras father was hardly made of such stuff that obedience to the aunt would be enforced on her by parental authority doubtless clara could have rebelled against her aunt indeed i do not know that she had hitherto been very obedient but there were family facts about these winterfield connections which would have made it difficult for her to ignore her socalled aunt even had she wished to do so mrs winterfield had twelve hundred a year at her own disposal and she was the only person related to the amedroz family from whom mr amedroz had a right to have expectations on his daughters behalf clara had in a measure been claimed by the lady and the father had made good the ladys claim and clara had acknowledged that a portion of her life was due to the demands of perivale these demands had undoubtedly made her life serious  life at perivale was a very serious thing as regards amusement ordinarily so called the need of any such institution was not acknowledged at prospect house food drink and raiment were acknowledged to be necessary to humanity and in accordance with the rules of that house they were supplied in plenty and good of their kind such ladies as mrs winterfield generally keep good tables thinking no doubt that the eatables should do honour to the grace that is said for them and mrs winterfield herself always wore a thick black silk dressnot rusty or dowdy with agebut with some gloss of the silk on it giving away with secret underhand undiscovered charity her old dresses to another lady of her own sort on whom fortune had not bestowed twelve hundred a year and mrs winterfield kept a low fourwheeled onehorsed little phaeton in which she made her pilgrimages among the poor of perivale driven by the most solemn of stableboys dressed up in a white great coat the most priggish of hats and white cotton gloves at the rate of five miles an hour was she driven about and this driving was to her the amusement of life but such an occupation to clara amedroz assisted to make life serious  in person mrs winterfield was tall and thin wearing on her brow thin braids of false hair she had suffered much from acute ill health and her jaws were sunken and her eyes were hollow and there was a look of woe about her which seemed ever to be telling of her own sorrows in this world and of the sorrows of others in the world to come illnature was written on her face but in this her face was a false face she had the manners of a cross peevish woman but her manners also were false and gave no proper idea of her character but still such as she was she made life very serious to those who were called upon to dwell with her  i need i hope hardly say that a young lady such as miss amedroz even though she had reached the age of twentyfivefor at the time to which i am now alluding she had nearly done soand was not young of her age had formed for herself no plan of life in which her aunts money figured as a motive power she had gone to perivale when she was very young because she had been told to do so and had continued to go partly from obedience partly from habit and partly from affection an aunts dominion when once well established in early years cannot easily be thrown altogether asideeven though a young lady have a will of her own now clara amedroz had a strong will of her own and did not at allat any rate in these latter daysbelong to that school of divinity in which her aunt shone almost as a professor and this circumstance also added to the seriousness of her life but in regard to her aunts money she had entertained no established hopes and when her aunt opened her mind to her on that subject a few days before the arrival of the fatal news at perivale clara though she was somewhat surprised was by no means disappointed now there was a certain captain aylmer in the question of whom in this opening chapter it will be necessary to say a few words  captain frederic folliott aylmer was in truth the nephew of mrs winterfield whereas clara amedroz was not in truth her niece and captain aylmer was also member of parliament for the little borough of perivale returned altogether on the low church interestfor a devotion to which and for that alone perivale was noted among boroughs these facts together added not a little to mrs winterfields influence and professorial power in the place and gave a dignity to the onehorse chaise which it might not otherwise have possessed but captain aylmer was only the second son of his father sir anthony aylmer who had married a miss folliott sister of our mrs winterfield on frederic aylmer his mothers estate was settled that and mrs winterfields property lay in the neighbourhood of perivale and now on the occasion to which i am alluding mrs winterfield thought it necessary to tell clara that the property must all go together she had thought about it and had doubted about it and had prayed about it and now she found that such a disposition of it was her duty  i am quite sure youre right aunt clara had said she knew very well what had come of that provision which her father had attempted to make for her and knew also how great were her fathers expectations in regard to mrs winterfields money  i hope i am but i have thought it right to tell you i shall feel myself bound to tell frederic i have had many doubts but i think i am right  i am sure you are aunt what would he think of me if at some future time he should have to find that i had been in his way  the future time will not be long now my dear  i hope it may but long or short it is better so  i think it is my dear i think it is i think it is my duty  it must be understood that captain aylmer was member for perivale on the low church interest and that therefore when at perivale he was decidedly a low churchman i am not aware that the peculiarity stuck to him very closely at aylmer castle in yorkshire or among his friends in london but there was no hypocrisy in this as the world goes women in such matters are absolutely false if they be not sincere but men with political views and with much of their future prospects in jeopardy also are allowed to dress themselves differently for different scenes whatever be the peculiar interest on which a man goes into parliament of course he has to live up to that in his own borough whether malt the franchise or teetotalism be his rallying point of course he is full of it when among his constituents but it is not desirable that he should be full of it also at his club had captain aylmer become prime minister he would no doubt have made low church bishops it was the side to which he had taken himself in that matternot without good reasons and he could say a sharp word or two in season about vestments he was strong against candles and fought for his side fairly well no one had good right to complain of captain aylmer as being insincere but had his aunt known the whole history of her nephews life i doubt whether she would have made him her heirthinking that in doing so she was doing the best for the good cause  the whole history of her nieces life she did know and she knew that clara was not with her heart and soul had clara left the old woman in doubt on this subject she would have been a hypocrite captain aylmer did not often spend a sunday at perivale but when he did he went to church three times and submitted himself to the yoke he was thinking of the borough votes quite as much as of his aunts money and was carrying on his business after the fashion of men but clara found herself compelled to maintain some sort of a fight though she also went to church three times on sunday and there was another reason why mrs winterfield thought it right to mention captain aylmers name to her niece on this occasion  i had hoped she said that it might make no difference in what way my money was left  clara well understood what this meant as will probably the reader also i cant say but what it will make a difference she answered smiling but i shall always think that you have done right why should i stand in captain aylmers way  i had hoped your ways might have been the same said the old lady fretfully  but they cannot be the same  no you do not see things as he sees them things that are serious to him are i fear only light to you dear clara would i could see you more in earnest as to the only matter that is worth our earnestness miss amedroz said nothing as to the captains earnestness though perhaps her ideas as to his ideas about religion were more correct than those held by mrs winterfield but it would not have suited her to raise any argument on that subject i pray for you clara continued the old lady and will do so as long as the power of prayer is left to me i hopei hope you do not cease to pray for yourself  i endeavour aunt  it is an endeavour which if really made never fails  clara said nothing more and her aunt also remained silent soon afterwards the fourwheeled carriage with the demure stableboy came to the door and clara was driven up and down through the streets of perivale in a manner which was an injury to her she knew that she was suffering an injustice but it was one of which she could not make complaint she submitted to her aunt enduring the penances that were required of her and therefore her aunt had opportunity enough to see her shortcomings mrs winterfield did see them and judged her accordingly captain aylmer being a man and a member of parliament was called upon to bear no such penances and therefore his shortcomings were not suspected  but after all what title had she ever possessed to entertain expectations from mrs winterfield when she thought of it all in her room that night she told herself that it was strange that her aunt should have spoken to her in such a way on such a subject but then so much had been said to her on the matter by her father so much no doubt had reached her aunts ears also the hope that her position with reference to the rich widow at perivale might be beneficial to her had been so often discussed at belton as a makeweight against the extravagance of the heir there had already been so much of this mistake that she taught herself to perceive that the communication was needed in her honesty she has not chosen to leave me with false hopes said clara to herself and at that moment she loved her aunt for her honesty  then on the day but one following this conversation as to the destiny of her aunts property came the terrible tidings of her brothers death captain aylmer who had been in london at the time hurried down to perivale and had been the first to tell miss amedroz what had happened the words spoken between them then had not been many but clara knew that captain aylmer had been kind to her and when he had offered to accompany her to belton she had thanked him with a degree of gratitude which had almost seemed to imply more of regard between them than clara would have acknowledged to exist but in moments such as those soft words may be spoken and hands may be pressed without any of that meaning which soft words and the grasping of hands generally carry with them as far as taunton captain aylmer did go with miss amedroz and there they parted he on his journey up to town and she for her fathers desolate house at belton     chapter ii  the heir proposes to visit his cousins   it was full summer at belton and the sweet scent of the new hay filled the porch of the old house with fragrance as clara sat there alone with her work immediately before the house door between that and the old tower there stood one of farmer stoveys haycarts now empty with an old horse between the shafts looking as though he were asleep in the sun immediately beyond the tower the men were loading another cart and the women and children were chattering as they raked the scattered remnants up to the rows under the shadow of the old tower but in sight of clara as she sat in the porch there lay the small beerbarrels of the haymakers and three or four rakes were standing erect against the old grey wall it was now eleven oclock and clara was waiting for her father who was not yet out of his room she had taken his breakfast to him in bed as was her custom for he had fallen into idle ways and the luxury of his bed was of all his remaining luxuries the one that he liked the best after a while he came down to her having an open letter in his hand clara saw that he intended either to show it to her or to speak of it and asked him therefore with some tone of interest in her voice from whom it had come but mr amedroz was fretful at the moment and instead of answering her began to complain of his tenants illusage of him  what has he got his cart there for i havent let him the road up to the hall door i suppose he will bring his things into the parlour next  i rather like it papa  do you i can only say that youre lucky in your tastes i dont like it i can tell you  mr stovey is out there shall i ask him to have the things moved further off  no my dearno i must bear it as i do all the rest of it what does it matter therell be an end of it soon he pays his rent and i suppose he is right to do as he pleases but i cant say that i like it  am i to see the letter papa she asked wishing to turn his mind from the subject of the haycart  well yes i brought it for you to see though perhaps i should be doing better if i burned it and said nothing more about it it is a most impudent production and heartlessvery heartless  clara was accustomed to such complaints as these from her father everything that everybody did around him he would call heartless the man pitied himself so much in his own misery that he expected to live in an atmosphere of pity from others and though the pity doubtless was there he misdoubted it he thought that farmer stovey was cruel in that he had left the haycart near the house to wound his eyes by reminding him that he was no longer master of the ground before his own hall door he thought that the women and children were cruel to chatter so near his ears he almost accused his daughter of cruelty because she had told him that she liked the contiguity of the haymaking under such circumstances as those which enveloped him and her was it not heartless in her to like anything it seemed to him that the whole world of belton should be drowned in woe because of his misery  where is it from papa she asked  there you may read it perhaps it is better that you should know that it has been written then she read the letter which was as follows  plaistow hall  july 186  though she had never before seen the handwriting she knew at once from whence came the letter for she had often heard of plaistow hall it was the name of the farm at which her distant cousin will belton lived and her father had more than once been at the trouble of explaining to her that though the place was called a hall the house was no more than a farmhouse he had never seen plaistow hall and had never been in norfolk but so much he could take upon himself to say they call all the farms halls down there it was not wonderful that he should dislike his heir and perhaps not unnatural that he should show his dislike after this fashion clara when she read the address looked up into her fathers face you know who it is now he said and then she read the letter      plaistow hall  july 186     my dear sir     i have not written to you before since your bereavement    thinking it better to wait awhile but i hope you have    not taken me to be unkind in this or have supposed me    to be unmindful of your sorrow now i take up my pen    hoping that i may make you understand how greatly i was    distressed by what has occurred i believe i am now the    nearest male relative that you have and as such i am very    anxious to be of service to you if it may be possible    considering the closeness of our connection and my    position in reference to the property it seems bad that    we should never meet i can assure you that you would find    me very friendly if we could manage to come together     i should think nothing of running across to belton if you    would receive me at your house i could come very well    before harvest if that would suit you and would stay    with you for a week pray give my kindest regards to my    cousin clara whom i can only just remember as a very    little girl she was with her aunt at perivale when i was    at belton as a boy she shall find a friend in me if she    wants a friend     your affectionate cousin     w belton   clara read the letter very slowly so that she might make herself sure of its tone and bearing before she was called upon by her father to express her feeling respecting it she knew that she would be expected to abuse it violently and to accuse the writer of vulgarity insolence and cruelty but she had already learned that she must not allow herself to accede to all her fathers fantasies for his sake and for his protection it was necessary that she should differ from him and even contradict him were she not to do so he would fall into a state of wailing and complaining that would exaggerate itself almost to idiotcy and it was imperative that she herself should exercise her own opinion on many points almost without reference to him she alone knew how utterly destitute she would be when he should die he in the first days of his agony had sobbed forth his remorse as to her ruin but even when doing so he had comforted himself with the remembrance of mrs winterfields money and mrs winterfields affection for his daughter and the aunt when she had declared her purpose to clara had told herself that the provision made for clara by her father was sufficient to neither of them had clara told her own position she could not inform her aunt that her father had given up to the poor reprobate who had destroyed himself all that had been intended for her had she done so she would have been asking her aunt for charity nor would she bring herself to add to her fathers misery by destroying the hopes which still supported him she never spoke of her own position in regard to money but she knew that it had become her duty to live a wary watchful life taking much upon herself in their impoverished household and holding her own opinion against her fathers when her doing so became expedient so she finished the letter in silence and did not speak at the moment when the movement of her eyes declared that she had completed the task  well said he  i do not think my cousin means badly  you dont i do then i think he means very badly what business has he to write to me talking of his position  i cant see anything amiss in his doing so papa i think he wishes to be friendly the property will be his some day and i dont see why that should not be mentioned when there is occasion  upon my word clara you surprise me but women never understand delicacy in regard to money they have so little to do with it and think so little about it that they have no occasion for such delicacy  clara could not help the thought that to her mind the subject was present with sufficient frequency to make delicacy very desirable if only it were practicable but of this she said nothing and what answer will you send to him papa she asked  none at all why should i trouble myself to write to him  i will take the trouble off your hands  and what will you say to him  i will ask him to come here as he proposes  clara  why not papa he is the heir to the property and why should he not be permitted to see it there are many things in which his cooperation with you might be a comfort to you i cant tell you whether the tenants and people are treating you well but he can do so and moreover i think he means to be kind i do not see why we should quarrel with our cousin because he is the heir to your property it is not through any doing of his own that he is so  this reasoning had no effect upon mr amedroz but his daughters resolution carried the point against him in spite of his want of reason no letter was written that day or on the next but on the day following a formal note was sent off by clara in which mr belton was told that mr amedroz would be happy to receive him at belton castle the letter was written by the daughter but the father was responsible for the formality he sat over her while she wrote it and nearly drove her distracted by discussing every word and phrase at last clara was so annoyed with her own production that she was almost tempted to write another letter unknown to her father but the formal note went      my dear sir     i am desired by my father to say that he will be happy    to receive you at belton castle at the time fixed by    yourself     yours truly     clara amedroz   there was no more than that but that had the desired effect and by return of post there came a rejoinder saying that will belton would be at the castle on the fifteenth of august they can do without me for about ten days he said in his postscript writing in a familiar tone which did not seem to have been at all checked by the coldness of his cousins noteas our harvest will be late but i must be back for a weeks work before the partridges  heartless quite heartless mr amedroz said as he read this partridges to talk of partridges at such a time as this  clara however would not acknowledge that she agreed with her father but she could not altogether restrain a feeling on her own part that her cousins good humour towards her and mr amedroz should have been repressed by the tone of her letter to him the man was to come however and she would not judge of him until he was there  in one house in the neighbourhood and in only one had miss amedroz a friend with whom she was intimate and as regarded even this single friend the intimacy was the effect rather of circumstances than of real affection she liked mrs askerton and saw her almost daily but she could hardly tell herself that she loved her neighbour  in the little town of belton close to the church there stood a pretty small house called belton cottage it was so near the church that strangers always supposed it to be the parsonage but the rectory stood away out in the country half a mile from the town on the road to redicote and was a large house three stories high with grounds of its own and very ugly here lived the old bachelor rector seventy years of age given much to long absences when he could achieve them and never on good terms with his bishop his two curates lived at redicote where there was a second church belton cottage which was occupied by colonel askerton and mrs askerton was on the amedroz property and had been hired some two years since by the colonel who was then a stranger in the country and altogether unknown to the belton people but he had come there for shooting and therefore his coming had been understood even as long ago as two years since there had been neither use nor propriety in keeping the shooting for the squires son and it had been let with the cottage to colonel askerton so colonel askerton had come there with his wife and no one in the neighbourhood had known anything about them mr amedroz with his daughter had called upon them and gradually there had grown up an intimacy between clara and mrs askerton there was an opening from the garden of belton cottage into the park so that familiar intercourse was easy and mrs askerton was a woman who knew well how to make herself pleasant to such another woman as miss amedroz  the reader may as well know at once that rumours prejudicial to the askertons reached belton before they had been established there for six months at taunton which was twenty miles distant these rumours were very rife and there were people there who knew with accuracythough probably without a grain of truth in their accuracyevery detail in the history of mrs askertons life and something too reached claras earssomething from old mr wright the rector who loved scandal and was very illnatured a very nice woman the rector had said but she does not seem to have any belongings in particular she has got a husband clara had replied with some little indignation for she had never loved mr wright yes i suppose she has got a husband then clara had in her own judgment accused the rector of lying evilspeaking and slandering and had increased the measure of her cordiality to mrs askerton but something more she had heard on the same subject at perivale before you throw yourself into close intimacy with the lady i think you should know something about her mrs winterfield had said to her i do know something about her i know that she has the manners and education of a lady and that she is living affectionately with her husband who is devoted to her what more ought i to know if you really do know all that you know a great deal mrs winterfield had replied  do you know anything against her aunt clara asked after a pause  there was another pause before mrs winterfield answered no my dear i cannot say that i do but i think that young ladies before they make intimate friendships should be very sure of their friends  you have already acknowledged that i know a great deal about her clara replied and then the conversation was at an end clara had not been quite ingenuous as she acknowledged to herself she was aware that her aunt would not permit herself to repeat rumours as to the truth of which she had no absolute knowledge she understood that the weakness of her aunts caution was due to the old ladys sense of charity and dislike of slander but clara had buckled on her armour for mrs askerton and was glad therefore to achieve her little victory when we buckle on our armour in any cause we are apt to go on buckling it let the cause become as weak as it may and clara continued her intimacy with mrs askerton although there was something in the ladys modes of speech and something also in her modes of thinking which did not quite satisfy the aspirations of miss amedroz as to a friend  colonel askerton himself was a pleasant quiet man who seemed to be contented with the life which he was leading for six weeks in april and may he would go up to town leaving mrs askerton at the cottageas to which probably jovial absence in the metropolis there seemed to be no spirit of grudging on the part of the wife on the first of september a friend would come to the cottage and remain there for six weeks shooting and during the winter the colonel and his wife always went to paris for a fortnight such had been their life for the last two years and thusso said mrs askerton to claradid they intend to live as long as they could keep the cottage at belton society at belton they had none andas they saiddesired none between them and mr wright there was only a speaking acquaintance the married curate at redicote would not let his wife call on mrs askerton and the unmarried curate was a hardworked clerical hacka parochial minister at all times and seasons who went to no houses except the houses of the poor and who would hold communion with no man and certainly with no woman who would not put up with clerical admonitions for sunday backslidings mr amedroz himself neither received guests nor went as a guest to other mens houses he would occasionally stand for a while at the gate of the colonels garden and repeat the list of his own woes as long as his neighbour would stand there to hear it but there was no society at belton and clara as far as she herself was aware was the only person with whom mrs askerton held any social intercourse except what she might have during her short annual holiday in paris  of course you are right she said when clara told her of the proposed coming of mr belton if he turn out to be a good fellow you will have gained a great deal and should he be a bad fellow you will have lost nothing in either case you will know him and considering how he stands towards you that itself is desirable  but if he should annoy papa  in your papas condition my dear the coming of any one will annoy him at least he will say so though i do not in the least doubt that he will like the excitement better even than you will  i cant say there will be much excitement to me  no excitement in a young mans coming into the house without shocking your propriety allow me to say that that is impossible of course he is coming to see whether he cant make matters all right by marrying you  thats nonsense mrs askerton  very well let it be nonsense but why shouldnt he its just what he ought to do he hasnt got a wife and as far as i know you havent got a lover  i certainly have not got a lover  our religious nephew at perivale does not seem to be of any use  i wish mrs askerton you would not speak of captain aylmer in that way i dont know any man whom i like so much or at any rate better than captain aylmer but i hate the idea that no girl can become acquainted with an unmarried man without having her name mentioned with his and having to hear illnatured remarks of that kind  i hope you will learn to like this other man much better think how nice it will be to be mistress of the old place after all and then to go back to the old family name if i were you i would make up my mind not to let him leave the place till i had brought him to my feet  if you go on like that i will not speak to you about him again  or rather not to my feetfor gentlemen have laid aside the humble way of making love for the last twenty years at least but i dont know whether the women havent gained quite as much by the change as the men  as i know nothing will stop you when you once get into a vein of that kind i shall go said clara and till this man has come and gone i shall not mention his name again in your presence  so be it said mrs askerton but as i will promise to say nothing more about him you need not go on his account but clara had got up and did leave the cottage at once     chapter iii  will belton   mr belton came to the castle and nothing further had been said at the cottage about his coming clara had seen mrs askerton in the meantime frequently but that lady had kept her promisealmost to claras disappointment for shethough she had in truth disliked the proposition that her cousin could be coming with any special views with reference to herself had nevertheless sufficient curiosity about the stranger to wish to talk about him her father indeed mentioned beltons name very frequently saying something with reference to him every time he found himself in his daughters presence a dozen times he said that the man was heartless to come to the house at such a time and he spoke of his cousin always as though the man were guilty of a gross injustice in being heir to the property but not the less on that account did he fidget himself about the room in which belton was to sleep about the food that belton was to eat and especially about the wine that belton was to drink what was he to do for wine the stock of wine in the cellars at belton castle was no doubt very low the squire himself drank a glass or two of port daily and had some remnant of his old treasures by him which might perhaps last him his time and occasionally there came small supplies of sherry from the grocer at taunton but mr amedroz pretended to think that will belton would want champagne and claretand he would continue to make these suggestions in spite of his own repeated complaints that the man was no better than an ordinary farmer ive no doubt hell like beer said clara beer said her father and then stopped himself as though he were lost in doubt whether it would best suit him to scorn his cousin for having so low a taste as that suggested on his behalf or to ridicule his daughters idea that the household difficulty admitted of so convenient a solution  the day of the arrival at last came and clara certainly was in a twitter although she had steadfastly resolved that she would be in no twitter at all she had told her aunt by letter of the proposed visit and mrs winterfield had expressed her approbation saying that she hoped it would lead to good results of what good results could her aunt be thinking the one probable good result would surely be thisthat relations so nearly connected should know each other why should there be any fuss made about such a visit but nevertheless clara though she made no outward fuss knew that inwardly she was not as calm about the mans coming as she would have wished herself to be  he arrived about five oclock in a gig from taunton five was the ordinary dinner hour at belton but it had been postponed till six on this day in the hope that the cousin might make his appearance at any rate by that hour mr amedroz had uttered various complaints as to the visitors heartlessness in not having written to name the hour of his arrival and was manifestly intending to make the most of the grievance should he not present himself before sixbut this indulgence was cut short by the sound of the gig wheels mr amedroz and his daughter were sitting in a small drawingroom which looked out to the front of the house and he seated in his accustomed chair near the window could see the arrival for a moment or two he remained quiet in his chair as though he would not allow so insignificant a thing as his cousins coming to ruffle himbut he could not maintain this dignified indifference and before belton was out of the gig he had shuffled out into the hall  clara followed her father almost unconsciously and soon found herself shaking hands with a big man over six feet high broad in the shoulders large limbed with bright quick grey eyes a large mouth teeth almost too perfect and a wellformed nose with thick short brown hair and small whiskers which came but halfway down his cheeksa decidedly handsome man with a florid face but still perhaps with something of the promised roughness of the farmer but a more goodhumoured looking countenance clara felt at once that she had never beheld  and you are the little girl that i remember when i was a boy at mr folliotts he said his voice was clear and rather loud but it sounded very pleasantly in that sad old house  yes i am the little girl said clara smiling  dear dear and thats twenty years ago now said he  but you oughtnt to remind me of that mr belton  oughtnt i why not  because it shows how very old i am  ah yesto be sure but theres nobody here that signifies how well i remember this roomand the old tower out there it isnt changed a bit  not to the outward eye perhaps said the squire  thats what i mean so theyre making hay still our hay has been all up these three weeks i didnt know you ever meadowed the park here he trod with dreadful severity upon the corns of mr amedroz but he did not perceive it and when the squire muttered something about a tenant and the inconvenience of keeping land in his own hands belton would have gone on with the subject had not clara changed the conversation the squire complained bitterly of this to clara when they were alone saying that it was very heartless  she had a little scheme of her owna plan arranged for the saying of a few words to her cousin on the earliest opportunity of their being alone togetherand she contrived that this should take place within half an hour after his arrival as he went through the hall up to his room mr belton she said im sure you will not take it amiss if i take a cousins privilege at once and explain to you something of our way of living here my dear father is not very strong  he is much altered since i saw him last  oh yes think of all that he has had to bear well mr belton the fact is that we are not so well off as we used to be and are obliged to live in a very quiet way you will not mind that  who i  i take it very kind of you your coming all this way to see us  id have come three times the distance  but you must put up with us as you find us you know the truth is we are very poor  well nowthats just what i wanted to know one couldnt write and ask such a question but i was sure i should find out if i came  youve found it out already you see  as for being poor its a thing i dont think very much aboutnot for young people but it isnt comfortable when a man gets old now what i want to know is this cant something be done  the only thing to do is to be very kind to him he has had to let the park to mr stovey and he doesnt like talking about it  but if it isnt talked about how can it be mended  it cant be mended  well see about that but ill be kind to him you see if i aint and ill tell you what ill be kind to you too if youll let me you have got no brother now  no said clara i have got no brother now belton was looking full into her face and saw that her eyes had become clouded with tears  i will be your brother said he you see if i dont when i say a thing i mean it i will be your brother and he took her hand caressing it and showing her that he was not in the least afraid of her he was blunt in his bearing saying things which her father would have called indelicate and heartless as though they gave him no effort and placing himself at once almost in a position of ascendency this clara had not intended she had thought that her farmer cousin in spite of the superiority of his prospects as heir to the property would have acceded to her little hints with silent acquiescence but instead of this he seemed prepared to take upon himself the chief part in the play that was to be acted between them shall it be so he said still holding her hand  you are very kind  i will be more than kind i will love you dearly if you will let me you dont suppose that i have looked you up here for nothing blood is thicker than water and you have nobody now so near to you as i am i dont see why you should be so poor as the debts have been paid  papa has had to borrow money on his life interest in the place  thats the mischief never mind well see if we cant do something and in the meantime dont make a stranger of me anything does for me lord bless you if you were to see how i rough it sometimes i can eat beans and bacon with any one and whats more i can go without em if i cant get em  wed better get ready for dinner now i always dress because papa likes to see it this she said as a hint to her cousin that he would be expected to change his coat for her father would have been annoyed had his guest sat down to dinner without such ceremony will belton was not very good at taking hints but he did understand this and made the necessary change in his apparel  the evening was long and dull and nothing occurred worthy of remark except the surprise manifested by mr amedroz when belton called his daughter by her christian name this he did without the slightest hesitation as though it were the most natural thing in the world for him to do she was his cousin and cousins of course addressed each other in that way claras quick eye immediately saw her fathers slight gesture of dismay but belton caught nothing of this the squire took an early opportunity of calling him mr belton with some little peculiarity of expression but this was altogether lost upon will who five times in the next five minutes addressed clara as though they were already on the most intimate terms she would have answered him in the same way and would have called him will had she not been afraid of offending her father  mr amedroz had declared his purpose of coming down to breakfast during the period of his cousins visit and at halfpast nine he was in the parlour clara had been there some time but had not seen her cousin he entered the room immediately after her father bringing his hat with him in his hand and wiping the drops of perspiration from his brow you have been out mr belton said the squire  all round the place sir six oclock doesnt often find me in bed summer or winter whats the use of laying in bed when one has had enough of sleep  but thats just the question said clara whether one has had enough at six oclock  women want more than men of course a man if he means to do any good with land must be out early the grass will grow of itself at nights but it wants looking after as soon as the daylight comes  i dont know that it would do much good to the grass here said the squire mournfully  as much here as anywhere and indeed ive got something to say about that he had now seated himself at the breakfasttable and was playing with his knife and fork i think sir youre hardly making the best you can out of the park  we wont mind talking about it if you please said the squire  well of course i wont if you dont like it but upon my word you ought to look about you you ought indeed  in what way do you mean said clara  if your father doesnt like to keep the land in his own hands he should let it to some one who would put stock in itnot go on cutting it year after year and putting nothing back as this fellow will do ive been talking to stovey and thats just what he means  nobody here has got money to put stock on the land said the squire angrily  then you should look for somebody somewhere else thats all ill tell you what now mr amedroz ill do it myself by this time he had helped himself to two large slices of cold mutton and was eating his breakfast and talking with an equal amount of energy for either occupation  thats out of the question said the squire  i dont see why it should be out of the question it would be better for youand better for me too if this place is ever to be mine on hearing this the squire winced but said nothing this terrible fellow was so vehemently outspoken that the poor old man was absolutely unable to keep pace with himeven to the repeating of his wish that the matter should be talked of no further ill tell you what ill do now continued belton theres altogether outside the palings and in about a hundred and fifty acres of it ill give you one pound two and sixpence an acre and i wont cut an acre of grass inside the parkno nor much of it outside eitheronly just enough to give me a little fodder for the cattle in winter  and give up plaistow hall asked clara  lord love you no ive a matter of nine hundred acres on hand there and most of it under the plough ive counted it up and it would just cost me a thousand pounds to stock this place i should come and look at it twice a year or so and i should see my money home again if i didnt get any profit out of it  mr amedroz was astonished the man had only been in his house one night and was proposing to take all his troubles off his hands he did not relish the proposition at all he did not like to be accused of not doing as well for himself as others could do for him he did not wish to make any changealthough he remembered at the moment his anger with farmer stovey respecting the haycarts he did not desire that the heir should have any immediate interest in the place but he was not strong enough to meet the proposition with a direct negative i couldnt get rid of stovey in that way he said plaintively  ive settled it all with stovey already said belton hell be glad enough to walk off with a twentypound note which ill give him he cant make money out of the place he hasnt got means to stock it and then see the wages that haymaking runs away with hed lose by it even at what hes paying and he knows it there wont be any difficulty about stovey  by twelve oclock on that day mr stovey had been brought into the house and had resigned the land it had been let to mr william belton at an increased rentala rental increased by nearly forty pounds per annumand that gentleman had already made many of his arrangements for entering upon his tenancy the twenty pounds had already been paid to stovey and the transaction was complete mr amedroz sat in his chair bewildered dismayedand as he himself declaredshocked quite shocked at the precipitancy of the young man it might be for the best he didnt know he didnt feel at all sure but such hurrying in such a matter was under all the circumstances of the family to say the least of it very indelicate he was angry with himself for having yielded and angry with clara for having allowed him to do so it doesnt signify much he said at last of course hell have it all to himself before long  but papa it really seems to be a much better arrangement for you youll get more money  money is not everything my dear  but youd sooner have mr belton our own cousin about the place than mr stovey  i dont know we shall see the thing is done now and there is no use in complaining i must say he hasnt shown a great deal of delicacy  on that afternoon belton asked clara to go out with him and walk round the place he had been again about the grounds and had made plans and counted up capabilities and calculated his profit and losses if you dont dislike scrambling about said he ill show you everything that i intend to do  but i cant have any changes made mr belton said mr amedroz with some affectation of dignity in his manner i wont have the fences moved or anything of that kind  nothing shall be done sir that you dont approve ill just manage it all as if i was acting as your ownbailiff son he was going to say but he remembered the fate of his cousin charles just in time to prevent the use of the painful word  i dont want to have anything done said mr amedroz  then nothing shall be done well just mend a fence or two to keep in the cattle and leave other things as they are but perhaps clara will walk out with me all the same  clara was quite ready to walk out and had already tied on her hat and taken her parasol  your father is a little nervous said he as soon as they were beyond hearing of the house  can you wonder at it when you remember all that he has suffered  i dont wonder at it in the least and i dont wonder at his disliking me either  i dont think he dislikes you mr belton  oh but he does of course he does im the heir to the place instead of you it is natural that he should dislike me but ill live it down you see if i dont ill make him so fond of me hell always want to have me here i dont mind a little dislike to begin with  youre a wonderful man mr belton  i wish you wouldnt call me mr belton but of course you must do as you please about that if i can make him call me will i suppose youll call me so too  oh yes then i will  it dont much matter what a person is called does it only one likes to be friendly with ones friends i suppose you dont like my calling you clara  now youve begun you had better go on  i mean to i make it a rule never to go back in the world your father is half sorry that he has agreed about the place but i shant let him off now and ill tell you what in spite of what he says ill have it as different as possible before this time next year why theres lots of timber that ought to come out of the plantation and theres places where the roots want stubbing up horribly these things always pay for themselves if they are properly done any good done in the world always pays clara often remembered those words afterwards when she was thinking of her cousins character any good done in the world always pays  but you mustnt offend my father even though it should do good she said  i understand he answered i wont tread on his toes where do you get your milk and butter  we buy them  from stovey i suppose  yes from mr stovey it goes against the rent  and it ought to go against the grain tooliving in the country and paying for milk ill tell you what ill do ill give you a cow it shall be a little present from me to you he said nothing of the more important present which this would entail upon him in the matter of the grass for the cow but she understood the nature of the arrangement and was anxious to prevent it  oh mr belton i think wed better not attempt that she said  but we will attempt it ive pledged myself to do nothing to oppose your father but ive made no such promise as to you well have a cow before im many days older what a pretty place this is i do like these rocks so much and it is such a comfort to be off the flat  it is pretty  very pretty youve no conception what an ugly place plaistow is the land isnt actual fen now but it was once and its quite flat and there is a great dike twenty feet wide oozing through itjust oozing you know and lots of little dikes at right angles with the big one and the fields are all square and there are no hedgesand hardly a tree to be seen in the place  what a picture you have drawn i should commit suicide if i lived there  not if you had so much to do as i have  and what is the house like  the house is good enoughan oldfashioned manorhouse with high brick chimneys and brick gables tiled all over and large square windows set in stone the house is good enough only it stands in the middle of a farmyard i said there were no trees but there is an avenue  come thats something  it was an old family seat and they used to have avenues in those days but it doesnt lead up to the present hall door it comes sideways up to the farmyard so that the whole thing must have been different once and there must have been a great courtyard in elizabeths time plaistow manor was rather a swell place and belonged to some roman catholics who came to grief and then the howards got it theres a whole history about it only i dont much care about those things  and is it yours now  its between me and my uncle and i pay him rent for his part hes a clergyman you know and he has a living in lincolnshirenot far off  and do you live alone in that big house  theres my sister youve heard of maryhavent you  then clara remembered that there was a miss beltona poor sickly creature with a twisted spine and a hump back as to whose welfare she ought to have made inquiries  oh yes of course said clara i hope shes better than she used to bewhen we heard of her  shell never be better but then she does not become much worse i think she does grow a little weaker shes older than i am you knowtwo years older but you would think she was quite an old woman to look at her then for the next halfhour they talked about mary belton as they visited every corner of the place belton still had an eye to business as he went on talking and clara remarked how many sticks he moved as he went how many stones he kicked on one side and how invariably he noted any defect in the fences but still he talked of his sister swearing that she was as good as gold and at last wiping away the tears from his eyes as he described her maladies and yet i believe she is better off than any of us he said because she is so good clara began to wish that she had called him will from the beginning because she liked him so much he was just the man to have for a cousina true loving cousin stalwart selfconfident with a grain or two of tyranny in his composition as becomes a man in relation to his intimate female relatives and one moreover with whom she could trust herself to be familiar without any danger of lovemaking she saw his character clearly and told herself that she understood it perfectly he was a jewel of a cousin and she must begin to call him will as speedily as possible  at last they came round in their walk to the gate leading into colonel askertons garden and here in the garden close to the gate they found mrs askerton i fancy that she had been watching for them or at any rate watching for clara so that she might know how her friend was carrying herself with her cousin she came at once to the wicket and there she was introduced by clara to mr belton mr belton as he made his bow muttered something awkwardly and seemed to lose his selfpossession for the moment mrs askerton was very gracious to him and she knew well how to be both gracious and ungracious she talked about the scenery and the charms of the old place and the dullness of the people around them and the inexpediency of looking for society in country places till after awhile mr belton was once more at his ease  how is colonel askerton asked clara  hes indoors will you come and see him hes reading a french novel as usual its the only thing he ever does in summer do you ever read french novels mr belton  i read very little at all and when i do i read english  ah youre a man who has a pursuit in life no doubt  i should rather think sothat is if you mean by a pursuit earning my bread a man has not much time for french novels with a thousand acres of land on his hands even if he knew how to read french which i dont  but youre not always at work on your farm  its pretty constant mrs askerton then i shoot and hunt  youre a sportsman  all men living in the country aremore or less  colonel askerton shoots a great deal he has the shooting of belton you know hell be delighted im sure to see you if you are here some time in september but you coming from norfolk would not care for partridgeshooting in somersetshire  i dont see why it shouldnt be as good here as there  colonel askerton thinks he has got a fair head of game upon the place  i dare say game is easily kept if people knew how to set about it  colonel askerton has a very good keeper and has gone to a great deal of expense since he has been here  im my own headkeeper said belton and so i will beor rather should be if i had this place  something in the ladys tone had grated against his feelings and offended him or perhaps he thought that she assumed too many of the airs of proprietorship because the shooting of the place had been let to her husband for thirty pounds ayear  i hope you dont mean to say youll turn us out said mrs askerton laughing  i have no power to turn anybody out or in said he ive got nothing to do with it  clara perceiving that matters were not going quite pleasantly between her old and new friend thought it best to take her departure belton as he went lifted his hat from his head and clara could not keep herself from thinking that he was not only very handsome but that he looked very much like a gentleman in spite of his occupation as a farmer  bybye clara said mrs askerton come down and see me tomorrow theres a dear dont forget what a dull life i have of it clara said that she would come and i shall be so happy to see mr belton if he will call before he leaves you at this belton again raised his hat from his head and muttered some word or two of civility but this his latter muttering was different from the first for he had altogether regained his presence of mind  you didnt seem to get on very well with my friend said clara laughing as soon as they had turned away from the cottage  well nothat is to say not particularly well or particularly badly at first i took her for somebody else i knew slightly ever so long ago and i was thinking of that other person at the time  and what was the other persons name  i cant even remember that at the present moment  mrs askerton was a miss oliphant  that wasnt the other ladys name but independently of that they cant be the same the other lady married a mr berdmore  a mr berdmore clara as she repeated the name felt convinced that she had heard it before and that she had heard it in connection with mrs askerton she certainly had heard the name of berdmore pronounced or had seen it written or had in some shape come across the name in mrs askertons presence or at any rate somewhere on the premises occupied by that lady more than this she could not remember but the name as she had now heard it from her cousin became at once distinctly connected in her memory with her friends at the cottage  yes said belton a mr berdmore i knew more of him than of her though for the matter of that i knew very little of him either she was a fastgoing girl and his friends were very sorry but i think they are both dead or divorced or that they have come to grief in some way  and is mrs askerton like the fastgoing lady  in a certain way not that i remember what the fastgoing lady was like but there was something about this woman that put me in mind of the other vigo was her name now i recollect ita miss vigo its nine or ten years ago now and i was little more than a boy  her name was oliphant  i dont suppose they have anything to do with each other what riled me was the way she talked of the shooting people do when they take a little shooting they pay some trumpery thirty or forty pounds a year and then they seem to think that its almost the same as though they owned the property themselves ive known a man talk of his manor because he had the shooting of a wood and a small farm round it they are generally shopkeepers out of london gin distillers or brewers or people like that  why mr belton i didnt think you could be so furious  cant i when my backs up it is up but it isnt up yet  and i hope it wont be up while you remain in somersetshire  i wont answer for that theres stoveys empty cart standing just where it stood yesterday and he promised hed have it home before three today my back will be up with him if he doesnt mind himself  it was nearly six oclock when they got back to the house and clara was surprised to find that she had been out three hours with her cousin certainly it had been very pleasant the usual companion of her walks when she had a companion was mrs askerton but mrs askerton did not like real walking she would creep about the grounds for an hour or so and even such companionship as that was better to clara than absolute solitude but now she had been carried about the place getting over stiles and through gates and wandering through the copses till she was tired and hungry and excited and happy oh papa she said we have had such a walk  i thought we were to have dined at five he replied in a low wailing voice  no papa indeedindeed you said six  that was for yesterday  you said we were to make it six while mr belton was here  very wellif it must be i suppose it must be  you dont mean on my account said will ill undertake to eat my dinner sir at any hour that youll undertake to give it me if theres a strong point about me at all it is my appetite  clara when she went to her fathers room that evening told him what mr belton had said about the shooting knowing that her fathers feelings would agree with those which had been expressed by her cousin mr amedroz of course made this an occasion for further grumbling suggesting that belton wanted to get the shooting for himself as he had got the farm but nevertheless the effect which clara had intended was produced and before she left him he had absolutely proposed that the shooting and the land should go together  im sure that mr belton doesnt mean that at all said clara  i dont care what he means said the squire  and it wouldnt do to treat colonel askerton in that way said clara  i shall treat him just as i like said the squire     chapter iv  safe against lovemaking   a dear cousin and safe against lovemaking this was claras verdict respecting will belton as she lay thinking of him in bed that night why that warranty against lovemaking should be a virtue in her eyes i cannot perhaps explain but all young ladies are apt to talk to themselves in such phrases about gentlemen with whom they are thrown into chance intimacyas though lovemaking were in itself a thing injurious and antagonistic to happiness instead of being as it is the very salt of life safe against lovemaking and yet mrs askerton her friend had spoken of the probability of such lovemaking as being the great advantage of his coming and there could not be a second opinion as to the expediency of a match between her and her cousin in a worldly point of view clara moreover had already perceived that he was a man fit to guide a wife very goodhumouredand goodtempered also anxious to give pleasure to others a man of energy and forethought who would be sure to do well in the world and hold his head always high among his fellowsas good a husband as a girl could have nevertheless she congratulated herself in that she felt satisfied that he was safe against lovemaking might it be possible that that pressing of hands at taunton had been so tender and those last words spoken with captain aylmer so soft that on his account she felt delighted to think that her cousin was warranted not to make love  and what did will belton think about his cousin insured as he was thus supposed to be against the dangers of love he also lay awake for awhile that night thinking over this new friendship or rather he thought of it walking about his room and looking out at the bright harvest moonfor with him to be in bed was to be asleep he sat himself down and he walked about and he leaned out of the window into the cool night air and he made some comparisons in his mind and certain calculations and he thought of his present home and of his sister and of his future prospects as they were concerned with the old place at which he was now staying and he portrayed to himself in his mind claras head and face and figure and feetand he resolved that she should be his wife he had never seen a girl who seemed to suit him so well though he had only been with her for a day he swore to himself that he knew he could love her nayhe swore to himself that he did love her thenwhen he had quite made up his mind he tumbled into his bed and was asleep in five minutes  miss amedroz was a handsome young woman tall wellmade active and full of health she carried herself as though she thought her limbs were made for use and not simply for ease upon a sofa her head and neck stood well upon her shoulders and her waist showed none of those waspish proportions of which ladies used to be more proud than i believe them to be now in their more advanced state of knowledge and taste there was much about her in which she was like her cousin as though the blood they had in common between them had given to both the same proportions and the same comeliness her hair was of a dark brown colour as was his her eyes were somewhat darker than his and perhaps not so full of constant movement but they were equally bright and possessed that quick power of expressing tenderness which belonged to them her nose was more finely cut as was also her chin and the oval of her face but she had the same large expressive mouth and the same perfection of ivorywhite teeth as has been said before clara amedroz who was now nearly twentysix years of age was not a younglooking young woman to the eyes of many men that would have been her fault but in the eyes of belton it was no fault he had not made himself fastidious as to women by much consort with them and he was disposed to think that she who was to become his wife had better be something more than a girl not long since taken out of the nursery he was well to do in the world and could send his wife out in her carriage with all becoming bravery of appurtenances and he would do so too when he should have a wife but still he would look to his wife to be a useful partner to him she should be a woman not above agricultural solicitude or too proud to have a care for her cows clara he was sure had no false pride and yetas he was sure also she was at every point such a lady as would do honour to the carriage and the bravery when it should be forthcoming and then such a marriage as this would put an end to all the trouble which he felt in reference to the entail on the estate he knew that he was to be master of belton and of course had in that knowledge the satisfaction which men do feel from the consciousness of their future prosperity and this with him was enhanced by a strong sympathy with oldfashioned prejudices as to family he would be belton of belton and there had been beltons of belton in old days for a longer time backwards than he was able to count but still the prospect had not been without its alloy and he had felt real distress at the idea of turning his cousin out of her fathers house such a marriage as that he now contemplated would put all these things right  when he got up in the morning he was quite as keen about it as he had been on the previous eveningand as he thought about it the more he became keener and still more keen on the previous evening as he was leaning out of the window endeavouring to settle in his own mind what would be the proper conduct of the romance of the thing he had considered that he had better not make his proposal quite at once he was to remain eight days at belton and as eight days was not a long period of acquaintance he had reflected that it might be well for him to lay what foundation for love it might be in his power to construct during his present sojourn and then return and complete the work before christmas but as he was shaving himself the habitual impatience of his nature predominated and he became disposed to think that delay would be useless and might perhaps be dangerous it might be possible that clara would be unable to give him a decisive answer so quickly as to enable him to return home an accepted lover but if such doubt were left such doubt would give him an excuse for a speedy return to belton he did not omit to tell himself that very probably he might not succeed at all he was a man not at all apt to feel assurance that he could carry all before him in love but in this matter as in all others which required from him any personal effort he prepared himself to do his best leaving the consequences to follow as they might when he threw his seed corn into the earth with all such due appliances of agricultural skill and industry as his capital and experience enabled him to use he did his part towards the production of next years crop and after that he must leave it to a higher power to give to him or to withhold from him the reward of his labour he had found that as a rule the reward had been given when the labour had been honest and he was now prepared to follow the same plan with the same hopes in this matter of his lovemaking  after much considerationvery much consideration a consideration which took him the whole time that he was brushing his hair and washing his teethhe resolved that he would in the first instance speak to mr amedroz not that he intended that the father should win the daughter for him he had an idea that he would like to do that work for himself but he thought that the old squire would be better pleased if his consent were asked in the first instance the present day was sunday and he would not speak on the subject till monday this day he would devote to the work of securing his future fatherinlaws good opinion to thatand to his prayers  and he had gained very much upon mr amedroz before the evening of the day was over he was a man before whom difficulties seemed to yield and who had his own way simply because he had become accustomed to ask for itto ask for it and to work for it he had so softened the squires tone of thought towards him that the future stocking of the land was spoken of between them with something like energy on both sides and mr amedroz had given his consent without any difficulty to the building of a shed for winter stallfeeding clara sat by listening and perceived that will belton would soon be allowed to do just what he pleased with the place her father talked as she had not heard him talk since her poor brothers death and was quite animated on the subject of woodcraft we dont know much about timber down where i am said will just because weve got no trees  ill show you your way said the old man ive managed the timber on the estate myself for the last forty years will belton of course did not say a word as to the gross mismanagement which had been apparent even to him what a cousin he was clara thoughtwhat a paragon among cousins and then he was so manifestly safe against lovemaking so safe that he only cared to talk about timber and oxen and fences and winterforage but it was all just as it ought to be and if her father did not call him will before long she herself would set the way by doing so first a very paragon among cousins  what a flatterer you are she said to him that night  a flatterer i  yes you you have flattered papa out of all his animosity already i shall be jealous soon for hell think more of you than of me  i hope hell come to think of us as being nearly equally near to him said belton with a tone that was half serious and half tender now that he had made up his mind he could not keep his hand from the work before him an instant but clara had also made up her mind and would not be made to think that her cousin could mean anything that was more than cousinly  upon my word she said laughing that is very cool on your part  i came here determined to be friends with him at any rate  and you did so without any thought of me but you said you would be my brother and i shall not forget your promise indeed indeed i cannot tell you how glad i am that you have comeboth for papas sake and my own you have done him so much good that i only dread to think that you are going so soon  ill be back before long i think nothing of running across here from norfolk youll see enough of me before next summer  soon after breakfast on the next morning he got mr amedroz out into the grounds on the plea of showing him the proposed site for the cattle shed but not a word was said about the shed on that occasion he went to work at his other task at once and when that was well on hand the squire was quite unfitted for the consideration of any less important matter however able to discuss it belton might have been himself  ive got something particular that i want to say to you sir belton began  now mr amedroz was of opinion that his cousin had been saying something very particular ever since his arrival and was rather frightened at this immediate prospect of a new subject  theres nothing wrong is there  no nothing wrongat least i hope its not wrong would not it be a good plan sir if i were to marry my cousin clara  what a terrible young man mr amedroz felt that his breath was so completely taken away from him that he was quite unable to speak a word of answer at the moment indeed he was unable to move and stood still where he had been fixed by the cruel suddenness of the proposition made to him  of course i know nothing of what she may think about it continued belton i thought it best to come to you before i spoke a word to her and i know that in many ways she is above me she is better educated and reads more and all that sort of thing and it may be that shed rather marry a london man than a fellow who passes all his time in the country but she couldnt get one who would love her better or treat her more kindly and then as to the property you must own it would be a good arrangement youd like to know it would go to your own child and your own grandchildwouldnt you sir and im not badly off without looking to this place at all and could give her everything she wants but then i dont know that shed care to marry a farmer these last words he said in a melancholy tone as though aware that he was confessing his own disgrace  the squire had listened to it all and had not as yet said a word and now when belton ceased he did not know what word to speak he was a man whose thoughts about women were chivalrous and perhaps a little oldfashioned of course when a man contemplates marriage he could do nothing better nothing more honourable than consult the ladys father in the first instance but he felt that even a father should be addressed on such a subject with great delicacy there should be ambages in such a matter the man who resolved to commit himself to such a task should come forward with apparent difficultywith great diffidence and even with actual difficulty he should keep himself almost hidden as behind a mask and should tell of his own ambition with doubtful quivering voice and the ambages should take time he should approach the citadel to be taken with covered waysworking his way slowly and painfully but this young man before he had been in the house three days said all that he had to say without the slightest quaver in his voice and evidently expected to get an answer about the squires daughter as quickly as he had got it about the squires land  you have surprised me very much said the old man at last drawing his breath  im quite in earnest about it clara seems to me to be the very girl to make a good wife to such a one as i am shes got everything that a woman ought to haveby george she has  she is a good girl mr belton  she is as good as gold every inch of her  but you have not known her very long mr belton  quite long enough for my purposes you see i knew all about her beforehandwho she is and where she comes from theres a great deal in that you know  mr amedroz shuddered at the expressions used it was grievous to him to hear his daughter spoken of as one respecting whom some one knew who she was and whence she came such knowledge respecting the daughter of such a family was as a matter of course common to all polite persons yes said mr amedroz stiffly you know as much as that about her certainly  and she knows as much about me now the question is whether you have any objection to make  really mr belton you have taken me so much by surprise that i do not feel myself competent to answer you at once  shall we say in an hours time sir an hours time mr amedroz if he could have been left to his own guidance would have thought a month very little for such a work  i suppose you would wish me to see clara first said mr amedroz  oh dear no i would much rather ask her myselfif only i could get your consent to my doing so  and you have said nothing to her  not a word  i am glad of that you would have behaved badly i think had you done so while staying under my roof  i thought it best at any rate to come to you first but as i must be back at plaistow on this day week i havent much time to lose so if you could think about it this afternoon you know  mr amedroz much bewildered promised that he would do his best and eventually did bring himself to give an answer on the next morning i have been thinking about this all night said mr amedroz  im sure im very much obliged to you said belton feeling rather ashamed of his own remissness as he remembered how soundly he had himself slept  if you are quite sure of yourself  do you mean sure of loving her i am as sure of that as anything  but men are so apt to change their fancies  i dont know much about my fancies but i dont often change my purpose when im in earnest in such a matter as this i couldnt change ill say as much as that for myself though it may seem bold  of course in regard to money such a marriage would be advantageous to my child i dont know whether you know it but i shall have nothing to give herliterally nothing  all the better sir as far as i am concerned im not one who wants to be saved from working by a wifes fortune  but most men like to get something when they marry  i want to get nothingnothing that is in the way of money if clara becomes my wife ill never ask you for one shilling  i hope her aunt will do something for her this the old man said in a wailing voice as though the expression of such a hope was grievous to him  if she becomes my wife mrs winterfield will be quite at liberty to leave her money elsewhere there were old causes of dislike between mr belton and mrs winterfield and even now mrs winterfield was almost offended because mr belton was staying at belton castle  but all that is quite uncertain continued mr amedroz  and i have your leave to speak to clara myself  well mr belton yes i think so i do not see why you should not speak to her but i fear you are a little too precipitate clara has known you so very short a time that you can hardly have a right to hope that she should learn to regard you at once as you would have her do as he heard this beltons face became long and melancholy he had taught himself to think that he could dispense with that delay till christmas which he had at first proposed to himself and that he might walk into the arena at once and perhaps win the battle in the first round three days is such a very short time said the squire  it is short certainly said belton  the fathers leave was however given and armed with that belton was resolved that he would take at any rate some preliminary steps in lovemaking before he returned to plaistow what would be the nature of the preliminary steps taken by such a one as him the reader by this time will probably be able to surmise     chapter v  not safe against lovemaking   why dont you call him will clara said to her father this question was asked on the evening of that monday on which mr amedroz had given his consent as to the marriage proposal  call him will why should i  you used to do so when he was a boy  of course i did but that is years ago he would think it impertinent now  indeed he would not he would like it he has told me so it sounds so cold to him to be called mr belton by his relations  the father looked at his daughter as though for a moment he almost suspected that matters had really been arranged between her and her future lover without his concurrence and before his sanction had been obtained but if for a moment such a thought did cross his mind it did not dwell there he trusted belton but as to his daughter he knew that he might be sure of her it would be impossible with her to keep such a secret from him even for half a day and yet how odd it was here was a man who in three days had fallen in love with his daughter and here was his daughter apparently quite as ready to be in love with the man how could she who was ordinarily circumspect and almost cold in her demeanour towards strangerswho was from circumstances and from her own disposition altogether hostile to flirting intimacieshow could his clara have changed her nature so speedily the squire did not understand it but was prepared to believe that it was all for the best ill call him will if you like it said he  do papa and then i can do so also he is such a good fellow and i am so fond of him  on the next morning mr amedroz did with much awkwardness call his guest by his christian name clara caught her cousins eye and smiled and he also smiled at that moment he was more in love than ever could anything be more charming than this immediately after breakfast he was going over to redicote to see a builder in a small way who lived there and whom he proposed to employ in putting up the shed for the cattle but he almost begrudged the time so anxious was he to begin his suit but his plan had been laid out and he would follow it i think i shall be back by three oclock he said to clara and then well have our walk  ill be ready and you can call for me at mrs askertons i must go down there and it will save you something in your walk to pick me up at the cottage and so the arrangements for the day were made  clara had promised that she would soon call at the cottage and was indeed rather anxious to see mrs askerton on her own account what she had heard from her cousin as to a certain miss vigo of old days had interested her and also what she had heard of a certain mr berdmore it had been evident to her that her cousin had thought little about it the likeness of the lady he then saw to the lady he had before known had at first struck him but when he found that the two ladies were not represented by one and the same person he was satisfied and there was an end of the matter for him but it was not so with clara her feminine mind dwelt on the matter with more earnestness than he had cared to entertain and her clearer intellect saw possibilities which did not occur to him but it was not till she found herself walking across the park to the cottage that she remembered that any inquiries as to her past life might be disagreeable to mrs askerton she had thought of asking her friend plainly whether the names of vigo and berdmore had ever been familiar to her but she reminded herself that there had been rumours afloat and that there might be a mystery mrs askerton would sometimes talk of her early life but she would do this with dreamy indistinct language speaking of the sorrows of her girlhood but not specifying their exact nature seldom mentioning any names and never referring with clear personality to those who had been nearest to her when she had been a child clara had seen her friends maiden name mary oliphant written in a book and seeing it had alluded to it on that occasion mrs askerton had spoken of herself as having been an oliphant and thus clara had come to know the fact but now as she made her way to the cottage she remembered that she had learned nothing more than this as to mrs askertons early life such being the case she hardly knew how to ask any question about the two names that had been mentioned and yet why should she not ask such a question why should she doubt mrs askerton and if she did doubt why should not her doubts be solved  she found colonel askerton and his wife together and she certainly would ask no such question in his presence he was a slight built wiry man about fifty with irongrey hair and beardwho seemed to have no trouble in life and to desire but few pleasures nothing could be more regular than the course of his days and nothing more idle he breakfasted at eleven smoked and read till the afternoon when he rode for an hour or two then he dined read again smoked again and went to bed in september and october he shot and twice in the year as has been before stated went away to seek a little excitement elsewhere he seemed to be quite contented with his lot and was never heard to speak an angry word to any one nobody cared for him much but then he troubled himself with no ones affairs he never went to church and had not eaten or drank in any house but his own since he had come to belton  oh clara you naughty girl said mrs askerton why didnt you come yesterday i was expecting you all day  i was busy really weve grown to be quite industrious people since my cousin came  they tell me hes taking the land into his own hands said the colonel  yes indeed and he is going to build sheds and buy cattle and i dont know what he doesnt mean to do so that we shall be alive again  i hope he wont want my shooting  he has shooting of his own in norfolk said clara  then hell hardly care to come here for that purpose when i heard of his proceedings i began to be afraid  i dont think he would do anything to annoy you for the world said clara enthusiastically hes the most unselfish person i ever met  hed have a perfect right to take the shooting if he liked itthat is always supposing that he and your father agreed about it  they agree about everything now he has altogether disarmed papas prejudices and it seems to be recognised that he is to have his own way about the place but i dont think hell interfere about the shooting  he wont my dear if you ask him not said mrs askerton  ill ask him in a moment if colonel askerton wishes it  oh dear no said he it would be teaching the ostler to grease the horses teeth perhaps he hasnt thought of it  he thinks of everything said clara  i wonder whether hes thinking of so far mrs askerton spoke and then she paused colonel askerton looked up at clara with an illnatured smile and clara felt that she blushed was it not cruel that she could not say a word in favour of a friend and a cousina cousin who had promised to be a brother to her without being treated with such words and such looks as these but she was determined not to be put down im quite sure of this she said that my cousin would do nothing unfair or ungentlemanlike  there would be nothing unfair or ungentlemanlike in it i shouldnt take it amiss at allbut i should simply take up my bed and walk pray tell him that i hope i shall have the pleasure of seeing him before he goes i did call yesterday but he was out  hell be here soon hes to come here for me but colonel askertons horse was brought to the door and he could not therefore wait to make mr beltons acquaintance on that occasion  what a phoenix this cousin of yours is said mrs askerton as soon as her husband was gone  he is a splendid fellowhe is indeed theres so much life about him hes always doing something he says that doing good will always pay in the long run isnt that a fine doctrine  quite a practical phoenix  it has done papa so much good at this moment hes out somewhere thinking of what is going on instead of moping in the house he couldnt bear the idea of wills coming and now he is already beginning to complain because hes going away  will indeed  and why not will hes my cousin  yesten times removed but so much the better if hes to be anything more than a cousin  he is to be nothing more mrs askerton  youre quite sure of that  i am quite sure of it and i cannot understand why there should be such a suspicion because he and i are thrown closely together and are fond of each other whether he is a sixth eighth or tenth cousin makes no difference he is the nearest i have on that side and since my poor brothers death he is papas heir it is so natural that he should be my friendand such a comfort that he should be such a friend as he is i own it seems cruel to me that under such circumstances there should be any suspicion  suspicion my dearsuspicion of what  not that i care for it i am prepared to love him as if he were my brother i think him one of the finest creatures i ever knewperhaps the finest i ever did know his energy and goodnature together are just the qualities to make the best kind of man i am proud of him as my friend and my cousin and now you may suspect what you please  but my dear why should not he fall in love with you it would be the most proper and also the most convenient thing in the world  i hate talking of falling in loveas though a woman has nothing else to think of whenever she sees a man  a woman has nothing else to think of  i havea great deal else and so has he  its quite out of the question on his part then  quite out of the question im sure he likes me i can see it in his face and hear it in his voice and am so happy that it is so but it isnt in the way that you mean heaven knows that i may want a friend some of these days and i feel that i may trust to him his feelings to me will be always those of a brother  perhaps so i have seen that fraternal love before under similar circumstances and it has always ended in the same way  i hope it wont end in any way between us  but the joke is that this suspicion as you call itwhich makes you so indignantis simply a suggestion that a thing should happen which of all things in the world would be the best for both of you  but the thing wont happen and therefore let there be an end of it i hate the twaddle talk of love whether its about myself or about any one else it makes me feel ashamed of my sex when i find that i cannot talk of myself to another woman without being supposed to be either in love or thinking of loveeither looking for it or avoiding it when it comes if it comes prosperously its a very good thing but i for one can do without it and i feel myself injured when such a state of things is presumed to be impossible  it is worth any ones while to irritate you because your indignation is so beautiful  it is not beautiful to me for i always feel ashamed afterwards of my own energy and now if you please we wont say anything more about mr will belton  may i not talk about him even as the enterprising cousin  certainly and in any other light you please do you know he seemed to think that he had known you ever so many years ago clara as she said this did not look direct at her friends face but still she could perceive that mrs askerton was disconcerted there came a shade of paleness over her face and a look of trouble on her brow and for a moment or two she made no reply  did he she then said and when was that  i suppose it was in london but after all i believe it was not you but somebody whom he remembers to have been like you he says that the lady was a miss vigo as she pronounced the name clara turned her face away feeling instinctively that it would be kind to do so  miss vigo said mrs askerton at once and there was that in the tone of her voice which made clara feel that all was not right with her i remember that there were miss vigos two of them i think i didnt know that they were like me especially  and he says that the one he remembers married a mr berdmore  married a mr berdmore the tone of voice was still the same and there was an evident struggle as though the woman was making a vehement effort to speak in her natural voice then clara looked at her feeling that if she abstained from doing so the very fact of her so abstaining would be remarkable there was the look of pain on mrs askertons brow and her cheeks were still pale but she smiled as she went on speaking im sure im flattered for i remember that they were both considered beauties did he know anything more of her  no nothing more  there must have been some casual likeness i suppose mrs askerton was a clever woman and had by this time almost recovered her selfpossession then there came a ring at the front door and in another minute mr belton was in the room mrs askerton felt that it was imperative on her to make some allusion to the conversation which had just taken place and dashed at the subject at once clara tells me that i am exactly like some old friend of yours mr belton  then he looked at her closely as he answered her i have no right to say that she was my friend mrs askerton he said indeed there was hardly what might be called an acquaintance between us but you certainly are extremely like a certain miss vigo that i remember  i often wonder that one person isnt more often found to be like another said mrs askerton  people often are like said he but not like in such a way as to give rise to mistakes as to identity now i should have stopped you in the street and called you mrs berdmore  didnt i once see or hear the name of berdmore in this house asked clara  then that look of pain returned mrs askerton had succeeded in recovering the usual tone of her countenance but now she was once more disturbed i think i know the name said she  i fancy that i have seen it in this house said clara  you may more likely have heard it my dear my memory is very poor but if i remember rightly colonel askerton did know a captain berdmorea long while ago before he was married and you may probably have heard him mention the name this did not quite satisfy clara but she said nothing more about it then if there was a mystery which mrs askerton did not wish to have explored why should she explore it  soon after this clara got up to go and mrs askerton making another attempt to be cheerful was almost successful so youre going back into norfolk on saturday clara tells me you are making a very short visit now that youre come among us  it is a long time for me to be away from home farmers can hardly ever dare to leave their work but in spite of my farm i am talking of coming here again about christmas  but you are going to have a farming establishment here too  that will be nothing clara will look after that for me will you not then they went and belton had to consider how he would begin the work before him he had some idea that too much precipitancy might do him an injury but he hardly knew how to commence without coming to the point at once when they were out together in the park he went back at first to the subject of mrs askerton  i would almost have sworn they were one and the same woman he said  but you see that they are not  its not only the likeness but the voice it so chanced that i once saw that miss vigo in some trouble i happened to meet her in company with a man who waswho was tipsy in fact and i had to relieve her  dear mehow disagreeable  its a long time ago and there cant be any harm in mentioning it now it was the man she was going to marry and whom she did marry  whatthe mr berdmore  yes he was often in that way and there was a look about mrs askerton just now so like the look of that miss vigo then that i cannot get rid of the idea  they cant be the same as she was certainly a miss oliphant and you hear too what she says  yesi heard what she said you have known her long  these two years  and intimately  very intimately she is our only neighbour and her being here has certainly been a great comfort to me it is sad not having some woman near one that one can speak toand then i really do like her very much  no doubt its all right  yes its all right said clara after that there was nothing more said about mrs askerton and belton began his work they had gone from the cottage across the park away from the house up to a high rock which stood boldly out of the ground from whence could be seen the sea on one side and on the other a far tract of country almost away to the moors and when they reached this spot they seated themselves there said clara i consider this to be the prettiest spot in england  i havent seen all england said belton  dont be so matteroffact will i say its the prettiest in england and you cant contradict me  and i say youre the prettiest girl in england and you cant contradict me  this annoyed clara and almost made her feel that her paragon of a cousin was not quite so perfect as she had represented him to be i see she said that if i talk nonsense im to be punished  is it a punishment to you to know that i think you very handsome he said turning round and looking full into her face  it is disagreeable to mevery to have any such subject talked about at all what would you think if i began to pay you foolish personal compliments  what i say isnt foolish and theres a great difference clara i love you better than all the world put together  she now looked at him but still she did not believe it it could not be that after all her boastings she should have made so gross a blunder i hope you do love me she said indeed you are bound to do so for you promised that you would be my brother  but that will not satisfy me now clara clara i want to be your husband  will she exclaimed  now you know it all and if i have been too sudden i must beg your pardon  oh will forget that you have said this do not go on until everything must be over between us  why should anything be over between us why should it be wrong in me to love you  what will papa say  mr amedroz knows all about it already and has given me his consent i asked him directly i had made up my own mind and he told me that i might go to you  you have asked papa oh dear oh dear what am i to do  am i so odious to you then as he said this he got up from his seat and stood before her he was a tall wellbuilt handsome man and he could assume a look and mien that were almost noble when he was moved as he was moved now  odious do you not know that i have loved you as my cousinthat i have already learned to trust you as though you were really my brother but this breaks it all  you cannot love me then as my wife  no she pronounced the monosyllable alone and then he walked away from her as though that one little word settled the question for him now and for ever he walked away from her perhaps a distance of two hundred yards as though the interview was over and he were leaving her she as she saw him go wished that he would return that she might say some word of comfort to him not that she could have said the only word that would have comforted him at the first blush of the thing at the first sound of the address which he had made to her she had been angry with him he had disappointed her and she was indignant but her anger had already melted and turned itself to ruth she could not but love him better in that he had loved her so well but yet she could not love him with the love which he desired  but he did not leave her when he had gone from her down the hill the distance that has been named he turned back and came up to her slowly he had a trick of standing and walking with his thumbs fixed into the armholes of his waistcoat while his large hands rested on his breast he would always assume this attitude when he was assured that he was right in his views and was eager to carry some point at issue clara already understood that this attitude signified his intention to be autocratic he now came close up to her and again stood over her before he spoke my dear he said i have been rough and hasty in what i have said to you and i have to ask you to pardon my want of manners  no no no she exclaimed  but in a matter of so much interest to us both you will not let an awkward manner prejudice me  it is not that indeed it is not  listen to me dearest it is true that i promised to be your brother and i will not break my word unless i break it by your own sanction i did promise to be your brother but i did not know then how fondly i should come to love you your father when i told him of this bade me not to be hasty but i am hasty and i havent known how to wait tell me that i may come at christmas for my answer and i will not say a word to trouble you till then i will be your brother at any rate till christmas  be my brother always  a black cloud crossed his brow as this request reached his ears she was looking anxiously into his face watching every turn in the expression of his countenance will you not let it wait till christmas he asked  she thought it would be cruel to refuse this request and yet she knew that no such waiting could be of service to him he had been awkward in his lovemaking and was aware of it he should have contrived this period of waiting for himself giving her no option but to wait and think of it he should have made no proposal but have left her certain that such proposal was coming in such case she must have waitedand if good could have come to him from that he might have received it but as the question was now presented to her it was impossible that she should consent to wait to have given such consent would have been tantamount to receiving him as her lover she was therefore forced to be cruel  it will be of no avail to postpone my answer when i know what it must be why should there be suspense  you mean that it is impossible that you should love me  not in that way will  and why not then there was a pause but i am a fool to ask such a question as that and i should be worse than a fool were i to press it it must then be considered as settled  she got up and clung to his arm oh will do not look at me like that  it must then be considered as settled he repeated  yes will yes pray consider it as settled he then sat down on the rock again and she came and sat by himnear to him but not close as she had been before she turned her eyes upon him gazing on him but did not speak to him and he sat also without speaking for a while with his eyes fixed upon the ground i suppose we may go back to the house he said at last  give me your hand will and tell me that you will still love meas your sister  he gave her his hand if you ever want a brothers care you shall have it from me he said  but not a brothers love  no how can the two go together i shant cease to love you because my love is in vain instead of making me happy it will make me wretched that will be the only difference  i would give my life to make you happy if that were possible  you will not give me your life in the way that i would have it after that they walked in silence back to the house and when he had opened the front door for her he parted from her and stood alone under the porch thinking of his misfortune     chapter vi  safe against lovemaking once again   for a considerable time belton stood under the porch of the house thinking of what had happened to him and endeavouring to steady himself under the blow which he had received i do not know that he had been sanguine of success probably he had made to himself no assurances on the subject but he was a man to whom failure of itself was intolerable in any other event of life he would have told himself that he would not failthat he would persevere and conquer he could imagine no other position as to which he could at once have been assured of failure in any project on which he had set his heart but as to this project it was so he had been told that she could not love himthat she could never love himand he had believed her he had made his attempt and had failed and as he thought of this standing under the porch he became convinced that life for him was altogether changed and that he who had been so happy must now be a wretched man  he was still standing there when mr amedroz came down into the hall dressed for dinner and saw his figure through the open doors will he said coming up to him it only wants five minutes to dinner belton started and shook himself as though he were shaking off a lethargy and declared that he was quite ready then he remembered that he would be expected to dress and rushed upstairs three steps at a time to his own room when he came down clara and her father were already in the diningroom and he joined them there  mr amedroz though he was not very quick in reading facts from the manners of those with whom he lived had felt assured that things had gone wrong between belton and his daughter he had not as yet had a minute in which to speak to clara but he was certain that it was so indeed it was impossible not to read terrible disappointment and deep grief in the young mans manner he made no attempt to conceal it though he did not speak of it through the whole evening though he was alone for a while with the squire and alone also for a time with clara he never mentioned or alluded to the subject of his rejection but he bore himself as though he knew and they knewas though all the world knew that he had been rejected and yet he did not remain silent he talked of his property and of his plans and explained how things were to be done in his absence once only was there something like an allusion made to his sorrow but you will be here at christmas said mr amedroz in answer to something which belton had said as to work to be done in his absence i do not know how that may be now said belton and then they had all been silent  it was a terrible evening to clara she endeavoured to talk but found it to be impossible all the brightness of the last few days had disappeared and the world seemed to her to be more sad and solemn than ever she had no idea when she was refusing him that he would have taken it to heart as he had done the question had come before her for decision so suddenly that she had not in fact had time to think of this as she was making her answer all she had done was to feel that she could not be to him what he wished her to be and even as yet she had hardly asked herself why she must be so steadfast in her refusal but she had refused him steadfastly and she did not for a moment think of reducing the earnestness of her resolution it seemed to be manifest to her from his present manner that he would never ask the question again but she was sure let it be asked ever so often that it could not be answered in any other way  mr amedroz not knowing why it was so became cross and querulous and scolded his daughter to belton also he was captious making little difficulties and answering him with petulance this the rejected lover took with most extreme patience as though such a trifling annoyance had no effect in adding anything to his misery he still held his purpose of going on the saturday and was still intent on work which was to be done before he went but it seemed that he was satisfied to do everything now as a duty and that the enjoyment of the thing which had heretofore been so conspicuous was over  at last they separated and clara as was her wont went up to her fathers room papa she said what is all this about mr belton  all what my dear what do you mean  he has asked me to beto be his wife and has told me that he came with your consent  and why shouldnt he have my consent what is there amiss with him why shouldnt you marry him if he likes you you seemed i thought to be very fond of him  this surprised clara more than anything she could hardly have told herself why but she would have thought that such a proposition from her cousin would have made her father angryunreasonably angryangry with him for presuming to have such an idea but now it seemed that he was going to be angry with her for not accepting her cousin out of hand  yes papa i am fond of him but not like that i did not expect that he would think of me in that way  but why shouldnt he think of you it would be a very good marriage for you as far as money is concerned  you would not have me marry any one for that reasonwould you papa  but you seemed to like him well of course i cant make you like him i meant to do for the best and when he came to me as he did i thought he was behaving very handsomely and very much like a gentleman  i am sure he would do that  and if i could have thought that this place would be your home when i am gone it would have made me very happyvery happy  she now came and stood close to him and took his hand i hope papa you do not make yourself uneasy about me i shall do very well im sure you cant want me to go away and leave you  how will you do very well im sure i dont know and if your aunt winterfield means to provide for you it would only be kind in her to let me know it so that i might not have the anxiety always on my mind  clara knew well enough what was to be the disposition of her aunts property but she could not tell her father of that now she almost felt that it was her duty to do so but she could not bring herself to do it she could only beg him not to be anxious on her behalf making vague assurances that she would do very well and you are determined not to change your mind about will he said at last  i shall not change my mind about that papa certainly she answered then he turned away from her and she saw that he was displeased  when alone she was forced to ask herself why it was that she was so certain alas there could in truth be no doubt on that subject in her own mind when she sat down resolved to give herself an answer there was no doubt she could not love her cousin will belton because her heart belonged to captain aylmer  but she knew that she had received nothing in exchange for her heart he had been kind to her on that journey to taunton when the agony arising from her brothers death had almost crushed her he had often been kind to her on days before thatso kind so soft in his manners approaching so nearly to the little tendernesses of incipient lovemaking that the idea of regarding him as her lover had of necessity forced itself upon her but in nothing had he gone beyond those tendernesses which need not imperatively be made to mean anything though they do often mean so much it was now two years since she had first thought that captain aylmer was the most perfect gentleman she knew and nearly two years since mrs winterfield had expressed to her a hope that captain aylmer might become her husband she had replied that such a thing was impossibleas any girl would have replied and had in consequence treated captain aylmer with all the coolness which she had been able to assume whenever she was in company with him in her aunts presence nor was it natural to her to be specially gracious to a man under such trying circumstances even when no mrs winterfield was there to behold and so things had gone on captain aylmer had now and again made himself very pleasant to herat certain trying periods of joy or trouble almost more than pleasant but nothing had come of it and clara had told herself that captain aylmer had no special feeling in her favour she had told herself this ever since that journey together from perivale to taunton but never till now had she also confessed to herself what was her own case  she made a comparison between the two men her cousin will was she thought the more generous the more energeticperhaps by nature the man of the higher gifts in person he was undoubtedly the superior he was full of noble qualitiesforgetful of self industrious full of resources a very man of men able to command eager in doing work for others good and his owna man altogether uncontaminated by the coldness and selfishness of the outer world but he was rough awkward but indifferently educated and with few of those tastes which to clara amedroz were delightful he could not read poetry to her he could not tell her of what the world of literature was doing now or of what it had done in times past he knew nothing of the inner world of worlds which governs the world she doubted whether he could have told her who composed the existing cabinet or have given the name of a single bishop beyond the see in which his own parish was situated but captain aylmer knew everybody and had read everything and understood as though by instinct all the movements of the world in which he lived  but what mattered any such comparison even though she should be able to prove to herself beyond the shadow of a doubt that her cousin will was of the two the fitter to be lovedthe one more worthy of her heartno such proof could alter her position love does not go by worth she did not love her cousin as she must love any man to whom she could give her handand alas she did love that other man  on this night i doubt whether belton did slumber with that solidity of repose which was usual to him at any rate before he came down in the morning he had found time for sufficient thought and had brought himself to a resolution he would not give up the battle as lost to his thinking there was something weak and almost mean in abandoning any project which he had set before himself he had been awkward and he exaggerated to himself his own awkwardness he had been hasty and had gone about his task with inconsiderate precipitancy it might be that he had thus destroyed all his chance of success but as he said to himself he would never say die as long as there was a puff of breath left to him he would not mope and hang down his head and wear the willow such a state of things would ill suit either the roughness or the readiness of his life no he would bear like a man the disappointment which had on this occasion befallen him and would return at christmas and once more try his fortune  at breakfast therefore the cloud had passed from his brow when he came in he found clara alone in the room and he simply shook hands with her after his ordinary fashion he said nothing of yesterday and almost succeeded in looking as though yesterday had been in no wise memorable she was not so much at her ease but she also received some comfort from his demeanour mr amedroz came down almost immediately and belton soon took an opportunity of saying that he would be back at christmas if mr amedroz would receive him  certainly said the squire i thought it had been all settled  so it wastill i said a word yesterday which foolishly seemed to unsettle it but i have thought it over again and i find that i can manage it  we shall be so glad to have you said clara  and i shall be equally glad to come they are already at work sir about the sheds  yes i saw the carts full of bricks go by said the squire querulously i didnt know there was to be any brickwork you said you would have it made of deal slabs with oak posts  you must have a foundation sir i propose to carry the brickwork a foot and a half above the ground  i suppose you know best only that kind of thing is so very ugly  if you find it to be ugly after it is done it shall be pulled down again  noit can never come down again  it canand it shall if you dont like it i never think anything of changes like that  i think theyll be very pretty said clara  i dare say said the squire but at any rate it wont make much difference to me i shant be here long to see them  this was rather melancholy but belton bore up even against this speaking cheery words and expressing bright hopesso that it seemed both to clara and to her father that he had in a great measure overcome the disappointment of the preceding day it was probable that he was a man not prone to be deeply sensitive in such matters for any long period the period now had certainly not been long and yet will belton was alive again  immediately after breakfast there occurred a little incident which was not without its effect upon them all there came up on the drive immediately before the front door under the custody of a boy a cow it was an alderney cow and any man or woman at all understanding cows would at once have perceived that this cow was perfect in her kind her eyes were mild and soft and bright her legs were like the legs of a deer and in her whole gait and demeanour she almost gave the lie to her own name asserting herself to have sprung from some more noble origin among the woods than may be supposed to be the origin of the ordinary domestic cowa useful animal but heavy in its appearance and seen with more pleasure at some little distance than at close quarters but this cow was graceful in its movements and almost tempted one to regard her as the faroff descendant of the elk or the antelope  whats that said mr amedroz who having no cows of his own was not pleased to see one brought up in that way before his hall door theres somebodys cow come here  clara understood it in a moment but she was pained and said nothing had the cow come without any such scene as that of yesterday she would have welcomed the animal with all cordiality and would have sworn to her cousin that the cow should be cherished for his sake but after what had passed it was different how was she to take any present from him now  but belton faced the difficulty without any bashfulness or apparent regret i told you i would give you a cow said he and here she is  what can she want with a cow said mr amedroz  i am sure she wants one very much at any rate she wont refuse the present from me will you clara  what could she say not if papa will allow me to keep it  but weve no place to put it said the squire we havent got grass for it  theres plenty of grass said belton come mr amedroz ive made a point of getting this little creature for clara and you mustnt stand in the way of my gratification of course he was successful and of course clara thanked him with tears in her eyes  the next two days passed by without anything special to mark them and then the cousin was to go during the period of his visit he did not see colonel askerton nor did he again see mrs askerton he went to the cottage once with the special object of returning the colonels call but the master was out and he was not specially invited in to see the mistress he said nothing more to clara about her friends but he thought of the matter more than once as he was going about the place and became aware that he would like to ascertain whether there was a mystery and if so what was its nature he knew that he did not like mrs askerton and he felt also that mrs askerton did not like him this was as he thought unfortunate for might it not be the case that in the one matter which was to him of so much importance mrs askerton might have considerable influence over clara  during these days nothing special was said between him and clara the last evening passed over without anything to brighten it or to make it memorable mr amedroz in his passive but gently querulous way was sorry that belton was going to leave him as his cousin had been the creation of some new excitement for him but he said nothing on the subject and when the time for going to bed had come he bade his guest farewell with some languid allusion to the pleasure which he would have in seeing him again at christmas belton was to start very early in the morningbefore six and of course he was prepared to take leave also of clara but she told him very gently so gently that her father did not hear it that she would be up to give him a cup of coffee before he went  oh no he said  but i shall i wont have you go without seeing you out of the door  and on the following morning she was up before him she hardly understood herself why she was doing this she knew that it should be her object to avoid any further special conversation on that subject which they had discussed up among the rocks she knew that she could give him no comfort and that he could give none to her it would seem that he was willing to let the remembrance of the scene pass away so that it should be as though it had never been and surely it was not for her to disturb so salutary an arrangement but yet she was up to bid him godspeed as he went she could not bearso she excused the matter to herselfshe could not bear to think that he should regard her as ungrateful she knew all that he had done for them she had perceived that the taking of the land the building of the sheds the life which he had contrived in so short a time to throw into the old place had all come from a desire on his part to do good to those in whose way he stood by family arrangements made almost before his birth and she longed to say to him one word of thanks and had he not told heronce in the heat of his disappointment for then at that moment as clara said to herself she supposed that he must have been in some measure disappointedhad he not even then told her that when she wanted a brothers care a brothers care should be given to her by him was she not therefore bound to do for him what she would do for a brother  she with her own hands brought the coffee into the little breakfast parlour and handed the cup into his hands the gig which had come overnight from taunton was not yet at the door and there was a minute or two during which they must speak to each other who has not seen some such girl when she has come down early without the full completeness of her morning toilet and yet nicer fresher prettier to the eye of him who is so favoured than she has ever been in more formal attire and what man who has been so favoured has not loved her who has so favoured him even though he may not previously have been enamoured as deeply as poor will belton  this is so good of you he said  i wish i knew how to be good to you she answerednot meaning to trench upon dangerous ground but feeling as the words came from her that she had done so you have been so good to us so very good to papa that we owe you everything i am so grateful to you for saying that you will come back at christmas  he had resolved that he would refrain from further lovemaking till the winter but he found it very hard to refrain when so addressed to take her in his arms and kiss her twenty times and swear that he would never let her goto claim her at once savagely as his own that was the line of conduct to which temptation prompted him how could she look at him so sweetly how could she stand before him ministering to him with all her pretty maidenly charms brought so close to him without intending that he should love her but he did refrain blood is thicker than water said he thats the real reason why i first came  i understand that quite and it is that feeling that makes you so good but im afraid you are spending a great deal of money hereand all for our sakes  not at all i shall get my money back again and if i didnt what then ive plenty of money it is not money that i want  she could not ask him what it was that he did want and she was obliged therefore to begin again papa will look forward so to the winter now  and so shall i  but you must come for longer thenyou wont go away at the end of a week say that you wont  ill see about it i cant tell quite yet youll write me a line to say when the shed is finished wont you  that i will and ill tell you how bessy goes on bessy was the cow i will be so very fond of her shell come to me for apples already  belton thought that he would go to her wherever she might be even if he were to get no apples its all cupboard love with them he said ill tell you what ill dowhen i come ill bring you a dog that will follow you without thinking of apples then the gig was heard on the gravel before the door and belton was forced to go for a moment he reflected whether as her cousin it was not his duty to kiss her it was a matter as to which he had doubtas is the case with many male cousins but ultimately he resolved that if he kissed her at all he would not kiss her in that light and so he again refrained goodbye he said putting out his great hand to her  goodbye will and god bless you i almost think he might have kissed her asking himself no questions as to the light in which it was done  as he turned from her he saw the tears in her eyes and as he sat in the gig thinking of them other tears came into his own by heaven he would have her yet he was a man who had not read much of romance to him all the imagined mysteries of passion had not been made common by the perusal of legions of love storiesbut still he knew enough of the game to be aware that women had been won in spite as it were of their own teeth he knew that he could not now run away with her taking her off by force but still he might conquer her will by his own as he remembered the tears in her eyes and the tone of her voice and the pressure of her hand and the gratitude that had become tender in its expression he could not but think that he would be wise to love her still wise or foolish he did love her still and it should not be owing to fault of his if she did not become his wife as he drove along he saw little of the quantock hills little of the rich somersetshire pastures little of the early beauty of the august morning he saw nothing but her eyes moistened with bright tears and before he reached taunton he had rebuked himself with many revilings in that he had parted from her and not kissed her  clara stood at the door watching the gig till it was out of sightwatching it as well as her tears would allow what a grand cousin he was had it not been a pitya thousand pitiesthat that grievous episode should have come to mar the brotherly love the sisterly confidence which might otherwise have been so perfect between them but perhaps it might all be well yet clara knew or thought that she knew that men and women differed in their appreciation of love she having once loved could not change of that she was sure her love might be fortunate or unfortunate it might be returned or it might simply be her own to destroy all hope of happiness for her on earth but whether it were this or that whether productive of good or evil the love itself could not be changed but with men she thought it might be different her cousin doubtless had been sincere in the full sincerity of his heart when he made his offer and had she accepted ithad she been able to accept itshe believed that he would have loved her truly and constantly such was his nature but she also believed that love with him unrequited love would have no enduring effect and that he had already resolved with equal courage and wisdom to tread this shortlived passion out beneath his feet one night had sufficed to him for that treading out as she thought of this the tears ran plentifully down her cheek and going again to her room she remained there crying till it was time for her to wipe away the marks of her weeping that she might go to her father  but she was very glad that will bore it so wellvery glad her cousin was safe against lovemaking once again     chapter vii  miss amedroz goes to perivale   it had been settled for some time past that miss amedroz was to go to perivale for a few days in november indeed it seemed to be a recognised fact in her life that she was to make the journey from belton to perivale and back very often as there prevailed an idea that she owed a divided duty this was in some degree hard upon her as she had very little gratification in these visits to her aunt had there been any intention on the part of mrs winterfield to provide for her the thing would have been intelligible according to the usual arrangements which are made in the world on such matters but mrs winterfield had scarcely a right to call upon her niece for dutiful attendance after having settled it with her own conscience that her property was all to go to her nephew but clara entertained no thought of rebelling and had agreed to make the accustomed journey in november travelling then as she did on all such journeys at her aunts expense  two things only occurred to disturb her tranquillity before she went and they were not of much violence mr wright the clergyman called at belton castle and in the course of conversation with mr amedroz renewed one of those illnatured rumours which had before been spread about mrs askerton clara did not see him but she heard an account of it all from her father  does it mean papa she said speaking almost with anger that you want me to give up mrs askerton  how can you be so unkind as to ask me such a question he replied you know how i hate to be bothered i tell you what i hear and then you can decide for yourself  but that isnt quite fair either papa that man comes here  that man as you call him is the rector of the parish and ive known him for forty years  and have never liked him papa  i dont know much about liking anybody my dear nobody likes me and so why should i trouble myself  but papa it all amounts to thisthat somebody has said that the askertons are not askertons at all but ought to be called something else now we know that he served as captain and major askerton for seven years in indiaand in fact it all means nothing if i know anything i know that he is colonel askerton  but do you know that she is his wife that is what mr wright asks i dont say anything i think its very indelicate talking about such things  if i am asked whether i have seen her marriage certificate certainly i have not nor probably did you ever do so as to any lady that you ever knew but i know that she is her husbands wife as we all of us know things of that sort i know she was in india with him ive seen things of hers marked with her name that she has had at least for ten years  i dont know anything about it my dear said mr amedroz angrily  but mr wright ought to know something about it before he says such things and then this that hes saying now isnt the same that he said before  i dont know what he said before  he said they were both of them using a feigned name  its nothing to me what name they use i know i wish they hadnt come here if im to be troubled about them in this wayfirst by wright and then by you  they have been very good tenants papa  you neednt tell me that clara and remind me about the shooting when you know how unhappy it makes me  after this clara said nothing more and simply determined that mr wright and his gossip should have no effect upon her intimacy with mrs askerton but not the less did she continue to remember what her cousin had said about miss vigo  and she had been ruffled a second time by certain observations which mrs askerton made to her respecting her cousinor rather by little words which were dropped on various occasions it was very clear that mrs askerton did not like mr belton and that she wished to prejudice clara against him its a pity he shouldnt be a lover of yours the lady said because it would be such a fine instance of beauty and the beast it will of course be understood that mrs askerton had never been told of the offer that had been made  you dont mean to say that hes not a handsome man said clara  i never observe whether a man is handsome or not but i can see very well whether he knows what to do with his arms and legs or whether he has the proper use of his voice before ladies clara remembered a word or two spoken by her cousin to herself in speaking which he had seemed to have a very proper use of his voice i know when a man is at ease like a gentleman and when he is awkward like a  like a what said clara finish what youve got to say  like a ploughboy i was going to say said mrs askerton  i declare i think you have a spite against him because he said you were like some miss vigo replied clara sharply mrs askerton was on that occasion silenced and she said nothing more about mr belton till after clara had returned from perivale  the journey itself from belton to perivale was always a nuisance and was more so now than usual as it was made in the disagreeable month of november there was kept at the little inn at redicote an old flyso calledwhich habitually made the journey to the taunton railwaystation under the conduct of an old grey horse and an older and greyer driver whenever any of the old ladies of the neighbourhood were minded to leave their homes this vehicle usually travelled at the rate of five miles an hour but the old grey driver was never content to have time allowed to him for the transit calculated upon such a rate of speed accidents might happen and why should he be made as he would plaintively ask to drive the poor beast out of its skin he was consequently always at belton a full hour before the time and though clara was well aware of all this she could not help herself her father was fussy and impatient the man was fussy and impatient and there was nothing for her but to go on the present occasion she was taken off in this way the full sixty minutes too soon and after four dreary hours spent upon the road found herself landed at the taunton station with a terrible gulf of time to be passed before she could again proceed on her journey  one little accident had occurred to her the old horse while trotting leisurely along the level high road had contrived to tumble down clara did not think very much of this as the same thing had happened with her before but even with an hour or more to spare there arises a question whether under such circumstances the train can be saved but the grey old man reassured her now miss said he coming to the window while he left his horse recumbent and apparently comfortable on the road whered you have been now zure if i hadnt a few minutes in hand for you then he walked off to some neighbouring cottage and having obtained assistance succeeded in putting his beast again upon his legs after that he looked once more in at the window whos right now i wonder he said with an air of triumph and when he came to her for his guerdon at taunton he was evidently cross in not having it increased because of the accident  that hour at the taunton station was terrible to her i know of no hours more terrible than those so passed the minutes will not go away and utterly fail in making good their claim to be called winged a man walks up and down the platform and in that way obtains something of the advantage of exercise but a woman finds herself bound to sit still within the dreary dulness of the waitingroom there are perhaps people who under such circumstances can read but they are few in number the mind altogether declines to be active whereas the body is seized by a spirit of restlessness to which delay and tranquillity are loathsome the advertisements on the walls are examined the map of some new eden is studiedsome eden in which an irregular pond and a church are surrounded by a multiplicity of regular villas and shrubstill the student feels that no consideration of health or economy would induce him to live there then the porters come in and out till each porter has made himself odious to the sight everything is hideous dirty and disagreeable and the mind wanders away to consider why stationmasters do not more frequently commit suicide clara amedroz had already got beyond this stage and was beginning to think of herself rather than of the stationmaster when at last there sounded close to her ears the bell of promise and she knew that the train was at hand  at taunton there branched away from the main line that line which was to take her to perivale and therefore she was able to take her own place quietly in the carriage when she found that the downtrain from london was at hand this she did and could then watch with equanimity while the travellers from the other train went through the penance of changing their seats but she had not been so watching for many seconds when she saw captain frederic aylmer appear upon the platform immediately she sank back into her corner and watched no more of course he was going to perivale but why had not her aunt told her that she was to meet him of course she would be staying in the same house with him and her present small attempt to avoid him would thus be futile the attempt was made but nevertheless she was probably pleased when she found that it was made in vain he came at once to the carriage in which she was sitting and had packed his coats and dressingbag and desk about the carriage before he had discovered who was his fellowtraveller how do you do captain aylmer she said as he was about to take his seat  miss amedroz dear me how very odd i had not the slightest expectation of meeting you here the pleasure is of course the greater  nor i of seeing you mrs winterfield has not mentioned to me that you were coming to perivale  i didnt know it myself till the day before yesterday im going to give an account of my stewardship to the goodnatured perivalians who send me to parliament im to dine with the mayor tomorrow and as some bigwig has come in his way who is going to dine with him also the thing has been got up in a hurry but im delighted to find that you are to be with us  i generally go to my aunt about this time of the year  it is very goodnatured of you then he asked after her father and she told him of mr beltons visit telling him nothingas the reader will hardly require to be toldof mr beltons offer and so by degrees they fell into close and intimate conversation  i am so glad for your fathers sake said the captain with sympathetic voice speaking still of mr beltons visit  thats what i feel of course  it is just as it should be as he stands in that position to the property and so he is a nice sort of fellow is he  nice is no word for him he is perfect  dear me this is terrible you remember that they hated some old greek patriot when they could find no fault in him  ill defy you to hate my cousin will  what sort of looking man is he  extremely handsomeat least i should say so  then i certainly must hate him and clever  wellnot what you would call clever he is very clever about fields and cattle  come there is some relief in that  but you must not mistake me he is clever and then theres a way about him of doing everything just as he likes it which is wonderful you feel quite sure that hell become master of everything  but i do not feel at all sure that i should like him the better for that  but he doesnt meddle in things that he doesnt understand and then he is so generous his spending all that money down there is only done because he thinks it will make the place pleasanter to papa  has he got plenty of money  oh plenty at least i think so he says that he has  the idea of any man owning that he had got plenty of money what a happy mortal and then to be handsome and omnipotent and to understand cattle and fields one would strive to emulate him rather than envy him had not one learned to acknowledge that it is not given to every one to get to corinth  you may laugh at him but youd like him if you knew him  one never can be sure of that from a ladys account of a man when a man talks to me about another man i can generally tell whether i should like him or notparticularly if i know the man well who is giving the description but it is quite different when a woman is the describer  you mean that you wont take my word  we see with different eyes in such matters i have no doubt your cousin is a worthy manand as prosperous a gentleman as the thane of cawdor in his prosperous daysbut probably if he and i came together we shouldnt have a word to say to each other  clara almost hated captain aylmer for speaking as he did and yet she knew that it was true will belton was not an educated man and were they two to meet in her presencethe captain and the farmershe felt that she might have to blush for her cousin but yet he was the better man of the two she knew that he was the better man of the two though she knew also that she could not love him as she loved the other  then they changed the subject of their conversation and discussed mrs winterfield as they had often done before captain aylmer had said that he should return to london on the saturday the present day being tuesday and clara accused him of escaping always from the real hard work of his position i observe that you never stay a sunday at perivale she said  wellnot often why should i sunday is just the day that people like to be at home  i should have thought it would not have made much difference to a bachelor in that way  but sunday is a day that one specially likes to pass after ones own fashion  exactlyand therefore you dont stay with my aunt i understand it all completely  now you mean to be illnatured  i mean to say that i dont like sundays at perivale at all and that i should do just as you do if i had the power but womenwomen that is of my ageare such slaves we are forced to give an obedience for which we can see no cause and for which we can understand no necessity i couldnt tell my aunt that i meant to go away on saturday  you have no business which makes imperative calls upon your time  that means that i cant plead pretended excuses but the true reason is that we are dependent  there is something in that i suppose  not that i am dependent on her but my position generally is dependent and i cannot assist myself  captain aylmer found it difficult to make any answer to this feeling the subject to be one which could hardly be discussed between him and miss amedroz he not unnaturally looked to be the heir of his aunts property and any provision made out of that property for clara would so far lessen that which would come to him for anything that he knew mrs winterfield might leave everything she possessed to her niece the old lady had not been open and candid to him whom she meant to favour in her will as she had been to her to whom no such favour was to be shown but captain aylmer did know with tolerable accuracy what was the state of affairs at belton and was aware that miss amedroz had no prospect of maintenance on which to depend unless she could depend on her aunt she was now pleading that she was not dependent on that lady and captain aylmer felt that she was wrong he was a man of the world and was by no means inclined to abandon any right that was his own but it seemed to him that he was almost bound to say some word to show that in his opinion clara should hold herself bound to comply with her aunts requirements  dependence is a disagreeable word he said and one never quite knows what it means  if you were a woman youd know it means that i must stay at perivale on sundays while you can go up to london or down to yorkshire thats what it means  what you do mean i think is thisthat you owe a duty to your aunt the performance of which is not altogether agreeable nevertheless it would be foolish in you to omit it  it isnt thatnot that at all it would not be foolish not in your sense of the word but it would be wrong my aunt has been kind to me and therefore i am bound to her for this service but she is kind to you also and yet you are not bound thats why i complain you sail away under false pretences and yet you think you do your duty you have to see your lawyerwhich means going to your club or to attend to your tenantswhich means hunting and shooting  i havent got any tenants  you know very well that you could remain over sunday without doing any harm to anybodyonly you dont like going to church three times and you dont like hearing my aunt read a sermon afterwards why shouldnt you stay and i go to the club  with all my heart if you can manage it  but i cant we aint allowed to have clubs or shooting or to have our own way in anything putting forward little pretences about lawyers  come ill stay if youll ask me  im sure i wont do that in the first place youd go to sleep and then she would be offended and i dont know that your sufferings would make mine any lighter im not prepared to alter the ways of the world but i feel myself entitled to grumble at them sometimes  mrs winterfield inhabited a large brick house in the centre of the town it had a long frontage to the street for there was not only the house itself with its three square windows on each side of the door and its seven windows over that and again its seven windows in the upper storybut the end of the coachhouse also abutted on the street on which was the family clock quite as much respected in perivale as was the townclock and between the coachhouse and the mansion there was the broad entrance into the yard and the entrance also to the back door no perivalian ever presumed to doubt that mrs winterfields house was the most important house in the town nor did any stranger doubt it on looking at the frontage but then it was in all respects a town house to the eyethat is an english town house being as ugly and as respectable as unlimited bricks and mortar could make it immediately opposite to mrs winterfield lived the leading doctor and a retired builder so that the ladys eye was not hurt by any sign of a shop the shops indeed came within a very few yards of her on either side but as the neighbouring shops on each side were her own property this was not unbearable to me had i lived there the incipient growth of grass through some of the stones which formed the margin of the road would have been altogether unendurable there is no sign of coming decay which is so melancholy to the eye as any which tells of a decrease in the throng of men of men or horses there was never any throng now in that end of perivale that street had formed part of the main line of road from salisbury to taunton and coaches waggons and postingcarriages had been frequent on it but now alas it was deserted even the omnibuses from the railwaystation never came there unless they were ordered to call at mrs winterfields door for mrs winterfield herself this desolation had i think a certain melancholy attraction it suited her tone of mind and her religious views that she should be thus daily reminded that things of this world were passing away and going to destruction she liked to have ocular proof that grass was growing in the highways under mortal feet and that it was no longer worth mans while to renew human flags in human streets she was drawing near to the pavements which would ever be trodden by myriads of bright sandals and which yet would never be worn and would be carried to those jewelled causeways on which no weed could find a spot for its useless growth  behind the house there was a square prim garden arranged in parallelograms tree answering to tree at every corner round which it was still her delight to creep when the weather permitted poor clara how much advice she had received during these creepings and how often had she listened to inquiries as to the schooling of the gardeners children mrs winterfield was always unhappy about her gardener serious footmen are very plentiful and even coachmen are to be found who at a certain rate of extra payment will be punctual at prayer time and will promise to read good little books but gardeners as a class are a profane people who think themselves entitled to claim liberty of conscience and who will not submit to the domestic despotism of a serious sunday they live in cottages by themselves and choose to have an opinion of their own on church matters mrs winterfield was aware that she ought to bid high for such a gardener as she wanted a man must be paid well who will submit to daily inquiries as to the spiritual welfare of himself his wife and family but even though she did bid high and though she paid generously no gardener would stop with her one conscientious man attempted to bargain for freedom from religion during the six unimportant days of the week being strong and willing therefore to give up his day of rest but such liberty could not be allowed to him and he also went he couldnt stop he said in justice to the greenhouses when missus was so constant down upon him about his sprittual backsliding and after all where did he backslide it was only a pipe of tobacco with the babby in his arms instead of that darned evening lecture  poor mrs winterfield she had been strong in her youth and had herself sat through evening lectures with a fortitude which other people cannot attain and she was strong too in her age with the strength of a martyr submitting herself with patience to wearinesses which are insupportable to those who have none of the martyr spirit the sermons of perivale were neither bright nor eloquent nor encouraging all the old vicar or the young curate could tell she had heard hundreds of times she knew it all by heart and could have preached their sermons to them better than they could preach them to her it was impossible that she could learn anything from them and yet she would sit there thrice a day suffering from cold in winter from cough in spring from heat in summer and from rheumatism in autumn and now that her doctor had forbidden her to go more than twice recommending her to go only once she really thought that she regarded the prohibition as a grievance indeed to such as her that expectation of the jewelled causeway and of the perfect pavement that shall never be worn must be everything but if she was rightright as to herself and othersthen why has the world been made so pleasant why is the fruit of the earth so sweet and the treeswhy are they so green and the mountains so full of glory why are women so lovely and why is it that the activity of mans mind is the only sure forerunner of mans progress in listening thrice a day to outpourings from the clergymen at perivale there certainly was no activity of mind  now in these days mrs winterfield was near to her reward that she had ensured that i cannot doubt she had fed the poor and filled the young full with religious teachingsperhaps not wisely and in her own way only too well but yet as her judgment had directed her she had cared little for herselfforgiving injuries done to her and not forgiving those only which she thought were done to the lord she had lived her life somewhat as the martyr lived who stood for years on his pillar unmoved while his nails grew through his flesh so had she stood doing i fear but little positive good with her large meansbut thinking nothing of her own comfort here in comparison with the comfort of herself and others in the world to which she was going  on this occasion her nephew and niece reached her together the prim boy with the white cotton gloves and the low fourwheeled carriage having been sent down to meet clara for mrs winterfield was a lady who thought it unbecoming that her niecethough only an adopted nieceshould come to her door in an omnibus captain aylmer had driven the fourwheeled carriage from the station dispossessing the boy and the luggage had been confided to the public conveyance  it is very fortunate that you should come together said mrs winterfield i didnt know when to expect you fred indeed you never say at what hour youll come  i think it safer to allow myself a little margin aunt because one has so many things to do  i suppose it is so with a gentleman said mrs winterfield after which clara looked at captain aylmer but did not betray any of her suspicions but i knew clara would come by this train continued the old lady so i sent tom to meet her ladies always can be punctual they can do that at any rate mrs winterfield was one of those women who have always believed that their own sex is in every respect inferior to the other     chapter viii  captain aylmer meets his constituents   on the first evening of their visit captain aylmer was very attentive to his aunt he was quite alive to the propriety of such attentions and to their expediency and clara was amused as she watched him while he sat by her side by the hour together answering little questions and making little remarks suited to the temperament of the old ladys mind she herself was hardly called upon to join in the conversation on that evening and as she sat and listened she could not but think that will belton would have been less adroit but that he would also have been more straightforward and yet why should not captain aylmer talk to his aunt will belton would also have talked to his aunt if he had one but then he would have talked his own talk and not his aunts talk clara could hardly make up her mind whether captain aylmer was or was not a sincere man on the following day aylmer was out all the morning paying visits among his constituents and at three oclock he was to make his speech in the townhall special places in the gallery were to be kept for mrs winterfield and her niece and the old woman was quite resolved that she would be there as the day advanced she became very fidgety and at length she was quite alive to the perils of having to climb up the townhall stairs but she persevered and at ten minutes before three she was seated in her place  i suppose they will begin with prayer she said to clara clara who knew nothing of the manner in which things were done at such meetings said that she supposed so a town councillors wife who sat on the other side of mrs winterfield here took the liberty of explaining that as the captain was going to talk politics there would be no prayers but they have prayers in the houses of parliament said mrs winterfield with much anger to this the town councillors wife who was almost silenced by the great ladys wrath said that indeed she did not know after this mrs winterfield continued to hope for the best till the platform was filled and the proceedings had commenced then she declared the present men of perivale to be a godless set and expressed herself very sorry that her nephew had ever had anything to do with them no good can come of it my dear she said clara from the beginning had feared that no good would come of her aunts visit to the townhall  the business was put on foot at once and with some little flourishing at the commencement captain aylmer made his speechthe same speech which we have all heard and read so often specially adapted to the meridian of perivale he was a conservative and of course he told his hearers that a good time was coming that he and his family were really about to buckle themselves to the work and that perivale would hear things that would surprise it the malt tax was to go and the farmers were to have free trade in beerthe arguments from the other side having come beautifully round in their appointed circleand old england was to be old england once again he did the thing tolerably well as such gentlemen usually do and perivale was contented with its member with the exception of one perivalian to mrs winterfield sitting up there and listening with all her ears it seemed that he had hitherto omitted all allusion to any subject that was worthy of mention at last he said some word about the marriage and divorce court condemning the iniquity of the present law to which perivale had opposed itself violently by petition and general meetings and upon hearing this mrs winterfield had thumped with her umbrella and faintly cheered him with her weak old voice but the surrounding perivalians had heard the cheer and it was repeated backwards and forwards through the room till the members aunt thought that it might be her nephews mission to annul that godless act of parliament and restore the matrimonial bonds of england to their old rigidity when captain aylmer came out to hand her up to her little carriage she patted him and thanked him and encouraged him and on her way home she congratulated herself to clara that she should have such a nephew to leave behind her in her place  captain aylmer was dining with the mayor on that evening and mrs winterfield was therefore able to indulge herself in talking about him i dont see much of young men of course she said but i do not even hear of any that are like him again clara thought of her cousin will will was not at all like frederic aylmer but was he not better and yet as she thought thus she remembered that she had refused her cousin will because she loved that very frederic aylmer whom her mind was thus condemning  im sure he does his duty as a member of parliament very well said clara  that alone would not be much but when that is joined to so much that is better it is a great deal i am told that very few of the men in the house now are believers at all  oh aunt  it is terrible to think of my dear  but aunt they have to take some oath or something of that sort to show that they are christians  not now my dear theyve done away with all that since we had jew members an atheist can go into parliament now and im told that most of them are that or nearly as bad i can remember when no papist could sit in parliament but they seem to me to be doing away with everything its a great comfort to me that frederic is what he is  im sure it must be aunt  then there was a pause during which however mrs winterfield gave no sign that the conversation was to be considered as being over clara knew her aunts ways so well that she was sure something more was coming and therefore waited patiently without any thought of taking up her book i was speaking to him about you yesterday mrs winterfield said at last  that would not interest him very much  why not do you suppose he is not interested in those i love indeed it did interest him and he told me what i did not know before and what you ought to have told me  clara now blushed she knew not why and became agitated i dont know that i have kept anything from you that i ought to have told she said  he says that the provision made for you by your father has all been squandered  if he used that word he has been very unkind said clara angrily  i dont know what word he used but he was not unkind at all he never is i think he was very generous  i do not want his generosity aunt  that is nonsense my dear if he has told me the truth what have you to depend on  i dont want to depend on anything i hate hearing about it  clara i wonder you can talk in that way if you were only seventeen it would be very foolish but at your age it is inexcusable when i am gone and your father is gone who is to provide for you will your cousin do itmr belton who is to have the property  yes he wouldif i would let himof course i would not let him but aunt pray do not go on i would sooner have to starve than talk about it at all  there was another pause but clara again knew that the conversation was not over and she knew also that it would be vain for her to endeavour to begin another subject nor could she think of anything else to say so much was she agitated  what makes you suppose that mr belton would be so liberal asked mrs winterfield  i dont know i cant say he is the nearest relation i shall have and of all the people i ever knew he is the best and the most generous and the least selfish when he came to us papa was quite hostile to himdisliking his very name but when the time came papa could not bear to think of his going because he had been so good  clara  well aunt  i hope you know my affection for you  of course i do aunt and i hope you trust mine for you also  is there anything between you and mr belton besides cousinship  nothing  because if i thought that my trouble would of course be at an end  there is nothingbut pray do not let me be a trouble to you clara for a moment almost resolved to tell her aunt the whole truth but she remembered that she would be treating her cousin badly if she told the story of his rejection  there was another short period of silence and then mrs winterfield went on frederic thinks that i should make some provision for you by will that of course is the same as though he offered to do it himself i told him that it would be so and i read him my will last night he said that that made no difference and recommended me to add a codicil i asked him how much i ought to give you and he said fifteen hundred pounds there will be as much as that after burying me without burden to the estate you must acknowledge that he has been very generous  but clara in her heart did not at all thank captain aylmer for his generosity she would have had everything from him or nothing it was grievous to her to think that she should owe to him a bare pittance to keep her out of the workhouseto him who had twice seemed to be on the point of asking her to share everything with him she did not love her cousin will as she loved him but her cousin wills assurance to her that he would treat her with a brothers care was sweeter to her by far than frederic aylmers wellbalanced counsel to his aunt on her behalf in her present mood too she wanted no one to have forethought for her she desired no provision for her in the discomfiture of heart there was consolation in the feeling that when she should find herself alone in the world she would have been illtreated by her friends all round her there was a charm in the prospect of her desolation of which she did not wish to be robbed by the assurance of some seventy pounds a year to be given to her by captain frederic aylmer to be robbed of ones grievance is the last and foulest wronga wrong under which the most enduring temper will at last yield and become souredby which the strongest back will be broken well my dear continued mrs winterfield when clara made no response to this appeal for praise  it is so hard for me to say anything about it aunt what can i say but that i dont want to be a burden to any one  that is a position which very few women can attainthat is very few single women  i think it would be well if all single women were strangled by the time they are thirty said clara with a fierce energy which absolutely frightened her aunt  clara how can you say anything so wickedso abominably wicked  anything would be better than being twitted in this way how can i help it that i am not a man and able to work for my bread but i am not above being a housemaid and so captain aylmer shall find id sooner be a housemaid with nothing but my wages than take the money which you say he is to give me it will be of no use aunt for i shall not take it  it is i that am to leave it to you it is not to be a present from frederic  it is the same thing aunt he says you are to do it and you told me just now that it was to come out of his pocket  i should have done it myself long ago had you told me all the truth about your fathers affairs  how was i to tell you i would sooner have bitten my tongue out but i will tell you the truth now if i had known that all this was to be said to me about money and that our poverty was to be talked over between you and captain aylmer i would not have come to perivale i would rather that you should be angry with me and think that i had forgotten you  you would not say that clara if you remembered that this will probably be your last visit to me  no no it will not be the last but do not talk about these things and it will be so much better that i should be here when he is not here  i had hoped that when i died you might both be with me togetheras husband and wife  such hopes never come to anything  i still think that he would wish it  that is nonsense aunt it is indeed for neither of us wish it a lie on such a subject from a woman under such circumstances is hardly to be considered a lie at all it is spoken with no mean object and is the only bulwark which the woman has ready at her need to cover her own weakness  from what he said yesterday continued mrs winterfield i think it is your own fault  praypray do not talk in that way it cannot be matter of any fault that two people do not want to marry each other  of course i asked him no positive question it would be indelicate even in me to have done that but he spoke as though he thought very highly of you  no doubt he does and so do i of mr possitt  mr possitt is a very excellent young man said mrs winterfield gravely mr possitt was indeed her favourite curate at perivale and always dined at the house on sundays between services when mrs winterfield was very particular in seeing that he took two glasses of her best port wine to support him but mr possitt has nothing but his curacy  there is no danger aunt i can assure you  i dont know what you call danger but frederic seemed to think that you are always sharp with him you dont want to quarrel with him i hope because i love him better than any one in the world  oh aunt what cruel things you say to me without thinking of them  i do not mean to be cruel but i will say nothing more about him as i told you before that i had not thought it expedient to leave away any portion of my little property from fredericbelieving as i did then that the money intended for you by your father was still remainingit is best that you should now know that i have at last learnt the truth and that i will at once see my lawyer about making this change  dear aunt of course i thank you  i want no thanks clara i humbly strive to do what i believe to be my duty i have never felt myself to be more than a steward of my money that i have often failed in my stewardship i know wellfor in what duties do we not all fail then she gently laid herself back in her armchair closing her eyes while she kept fast clasped in her hands the little book of daily devotion which she had been striving to read when the conversation had been commenced clara knew then that nothing more was to be said and that she was not at present to interrupt her aunt from her posture and the closing of her eyelids mrs winterfield might have been judged to be asleep but clara could see the gentle motion of her lips and was aware that her aunt was solacing herself with prayer  clara was angry with herself and angry with all the world she knew that the old lady who was sitting then before her was very good and that all this that had now been said had come from pure goodness and a desire that strict duty might be done and clara was angry with herself in that she had not been more ready with her thanks and more demonstrative with her love and gratitude mrs winterfield was affectionate as well as good and her nieces coldness as the niece well knew had hurt her sorely but still what could clara have done or said she told herself that it was beyond her power to burst out into loud praises of captain aylmer and of such nature was the gratitude which mrs winterfield had desired she was not grateful to captain aylmer and wanted nothing that was to come from his generosity and then her mind went away to that other portion of her aunts discourse could it be possible that this man was in truth attached to her and was repelled simply by her own manner she was aware that she had fallen into a habit of fighting with him of sparring against him with words about indifferent things and calling his conduct in question in a manner half playful and half serious could it be the truth that she was thus robbing herself of that which would be to heras to herself she had frankly declaredthe one treasure which she would desire twice as has been said before words had seemed to tremble on his lips which might have settled the question for her for ever and on both occasions as she knew she herself had helped to laugh off the precious word that had been coming but had he been thoroughly in earnestin earnest as she would have him to beno laugh would have deterred him from his purpose could she have laughed will belton out of his declaration  at last the lips ceased to move and she knew that her aunt was in truth asleep the poor old lady hardly ever slept at night but nature claiming something of its due would give her rest such as this in her armchair by the fireside they were sitting in a large double drawingroom upstairs in which there were as was customary with mrs winterfield in winter two fires and the candles were in the backroom while the two ladies sat in that looking out into the street this mrs winterfield did to save her eyes from the candles and yet to be within reach of light if it were wanted and clara also sat motionless in the dark careful not to disturb her aunt and desirous of being with her when she should awake captain aylmer had declared his purpose of being home early from the mayors dinner and the ladies were to wait for his arrival before tea was brought to them clara was herself almost asleep when the door was opened and captain aylmer entered the room  hsh she said rising gently from her chair and putting up her finger he saw her by the dull light of the fire and closed the door without a sound clara then crept into the backroom and he followed her with noiseless step she did not sleep at all last night said clara and now the unusual excitement of the day has fatigued her and i think it is better not to wake her the rooms were large and they were able to place themselves at such a distance from the sleeper that their low words could hardly disturb her  was she very tired when she got home he asked  not very she has been talking much since that  has she spoken about her will to you  yesshe has  i thought she would then he was silent as though he expected that she would speak again on that matter but she had no wish to discuss her aunts will with him and therefore to break the silence asked him some trifling question are you not home earlier than you expected  it was very dull and there was nothing more to be said i did come away early and perhaps have given affront i hope you will accept the compliment implied  your aunt will when she wakes she will be delighted to find you here  i am awake said mrs winterfield i heard frederic come in it is very good of him to come so soon clara my dear we will have tea  during tea captain aylmer was called upon to give an account of the mayors feasthow the rector had said grace before dinner and mr possitt had done so after dinner and how the soup had been uneatable dear me said mrs winterfield and yet his wife was housekeeper formerly in a family that lived very well the mrs winterfields of this world allow themselves little spiteful pleasures of this kind repenting of them no doubt in those frequent moments in which they talk to their friends of their own terrible vilenesses captain aylmer then explained that his own health had been drunk and his aunt desired to know whether in returning thanks he had been able to say anything further against that wicked divorce act of parliament this her nephew was constrained to answer with a negative and so the conversation was carried on till tea was over she was very anxious to hear every word that he could be made to utter as to his own doings in parliament and as to his doings in perivale and hung upon him with that wondrous affection which old people with warm hearts feel for those whom they have selected as their favourites clara saw it all and knew that her aunt was almost doting  i think ill go up to bed now my dears said mrs winterfield when she had taken her cup of tea i am tired with those weary stairs in the townhall and i shall be better in my own room clara offered to go with her but this attendance her aunt declinedas she did always so the bell was rung and the old maidservant walked off with her mistress and miss amedroz and captain aylmer were left together  i dont think she will last long said captain aylmer soon after the door was closed  i should be sorry to believe that but she is certainly much altered  she has great courage to keep her upand a feeling that she should not give way but do her duty to the last in spite of all that however i can see how changed she is since the summer have you ever thought how sad it will be if she should be alone when the day comes  she has martha who is more to her now than any one elseunless it is you  you could not remain with her over christmas i suppose  who i what would my father do papa is as old or nearly as old as my aunt  but he is strong  he is very lonely he would be more lonely than she is for he has no such servant as martha to be with him women can do better than men i think when they come to my aunts age  from this they got into a conversation as to the character of the lady with whom they were both so nearly connected and in spite of all that clara could do to prevent it continual references were made by captain aylmer to her money and her will and the need of an addition to that will on claras behalf at last she was driven to speak out captain aylmer she said the subject is so distasteful to me that i must ask you not to speak about it  in my position i am driven to think about it  i cannot of course help your thoughts but i can assure you that they are unnecessary  it seems to me so hard that there should be such a gulf between you and me this he said after he had been silent for a while and as he spoke he looked away from her at the fire  i dont know that there is any particular gulf she replied  yes there is and it is you that make it whenever i attempt to speak to you as a friend you draw yourself off from me and shut yourself up i know that it is not jealousy  jealousy captain aylmer  jealousy with my aunt i mean  no indeed  you are infinitely too proud for that but i am sure that a stranger seeing it all would think that it was so  i dont know what it is that i do or that i ought not to do but all my life everything that i have done at perivale has always been wrong  it would have been so natural that you and i should be friends  if we are enemies captain aylmer i dont know it  but if ever i venture to speak of your future life you always repel meas though you were determined to let me know that it should not be a matter of care to me  that is exactly what i am determined to let you know you are or will be a rich man and you have everything the world can give you i am or shall be a very poor woman  is that a reason why i should not be interested in your welfare  yesthe best reason in the world we are not related to each other though we have a common connection in dear mrs winterfield and nothing to my idea can be more objectionable than any sort of dependence from a woman of my age on a man of yoursthere being no real tie of blood between them i have spoken very plainly captain aylmer for you have made me do it  very plainly he said  if i have said anything to offend you i beg your pardon but i was driven to explain myself then she got up and took her bedcandle in her hand  you have not offended me he said as he also rose  goodnight captain aylmer  he took her hand and kept it say that we are friends  why should we not be friends  there is no reason on my part why we should not be the dearest friends he said were it not that i am so utterly without encouragement i should say the very dearest he still held her hand and was looking into her face as he spoke for a moment she stood there bearing his gaze as though she expected some further words to be spoken then she withdrew her hand and again saying in a clear voice goodnight captain aylmer she left the room     chapter ix  captain aylmers promise to his aunt   what had captain aylmer meant by telling her that they might be the dearest friendsby saying so much as that and then saying no more of course clara asked herself that question as soon as she was alone in her bedroom after leaving captain aylmer below and she made two answers to herselftwo answers which were altogether distinct and contradictory one of the other at first she decided that he had said so much and no more because he was deceitfulbecause it suited his vanity to raise hopes which he had no intention of fulfillingbecause he was fond of saying soft things which were intended to have no meaning this was her first answer to herself but in her second she accused herself as much as she had before accused him she had been cold to him unfriendly and harsh as her aunt had told her she spoke sharp words to him and repulsed the kindness which he offered her what right had she to expect from him a declaration of love when she was studious to stop him at every avenue by which he might approach it a little management on her side would she almost knew make things right but then the idea of any such management distressed hernay more disgusted her the management if any were necessary must come from him and it was manifest enough that if he had any strong wishes in this matter he was not a good manager her cousin will belton knew how to manage much better  on the next morning however all her thoughts respecting captain aylmer were dissipated by tidings which martha brought to her bedside her aunt was ill martha was afraid that her mistress was very ill she did not dare to send specially for the doctor on her own responsibility as mrs winterfield had strong and peculiar feelings about doctors visits and had on this very morning declined to be so visited on the next day the doctor would come in the usual course of things for she had submitted for some years back to such periodical visitings but she had desired that nothing might be done out of the common way martha however declared that if she were alone with her mistress the doctor would be sent for and she now petitioned for aid from clara clara was of course by her aunts bedside in a few minutes and in a few minutes more the doctor from the other side of the way was there also  it was ten oclock before captain aylmer and miss amedroz met at breakfast and they had before that been together in mrs winterfields room the doctor had told captain aylmer that his aunt was very illvery ill dangerously ill she had been wrong to go into such a place as the cold unaired townhall and that too in the month of november and the fatigue had also been too much for her mrs winterfield too had admitted to clara that she knew herself to be very ill i felt it coming on me last night she said when i was talking to you and i felt it still more strongly when i left you after tea i have lived long enough gods will be done at that moment when she said she had lived long enough she forgot her intention with reference to her will but she remembered it before clara had left the room tell frederic she said to send at once for mr palmer now clara knew that mr palmer was the attorney and resolved that she would give no such message to captain aylmer but mrs winterfield sent for her nephew who had just left her and herself gave her orders to him in the course of the morning there came tidings from the attorneys office that mr palmer was away from perivale that he would be back on the morrow and that he would of course wait on mrs winterfield immediately on his return  captain aylmer and miss amedroz discussed nothing but their aunts state of health that morning over the breakfasttable of course under such circumstances in the house there was no further immediate reference made to that offer of dearest friendship it was clear to them both that the doctor did not expect that mrs winterfield would again leave her bed and it was clear to clara also that her aunt was of the same opinion  i shall hardly be able to go home now she said  it will be kind of you if you can remain  and you  i shall remain over the sunday if by that time she is at all better i will run up to town and come down again before the end of the week i know you dont believe it but a man really has some things which he must do  i dont disbelieve you captain aylmer  but you must write to me daily if i do go  to this clara made no objectionand she must write also to some one else she must let her cousin know how little chance there was that she would be at home at christmas explaining to him at the same time that his visit to her father would on that account be all the more welcome  are you going to her now he asked as clara got up immediately after breakfast i shall be in the house all the morning and if you want me you will of course send for me  she may perhaps like to see you  i will come up every now and again i would remain there altogether only i should be in the way then he got a newspaper and made himself comfortable over the fire while she went up to her weary task in her aunts room  neither on that day nor on the next did the lawyer come and on the following morning all earthly troubles were over with mrs winterfield it was early on the sunday morning that she died and late on the saturday evening mr palmer had sent up to say that he had been detained at taunton but that he would wait on mrs winterfield early on the monday morning on the friday the poor lady had said much on the subject but had been comforted by an assurance from her nephew that the arrangement should be carried out exactly as she wished it whether the codicil was or was not added to the will to clara she said nothing more on the subject nor at such a time did captain aylmer feel that he could offer her any assurance on the matter but clara knew that the will was not altered and though at the time she was not thinking much about money she had nevertheless very clearly made up her own mind as to her own conduct nothing should induce her to take a present of fifteen hundred poundsor indeed of as many pence from captain aylmer during those hours of sickness in the house they had been much thrown together and no one could have been kinder or more gentle to her than he had been he had come to call her clara as people will do when joined together in such duties and had been very pleasant as well as affectionate in his manner with her it had seemed to her that he also wished to take upon himself the cares and love of an adopted brother but as an adopted brother she would have nothing to do with him the two men whom she liked best in the world would assume each the wrong place and between them both she felt that she would be left friendless  on the saturday afternoon they had both surmised how it was going to be with mrs winterfield and captain aylmer had told mr palmer that he feared his coming on the monday would be useless he explained also what was required and declared that he would be at once ready to make good the deficiency in the will mr palmer seemed to think that this would be better even than the making of a codicil in the last moments of the ladys life and therefore he and captain aylmer were at rest on that subject  during the greater part of the saturday night both clara and captain aylmer remained with their aunt and once when the morning was almost there and the last hour was near at hand she had said a word or two which both of them had understood in which she implored her darling frederic to take a brothers care of clara amedroz even in that moment clara had repudiated the legacy feeling sure in her heart that frederic aylmer was aware what was the nature of the care which he ought to owe if he would consent to owe any care to her he promised his aunt that he would do as she desired him and it was impossible that clara should then aloud repudiate the compact but she said nothing merely allowing her hand to rest with his beneath the thin dry hand of the dying woman to her aunt however when for a moment they were alone together she showed all possible affection with thanks and tears and warm kisses and prayers for forgiveness as to all those matters in which she had offended my pretty onemy dear said the old woman raising her hand on to the head of the crouching girl who was hiding her moist eyes on the bed never during her life had her aunt appeared to her in so loving a mood as now when she was leaving it then with some eager impassioned words in which she pronounced her ideas of what should be the religious duties of a woman mrs winterfield bade farewell to her niece after that she had a longer interview with her nephew and then it seemed that all worldly cares were over with her  the sunday was passed in all that blankness of funeral grief which is absolutely necessary on such occasions it cannot be said that either clara or captain aylmer were stricken with any of that agony of woe which is produced on us by the death of those whom we have loved so well that we cannot bring ourselves to submit to part with them they were both truly sorry for their aunt in the common parlance of the world but their sorrow was of that modified sort which does not numb the heart and make the surviving sufferer feel that there never can be a remedy nevertheless it demanded sad countenances few words and those spoken hardly above a whisper an absence of all amusement and almost of all employment and a full surrender to the trappings of woe they two were living together without other companion in the big housesitting down together to dinner and to tea but on this day hardly a dozen words were spoken between them and those dozen were spoken with no purport on the monday captain aylmer gave orders for the funeral and then went away to london undertaking to be back on the day before the last ceremony clara was rather glad that he should be gone though she feared the solitude of the big house she was glad that he should be gone as she found it impossible to talk to him with ease to herself she knew that he was about to assume some position as protector or quasi guardian over her in conformity with her aunts express wish and she was quite resolved that she would submit to no such guardianship from his hands that being so the shorter period there might be for any such discussion the better  the funeral was to take place on the saturday and during the four days that intervened she received two visits from mr possitt mr possitt was very discreet in what he said and clara was angry with herself for not allowing his words to have any avail with her she told herself that they were commonplace but she told herself also after his first visit that she had no right to expect anything else but commonplace words how often are men found who can speak words on such occasions that are not commonplacesthat really stir the soul and bring true comfort to the listener the humble listener may receive comfort even from commonplace words but clara was not humble and rebuked herself for her own pride on the second occasion of his coming she did endeavour to receive him with a meek heart and to accept what he said with an obedient spirit but the struggle within her bosom was hard and when he bade her to kneel and pray with him she doubted for a moment between rebellion and hypocrisy but she had determined to be meek and so hypocrisy carried the hour  what would a clergyman say on such an occasion if the object of his solicitude were to decline the offer remarking that prayer at that moment did not seem to be opportune and that moreover he the person thus invited would like first of all to know what was to be the special object of the proposed prayer if he found that he could at the spur of the moment bring himself at all into a fitting mood for the task of him who would decline without argument the clergyman would opine that he was simply a reprobate of him who would propose to accompany an hypothetical acceptance with certain stipulations he would say to himself that he was a stiffnecked wrestler against grace whose condition was worse than that of the reprobate men and women conscious that they will be thus judged submit to the hypocrisy and go down upon their knees unprepared making no effort doing nothing while they are there allowing their consciences to be eased if they can only feel themselves numbed into some ceremonial awe by the occasion so it was with clara when mr possitt with easy piety went through the formula of his devotion hardly ever having realised to himself the fact that of all works in which man can engage himself that of prayer is the most difficult  it is a sad loss to me said mr possitt as he sat for half an hour with clara after she had thus submitted herself mr possitt was a weakly palefaced little man who worked so hard in the parish that on every day sundays included he went to bed as tired in all his bones as a day labourer from the fieldsa very great loss there are not many now who understand what a clergyman has to go through as our dear friend did if he was mindful of his two glasses of port wine on sundays who could blame him  she was a very kind woman mr possitt  yes indeedand so thoughtful that she will have an exceeding great reward who can doubt since i knew her she always lived as a saint upon earth i suppose theres nothing known as to who will live in this house miss amedroz  nothingi should think  captain aylmer wont keep it in his own hands  i cannot tell in the least but as he is obliged to live in london because of parliament and goes to yorkshire always in the autumn he can hardly want it  i suppose not but it will be a sad lossa sad loss to have this house empty ahi shall never forget her kindness to me do you know miss amedrozand as he told his little secret he became beautifully confidentialdo you know she always used to send me ten guineas at christmas to help me along she understood as well as any one how hard it is for a gentleman to live on seventy pounds a year you will not wonder that i should feel that ive had a loss it is hard for a gentleman to live upon seventy pounds a year and it is very hard too for a lady to live upon nothing a year which lot in life fate seemed to have in store for miss amedroz  on the friday evening captain aylmer came back and clara was in truth glad to see him her aunts death had been now far enough back to admit of her telling martha that she would not dine till captain aylmer had come and to allow her to think somewhat of his comfort people must eat and drink even when the grim monarch is in the house and it is a relief when they first dare to do so with some attention to the comforts which are ordinarily so important to them for themselves alone women seldom care to exercise much trouble in this direction but the presence of a man at once excuses and renders necessary the ceremony of a dinner so clara prepared for the arrival and greeted the comer with some returning pleasantness of manner and he too was pleasant with her telling her of his plans and speaking to her as though she were one of those whom it was natural that he should endeavour to interest in his future welfare  when i come back tomorrow he said the will must be opened and read it had better be done here they were sitting over the fire in the diningroom after dinner and clara knew that the coming back to which he alluded was his return from the funeral but she made no answer to this as she wished to say nothing about her aunts will and after that he continued you had better let me take you out  i am very well she said i do not want any special taking out  but you have been confined to the house the whole week  women are accustomed to that and do not feel it as you would however i will walk with you if youll take me  of course ill take you and then we must settle our future plans have you fixed upon any day yet for returning of course the longer you stay the kinder you will be  i can do no good to any one by staying  you do good to mebut i suppose im nobody i wish i could tell what to do about this house dear good old woman i know she would have wished that i should keep it in my own hands with some idea of living here at some future timebut of course i never shall live here  why not  would you like it yourself  i am not member of parliament for perivale and should not be the leading person in the town you would be a sort of king here and then some day you will have your mothers property as well as your aunts and you would be near to your own tenants  but that does not answer my question could you bring yourself to live hereeven if it were your own  why not  because it is so deadly dullbecause it has no attraction whateverbecause of all lives it is the one you would like the least no one should live in a provincial town but they who make their money by doing so  and what are the wives and daughters of such people to doand especially their widows i have no doubt i could live here very happily if i had anybody near me that i liked i should not wish to have to depend altogether on mr possitt for society  and you would find him about the best  mr possitt has been with me twice whilst you were away and he too asked what you meant to do about the house  and what did you say  what could i say of course i said i did not know i suppose he was meditating whether you would live here and ask him to dinner on sundays  mr possitt is a very good sort of man said the captain gravelyfor captain aylmer in the carrying out of his principles always spoke seriously of everything connected with the church in perivale  and quite worthy to be asked to dinner on sundays said clara but i did not give him any hope how could i of course i knew that you would not live here though i did not tell him so  no i dont suppose i shall but i see very plainly that you think i ought to do so  ive the oldfashioned idea as to a mans living near to his own property that is all no doubt it was good for other people in perivale besides mr possitt that my dear aunt lived here and if the house is shut up or let to some stranger they will feel her loss the more but i dont know that you are bound to sacrifice yourself to them  if i were to marry said captain aylmer very slowly and in a low voice of course i should have to think of my wifes wishes  but if your wife when she accepted you knew that you were living here she would hardly take upon herself to demand that you should give up your residence  she might find it very dull  she would make her own calculations as to that before she accepted you  no doubtbut i cant fancy any woman taking a man who was tied by his leg to perivale what do the people do who live in perivale  earn their bread  yesthats just what i said but i shouldnt earn mine here  i have the feeling i spoke of very strongly about papas place said clara changing the conversation suddenly i very often think of the future fate of belton castle when papa shall have gone my cousin has got his house at plaistow and i dont suppose hed live there  and where will you go he asked  as soon as she had spoken clara regretted her own imprudence in having ventured to speak upon her own affairs she had been well pleased to hear him talk of his plans and had been quite resolved not to talk of her own but now by her own speech she had set him to make inquiries as to her future life she did not at first answer the question but he repeated it and where will you live yourself  i hope i may not have to think of that for some time to come yet  it is impossible to help thinking of such things  i can assure you that i havent thought about it but i suppose i shall endeavour toto i dont know what i shall endeavour to do  will you come and live at perivale  why here more than anywhere else  in this house i mean  that would suit me admirablywould it not im afraid mr possitt would not find me a good neighbour to tell the truth i think that any lady who lives here alone ought to be older than i am the perivalians would not show to a young woman that sort of respect which they have always felt for this house  i didnt mean alone said captain aylmer  then clara got up and made some excuse for leaving him and there was nothing more said between themnothing at least of moment on that evening she had become uneasy when he asked her whether she would like to live in his house at perivale but afterwards when he suggested that she was to have some companion with her there she felt herself compelled to put an end to the conversation and yet she knew that this was always the way both with him and with herself he would say things which would seem to promise that in another minute he would be at her feet and then he would go no further and she when she heard those wordsthough in truth she would have had him at her feet if she couldwould draw away and recede and forbid him as it were to go on but clara continued to make her comparisons and knew well that her cousin will would have gone on in spite of any such forbiddings  on that night however when she was alone she could console herself with thinking how right she had been in that front bedroom the door of which was opposite to her own with closed shutters in the terrible solemnity of lifeless humanity was still lying the body of her aunt what would she have thought of herself if at such a moment she could have listened to words of love and promised herself as a wife while such an inmate was in the house she little knew that he within that same room had pledged himself to her who was now lying there waiting for her last removalhad pledged himself just seven days since to make the offer which when he was talking to her she was always half hoping and half fearing  he could have meant nothing else when he told her that he had not intended to suggest that she should live there alone in that great house at perivale she could not hinder herself from thinking of this unfit as was the present moment for any such thoughts how was it possible that she should not speculate on the subject let her resolutions against any such speculation be ever so strong she had confessed to herself that she loved the man and what else could she wish but that he also should love her but there came upon her some faint suspicionsome glimpse of what was almost a dreamthat he might possibly in this matter be guided rather by duty than by love it might be that he would feel himself constrained to offer his hand to herconstrained by the peculiarity of his position towards her if soshould she discover that such were his motivesthere would be no doubt as to the nature of her answer     chapter x  showing how captain aylmer kept his promise   the next day was necessarily very sad clara had declared her determination to follow her aunt to the churchyard and did so together with martha the old servant there were three or four mourning coaches as family friends came over from taunton one or two of whom were to be present at the reading of the will how melancholy was the occasion and how well the work was done how substantial and yet how solemn was the luncheon spread after the funeral for the gentlemen and how the will was read without a word of remark by mr palmer need hardly be told here the will contained certain substantial legacies to servantsthe amount to that old handmaid martha being so great as to produce a fit of fainting after which the old handmaid declared that if ever there was by any chance an angel of light upon the earth it was her late mistress and yet martha had had her troubles with her mistress and there was a legacy of two hundred pounds to the gentleman who was called upon to act as coexecutor with captain aylmer other clause in the will there was none except that one substantial clause which bequeathed to her wellbeloved nephew frederic folliott aylmer everything of which the testatrix died possessed the will had been made at some moment in which claras spirit of independence had offended her aunt and her name was not mentioned that nothing should have been left to clara was the one thing that surprised the relatives from taunton who were present the relatives from taunton to give them their due expected nothing for themselves but as there had been great doubt as to the proportions in which the property would be divided between the nephew and adopted niece there was aroused a considerable excitement as to the omission of the name of miss amedrozan excitement which was not altogether unpleasant when people complain of some cruel shame which does not affect themselves personally the complaint is generally accompanied by an unexpressed and unconscious feeling of satisfaction  on the present occasion when the will had been read and refolded captain aylmer who was standing on the rug near the fire spoke a few words his aunt he said had desired to add a codicil to the will of the nature of which mr palmer was well aware she had expressed her intention to leave fifteen hundred pounds to her niece miss amedroz but death had come upon her too quickly to enable her to perform her purpose of this intention on the part of mrs winterfield mr palmer was as well aware as himself and he mentioned the subject now merely with the object of saying that as a matter of course the legacy to miss amedroz was as good as though the codicil had been completed on such a question as that there could arise no question as to legal right but he understood that the legal claim of miss amedroz under such circumstances was as valid as his own it was therefore no affair of generosity on his part then there was a little buzz of satisfaction on the part of those present and the meeting was broken up  a certain old mrs folliott who was cousin to everybody concerned had come over from taunton to see how things were going she had always been at variance with mrs winterfield being a woman who loved cards and supper parties and who had throughout her life stabled her horses in stalls very different to those used by the lady of perivale now this mrs folliott was the first to tell clara of the will clara of course was altogether indifferent she had known for months past that her aunt had intended to leave nothing to her and her only hope had been that she might be left free from any commiseration or remark on the subject but mrs folliott with sundry shakings of the head told her how her aunt had omitted to name herand then told her also of captain aylmers generosity we all did think my dear said mrs folliott that she would have done better than that for you or at any rate that she would not have left you dependent on him captain aylmers horses were also supposed to be stabled in strictly low church stalls and were therefore regarded by mrs folliott with much dislike  i and my aunt understood each other perfectly said clara  i dare say but if so you really were the only person that did understand her no doubt what she did was quite right seeing that she was a saint but we sinners would have thought it very wicked to have made such a will and then to have trusted to the generosity of another person after we were dead  but there is no question of trusting to any ones generosity mrs folliott  he need not pay you a shilling you know unless he likes it  and he will not be asked to pay me a shilling  i dont suppose he will go back after what he has said publicly  my dear mrs folliott said clara earnestly pray do not let us talk about it it is quite unnecessary i never expected any of my aunts property and knew all along that it was to go to captain aylmerwho indeed was mrs winterfields heir naturally mrs winterfield was not really my aunt and i had no claim on her  but everybody understood that she was to provide for you  as i was not one of the everybodies myself it will not signify then mrs folliott retreated having as she thought performed her duty to clara and contented herself henceforth with abusing mrs winterfields will in her own social circles at taunton  on the evening of that day when all the visitors were gone and the house was again quiet captain aylmer thought it expedient to explain to clara the nature of his aunts will and the manner in which she would be allowed to inherit under it the amount of money which her aunt had intended to bequeath to her when she became impatient and objected to listen to him he argued with her pointing out to her that this was a matter of business to which it was now absolutely necessary that she should attend it may be the case he said and indeed i hope it will that no essential difference will be made by itexcept that it will gratify you to know how careful she was of your interests in her last moments but you are bound in duty to learn your own position and i as her executor am bound to explain it to you but perhaps you would rather discuss it with mr palmer  oh nosave me from that  you must understand then that i shall pay over to you the sum of fifteen hundred pounds as soon as the will has been proved  i understand nothing of the kind i know very well that if i were to take it i should be accepting a present from you and to that i cannot consent  but clara  it is no good captain aylmer though i dont pretend to understand much about law i do know that i can have no claim to anything that is not put into the will and i wont have what i could not claim my mind is quite made up and i hope i maynt be annoyed about it nothing is more disagreeable than having to discuss money matters  perhaps captain aylmer thought that the having no money matters to discuss might be even more disagreeable well he said i can only ask you to consult any friend whom you can trust upon the matter ask your father or mr belton and i have no doubt that either of them will tell you that you are as much entitled to the legacy as though it had been written in the will  on such a matter captain aylmer i dont want to ask anybody you cant pay me the money unless i choose to take it and i certainly shall not do that upon hearing this he smiled assuming as clara fancied that he was sometimes wont to do a look of quiet superiority and then for that time he allowed the subject to be dropped between them  but clara knew that she must discuss it at length with her father and the fear of that discussion made her unhappy she had already written to say that she would return home on the day but one after the funeral and had told captain aylmer of her purpose so very prudent a man as he of course could not think it right that a young lady should remain with him in his house as his visitor and to her decision on this point he had made no objection she now heartily wished that she had named the day after the funeral and that she had not been deterred by her dislike of making a sunday journey she dreaded this day and would have been very thankful if he would have left her and gone back to london but he intended he said to remain at perivale throughout the next week and she must endure the day as best she might be able she wished that it were possible to ask mr possitt to his accustomed dinner but she did not dare to make the proposition to the master of the house though captain aylmer had declared mr possitt to be a very worthy man clara surmised that he would not be anxious to commence that practice of a sabbatical dinner so soon after his aunts decease the day after all would be but one day and clara schooled herself into a resolution to bear it with good humour  captain aylmer had made a positive promise to his aunt on her deathbed that he would ask clara amedroz to be his wife and he had no more idea of breaking his word than he had of resigning the whole property which had been left to him whether clara would accept him he had much doubt he was a man by no means brilliant not naturally selfconfident nor was he perhaps to be credited with the possession of high principles of the finest sort but he was clever in the ordinary sense of the word knowing his own interest knowing too that that interest depended on other things besides money and he was a just man according to the ordinary rules of justice in the world not for the first time when he was sitting by the bedside of his dying aunt had he thought of asking clara to marry him though he had never hitherto resolved that he would do sothough he had never till then brought himself absolutely to determine that he would take so important a stephe had pondered over it often and was aware that he was very fond of clara he was in truth as much in love with her as it was in his nature to be in love he was not a man to break his heart for a girlnor even to make a strong fight for a wife as belton was prepared to do if refused once he might probably ask againhaving some idea that a first refusal was not always intended to mean muchand he might possibly make a third attempt prompted by some further calculation of the same nature but it might be doubted whether on the first second or third occasion he would throw much passion into his words and those who knew him well would hardly expect to see him die of a broken heart should he ultimately be unsuccessful  when he had first thought of marrying miss amedroz he had imagined that she would have shared with him his aunts property and indeed such had been his belief up to the days of the last illness of mrs winterfield the match therefore had recommended itself to him as being prudent as well as pleasant and though his aunt had never hitherto pressed the matter upon him he had understood what her wishes were when she first told him three or four days before her death that her property was left altogether to him and then on hearing how totally her niece was without hope of provision from her father had expressed her desire to give a sum of money to clara she had spoken plainly of her desirebut she had not on that occasion asked him for any promise but afterwards when she knew that she was dying she had questioned him as to his own feelings and he in his anxiety to gratify her in her last wishes had given her the promise which she was so anxious to hear he made no difficulty in doing so it was his own wish as well as hers in a money point of view he might no doubt now do better but then money was not everything he was very fond of clara and felt that if she would accept him he would be proud of his wife she was well born and well educated and it was the proper sort of thing for him to do no doubt he had some idea seeing how things had now arranged themselves that he would be giving much more than he would get and perhaps the manner of his offer might be affected by that consideration but not on that account did he feel at all sure that he would be accepted clara amedroz was a proud girlperhaps too proud indeed it was her fault if her pride now interfered with her future fortune in life it should be her own fault not his he would do his duty to her and to his aunthe would do it perseveringly and kindly and then if she refused him the fault would not be his  such i think was the state of captain aylmers mind when he got up on the sunday morning resolving that he would on that day make good his promise and it must be remembered on his behalf that he would have prepared himself for his task with more animation if he had hitherto received warmer encouragement he had felt himself to be repulsed in the little efforts which he had already made to please the lady and had no idea whatever as to the true state of her feelings had he known what she knew he would i think have been animated enough and gone to his task as happy and thriving a lover as any but he was a man somewhat diffident of himself though sufficiently conscious of the value of the worldly advantages which he possessedand he was perhaps a little afraid of clara giving her credit for an intellect superior to his own  he had promised to walk with her on the saturday after the reading of the will intending to take her out through the gardens down to a farm now belonging to himself which lay at the back of the town and which was held by an old widow who had been senior in life to her late landlady but no such walk had been possible as it was dark before the last of the visitors from taunton had gone at breakfast on sunday he again proposed the walk offering to take her immediately after luncheon i suppose you will not go to church he said  not today i could hardly bring myself to do it today  i think you are right i shall go a man can always do these things sooner than a lady can but you will come out afterwards to this she assented and then she was left alone throughout the morning the walk she did not mind that she and captain aylmer should walk together was all very well they might probably have done so had mrs winterfield been still alive it was the long evening afterwards that she dreadedthe long winter evening in which she would have to sit with him as his guest and with him only she could not pass these hours without talking to him and she felt that she could not talk to him naturally and easily it would however be but for once and she would bear it  they went together down to the house of mrs partridge the tenant and made their kindly speeches to the old woman mrs partridge already knew that captain aylmer was to be her landlord but having hitherto seen more of miss amedroz than of the captain and having always regarded her landladys niece as being connected irrevocably with the property she addressed them as though the estate were a joint affair  i shant be here to trouble you longthat i shant miss clara said the old woman  i am sure captain aylmer would be very sorry to lose you replied clara speaking loud and close to the poor womans ear for she was deaf  i never looked to live after she was gone miss claranever no more i didnt dearydeary and i suppose youll be living at the big house now wont ye  the big house belongs to captain aylmer mrs partridge she was driven to bawl out her words and by no means liked the task then captain aylmer said something but his speech was altogether lost  ohit belongs to the captain do it they told me that was the way of the will but i suppose its all one  yes its all one said captain aylmer gaily  its not exactly all one as you call it said clara attempting to laugh but still shouting at the top of her voice  ahi dont understand but i hope youll both live there togetherand i hope youll be as good to the poor as she that is gone well well i didnt ever think that i should be still here while she is lying under the stones up in the old church  captain aylmer had determined that he would ask his question on the way back from the farm and now resolved that he might as well begin with some allusion to mrs partridges words about the house the afternoon was bright and cold and the lane down to the farmhouse had been dried by the wind so that the day was pleasant for walking we might as well go on to the bridge he said as they left the farmyard i always think that perivale church looks better from creevy bridge than any other point perivale church stood high in the centre of the town on an eminence and was graced with a spire which was declared by the perivalians to be preferable to that of salisbury in proportion though it was acknowledged to be somewhat inferior to it in height the little river creevy which ran through a portion of the suburbs of the town and which as there seen was hardly more than a ditch then sloped away behind creevy grange as the farm of mrs partridge was called and was crossed by a small wooden bridge from which there was a view not only of the church but of all that side of the hill on which mrs winterfields large brick house stood conspicuously so they walked down to creevy bridge and when there stood leaning on the parapet and looking back upon the town  how well i know every house and spot in the place as i see them from here he said  a good many of the houses are your ownor will be some day and therefore you should know them  i remember when i used to be here as a boy fishing i always thought aunt winterfields house was the biggest house in the county  it cant be nearly so large as your fathers house in yorkshire  no certainly it is not aylmer park is a large place but the house does not stretch itself out so wide as that nor does it stand on the side of a hill so as to show out its proportions with so much ostentation the coachhouse and the stables and the old brewhouse seem to come half way down the hill and when i was a boy i had much more respect for my aunts redbrick house in perivale than i had for aylmer park  and now its your own  yes now its my ownand all my respect for it is gone i used to think the creevy the best river in england for fish but i wouldnt give a sixpence now for all the perch i ever caught in it  perhaps your taste for perch is gone also  yes and my taste for jam i never believed in the storeroom at aylmer park as i did in my aunts storeroom here  i dont doubt but what it is full now  i dare say but i shall never have the curiosity even to inquire ah deari wish i knew what to do about the house  you wont sell it i suppose  not if i could either live in it or let it it would be wrong to let it stand idle  but you need not decide quite at once  thats just what i want to do i want to decide at once  then im sure i cannot advise you it seems to me very unlikely that you should come and live here by yourself it isnt like a countryhouse exactly  i shant live there by myself certainly you heard what mrs partridge said just now  what did mrs partridge say  she wanted to know whether it belonged to both of us and whether it was not all one shall it be all one clara  she was leaning over the rail of the bridge as he spoke with her eyes fixed on the slowly moving water when she heard his words she raised her face and looked full upon him she was in some sort prepared for the moment though it would be untrue to say that she had now expected it unconsciously she had made some resolve that if ever the question were put to her by him she would not be taken altogether off her guard and now that the question was put to her she was able to maintain her composure her first feeling was one of triumphas it must be in such a position to any woman who has already acknowledged to herself that she loves the man who then asks her to be his wife she looked up into captain aylmers face and his eye almost quailed beneath hers even should he be triumphant he was not perfectly assured that his triumph would be a success  shall what be all one she asked  shall it be your house and my house can you tell me that you will love me and be my wife again she looked at him and he repeated his question clara can you love me well enough to take me for your husband  i can she said why should she hesitate and play the coy girl and pretend to any doubts in her mind which did not exist there she did love him and had so told herself with much earnestness to him while his words had been doubtfulwhile he had simply played at making love to her she had given no hint of the state of her affections she had so carried herself before him as to make him doubt whether success could be possible for him but nowwhy should she hesitate now it was as she had hopedor as she had hardly dared to hope he did love her i can she said and then before he could speak again she repeated her words with more emphasis indeed i can with all my heart  as regarded herself she was quite equal to the occasion but had she known more of the inner feelings of men and women in general she would have been slower to show her own what is there that any man desiresany man or any womanthat does not lose half its value when it is found to be easy of access and easy of possession wine is valued by its price not its flavour open your doors freely to jones and smith and jones and smith will not care to enter them shut your doors obdurately against the same gentlemen and they will use all their little diplomacy to effect an entrance captain aylmer when he heard the hearty tone of the girls answer already began almost to doubt whether it was wise on his part to devote the innermost bin of his cellar to wine that was so cheap  not that he had any idea of receding principle if not love prevented that then the question about the house is decided he said giving his hand to clara as he spoke  i dont care a bit about the house now she answered  thats unkind  i am thinking so much more of youof you and of myself what does an old house matter  its in very good repair said captain aylmer  you must not laugh at me she said and in truth he was not laughing at her what i mean is that anything about a house is indifferent to me now it is as though i had got all that i want in the world is it wrong of me to say so  oh dear nonot wrong at all how can it be wrong he did not tell her that he also had got all he wanted but his lack of enthusiasm in this respect did not surprise her or at first even vex her she had always known him to be a man careful of his wordsknowing their valuenot speaking with hurried rashness as would her dear cousin will and she doubted whether after all such hurried words mean as much as words which are slower and calmer after all his heat in love and consequent disappointment will belton had left her apparently well contented his fervour had been shortlived she loved her cousin dearly and was so very glad that his fervour had been shortlived  when you asked me i could but tell you the truth she said smiling at him  the truth is very well but he would have liked it better had the truth come to him by slower degrees when his aunt had told him to marry clara amedroz he had been at once reconciled to the order by a feeling on his own part that the conquest of clara would not be too facile she was a woman of value not to be snapped up easilyor by any one so he had thought then but he began to fancy now that he had been wrong in that opinion  the walk back to the house was not of itself very exciting though to clara it was a short period of unalloyed bliss no doubt had then come upon her to cloud her happiness and she was wrapped up in measureless content it was well that they should both be silent at such a moment only yesterday had been buried their dear old friendthe friend who had brought them together and been so anxious for their future happiness and clara amedroz was not a young girl prone to jump out of her shoes with elation because she had got a lover she could be steadily happy without many immediate words about her happiness when they had reached the house and were once more together in the drawingroom she again gave him her hand and was the first to speak and you are you contented she asked who does not know the smile of triumph with which a girl asks such a question at such a moment as that  contentedwellyes i think i am he said  but even those words did not move her to doubt if you are she said i am and now i will leave you till dinner that you may think over what you have done  i had thought about it before you know he replied then he stooped over her and kissed her it was the first time he had done so but his kiss was as cold and proper as though they had been man and wife for years but it sufficed for her and she went to her room as happy as a queen     chapter xi  miss amedroz is too candid by half   clara when she left her accepted lover in the drawingroom and went up to her own chamber had two hours for consideration before she would see him againand she had two hours for enjoyment she was very happy she thoroughly believed in the man who was to be her husband feeling confident that he possessed those qualities which she thought to be most necessary for her married happiness she had quizzed him at times pretending to make it matter of accusation against him that his life was not in truth all that his aunt believed it to bebut had it been more what mrs winterfield would have wished it would have been less to claras taste she liked his position in the world she liked the feeling that he was a man of influence perhaps she liked to think that to some extent he was a man of fashion he was not handsome but he looked always like a gentleman he was well educated given to reading prudent steady in his habits a man likely to rise in the world and she loved him i fear the reader by this time may have begun to think that her love should never have been given to such a man to this accusation i will make no plea at present but i will ask the complainant whether such men are not always loved much is said of the rashness of women in giving away their hearts wildly but the charge when made generally is i think an unjust one i am more often astonished by the prudence of girls than by their recklessness a woman of thirty will often love well and not wisely but the girls of twenty seem to me to like propriety of demeanour decency of outward life and a competence it is of course good that it should be so but if it is so they should not also claim a general character for generous and passionate indiscretion asserting as their motto that love shall still be lord of all clara was more than twenty but she was not yet so far advanced in age as to have lost her taste for decency of demeanour and propriety of life a member of parliament with a small house near eaton square with a moderate income and a liking for committees who would write a pamphlet once every two years and read dante critically during the recess was to her the model for a husband for such a one she would read his blue books copy his pamphlets and learn his translations by heart she would be safe in the hands of such a man and would know nothing of the miseries which her brother had encountered her model may not appear when thus described to be a very noble one but i think it is the model most approved among ladies of her class in england  she made up her mind on various points during those two hours of solitude in the first place she would of course keep her purpose of returning home on the following day it was not probable that captain aylmer would ask her to change it but let him ask ever so much it must not be changed she must at once have the pleasure of telling her father that all his trouble about her would now be over and then there was the consideration that her further sojourn in the house with captain aylmer as her lover would hardly be more proper than it would have been had he not occupied that position and what was she to say if he pressed her as to the time of their marriage her aunts death would of course be a sufficient reason why it should be delayed for some few months and upon the whole she thought it would be best to postpone it till the next session of parliament should have nearly expired but she would be prepared to yield to captain aylmer should he name any time after easter it was clearly his intention to keep up the house in perivale as his country residence she did not like perivale or the house but she would say nothing against such an arrangement indeed with what face could she do so she was going to bring nothing to the common accountabsolutely nothing but herself as she thought of this her love grew warmer and she hardly knew how sufficiently to testify to herself her own gratitude and affection  she became conscious as she was preparing herself for dinner of some special attention to her toilet she was more than ordinarily careful with her hair and felt herself to be aware of an anxiety to look her best she had now been for some time so accustomed to dress herself in black that in that respect her aunts death had made no difference to her deep mourning had ceased from habit to impress her with any special feeling of funereal solemnity but something about herself or in the room at last struck her with awe bidding her remember how death had of late been busy among those who had been her dearest and nearest friends and she sat down almost frightened at her own heartlessness in that she was allowing herself to be happy at such a time her aunt had been carried away to her grave only yesterday and her brothers death had occurred under circumstances of peculiar distress within the yearand yet she was happy triumphantalmost lost in the joy of her own position she remained for a while in her chair with her black dress hanging across her lap as she argued with herself as to her own state of mind was it a sign of a hard heart within her that she could be happy at such a time ought the memory of her poor brother to have such an effect upon her as to make any joy of spirits impossible to her should she at the present moment be so crushed by her aunts demise as to be incapable of congratulating herself upon her own success should she have told him when he asked her that question upon the bridge that there could be no marrying or giving in marriage between them no talking on such a subject in days so full of sorrow as these i do not know that she quite succeeded in recognising it as a truth that sorrow should be allowed to bar out no joy that it does not bar out of absolute necessityby its own weight without reference to conventional ideas that sorrow should never under any circumstances be nursed into activity as though it were a thing in itself divine or praiseworthy i do not know that she followed out her arguments till she had taught herself that it is the love that is divinethe love which when outraged by death or other severance produces that sorrow which man would control if he were strong enough but which he cannot control by reason of the weakness of his humanity i doubt whether so much as this made itself plain to her as she sat there before her toilet table with her sombre dress hanging from her hands on to the ground but something of the strength of such reasoning was hers knowing herself to be full of joy she would not struggle to make herself believe that it behoved her to be unhappy she told herself that she was doing what was good for others as well as for herselfwhat would be very good for her father and what should be good if it might be within her power to make it so for him who was to be her husband the blackness of the cloud of her brothers death would never altogether pass away from her it had tended as she knew well to make her serious grave and old in spite of her own efforts to the contrary the cloud had been so black with her that it had nearly lost for her the prize which was now her own but she told herself that that blackness was an injury to her and not a benefit and that it had now become a duty to herfor his sake if not for her ownto dispel its shadows rather than encourage them she would go down to him full of joy though not full of mirth and would confess to him frankly that in receiving the assurance of his love she had received everything that had seemed to have any value for her in the world hitherto she had been independentshe had specially been careful to show to him her resolve to be independent of him now she would put aside all that and let him know that she recognised in him her lord and master as well as husband to her father had been left no strength on which she could lean and she had been forced therefore to trust to her own strength now she would be dependent on him who was to be her husband as heretofore she had rejected his offers of assistance almost with disdain so now would she accept them without scruple looking to him to be her guide in all things putting from her that carping spirit in which she had been wont to judge of his actions and believing in himas a wife should believe in her husband  such were the resolutions which clara made in the first hour of solitude which came to her after her engagement and they would have been wise resolutions but for this flawthat the stronger was submitting itself to the weaker the greater to the less the more honest to the less honest that which was nearly true to that which was in great part false the theory of man and wifethat special theory in accordance with which the wife is to bend herself in loving submission before her husband is very beautiful and would be good altogether if it could only be arranged that the husband should be the stronger and the greater of the two the theory is based upon that hypothesisand the hypothesis sometimes fails of confirmation in ordinary marriages the vessel rights itself and the stronger and the greater takes the lead whether clothed in petticoats or in coat waistcoat and trousers but there sometimes comes a terrible shipwreck when the woman before marriage has filled herself full with ideas of submission and then finds that her goldenheaded god has got an iron body and feet of clay  captain aylmer when he was left alone had also something to think about and as there were two hours left for such thought before he would again meet clara and as he had nothing else with which to occupy himself during those two hours he again strolled down to the bridge on which he had made his offer he strolled down there thinking that he was thinking but hardly giving much mind to his thoughts which he allowed to run away with themselves as they listed of course he was going to be married that was a thing settled and he was perfectly satisfied with himself in that he had done nothing in a hurry and could accuse himself of no folly even if he had no great cause for triumph he had been long thinking that he should like to have clara amedroz for his wifelong thinking that he would ask her to marry him and having for months indulged such thoughts he could not take blame to himself for having made to his aunt that deathbed promise which she had exacted at the moment in which she asked him the question he was himself anxious to do the thing she desired of him how then could he have refused her and having given the promise it was a matter of course with him to fulfil it he was a man who would have never respected himself againwould have hated himself for ever had he failed to keep a promise from which no living being could absolve him he had been right therefore to make the promise and having made it had been right to keep it and to do the thing at once and clara was very good and very wise and sometimes looked very well and would never disgrace him and as she was in worldly matters to receive much and give nothing she would probably be willing to make herself amenable to any arrangements as to their future mode of life which he might propose in respect of this matter he was probably thinking of lodgings for himself in london during the parliamentary session while she remained alone in the big red house upon which his eyes were fixed at the time there was much of convenience in all this which might perhaps atone to him for the sacrifice which he was undoubtedly making of himself had marriage simply been of itself a thing desirable he could doubtless have disposed of himself to better advantage his prospects present fortune and general position were so favourable that he might have dared to lift his expectations in regard both to wealth and rank very high the aylmers were a considerable people and he though a younger brother had much more than a younger brothers portion his seat in parliament was safe his position in society was excellent and secure he was exactly so placed that marriage with a fortune was the only thing wanting to put the finishing copingstone to his edificethat and perhaps also the useful glory of having some lady mary or lady emily at the top of his table lady emily aylmer yesit would have sounded better and there was a certain lady emily who might have suited now as some slight regrets stole upon him gently he failed to remember that this lady emily had not a shilling in the world  yes some faint regrets did steal upon him though he went on telling himself that he had acted rightly his stars which were generally very good to him had not perhaps on this occasion been as good as usual no doubt he had to a certain degree become encumbered with clara amedroz had not the direct and immediate leap with which she had come into his arms shown him somewhat too plainly that one word of his mouth tending towards matrimony had been regarded by her as being too valuable to be lost the fruit that falls easily from the tree though it is ever the best is never valued by the gardener let him have wellnigh broken his neck in gathering it unripe and crude from the small topmost boughs of the branching tree and the pippin will be esteemed by him as invaluable on that morning as captain aylmer had walked home from church he had doubted much what would be claras answer to him then the pippin was at the end of the dangerous bough now it had fallen to his feet and he did not scruple to tell himself that it was his and always might have been his as a matter of course well the apple had come of a good kind and though there might be specks upon it though it might not be fit for any special glory of show or pride of place among the dessert service still it should be garnered and used and no doubt would be a very good apple for eating having so concluded captain aylmer returned to the house washed his hands changed his boots and went down to the drawingroom just as dinner was ready she came up to him almost radiant with joy and put her hand upon his arm martha did not know but what you were here she said and told them to put dinner on the table  i hope i have not kept you waiting  oh dear no and what if you did ladies never care about things getting cold it is gentlemen only who have feelings in such matters as that  i dont know that there is much difference but however then they were in the diningroom and as the servant remained there during dinner there was nothing in their conversation worth repeating after dinner they still remained down stairs seating themselves on the two sides of the fire clara having fully resolved that she would not on such an evening as this leave captain aylmer to drink his glass of port wine by himself  i suppose i may stay with you maynt i she said  oh dear yes im sure im very much obliged im not at all wedded to solitude then there was a slight pause  thats lucky she said as you have made up your mind to be wedded in another sort of way her voice as she spoke was very low but there was a gentle ring of restrained joyousness in it which ought to have gone at once to his heart and made him supremely blessed for the time  wellyes he answered we are in for it now both of usare we not i hope you have no misgivings about it clara  who i i have misgivings no indeed i have no misgivings frederic no doubts no scruples no alloy in my happiness with me it is all as i would have it be ah you havent understood why it has been that i have seemed to be harsh to you when we have met  no i have not said he this was true but it is true also that it would have been well that he should be kept in his ignorance she was minded however to tell him everything and therefore she went on  i dont know how to tell you and yet circumstanced as we are now it seems that i ought to tell you everything  yes certainly i think that said aylmer he was one of those men who consider themselves entitled to see hear and know every little detail of a womans conduct as a consequence of the circumstances of his engagement and who consider themselves shorn of their privilege if anything be kept back if any gentleman had said a soft word to clara eight years ago that soft word ought to be repeated to him now i am afraid that these particular gentlemen sometimes hear some fibs and i often wonder that their own early passages in the tournays of love do not warn them that it must be so when james has sat deliciously through all the moonlit night with his arm round marys waist and afterwards sees mary led to the altar by john does it not occur to him that some john may have also sat with his arm round annas waistthat anna whom he is leading to the altar these things should not be inquired into too curiously but the curiosity of some men on such matters has no end for the most part women like tellingonly they do not choose to be pressed beyond their own modes of utterance i should like to know that i have your full confidence said he  you have got my full confidence she replied  i mean that you should tell me anything that there is to be told  it was only this that i had learned to love you before i thought that my love would be returned  ohwas that it said captain aylmer in a tone which seemed to imply something like disappointment  yes fred that was it and how could i under such circumstances trust myself to be gentle with you or to look to you for assistance how could i guess then all that i know now  of course you couldnt  and therefore i was driven to be harsh my aunt used to speak to me about it  i dont wonder at that for she was very anxious that we should be married  clara for a moment felt herself to be uncomfortable as she heard these words half perceiving that they implied some instigation on the part of mrs winterfield could it be that captain aylmers offer had been made in obedience to a promise did you know of her anxiety she asked  wellyes that is to say i guessed it it was natural enough that the same idea should come to her and to me too of course seeing us so much thrown together she could not but think of our being married as a chance upon the cards  she used to tell me that i was harsh to youabrupt she called it but what could i do ill tell you fred how i first found out that i really cared for you what i tell you now is of course a secret and i should speak of it to no one under any circumstances but those which unite us two together my cousin will when he was at belton made me an offer  he did did he you did not tell me that when you were saying all those fine things in his praise in the railway carriage  of course i did not why should i i wasnt bound to tell you my secrets then sir  but he did absolutely offer to you  is there anything so wonderful in that but wonderful or not he did  and you refused him  i refused him certainly  it wouldnt have been a bad match if all that you say about his property is true  if you come to that it would have been a very good match and perhaps you think i was silly to decline it  i dont say that  papa thought sobut then i couldnt tell papa the whole truth as i can tell it to you now captain aylmer i couldnt tell dear papa that my heart was not my own to give to my cousin will nor could i give will any such reason poor will i could only say to him bluntly that i wouldnt have him  and you would if it hadnt beenhadnt beenfor me  nay fred there you tax me too far what might have come of my heart if you hadnt fallen in my way who can say i love will belton dearly and hope that you may do so  i must see him first  of coursebut as i was saying i doubt whether under any circumstances he would have been the man i should have chosen for a husband but as it wasit was impossible now you know it all and i think that i have been very frank with you  oh very frank he would not take her little jokes nor understand her little prettinesses that he was a man not prone to joking she knew well but still it went against the grain with her to find that he was so very hard in his replies to her attempts  it was not easy for clara to carry on the conversation after this so she proposed that they should go upstairs into the drawingroom such a change even as that would throw them into a different way of talking and prevent the necessity of any further immediate allusion to will belton for clara was aware though she hardly knew why that her frankness to her future husband had hardly been successful and she regretted that she had on this occasion mentioned her cousins name they went upstairs and again sat themselves in chairs over the fire but for a while conversation did not seem to come to them freely clara felt that it was now captain aylmers turn to begin and captain aylmer feltthat he wished he could read the newspaper he had nothing in particular that he desired to say to his ladylove that morning as he was shaving himself he had something to say that was very particularas to which he was at that moment so nervous that he had cut himself slightly through the trembling of his hand but that had now been said and he was nervous no longer that had now been said and the thing settled so easily that he wondered at his own nervousness he did not know that there was anything that required much further immediate speech clara had thought somewhat of the time which might be proposed for their marriage making some little resolves with which the reader is already acquainted but no ideas of this kind presented themselves to captain aylmer he had asked his cousin to be his wife thereby making good his promise to his aunt there could be no further necessity for pressing haste sufficient for the day is the evil thereof  it is not to be supposed that the thriving lover actually spoke to himself in such language as thator that he confessed to himself that clara amedroz was an evil to him rather than a blessing but his feelings were already so far tending in that direction that he was by no means disposed to make any further promise or to engage himself in closer connection with matrimony by the mention of any special day clara finding that her companion would not talk without encouragement from her had to begin again and asked all those natural questions about his family his brother his sister his home habits and the old house in yorkshire the answers to which must be so full of interest to her but even on these subjects he was dry and indisposed to answer with the full copiousness of free communication which she desired and at last there came a question and an answera word or two on one side and then a word or two on the other from which clara got a wound which was very sore to her  i have always pictured to myself she said your mother as a woman who has been very handsome  she is still a handsome woman though she is over sixty  tall i suppose  yes tall and with something ofofwhat shall i saydignity about her  she is not grand i hope  i dont know what you call grand  not grand in a bad senseim sure she is not that but there are some ladies who seem to stand so high above the level of ordinary females as to make us who are ordinary quite afraid of them  my mother is certainly not ordinary said captain aylmer  and i am said clara laughing i wonder what shell say to meor rather what she will think of me then there was a moments silence after which clara still laughing went on i see fred that you have not a word of encouragement to give me about your mother  she is rather particular said captain aylmer  then clara drew herself up and ceased to laugh she had called herself ordinary with that halfinsincere depreciation of self which is common to all of us when we speak of our own attributes but which we by no means intend that they who hear us shall accept as strictly true or shall reecho as their own approved opinions but in this instance captain aylmer though he had not quite done that had done almost as bad  then i suppose i had better keep out of her way said clara by no means laughing as she spoke  of course when we are married you must go and see her  you do not at any rate promise me a very agreeable visit fred but i dare say i shall survive it after all it is you that i am to marry and not your mother and as long as you are not majestic to me i need not care for her majesty  i dont know what you mean by majesty  you must confess that you speak of her as of something very terrible  i say that she is particularand so she is and as my respect for her opinion is equal to my affection for her person i hope that you will make a great effort to gain her esteem  i never make any efforts of that kind if esteem doesnt come without efforts it isnt worth having  there i disagree with you altogetherbut i especially disagree with you as you are speaking about my mother and about a lady who is to become your own motherinlaw i trust that you will make such efforts and that you will make them successfully lady aylmer is not a woman who will give you her heart at once simply because you have become her sons wife she will judge you by your own qualities and will not scruple to condemn you should she see cause  then there was a longer silence and claras heart was almost in rebellion even on this the first day of her engagement but she quelled her high spirit and said no further word about lady aylmer nor did she speak again till she had enabled herself to smile as she spoke  well fred she said putting her hand upon his arm ill do my best and woman can do no more and now ill say good night for i must pack for tomorrows journey before i go to bed then he kissed herwith a cold chilling kissand she left him for the night     chapter xii  miss amedroz returns home   clara was to start by a train leaving perivale at eight on the following morning and therefore there was not much time for conversation before she went during the night she had endeavoured so to school herself as to banish from her breast all feelings of anger against her lover and of regret as regarded herself probably as she told herself she had made more of what he had said than he had intended that she should do and then was it not natural that he should think much of his mother and feel anxious as to the way in which she might receive his wife as to that feeling of anger on her own part she did get quit of itbut the regret was not to be so easily removed it was not only what captain aylmer had said about his mother that clung to her doing much to quench her joy but there had been a coldness in his tone to her throughout the evening which she recognised almost unconsciously and which made her heart heavy in spite of the joy which she repeatedly told herself ought to be her own and she also feltthough she was not clearly aware that she did sothat his manner towards her had become less affectionate less like that of a lover since the honest tale she had told him of her own early love for him she should have been less honest and more discreet less bold and more like in her words to the ordinary run of women she had known this as she was packing last night and she told herself that it was so as she was dressing on this her last morning at perivale that frankness of hers had not been successful and she regretted that she had not imposed on herself some little reticenceor even a little of that coy pretence of indifference which is so often used by ladies when they are wooed she had been boldly honest and had found her honesty to be bad policy she thought at least that she had found its policy to be bad whether in truth it may not have been very goodhave been the best policy in the worldtending to give her the first true intimation which she had ever yet received of the real character of the man who was now so much to herthat is altogether another question  but it was clearly her duty to make the best of her present circumstances and she went downstairs with a smiling face and with pleasant words on her tongue when she entered the breakfastroom captain aylmer was there but martha was there also and her pleasant words were received indifferently in the presence of the servant when the old woman was gone captain aylmer assumed a grave face and began a serious little speech which he had prepared but he broke down in the utterance of it and was saying things very different from what he had intended before he had completed it  clara he began what occurred between us yesterday is a source of great satisfaction to me  i am glad of that frederic said she trying to be a little less serious than her lover  of very great satisfaction he continued and i cannot but think that we were justified by the circumstances of our position in forgetting for a time the sad solemnity of the occasion when i remember that it was but the day before yesterday that i followed my dear old aunt to the grave i am astonished to think that yesterday i should have made an offer of marriage  what could be the good of his talking in this strain clara too had had her own misgivings on the same subjectlittle qualms of conscience that had come to her as she remembered her old friend in the silent watches of the night but such thoughts were for the silent watches and not for open expression in the broad daylight but he had paused and she must say something  ones excuse to oneself is thisthat she would have wished it so  exactly she would have wished it indeed she did wish it and therefore he paused in what he was saying and felt himself to be on difficult ground her eye was full upon him and she waited for a moment or two as though expecting that he would finish his words but as he did not go on she finished them for him  and therefore you sacrificed your own feelings her heart was becoming sore and she was unable to restrain the utterance of her sarcasm  just so said he or rather not exactly that i dont mean that i am sacrificed for of course as i have just now said nothing as regards myself can be more satisfactory but yesterday should have been a solemn day to us and as it was not  i thought it very solemn  what i mean is that i find an excuse in remembering that i was doing what she asked me to do  what she asked you to do fred  what i had promised i mean  what you had promised i did not hear that before these last words were spoken in a very low voice but they went direct to captain aylmers ears  but you have heard me declare he said that as regards myself nothing could be more satisfactory  fred she said listen to me for a moment you and i engaged ourselves to each other yesterday as man and wife  of course we did  listen to me dear fred in doing that there was nothing in my mind unbefitting the sadness of the day even in death we must think of life and if it were well for you and me that we should be together it would surely have been but a foolish ceremony between us to have abstained from telling each other that it would be so because my aunt had died last week but it may be and i think it is the case that the feelings arising from her death have made us both too precipitate  i dont understand how that can be  you have been anxious to keep a promise made to her without considering sufficiently whether in doing so you would secure your own happiness and i  i dont know about you but as regards myself i must be considered to be the best judge  and i have been too much in a hurry in believing that which i wished to believe  what do you mean by all this clara  i mean that our engagement shall be at an endnot necessarily so for always but that as an engagement binding us both it shall for the present cease to exist you shall be again free  but i dont choose to be free  when you think of it you will find it best that it should be so you have performed your promise honestly even though at a sacrifice to yourself luckily for youfor both of us i should saythe full truth has come out and we can consider quietly what will be best for us to do independently of that promise we will part therefore as dear friends but not as engaged to each other as man and wife  but we are engaged and i will not hear of its being broken  a ladys word fred is always the most potential before marriageand you must therefore yield to me in this matter i am sure your judgment will approve of my decision when you think of it there shall be no engagement between us i shall consider myself quite freefree to do as i please altogether and you of course will be free also  if you please of course it must be so  i do please fred  and yesterday then is to go for nothing  not exactly it cannot go for nothing with me i told you too many of my secrets for that but nothing that was done or said yesterday is to be held as binding upon either of us  and you made up your mind to that last night  it is at any rate made up to that now comei shall have to go without my breakfast if i do not eat it at once will you have your tea now or wait and take it comfortably when i am gone  captain aylmer breakfasted with her and took her to the station and saw her off with all possible courtesy and attention and then he walked back by himself to his own great house in perivale not a word more had been said between him and clara as to their engagement and he recognised it as a fact that he was no longer bound to her as her future husband indeed he had no power of not recognising the fact so decided had been her language and so imperious her manner it had been of no avail that he had said that the engagement should stand she had told him that her voice was to be the more potential and he had felt that it was so wellmight it not be best for him that it should be so he had kept his promise to his aunt and had done all that lay in his power to make clara amedroz his wife if she chose to rebel against her own good fortune simply because he spoke to her a few words which seemed to him to be fitting might it not be well for him to take her at her word  such were his first thoughts but as the day wore on with him something more generous in his nature came to his aid and something also that was akin to real love now that she was no longer his own he again felt a desire to have her now that there would be again something to be done in winning her he was again stirred by a mans desire to do that something he ought not to have told her of the promise he was aware that what he had said on that point had been dropped by him accidentally and that claras resolution after that had not been unnatural he would therefore give her another chance and resolved before he went to bed that night that he would allow a fortnight to pass away and would then write to her renewing his offer with all the strongest declarations of affection which he would be enabled to make  clara on her way home was not well satisfied with herself or with her position she had had great joy during the few hours of joy which had been hers in thinking of the comfort which her news would give to her father he would be released from all further trouble on her account by the tidings which she would convey to himby the tidings which she had intended to convey to him but now the story which she would have to tell would by no means be comfortable she would have to explain to him that her aunt had left no provision for her and that would be the beginning and the end of her story as for those conversations about the fifteen hundred poundsof them she would say nothing when she reflected on what had taken place between herself and captain aylmer she was more resolved than ever that she would not touch any portion of that moneyor of any money that should come from him nor would she tell her father anything of the marriage engagement which had been made on one day and unmade on the next why should she add to his distress by showing him what good things might have been hers had she only had the wit to keep them noshe would tell her father simply of the will and then comfort him in his affliction as best she might  as regarded her position with captain aylmer the more she thought of it the more sure she became that everything was over in that quarter she had indeed told him that such need not necessarily be the casebut this she had done in her desire at the moment to mitigate the apparent authoritativeness of her own decision rather than with any idea of leaving the matter open for further consideration she was sure that captain aylmer would be glad of a means of escape and that he would not again place himself in the jeopardy which the promise exacted from him by his aunt had made so nearly fatal to him and for herself though she still loved the manso loved him that she lay back in the corner of her carriage weeping behind her veil as she thought of what she had loststill she would not take him though he should again press his suit upon her with all the ardour at his command no indeed no man should ever be made to regard her as a burden imposed upon him by an extorted promise whatlet a man sacrifice himself to a sense of duty on her behalf and then she repeated the odious words to herself till she came to think that it had fallen from his lips and not from her own  in writing to her father from perivale she had merely told him of mrs winterfields death and of her own intended return at the taunton station she met the wellknown old fly and the wellknown old driver and was taken home in the accustomed manner as she drew nearer to belton the sense of her distress became stronger and stronger till at last she almost feared to meet her father what could she say to him when he should repeat to her as he would be sure to do his lamentation as to her future poverty  on arriving at the house she learned that he was upstairs in his bedroom he had been ill the servant said and though he was not now in bed he had not come downstairs so she ran up to his room and finding him seated in an old armchair by the fireside knelt down at his feet as she took his hand and asked him as to his health  what has mrs winterfield done for you in her will these were the first words he spoke to her  never mind about wills now papa i want you to tell me of yourself  nonsense clara answer my question  oh papa i wish you would not think so much about money for me  not think about it why am i not to think about it what else have i got to think of tell me at once clara what she has done you ought to have written to me directly the will was made known  there was no help for her and the terrible word must be spoken she has left her property to captain aylmer papa and i must say that i think she is right  you do not mean everything  she has provided for her servants  and has made no provision for you  no papa  do you mean to tell me that she has left you nothingabsolutely nothing the old mans manner was altogether altered as he asked this question and there came over his face so unusual a look of energyof the energy of angerthat clara was frightened and knew not how to answer him with that tone of authority which she was accustomed to use when she found it necessary to exercise control over him do you mean to say that there is nothingnothing and as he repeated the question he pushed her away from his knees and stood up with an effort leaning against the back of his chair  dear papa do not let this distress you  but is it so is there in truth nothing  nothing papa remember that she was not really my aunt  nonsense childnonsense how can you talk such trash to me as that and then you tell me not to distress myself i am to know that you will be a beggar in a year or twoprobably in a few monthsand that is not to distress me she has been a wicked woman  oh papa do not say that  a wicked woman a very wicked woman it is always so with those who pretend to be more religious than their neighbours she has been a very wicked woman alluring you into her house with false hopes  no papano i must contradict you she had given me no ground for such hope  i say she hadeven though she may not have made a promise i say she had did not everybody think that you were to have her money  i dont know what people may have thought nobody has had any right to think about it at all  that is nonsense clara you know that i expected itthat you expected it yourself  nono no  clarahow can you tell me that  papa i knew that she intended to leave me nothing she told me so when i was there in the spring  she told you so  yes papa she told me that frederic aylmer was to have all her property she explained to me everything that she meant to do and i thought that she was right  and why was not i told when you came home  dear papa  dear papa indeed what is the meaning of dear papa why have i been deceived  what good could i do by telling you you could not change it  you have been very undutiful and as for her her wickedness and cruelty shock meshock me they do indeed that she should have known your position and had you with her alwaysand then have made such a will as that quite heartless she must have been quite heartless  clara now began to find that she must in justice to her aunts memory tell her father something more and yet it would be very difficult to tell him anything that would not bring greater affliction upon him and would not also lead her into deeper trouble should it come to pass that her aunts intention with reference to the fifteen hundred pounds was mentioned she would be subjected to an endless persecution as to the duty of accepting that money from captain aylmer but her present feelings would have made her much prefer to beg her bread upon the roads than accept her late lovers generosity and then again how could she explain to her father mrs winterfields mistake about her own position without seeming to accuse her father of having robbed her but nevertheless she must say something as mr amedroz continued to apply that epithet of heartless to mrs winterfield going on with it in a low droning tone that was more injurious to claras ears than the first full energy of his anger heartlessquite heartlessshockingly heartlessshockingly heartless  the truth is papa clara said at last that when my aunt told me about her will she did not know but what i had some adequate provision from my own family  oh clara  that is the truth papafor she explained the whole thing to me i could not tell her that she was mistaken and thus ask for her money  but she knew everything about that poor wretched boy and now the father dropped back into his chair and buried his face in his hands  when he did this clara again knelt at his feet she felt that she had been cruel and that she had defended her aunt at the cost of her own father she had as it were thrown in his teeth his own imprudence and twitted him with the injuries which he had done to her papa she said dear papa do not think about it at all what is the use after all money is not everything i care nothing for money if you will only agree to banish the subject altogether we shall be so comfortable  how is it to be banished  at any rate we need not speak of it why should we talk on a subject which is simply uncomfortable and which we cannot mend  oh dear oh dear oh dear and now he swayed himself backwards and forwards in his chair bewailing his own condition and hers and his past imprudence while the tears ran down his cheeks she still knelt there at his feet looking up into his face with loving beseeching eyes praying him to be comforted and declaring that all would still be well if he would only forget the subject or at any rate cease to speak of it but still he went on wailing complaining of his lot as a child complains and refusing all consolation yes i know said he it has all been my fault but how could i help it what was i to do  papa nobody has said that anything was your fault nobody has thought so  i never spent anything on myselfnever never and yetand yetand yet  look at it with more courage papa after all what harm will it be if i should have to go out and earn my own bread like any other young woman i am not afraid  at last he wept himself into an apathetic tranquillity as though he had at present no further power for any of the energy of grief and she left him while she went about the house and learned how things had gone on during her absence it seemed from the tidings which the servant gave her that he had been ill almost since she had been gone he had at any rate chosen to take his meals in his own room and as far as was remembered had not once left the house since she had been away he had on two or three occasions spoken of mr belton appearing to be anxious for his coming and asking questions as to the cattle and the work that was still going on about the place and clara when she returned to his room tried to interest him again about her cousin but he had in truth been too much distressed by the ill news as to mrs winterfields will to be able to rally himself and the evening that was spent up in his room was very comfortless to both of them clara had her own sorrows to bear as well as her fathers and could take no pleasant look out into the world of her own circumstances she had gained her lover merely to lose himand had lost him under circumstances that were very painful to her womans feeling though he had been for one night betrothed to her as her husband he had never loved her he had asked her to be his wife simply in fulfilment of a deathbed promise the more she thought of it the more bitter did the idea of it become to her and she could not also but think of her cousin poor will he at any rate had loved her though his eagerness in love had been as she told herself but shortlived as she thought of him it seemed but the other day that he had been with her up on the rock in the parkbut as she thought of captain aylmer to whom she had become engaged only yesterday and from whom she had separated herself only that morning she felt that an eternity of time had passed since she had parted from him  on the following day a dull dark melancholy day towards the end of november she went out to saunter about the park leaving her father still in his bedroom and after a while made her way down to the cottage she found mrs askerton as usual alone in the little drawingroom sitting near the window with a book in her hand but clara knew at once that her friend had not been readingthat she had been sitting there looking out upon the clouds with her mind fixed upon things far away the general cheerfulness of this woman had often been cause of wonder to clara who knew how many of her hours were passed in solitude but there did occasionally come upon her periods of melancholy in which she was unable to act up to the settled rule of her life and in which she would confess that the days and weeks and months were too long for her  so you are back said mrs askerton as soon as the first greeting was over  yes i am back  i supposed you would not stay there long after the funeral  no what good could i do  and captain aylmer is still there i suppose  i left him at perivale  there was a slight pause as mrs askerton hesitated before she asked her next question may i be told anything about the will she said  the weary will if you knew how i hated the subject you would not ask me but you must not think i hate it because it has given me nothing  given you nothing  nothing but that does not make me hate it it is the nature of the subject that is so odious i have now told you alleverything that there is to be told though we were to talk for a week if you are generous you will not say another word about it  but i am so sorry  therethats it you wont perceive that the expression of such sorrow is a personal injury to me i dont want you to be sorry  how am i to help it  you need not express it i dont come pitying you for supposed troubles you have plenty of money but if you were so poor that you could eat nothing but cold mutton i shouldnt condole with you as to the state of your larder i should pretend to think that poultry and piecrust were plentiful with you  no you wouldnt dearnot if i were as dear to you as you are to me  well then be sorry and let there be an end of it remember how much of all this i must of necessity have to go through with poor papa  ah yes i can believe that  and he is so far from well of course you have not seen him since i have been gone  no we never see him unless he comes up to the gate there then there was another pause for a moment and what about captain aylmer asked mrs askerton  wellwhat about him  he is the heir now  yeshe is the heir  and that is all  yes that is all what more should there be the poor old house at perivale will be shut up i suppose  i dont care about the old house much as it is not to be your house  noit is not to be my house certainly  there were two ways in which it might have become yours  though there were ten ways none of those ways have come my way said clara  of course i know that you are so close that though there were anything to tell you would not tell it  i think i would tell you anything that was proper to be told but now there is nothing properor improper  was it proper or improper when mr belton made an offer to youas i knew he would do of course as i told you that he would was that so improper that it could not be told  clara was aware that the telltale colour in her face at once took from her the possibility of even pretending that the allegation was untrue and that in any answer she might give she must acknowledge the fact i do not think she said that it is considered fair to gentlemen to tell such stories as that  then i can only say that the young ladies i have known are generally very unfair  but who told you  who told me my maid of course she got it from yours those things are always known  poor will  poor will indeed he is coming here again i hear almost immediately and it neednt be poor will unless you like it but as for me i am not going to be an advocate in his favour i tell you fairly that i did not like what little i saw of poor will  i like him of all things  you should teach him to be a little more courteous in his demeanour to ladies that is all i will tell you something else too about poor willbut not now some other day i will tell you something of your cousin will  clara did not care to ask any questions as to this something that was to be told and therefore took her leave and went away     chapter xiii  mr william belton takes a walk in the country   clara amedroz had made one great mistake about her cousin will belton when she came to the conclusion that she might accept his proffered friendship without any apprehension that the friend would become a lover and she made another equally great when she convinced herself that his love had been as shortlived as it had been eager throughout his journey back to plaistow he had thought of nothing else but his love and had resolved to persevere telling himself sometimes that he might perhaps be successful and feeling sure at other times that he would encounter renewed sorrow and permanent disappointmentbut equally resolved in either mood that he would persevere not to persevere in pursuit of any desired objectlet the object be what it mightwas to his thinking unmanly weak and destructive of selfrespect he would sometimes say of himself joking with other men that if he did not succeed in this or that thing he could never speak to himself again to no man did he talk of his love in such a strain as this but there was a woman to whom he spoke of it and though he could not joke on such a matter the purport of what he said showed the same feeling to be finally rejected and to put up with such rejection would make him almost contemptible in his own eyes  this woman was his sister mary belton something has been already said of this lady which the reader may perhaps remember she was a year or two older than her brother with whom she always lived but she had none of those properties of youth which belonged to him in such abundance she was indeed a poor cripple unable to walk beyond the limits of her own garden feeble in health dwarfed in stature robbed of all the ordinary enjoyments of life by physical deficiencies which made even the task of living a burden to her to eat was a pain or at best a trouble sleep would not comfort her in bed and weariness during the day made it necessary that the hours passed in bed should be very long she was one of those whose lot in life drives us to marvel at the inequalities of human destiny and to inquire curiously within ourselves whether future compensation is to be given  it is said of those who are small and crookedbacked in their bodies that their minds are equally crossgrained and their tempers as ungainly as their stature but no one had ever said this of mary belton her friends indeed were very few in number but those who knew her well loved her as they knew her and there were three or four persons in the world who were ready at all times to swear that she was faultless it was the great happiness of her life that among those three or four her own brother was the foremost will beltons love for his sister amounted almost to veneration and his devotion to her was so great that in all the affairs of his life he was prepared to make her comfort one of his first considerations and she knowing this had come to fear that she might be an embargo on his prosperity and a stumblingblock in the way of his success it had occurred to her that he would have married earlier in life if she had not been as it were in his way and she had threatened him playfullyfor she could be playfulthat she would leave him if he did not soon bring a mistress home to plaistow hall i will go to uncle robert she had said now uncle robert was the clergyman in lincolnshire of whom mention has been made and he was among those two or three who believed in mary belton with an implicit faithas was also his wife i will go to uncle robert will and then you will be driven to get a wife  if my sister ever leaves my house whether there be a wife in it or not will had answered i will never put trust in any woman again  plaistow manorhouse or hall was a fine brick mansion built in the latter days of tudor house architecture with many gables and countless high chimneysvery picturesque to the eye but not in all respects comfortable as are the modern houses of the welltodo squirearchy of england and indeed it was subject to certain objectionable characteristics which in some degree justified the scorn which mr amedroz intended to throw upon it when he declared it to be a farmhouse the gardens belonging to it were large and excellent but they did not surround it and allowed the farm appurtenances to come close up to it on two sides the door which should have been the front door opening from the largest room in the house which had been the hall and which was now the kitchen led directly into the farmyard from the further end of this farmyard a magnificent avenue of elms stretched across the home pasture down to a hedge which crossed it at the bottom that there had been a road through the rows of treesor in other words that there had in truth been an avenue to the house on that sidewas of course certain but now there was no vestige of such road and the front entrance to plaistow hall was by a little path across the garden from a modern road which had been made to run cruelly near to the house such was plaistow hall and such was its mistress of the master the reader i hope already knows so much as to need no further description  as belton drove himself home from the railway station late on that august night he made up his mind that he would tell his sister all his story about clara amedroz she had ever wished that he should marry and now he had made his attempt little as had been her opportunity of learning the ways of men and women from experience in society she had always seemed to him to know exactly what every one should do in every position of life and she would be tender with him giving him comfort even if she could not give him hope moreover mary might be trusted with his secret for belton felt as men always do feel a great repugnance to have it supposed that his suit to a woman had been rejected women when they have loved in vain often almost wish that their misfortune should be known they love to talk about their wounds mysticallytelling their own tales under feigned names and extracting something of a bitter sweetness out of the sadness of their own romance but a man when he has been rejectedrejected with a finality that is acknowledged by himselfis unwilling to speak or hear a word upon the subject and would willingly wash the episode out from his heart if it were possible  but not on that his first night would he begin to speak of clara amedroz he would not let his sister believe that his heart was too full of the subject to allow of his thinking of other matters mary was still up waiting for him when he arrived with tea and cream and fruit ready for him oh mary he said why are you not in bed you know that i would have come to you upstairs she excused herself smiling declaring that she could not deny herself the pleasure of being with him for half an hour on his first return from his travels of course i want to know what they are like she said  he is a nicelooking old man said will and she is a nicelooking young woman  that is graphic and short at any rate  and he is weak and silly but she is strong andandand  not silly also i hope  anything but that i should say she is very clever  im afraid you dont like her will  yes i do  really  yes really  and did she take your coming well  very well i think she is much obliged to me for going  and mr amedroz  he liked my coming toovery much  whatafter that cold letter  yes indeed i shall explain it all by degrees i have taken a lease of all the land and im to go back at christmas and as to the old gentlemanhed have me live there altogether if i would  why will  is it not odd im so glad i didnt make up my mind not to go when i got that letter and yet i dont know these last words he added slowly and in a low voice and mary at once knew that everything was not quite as it ought to be  is there anything wrong will  no nothing wrong that is to say there is nothing to make me regret that i went i think i did some good to them  it was to do good to them that you went there  they wanted to have some one near them who could be to them as one of their own family he is too oldtoo much worn out to be capable of managing things and the people there were of course robbing him i think i have put a stop to that  and you are to go again at christmas  yes they can do without me at my uncles and you will be there i have taken the land and already bought some of the stock for it and am going to buy more  i hope you wont lose money will  nonot ultimately that is i shall get the place in good condition and i shall have paid myself when he goes in that way if in no other besides whats a little money i owe it to them for robbing her of her inheritance  you do not rob her will  it is hard upon her though  does she feel it hard  whatever may be her feelings on such a matter she is a woman much too proud to show them  i wish i knew whether you liked her or not  i do like heri love her better than any one in the world better even than you mary for i have asked her to be my wife  oh will  and she has refused me now you know the whole of itthe whole history of what i have done while i have been away and he stood up before her with his thumbs thrust into the armholes of his waistcoat with something serious and almost solemn in his gait in spite of a smile which played about his mouth  oh will  i meant to have told you of course maryto have told you everything but i did not mean to tell it tonight only it has somehow fallen from me out of the full heart the mouth speaks they say  i never can like her if she refuses your love  why not that is unlike you mary why should she be bound to love me because i love her  is there any one else will  how can i tell i did not ask her i would not have asked her for the world though i would have given the world to know  and she is so very beautiful  beautiful it isnt that so muchthough she is beautiful butbuti cant tell you whybut she is the only girl that i ever saw who would suit me for a wife oh dear  my own will  but im not going to keep you up all night mary and ill tell you something else im not going to break my heart for love and ill tell you something else again im not going to give it up yet i believe ive been a fool indeed i know ive been a fool i went about it just as if i were buying a horse and had told the seller that that was my pricehe might take it or leave it what right had i to suppose that any girl was to be had in that way much less such a girl as clara amedroz  it would have been a great match for her  im not so sure of that mary her education has been different from mine and it may well be that she should marry above me but i swear i will not speak another word to you tonight tomorrow if youre well enough ill talk to you all day soon after that he did get her to go up to her room though of course he broke that oath of his as to not speaking another word after that he walked out by moonlight round the house wandering about the garden and farmyard and down through the avenue having in his own mind some pretence of the watchfulness of ownership but thinking little of his property and much of his love here was a thing that he desired with all his heart but it seemed to be out of his reachabsolutely out of his reach he was sick and weary with a feeling of longingsick with that covetousness wherewith ahab coveted the vineyard of naboth what was the world to him if he could not have this thing on which he had set his heart he had told his sister that he would not break his heart and so much he did not doubt would be true a man or woman with a broken heart was in his estimation a man or woman who should die of love and he did not look for such a fate as that but he experienced the palpable misery of a craving emptiness within his breast and did believe of himself that he never could again be in comfort unless he could succeed with clara amedroz he stood leaning against one of the trees striking his hands together and angry with himself at the weakness which had reduced him to such a state what could any man be worth who was so little master of himself as he had now become  after awhile he made his way back through the farmyard and in at the kitchen door which he locked and bolted and then throwing himself down into a wooden armchair which always stood there in the corner of the huge hearth he took a short pipe from the mantelpiece filled it with tobacco and lighting it almost unconsciously began to smoke with vehemence plaistow hall was already odious to him and he longed to be back at belton which he had left only that morning yes on that very morning she had brought to him his coffee looking sweetly into his faceso sweetly as she ministered to him and he might then well have said one word more in pleading his suit if he had not been too awkward to know what that word should be and was it not his own awkwardness that had brought him to this state of misery what right had he to suppose that any girl should fall in love with such a one as he at first sightwithout a moments notice to her own heart and then when he had her there almost in his arms why had he let her go without kissing her it seemed to him now that if he might have once kissed her even that would have been a comfort to him in his present affliction dtion he said at last as he jumped to his feet and kicked the chair on one side and threw the pipe among the ashes i trust it will be understood that he addressed himself and not his ladylove in this uncivil waydtion then when the chair had been well kicked out of his way he took himself up to bed i wonder whether claras heart would have been hardened or softened towards him had she heard the oath and understood all the thoughts and motives which had produced it  on the next morning poor mary belton was too ill to come downstairs and as her brother spent his whole day out upon the farm remaining among reapers and wheat stacks till nine oclock in the evening nothing was said about clara on that day then there came a sunday and it was a matter of course that the subject of which they both were thinking should be discussed will went to church and as was their custom on sundays they dined immediately on his return then as the afternoon was very warm he took her out to a favourite seat she had in the garden and it became impossible that they could longer abstain  and you really mean to go again at christmas she asked  certainly i shalli promised  then i am sure you will  and i must go from time to time because of the land i have taken indeed there seems to be an understanding that i am to manage the property for mr amedroz  and does she wish you to go  yesshe says so  girls i believe think sometimes that men are indifferent in their love they suppose that a man can forget it at once when he is not accepted and that things can go on just as before  i suppose she thinks so of me said belton wofully  she must either think that or else be willing to give herself the chance of learning to like you better  theres nothing of that im sure shes as true as steel  but she would hardly want you to go there unless she thought you might overcome either your love or her indifference she would not wish you to be there that you might be miserable  before i had asked her to be my wife i had promised to be her brother and so i will if she should ever want a brother i am not going to desert her because she will not do what i want her to do or be what i want her to be she understands that there is to be no quarrel between us  but she would be heartless if she were to encourage you to be with her simply for the assistance you may give her knowing at the same time that you could not be happy in her presence  she is not heartless  then she must suppose that you are  i dare say she doesnt think that i care much about it when i told her i did it all of a heap you see and i fancy she thought i was just mad at the time  and did you speak about it again  no not a word i shouldnt wonder if she hadnt forgotten it before i went away  that would be impossible  you wouldnt say so if you knew how it was done it was all over in half an hour and she had given me such an answer that i thought i had no right to say anything more about it the morning when i left her she did seem to be kinder  i wish i knew whether she cares for any one else  ah i so often think of that but i couldnt ask her you know i had no right to pry into her secrets when i came away she got up to see me off and i almost felt tempted to carry her into the gig and drive her off  i dont think that would have done will  i dont suppose anything will do we all know what happens to the child who cries for the top brick of the chimney the child has to do without it the child goes to bed and forgets it but i go to bedand cant forget it  my poor will  then he got up and shook himself and stalked about the gardenalways keeping within a few yards of his sisters chairand carried on a strong battle within his breast struggling to get the better of the weakness which his love produced though resolved that the love itself should be maintained  i wish it wasnt sunday he said at last because then i could go and do something if i thought that no one would see me id fill a dungcart or two even though it is sunday ill tell you whatill go and take a walk as far as denvir sluice and ill be back to tea you wont mind  denvir sluice is eight miles off  exactlyill be there and back in something over three hours  but willtheres a broiling sun  it will do me good anything that will take something out of me is what i want i know i ought to stay and read to you but i couldnt do it ive got the fidgets inside if you know what that means to have the big hayrick on fire or something of that sort is what would do me most good  then he started and did walk to denvir sluice and back in three hours the road from plaistow hall to denvir sluice was not in itself interesting it ran through a perfectly flat country without a tree for the greater part of the way it was constructed on the top of a great bank by the side of a broad dike and for five miles its course was straight as a line a country walk less picturesque could hardly be found in england the road too was very dusty and the sun was hot above beltons head as he walked but nevertheless he persevered going on till he struck his stick against the waterfall which was called denvir sluice and then returnednot once slackening his pace and doing the whole distance at a rate somewhat above five miles an hour they used to say in the nursery that cold pudding is good to settle a mans love but the receipt which belton tried was a walk of sixteen miles along a dusty road after dinner in the middle of an august day  i think it did him some good when he got back he took a long draught of homebrewed beer and then went upstairs to dress himself  what a state you are in mary said to him when he showed himself for a moment in the sittingroom  i did it from milestone to milestone in eleven minutes backwards and forwards all along the fivemile reach  then mary knew from his answer that the exercise had been of service to him perceiving that he had been able to take an interest in his own prowess as a walker  i only hope you wont have a fever she said  the people who stand still are they who get fevers he answered hard work never does harm to any one if john bowden would walk his five miles an hour on a sunday afternoon he wouldnt have the gout so often  john bowden was a neighbour in the next parish and mary was delighted to find that her brother could take a pride in his performance  by degrees miss belton began to know with some accuracy the way in which will had managed his affairs at belton castle and was enabled to give him salutary advice  you see will she said ladies are different from men in this that they cannot allow themselves to be in love so suddenly  i dont see how a person is to help it it isnt like jumping into a river which a person can do or not just as he pleases  but i fancy it is something like jumping into a river and that a person can help it what the person cant help is being in when the plunge has once been made  no by george theres no getting out of that river  and ladies dont take the plunge till theyve had time to think what may come after it perhaps you were a little too sudden with our cousin clara  of course i was of course i was a fool and a brute too  i know you were not a brute and i dont think you were a fool but yet you were too sudden you see a lady cannot always make up her mind to love a man merely because she is askedall in a moment she should have a little time to think about it before she is called upon for an answer  and i didnt give her two minutes  you never do give two minutes to anyonedo you will but youll be back there at christmas and then she will have had time to turn you and it over in her mind  and you think that i may have a chance  certainty you may have a chance  although she was so sure about it  she spoke of her own mind and her own heart as she knew them then but it depends chiefly on this willwhether there is any one else for anything we know she may be engaged now  of course she may then belton speculated on the extreme probability of such a contingency arguing within his own heart that of course every unmarried man who might see clara would want to marry her and that there could not but be some one whom even she would be able to love  when he had been home about a fortnight there came a letter to him from clara which was a great treasure to him in truth it simply told him of the completion of the cattleshed of her fathers health and of the milk which the little cow gave but she signed herself his affectionate cousin and the letter was very gratifying to him there were two lines of a postscript which could not but flatter himpapa is so anxious for christmas that you may be here againand so indeed am i also of course it will be understood that this was written before claras visit to perivale and before mrs winterfields death indeed much happened in claras history between the writing of that letter and will beltons winter visit to the castle  but christmas came at last all too slowly for willand he started on his journey on this occasion he arranged to stay a week in london having a lawyer there whom he desired to see and thinking perhaps that a short time spent among the theatres might assist him in his love troubles     chapter xiv  mr william belton takes a walk in london   at the time of my story there was a certain mr green a worthy attorney who held chambers in stone buildings lincolns inn much to the profit of himself and familyand to the profit and comfort also of a numerous body of clientsa man much respected in the neighbourhood of chancery lane and beloved i do not doubt in the neighbourhood of bushey in which delightfully rural parish he was possessed of a genteel villa and ornamental garden with mr greens private residence we shall i believe have no further concern but to him at his chambers in stone buildings i must now introduce the reader of these memoirs he was a man not yet forty years of age with still much of the salt of youth about him a pleasant companion as well as a good lawyer and one who knew men and things in london as it is given to pleasant clever fellows such as joseph green to know them now mr green and his father before him had been the legal advisers of the amedroz family and our mr joseph green had had but a bad time of it with charles amedroz in the last years of that unfortunate young mans life but lawyers endure these troubles submitting themselves to the extravagances embarrassments and even villany of the bad subjects among their clients families with a goodhumoured patience that is truly wonderful that however was all over now as regarded mr green and the amedrozes and he had nothing further to do but to save for the father what relics of the property he might secure and he was also legal adviser to our friend will belton there having been some old family connection among them and had often endeavoured to impress upon his old client at belton castle his own strong conviction that the heir was a generous fellow who might be trusted in everything but this had been taken amiss by the old squire who indeed was too much disposed to take all things amiss and to suspect everybody i understand he had said to his daughter i know all about it belton and mr green have been dear friends always i cant trust my own lawyer any longer in all which the old squire showed much ingratitude it will however be understood that these suspicions were rife before the time of beltons visit to the family estate  some four or five days before christmas there came a visitor to mr green with whom the reader is acquainted and who was no less a man than the member for perivale captain aylmer when clara parted from him on the morning of her return to belton castle had resolved that he would repeat his offer of marriage by letter a month had passed by since then and he had not as yet repeated it but his intention was not altered he was a deliberate man who did not do such things quite as quickly as his rival and who upon this occasion had thought it prudent to turn over more than once in his mind all that he proposed to do nor had he as yet taken any definite steps as to that fifteen hundred pounds which he had promised to clara in her aunts name and which clara had been and was so unwilling to receive he had now actually paid it over having purchased government stock in claras name for the amount and had called upon mr green in order that that gentleman as claras lawyer might make the necessary communication to her  i suppose theres nothing further to be done asked captain aylmer  nothing further by me said the lawyer of course i shall write to her and explain that she must make arrangements as to the interest i am very glad that her aunt thought of her in her last moments  mrs winterfield would have provided for her before had she known that everything had been swallowed up by that unfortunate young man  alls well that ends well fifteen hundred pounds are better than nothing  is it not enough said the captain blushing  it isnt for me to have an opinion about that captain aylmer it depends on the nature of the claim and that again depends on the relative position of the aunt and niece when they were alive together  you are aware that miss amedroz was not mrs winterfields niece  do not think for a moment that i am criticising the amount of the legacy i am very glad of it as without it there was literally no provisionno provision at all  you will write to herself  oh yes certainly to herself she is a better man of business than her fatherand then this is her own to do as she likes with it  she cant refuse it i suppose  refuse it  even though she did not wish to take it it would be legally her property just as though it had been really left by the will  well i dont know i dare say you could have resisted the payment but that has been made now and there seems to be an end of it  at this moment a clerk entered the room and handed a card to his employer heres the heir himself said mr green  what heir  will beltonthe heir of the property which mr amedroz holds captain aylmer had soon explained that he was not personally acquainted with mr william belton but having heard much about him declared himself anxious to make the acquaintance our friend will therefore was ushered into the room and the two rivals for claras favour were introduced to each other each had heard much of the other and each had heard of the other from the same person but captain aylmer knew much more as to belton than belton knew in respect to him aylmer knew that belton had proposed to clara and had been rejected and he knew also that belton was now again going down to somersetshire  you are to spend your christmas i believe with our friends at belton castle said the captain  yesand am now on my way there i believe you know them alsointimately then there was some explanation as to the winterfield connection a few remarks as to the precarious state of the old squires health a message or two from captain aylmer which of course were of no importance and the captain took his leave  then green and belton became very comfortably intimate in their conversation calling each other will and joefor they were old and close friends and they discussed matters in that cozy tone of confidential intercourse which is so directly at variance with the tones used by men when they ordinarily talk of business he has brought me good news for your friend miss amedroz said the lawyer  what good news  that aunt of hers left her fifteen hundred pounds after all or rather she did not leave it but desired on her deathbed that it might be given  thats the same thing i suppose  oh quitethat is to say its the same thing if the person who has to hand over the money does not dispute the legacy but it shows how the old ladys conscience pricked her at last and after all it was a shabby sum and should have been three times as much  fifteen hundred pounds and that is all she will have when her father dies  every farthing will youll take all the rest  i wish she wasnt going to have that  why why on earth should you of all men grudge her such a moderate maintenance seeing that you have not got to pay it  it isnt a maintenance how could it be a maintenance for such as her what sort of maintenance would it be  much better than nothing and so you would feel if she were your daughter  she shall be my daughter or my sister or whatever you like to call her you dont think that ill take the whole estate and leave her to starve on the interest of fifteen hundred pounds a year  youd better make her your wife at once will  will belton blushed as he answered that perhaps would be easier said than done that is not in my powereven if i should wish it but the other is in my power  will take my advice and dont make any romantic promises when you are down at belton youll be sure to regret them if you do and you should remember that in truth miss amedroz has no greater claim on you than any other lady in the land  isnt she my cousin  wellyes she is your cousin but a distant one only and im not aware that cousinship gives any claim  who is she to have a claim on im the nearest she has got besides am not i going to take all the property which ought to be hers  thats just it theres no such ought in the case the property is as much your own as this poker is mine thats exactly the mistake i want you to guard against if you liked her and chose to marry her that would be all very well presuming that you dont want to get money in marriage  i hate the idea of marrying for money  all right then marry miss amedroz if you please but dont make any rash undertakings to be her father or her brother or her uncle or her aunt such romance always leads a man into trouble  but ive done it already  what do you mean  ive told her that i would be her brother and that as long as i had a shilling she should never want sixpence and i mean it and as for what you say about romance and repenting it that simply comes from your being a lawyer  thank ye will  if one goes to a chemist of course one gets physic and has to put up with the bad smells  thank you again  but the chemist may be a very good sort of fellow at home all the same and have a cupboard full of sweetmeats and a garden full of flowers however the thing is done as far as i am concerned and i can almost find it in my heart to be sorry that clara has got this driblet of money fifteen hundred pounds it would keep her out of the workhouse and that is about all  if you knew how many ladies in her position would think that the heavens had rained wealth upon them if some one would give them fifteen hundred pounds  very well at any rate i wont take it away from her and now i want you to tell me something else do you remember a fellow we used to know named berdmore  philip berdmore  he may have been philip or daniel or jeremiah for anything i know but the man i mean was very much given to taking his liquor freely  that was jack berdmore philips brother oh yes i remember him hes dead now he drank himself to death at last out in india  he was in the army  yesand what a pleasant fellow he was at times i see phil constantly and phils wife but they never speak of jack  he got married didnt he after we used to see him  oh yeshe and phil married sisters it was a sad affair that  i remember being with him and herand the sister too after they were engaged and he got so drunk that we were obliged to take him away there was a large party of us at richmond but i dont think you were there  but i heard of it  and she was a miss vigo  exactly i see the younger sister constantly phil isnt very rich and hes got a lot of childrenbut hes very happy  what became of the other sister  of jacks wife  yes what became of her  i havent an idea something bad i suppose as they never speak of her  and how long is he dead  he died about three years since i only knew it from phils telling me that he was in mourning for him then he did speak of him for a moment or two and i came to know that he had carried on to the end in the same way if a fellow takes to drink in this country hell never get cured in india  i suppose not  never  and now i want to find out something about his widow  and why  ahim not sure that i can tell you why indeed im sure that i cannot but still you might be able to assist me  there were heaps of people who used to know the vigos said the lawyer  no end of peoplethough i couldnt for the life of me say who any of them were  they used to come out in london with an aunt but nobody knew much about her i fancy they had neither father nor mother  they were very pretty  and how well they danced i dont think i ever knew a girl who danced so pleasantlygiving herself no airs you knowas mary vigo  her name was mary said belton remembering that mrs askertons name was also mary  jack berdmore married mary  well now joe you must find out for me what became of her was she with her husband when he died  nobody was with him phil told me so no one that is but a young lieutenant and his own servant it was very sad he had dt and all that sort of thing  and where was she  at jericho for anything that i know  will you find out then mr joseph green thought for a moment of his capabilities in that line and having made an engagement to dine with his friend at his club on the evening before will left london said at last that he thought he could find out through certain mutual friends who had known the berdmores in the old days but the fact is said the lawyer that the world is so goodnaturedinstead of being illnatured as people saythat it always forgets those who want to be forgotten  we must now go back for a few moments to captain aylmer and his affairs having given a full month to the consideration of his position as regarded miss amedroz he made up his mind to two things in the first place he would at once pay over to her the money which was to be hers as her aunts legacy and then he would renew his offer to that latter determination he was guided by mixed motivesby motives which when joined together rarely fail to be operative his conscience told him that he ought to do soand then the fact of her having as it were taken herself away from him made him again wish to possess her and there was another cause which perhaps operated in the same direction he had consulted his mother and she had strongly advised him to have nothing further to do with miss amedroz lady aylmer abused her dead sister heartily for having interfered in the matter and endeavoured to prove to her son that he was released from his promise by having in fact performed it but on this point his conscience interferedbacked by his wishesand he made his resolve as has been above stated on leaving mr greens chambers he went to his own lodgings and wrote his letter as follows      mount street december 186     dearest clara     when you parted from me at perivale you said certain    things about our engagement which i have come to    understand better since then than i did at the time    it escaped from me that my dear aunt and i had had some    conversation about you and that i had told her what was    my intention something was said about a promise and i    think it was that word which made you unhappy at such a    time as that when i and my aunt were talking together    and when she was as she well knew on her deathbed    things will be said which would not be thought of in other    circumstances i can only assure you now that the promise    i gave her was a promise to do that which i had previously    resolved upon doing if you can believe what i say on this    head that ought to be sufficient to remove the feeling    which induced you to break our engagement     i now write to renew my offer to you and to assure you    that i do so with my whole heart you will forgive me if    i tell you that i cannot fail to remember and always to    bear in my mind the sweet assurances which you gave me of    your regard for myself as i do not know that anything has    occurred to alter your opinion of me i write this letter    in strong hope that it may be successful i believe that    your fear was in respect to my affection for you not as    to yours for me if this was so i can assure you that    there is no necessity for such fear     i need not tell you that i shall expect your answer with    great anxiety     yours most affectionately     f f aylmer     ps i have today caused to be bought in your name bank    stock to the amount of fifteen hundred pounds the amount    of the legacy coming to you from my aunt   this letter and that from mr green respecting the money both reached clara on the same morning now having learned so much as to the position of affairs at belton castle we may return to will and his dinner engagement with mr joseph green  and what have you heard about mrs berdmore belton asked almost as soon as the two men were together  i wish i knew why you want to know  i dont want to do anybody any harm  do you want to do anybody any good  any good i cant say that i want to do any particular good the truth is i think i know where she is and that she is living under a false name  then you know more of her than i do  i dont know anything im only in doubt but as the lady i mean lives near to friends of mine i should like to know  that you may expose her  noby no means but i hate the idea of deceit the truth is that any one living anywhere under a false name should be exposedor should be made to assume their right name  i find that mrs berdmore left her husband some years before he died there was nothing in that to create wonder for he was a man with whom a woman could hardly continue to live but i fear she left him under protection that was injurious to her character  and how long ago is that  i do not know some years before his death  and how long ago did he die  about three years since my informant tells me that he believes she has since married now you know all that i know and belton also knew that mrs askerton of the cottage was the miss vigo with whom he had been acquainted in earlier years  after that they dined comfortably and nothing passed between them which need be recorded as essential to our story till the time came for them to part then when they were both standing at the club door the lawyer said a word or two which is essential so youre off tomorrow said he  yes i shall go down by the express  i wish you a pleasant journey bytheby i ought to tell you that you wont have any trouble in being either father or mother or uncle or aunt to miss amedroz  why not  i suppose its no secret  whats no secret  shes going to be married to captain aylmer  then will belton started so violently and assumed on a sudden so manifest a look of anger that his tale was at once told to mr green who says so he asked i dont believe it  im afraid its true all the same will  who says it  captain aylmer was with me today and he told me he ought to be good authority on such a subject  he told you that he was going to marry clara amedroz  yes indeed  and what made him come to you to tell you  there was a question about some money which he had paid to her and which under existing circumstances he thought it as well that he should not pay matters of that kind are often necessarily told to lawyers but i should not have told it to you will if i had not thought that it was good news  it is not good news said belton moodily  at any rate old fellow my telling it will do no harm you must have learned it soon and he put his hand kindlyalmost tenderly on the others arm but belton moved himself away angrily the wound had been so lately inflicted that he could not as yet forgive the hand that had seemed to strike him  im sorry that it should be so bad with you will  what do you mean by bad it is not bad with me it is very well with me keep your pity for those who want it then he walked off by himself across the broad street before the club door leaving his friend without a word of farewell and made his way up into st jamess square choosing as was evident to mr green the first street that would take him out of sight  hes hit and hit hard said the lawyer looking after him poor fellow i might have guessed it from what he said i never knew of his caring for any woman before then mr green put on his gloves and went away home  we will now follow will belton into st jamess square and we shall follow a very unhappy gentleman doubtless he had hitherto known and appreciated the fact that miss amedroz had refused his offer and had often declared both to himself and to his sister his conviction that that refusal would never be reversed but in spite of that expressed conviction he had lived on hope till she belonged to another man she might yet be his he might win her at last by perseverance at any rate he had it in his power to work towards the desired end and might find solace even in that working and the misery of his loss would not be so great to himas he found himself forced to confess to himself before he had completed his wanderings on this nightin not having her for his own as it would be in knowing that she had given herself to another man he had often told himself that of course she would become the wife of some man but he had never yet realised to himself what it would be to know that she was the wife of any one specified rival he had been sad enough on that moonlight night in the avenue at plaistowwhen he had leaned against the tree striking his hands together as he thought of his great want but his unhappiness then had been as nothing to his agony now now it was all overand he knew the man who had supplanted him  how he hated him with what an unchristian spirit did he regard that worthy captain as he walked across st jamess square across jermyn street across piccadilly and up bond street not knowing whither he was going he thought with an intense regret of the laws of modern society which forbid duellingforgetting altogether that even had the old law prevailed the conduct of the man whom he so hated would have afforded him no casus belli but he was too far gone in misery and animosity to be capable of any reason on the matter captain aylmer had interfered with his dearest wishes and during this now passing hour he would willingly have crucified captain aylmer had it been within his power to do so till he had gone beyond oxford street and had wandered away into the far distance of portman square and baker street he had not begun to think of any interest which clara amedroz might have in the matter on which his thoughts were employed he was sojourning at an hotel in bond street and had gone thitherwards more by habit than by thought but he had passed the door of his inn feeling it to be impossible to render himself up to his bed in his present disturbed mood as he was passing the house in bond street he had been intent on the destruction of captain aylmerand had almost determined that if captain aylmer could not be made to vanish into eternity he must make up his mind to go that road himself  it was out of the question that he should go down to belton as to that he had come to a very decided opinion by the time that he had crossed oxford street go down to see her when she had treated him after this fashion no indeed she wanted no brother now she had chosen to trust herself to this other man and he will belton would not interfere further in her affairs then he drew upon his imagination for a picture of the future in which he portrayed captain aylmer as a ruined man who would probably desert his wife and make himself generally odious to all his acquaintancea picture as to the realisation of which i am bound to say that captain aylmers antecedents gave no probability but it was the looking at this selfdrawn picture which first softened the artists heart towards the victim whom he had immolated on his imaginary canvas when clara should be ruined by the baseness and villany and general scampishness of this man whom she was going to marryto whom she was about to be weak enough and fool enough to trust herselfthen he would interpose and be her brother once againa brokenhearted brother no doubt but a brother efficacious to keep the wolf from the door of this poor woman and herchildren then as he thus created captain aylmers embryo family of unprovided orphansfor after a while he killed the captain making him to die some death that was very disgraceful but not very distinct even to his own imaginationas he thought of those coming pledges of a love which was to him so bitter he stormed about the streets performing antics of which no one would have believed him capable who had known him as the thriving mr william belton of plaistow hall among the fens of norfolk  but the character of a man is not to be judged from the pictures which he may draw or from the antics which he may play in his solitary hours those who act generally with the most consummate wisdom in the affairs of the world often meditate very silly doings before their wiser resolutions form themselves i beg therefore that mr belton may be regarded and criticised in accordance with his conduct on the following morningwhen his midnight rambles which finally took him even beyond the new road had been followed by a few tranquil hours in his bond street bedroomfor at last he did bring himself to return thither and put himself to bed after the usual fashion he put himself to bed in a spirit somewhat tranquillised by the exercise of the night and at lastwept himself to sleep like a baby  but he was by no means like a baby when he took him early on the following morning to the paddington station and booked himself manfully for taunton he had had time to recognise the fact that he had no ground of quarrel with his cousin because she had preferred another man to him this had happened to him as he was recrossing the new road about two oclock and was beginning to find that his legs were weary under him and indeed he had recognised one or two things before he had gone to sleep with his tears dripping on to his pillow in the first place he had illtreated joe green and had made a fool of himself in his friends presence as joe green was a sensible kindhearted fellow this did not much signifybut not on that account did he omit to tell himself of his own fault then he discovered that it would ill become him to break his word to mr amedroz and to his daughter and to do so without a word of excuse because clara had exercised a right which was indisputably her own he had undertaken certain work at belton which required his presence and he would go down and do his work as though nothing had occurred to disturb him to remain away because of this misfortune would be to show the white feather it would be unmanly all this he recognised as the pictures he had painted faded away from their canvases as to captain aylmer himself he hoped that he might never be called upon to meet him he still hoped that even as he was resolutely cramming his shirts into his portmanteau before he began his journey his cousin clara he thought he could meet and tender to her some expression of good wishes as to her future life without giving way under the effort and to the old squire he could endeavour to make himself pleasant speaking of the relief from all trouble which this marriage with captain aylmer would affordfor now in his cooler moments he could perceive that captain aylmer was not a man apt to ruin himself or his wife and children but to captain aylmer himself he could not bring himself to say pleasant things or to express pleasant wishes she who was to be captain aylmers wife who loved him would of course have told him what had occurred up among the rocks in belton park and if that was so any meeting between will and captain aylmer would be death to the former  thinking of all this he journeyed down to taunton and thinking of all this he made his way from taunton across to belton park     chapter xv  evil words   clara amedroz had received her two letters togetherthat namely from the attorney and that from captain aylmerand the result of those letters is already known she accepted her lovers renewed offer of marriage acknowledging the force of his logic and putting faith in the strength of his assurances this she did without seeking advice from any one who was there from whom she could seek advice on such a matter as thatwho at least was there at belton that her father would as a matter of course bid her accept captain aylmer was she thought certain and she knew well that mrs askerton would do the same she asked no counsel from any one but taking the two letters up to her own room sat down to consider them that which referred to her aunts money together with the postscript in captain aylmers letter on the same subject would be of the least possible moment if she could bring herself to give a favourable answer to the other proposition but should she not be able to do thisshould she hesitate as to doing so at oncethen she must write to the lawyer in very strong terms refusing altogether to have anything to do with the money and in such a case as this not a word could she say to her father either on one subject or on the other  but why should she not accept the offer made to her captain aylmer declared that he had determined to ask her to be his wife before he had made any promise to mrs winterfield if this were in truth so then the very ground on which she had separated herself from him would be removed why should she hesitate in acknowledging to herself that she loved the man and believed him to be true so she sat herself down and answered both the letterswriting to the lawyer first to him she said that nothing need be done about the money or the interest till he should see or hear from captain aylmer again then to captain aylmer she wrote very shortly but very openlywith the same illjudged candour which her spoken words to him had displayed of course she would be his his without hesitation now that she knew that he expressed his own wishes and not merely those of his aunt as to the money she said it would be simply nonsense now for us to have any talk of money it is yours in any way and you had better manage about it as you please i have written an ambiguous letter to mr green which will simply plague him and which you may go and see if you like then she added her postscript in which she said that she should now at once tell her father as the news would remove from his mind all solicitude as to her future position that captain aylmer did go to mr green we already know and we know also that he told mr green of his intended marriage  nothing was said by captain aylmer as to any proposed period for their marriage but that was only natural it was not probable that any man would name a day till he knew whether or not he was accepted indeed clara on thinking over the whole affair was now disposed to find fault rather with herself than with her lover and forgetting his coldness and formality at perivale remembered only the fact of his offer to her and his assurance now received that he had intended to make it before the scene which had taken place between him and his aunt she did find fault with herself telling herself that she had quarrelled with him without sufficient causeand the eager loving candour of her letter to him was attributable to those selfaccusations  papa she said after the postman had gone away from belton so that there might be no possibility of any recall of her letter i have something to tell you which i hope will give you pleasure  it isnt often that i hear anything of that kind said he  but i think that this will give you pleasure i do indeed i am going to be married  going to what  going to be married papa that is if i have your leave of course any offer of that kind that i have accepted is subject to your approval  and i have been told nothing about it  it began at perivale and i could not tell you then you do not ask me who is to be my husband  it is not will belton  poor will no it is not will it is frederic aylmer i think you would prefer him as a soninlaw even to my cousin will  no i shouldnt why should i prefer a man whom i dont even know who lives in london and who will take you away so that i shall never see you again  dear papadont speak of it in that way i thought you would be glad to know that i was to be sososo happy  but why is it to be done this wayof a sudden why didnt he come to me will came to me the very first thing  he couldnt come all the way to belton very wellparticularly as he does not know you  will came here  oh papa dont make difficulties of course that was different he was here when he first thought of it and even then he didnt think very much about it  he did all that he could i suppose  wellyes i dont know how that might be and clara almost laughed as she felt the difficulties into which she was creeping dear will he is much better as a cousin than as a husband  i dont see that at all captain aylmer will not have the belton estate or plaistow hall  surely he is well enough off to take care of a wife he will have the whole of the perivale estate you know  i dont know anything about it according to my ideas of what is proper he should have spoken to me first if he could not come he might have written no doubt my ideas may be oldfashioned and im told that captain aylmer is a fashionable young man  indeed he is not papa he is a hardworking member of parliament  i dont know that he is any better for that people seem to think that if a man is a member of parliament he may do what he pleases there is thompson the member for minehead who has bought some sort of place out by the moors i never saw so vulgar pigheaded a fellow in my life being in parliament used to be something when i was young but it wont make a man a gentleman nowadays it seems to me that none but brewers and tallowchandlers and lawyers go into parliament now will belton could go into parliament if he pleased but he knows better than that he wont make himself such a fool  this was not comfortable to clara but she knew her father and allowed him to go on with his grumbling he would come round by degrees and he would appreciate if he could not be induced to acknowledge the wisdom of the step she was about to take  when is it to be he asked  nothing of that kind has ever been mentioned papa  it had better be soon if i am to have anything to do with it now it was certainly the case that the old man was very ill he had not been out of the house since clara had returned home and though he was always grumbling about his food he could hardly be induced to eat anything when the morsels for which he expressed a wish were got for him  of course you will be consulted papa before anything is settled  i dont want to be in anybodys way my dear  and may i tell frederic that you have given your consent  whats the use of my consenting or not consenting if you had been anxious to oblige me you would have taken your cousin will  oh papa how could i accept a man i didnt love  you seemed to me to be very fond of him at first and i must say i thought he was illtreated  papa papa do not say such things as that to me  what am i to do you tell me and i cant altogether hold my tongue then there was a pause well my dear as for my consent of course you may have itif its worth anything i dont know that i ever heard anything bad about captain aylmer  he had heard nothing bad about captain aylmer clara as she left her father felt that this was very grievous whatever cause she might have had for discontent with her lover she could not but be aware that he was a man whom any father might be proud to welcome as a suitor for his daughter he was a man as to whom no ill tales had ever been toldwho had never been known to do anything wrong or imprudent who had always been more than respectable and as to whose worldly position no exception could be taken she had been entitled to expect her fathers warmest congratulations and her tidings had been received as though she had proposed to give her hand to one whose character and position only just made it not imperative on the father to withhold his consent all this was hard and feeling it to be so she went upstairs all alone and cried bitterly as she thought of it  on the next day she went down to the cottage and saw mrs askerton she went there with the express purpose of telling her friend of her engagementdesirous of obtaining in that quarter the sympathy which her father declined to give her had her communication to him been accepted in a different spirit she might probably have kept her secret from mrs askerton till something further had been fixed about her marriage but she was in want of a few kind words and pined for some of that encouragement which ladies in love usually wish to receive at any rate from some one chosen friend but when she found herself alone with mrs askerton she hardly knew how to tell her news and at first could not tell it at all as that lady was eager in speaking on another subject  when do you expect your cousin mrs askerton asked almost as soon as clara was seated  the day after tomorrow  and he is in london now  he may be i dare say he is but i dont know anything about it  i can tell you then that he is colonel askerton has heard of his being there  you seem to speak of it as though there were some offence in it is there any reason why he should not be in london if he pleases  none in the least i would much rather that he should be there than here  why so will his coming hurt you  i dont like him i dont like him at alland now you know the truth you believe in himi dont you think him to be a fine fellow and a gentleman whereas i dont think him to be either  mrs askerton  this is strong language i know  very strong language  yes my dear but the truth is clara that you and i living together here this sort of hermits life each seeing so much of the other and seeing nothing of anybody else must either be real friends telling each other what we think or we must be nothing we cant go on with the ordinary makebelieves of society saying little civil speeches and not going beyond them therefore i have made up my mind to tell you in plain language that i dont like your cousin and dont believe in him  i dont know what you mean by believing in a man  i believe in you sometimes i have thought that you believe in me and sometimes i have feared that you do not i think that you are good and honest and true and therefore i like to see your face and hear your voicethough it is not often that you say very pleasant things to me  do i say unpleasant things  i am not going to quarrel with younot if i can help it what business has mr belton to go about london making inquiries as to me what have i done to him that he should honour me so far  has he made inquiries  yes he has if you have been contented with me as i amif you are satisfied why should he want to learn more if you have any question to ask me i will answer it but what right can he have to be asking questions among strangers  clara had no question to ask and yet she could not say that she was satisfied she would have been better satisfied to have known more of mrs askerton but yet she had never condescended to make inquiries about her friend but her curiosity was now greatly raised and indeed mrs askertons manner was so strange her vehemence so unusual and her eagerness to rush into dangerous subjects so unlike her usual tranquillity in conversation that clara did not know how to answer her  i know nothing of any questioning she said  i am sure you dont had i thought you did much as i love youvaluable as your society is to me down in this deserti would never speak to you again but rememberif you want to ask any questions and will ask them of meof mei will answer them and will not be angry  but i dont want to ask any questions  you may some day and then you can remember what i say  and am i to understand that you are determined to quarrel with my cousin will  quarrel with him i dont suppose that i shall see him after what i have said it is not probable that you will bring him here and the servant will have orders to say that i am not at home if he should call luckily he and colonel askerton did not meet when he was here before  this is the most strange thing i ever heard in my life  you will understand it better my dear when he makes his communication to you  what communication  youll find that hell have a communication to make he has been so diligent and so sharp that hell have a great deal to tell i do not doubt only remember clara that if anything that he tells you makes any difference in your feelings towards me i shall expect you to come to me and say so openly if he makes his statement let me make mine i have a right to ask for that after what i have promised  you may be sure that i will  i want nothing more i have no distrust in younone in the least i tell you that i believe in you if you will do that and will keep mr william belton out of my way during his visit to these parts i shall be satisfied for some time past mrs askerton had been walking about the room but as she now finished speaking she sat herself down as though the subject was fully discussed and completed for a minute or two she made an effort to resume her usual tranquillity of manner and in doing so attempted to smile as though ridiculing her own energy i knew i should make a fool of myself when you came she said and now i have done it  i dont think you have been a fool at all but you may have been mistaken  very well my dear we shall see its very odd what a dislike i took to that man the first time i saw him  and i am so fond of him  yes he has cozened you as he has your father i am only glad that he did not succeed in cozening you further than he did but i ought to have known you better than to suppose you could give your heart of hearts to one who is  do not abuse him any more  who is so very unlike the sort of people with whom you have lived i may at any rate say that  i dont know that i havent lived much with any one yetexcept papa and my aunt and you  but you know a gentleman when you see him  come mrs askerton i will not stand this i thought you had done with the subject and now you begin again i had come here on purpose to tell you something of real importancethat is to me but i must go away without telling you unless you will give over abusing my cousin  i will not say a word more about himnot at present  i feel so sure that you are mistaken you know  very welland i feel sure that you are mistaken we will leave it so and go to this matter of importance but clara felt it to be very difficult to tell her tidings after such a conversation as that which had just occurred when she had entered the room her mind had been tuned to the subject and she could have found fitting words without much difficulty to herself but now her thoughts had been scattered and her feelings hurt and she did not know how to bring herself back to the subject of her engagement she paused therefore and sat with a doubtful hesitating look meditating some mode of escape i am all ears said mrs askerton and clara thought that she discovered something of ridicule or of sarcasm in the tone of her friends voice  i believe ill put it off till another day she said  why so you dont think that anything really important to you will not be important to me also  im sure of that but somehow  you mean to say that i have ruffled you  wellperhaps a little  then be unruffled again like my own dear honest clara i have been ruffled too but ill be as tranquil now as a drawingroom cat then mrs askerton got up from her chair and seated herself by claras side on the sofa come you cant go till youve told me and if you hesitate i shall think that you mean to quarrel with me  ill come to you tomorrow  no no you shall tell me today all tomorrow youll be preparing for your cousin  what nonsense  or else youll come prepared to vindicate him and then we shant get on any further tell me what it is today you cant leave me in curiosity after what you have said  youve heard of captain aylmer i think  of course ive heard of him  but youve never seen him  you know i never have  i told you that he was at perivale when mrs winterfield died  and now he has proposed and you are going to accept him that will indeed be important is it sosay but dont i know it is so why dont you speak  if you know it why need i speak  but it is so oh clara i am so glad i congratulate you with all my heartwith all my heart my dearest dearest clara what a happy arrangement what a success it is just as it should be dear good man to come forward in that sensible way and put an end to all the little family difficulties  i dont know so much about success who is it that is successful  you to be sure  then by the same measurement he must be unsuccessful  dont be a fool clara  of course i have been successful if ive got a man that i can love as my husband  now my dear dont be a fool of course all that is between you and him and i dont in the least doubt that it is all as it should be if captain aylmer had been the elder brother instead of the younger and had all the aylmer estates instead of the perivale property i know you would not accept him if you did not like him  i hope not  i am sure you would not but when a girl with nothing a year has managed to love a man with two or three thousand a year and has managed to be loved by him in returninstead of going through the same process with the curate or village doctorit is a success and her friends will always think so and when a girl marries a gentleman and a member of parliament instead of well im not going to say anything personalher friends will congratulate her upon his position it may be very wicked and mercenary and all that but its the way of the world  i hate hearing about the world  yes my dear all proper young ladies like you do hate it but i observe that such girls as you never offend its prejudices you cant but know that you would have done a wicked as well as a foolish thing to marry a man without an adequate income  but i neednt marry at all  and what would you live on then come clara we neednt quarrel about that ive no doubt hes charming and beautiful and  he isnt beautiful at all and as for charming  he has charmed you at any rate  he has made me believe that i can trust him without doubt and love him without fear  an excellent man and the income will be an additional comfort youll allow that  ill allow nothing  and when is it to be  ohperhaps in six or seven years  clara  perhaps sooner but theres been no word said about time  is not mr amedroz delighted  not a bit he quite scolded me when i told him  whywhat did he want  you know papa  i know he scolds at everything but i shouldnt have thought he would have scolded at that and when does he come here  who come here  captain aylmer  i dont know that he is coming at all  he must come to be married  all that is in the clouds as yet i did not like to tell you but you mustnt suppose that because ive told you everything is settled nothing is settled  nothing except the one thing  nothing else  it was more than an hour after that before clara went away and when she did so she was surprised to find that she was followed out of the house by colonel askerton it was quite dusk at this time the days being just at their shortest and colonel askerton according to his custom would have been riding or returning from his ride clara had been over two hours at the cottage and had been aware when she reached it that he had not as yet gone out it appeared now that he had not ridden at all and as she remembered to have seen his horse led before the window it at once occurred to her that he had remained at home with the view of catching her as she went away he came up to her just as she was passing through the gate and offered her his right hand as he raised his hat with his left it sometimes happens to all of us in life that we become acquainted with persons intimatelythat is with an assumed intimacywhom in truth we do not know at all we meet such persons frequently often eating and drinking in their company being familiar with their appearance and wellinformed generally as to their concerns but we never find ourselves holding special conversations with them or in any way fitting the modes of our life to the modes of their life accident has brought us together and in one sense they are our friends we should probably do any little kindness for them or expect the same from them but there is nothing in common between us and there is generally a mutual though unexpressed agreement that there shall be nothing in common miss amedroz was intimately acquainted with colonel askerton after this fashion she saw him very frequently and his name was often on her tongue but she rarely if ever conversed with him and knew of his habits only from his wifes words respecting them when therefore he followed her through the garden gate into the park she was driven to suppose that he had something special to say to her  im afraid youll have a dark walk miss amedroz he said  its only just across the park and i know the way so well  yesof course i saw you coming out and as i want to say a word or two i have ventured to follow you when mr belton was down here i did not have the pleasure of meeting him  i remember that you missed each other  yes we did i understand from my wife that he will be here again in a day or two  he will be with us the day after tomorrow  i hope you will excuse my saying that it will be very desirable that we should miss each other again clara felt that her face became red with anger as she listened to colonel askertons words he spoke slowly as was his custom and without any of that violence of expression which his wife had used but on that very account there was more if possible of meaning in his words than in hers william belton was her cousin and such a speech as that which colonel askerton had made spoken with deliberation and unaccompanied by any previous explanation seemed to her almost to amount to insult but as she did not know how to answer him at the spur of the moment she remained silent then he continued you may be sure miss amedroz that i should not make so strange a request to you if i had not good reason for making it  i think it a very strange request  and nothing but a strong conviction of its propriety on my part would have induced me to make it  if you do not want to see my cousin why cannot you avoid him without saying anything to me on the subject  because you would not then have understood as thoroughly as i wish you to do why i kept out of his way for my wifes sakeand for yours if you will allow me to say soi do not wish to come to any open quarrel with him but if we met a quarrel would i think be inevitable mary has probably explained to you the nature of his offence against us  mrs askerton has told me something as to which i am quite sure that she is mistaken  i will say nothing about that as i have no wish at all to set you against your cousin i will bid you goodnight now as you are close at home then he turned round and left her  clara as she thought of all this could not but call to mind her cousins remembrances about miss vigo and mr berdmore what if he made some inquiry as to the correctness of his old recollections nothing she thought could be more natural and then she reflected that in the ordinary way of the world persons feel none of that violent objection to the asking of questions about their antecedents which was now evinced by both colonel and mrs askerton but of one thing she felt quite assuredthat her cousin will belton would make no inquiry which he ought not to make and would make no improper use of any information which he might obtain     chapter xvi  the heirs second visit to belton   clara began to doubt whether any possible arrangement of the circumstances of her life could be regarded as fortunate she was very fond in a different degree and after a different fashion of both captain aylmer and mr belton as regarded both her position was now exactly what she herself would have wished the man that she loved was betrothed to her and the other man whom she loved indeed also as a brother was coming to her in that guisewith the understanding that that was to be his position and yet everything was going wrong her father though he did not actually say anything against captain aylmer showed by a hundred little signs of which he was a skilful master that the aylmer alliance was distasteful to him and that he thought himself to be aggrieved in that his daughter would not marry her cousin whereas over at the cottage there was a still more bitter feeling against mr beltona feeling so bitter that it almost induced clara to wish that her cousin was not coming to them  but the cousin did come and was driven up to the door in the gig from taunton just as had been the case on his previous visit then however he had come in the full daylight and the haycarts had been about and all the prettiness and warmth of summer had been there now it was midwinter and there had been some slight beginnings of snow and the wind was moaning about the old tower and the outside of the house looked very unpleasant from the halldoor as it had become dusk in the afternoon the old squire had been very careful in his orders as to preparations for wills comfortas though clara would have forgotten all those things in the preoccupation of her mind caused by the constancy of her thoughts towards wills rival he even went so far as to creep across the upstairs landingplace to see that the fire was lighted in wills room this being the first time that he had left his chamber for many daysand had given special orders as to the food which was to be prepared for wills dinnerin a very different spirit from that which had dictated some former orders when will was about to make his first visit and when his coming had been regarded by the old man as a heartless indelicate and almost hostile proceeding  i wish i could go down to receive him said mr amedroz plaintively i hope he wont take it amiss  you may be sure he wont do that  perhaps i can tomorrow  dear papa you had better not think of it till the weather is milder  milder how is it to get milder at this time of the year  of course hell come up to you papa  hes very good i know hes very good no one else would do as much  clara understood accurately what all this meant of course she was glad that her father should feel so kindly towards her cousin and think so much of his coming but every word said by the old man in praise of will belton implied an equal amount of dispraise as regarded captain aylmer and contained a reproach against his daughter for having refused the former and accepted the latter  clara was in the hall when belton arrived and received him as he entered enveloped in his damp greatcoats it is so good of you to come in such weather she said  nice seasonable weather i call it he said it was the same comfortable hearty satisfactory voice which had done so much towards making his way for him on his first arrival at belton castle the voices to which clara was most accustomed were querulousas though the world had been found by the owners of them to be but a bad place but beltons voice seemed to speak of cheery days and happy friends and a general state of things which made life worth having nevertheless fortyeight hours had not yet passed over his head since he was walking about london in such misery that he had almost cursed the hour in which he was born his misery still remained with him as black now as it had been then and yet his voice was cheery the sick birds we are told creep into holes that they may die alone and unnoticed and the wounded beasts hide themselves that their grief may not be seen of their fellows a man has the same instinct to conceal the weakness of his sufferings but if he be a man he hides it in his own heart keeping it for solitude and the watches of the night while to the outer world he carries a face on which his care has made no marks  you will be sorry to hear that papa is too ill to come downstairs  is he indeed i am truly sorry i had heard he was ill but did not know he was so ill as that  perhaps he fancies himself weaker than he is  we must try and cure him of that i can see him i hope  oh dear yes he is most anxious for you to go to him as soon as ever you can come upstairs i will take you he had already stripped himself of his wrappings and declaring himself ready at once followed clara to the squires room  im sorry sir to find you in this way he said  im very poorly willvery said the squire putting out his hand as though he were barely able to lift it above his knee now it certainly was the fact that half an hour before he had been walking across the passage  we must see if we cant soon make you better among us said will  the squire shook his head with a slow melancholy movement not raising his eyes from the ground i dont think youll ever see me much better will he said and yet half an hour since he had been talking of being down in the diningroom on the next day i shant trouble you much longer said the squire youll soon have it all without paying rent for it  this was very unpleasant and almost frustrated beltons attempts to be cheery but he persevered nevertheless itll be a long time yet before that day comes sir  ah thats easily said but never mind why should i want to remain when i shall have once seen her properly settled ive nothing to live for except that she may have a home  on this subject it was quite impossible that belton should say anything clara was standing by him and she as he knew was engaged to captain aylmer so circumstanced what could he say as to claras settlement in life that something should be said between him and the old man and something also between him and clara was a matter of course but it was quite out of the question that he should discuss claras prospects in life in presence of them both together  papas illness makes him a little melancholy said clara  of courseof course it always does said will  i think he will be better when the weather becomes milder said clara  i suppose i may be allowed to know how i feel myself said the squire but dont keep will up here when he wants his dinner there thatll do youd better leave me now then will went out to his old room and a quarter of an hour afterwards he found himself seated with clara at the dinnertable and a quarter of an hour after that the dinner was over and they had both drawn their chairs to the fire  neither of them knew how to begin with the other clara was under no obligation to declare her engagement to her cousin but yet she felt that it would be unhandsome in her not to do so had will never made the mistake of wanting to marry her himself she would have done so as a matter of course had she supposed him to cherish any intention of renewing that mistake she would have felt herself bound to tell himso that he might save himself from unnecessary pain but she gave him credit for no such intention and yet she could not but remember that scene among the rocks and then was she or was she not to say anything to him about the askertons with him also the difficulty was as great he did not in truth believe that the tidings which he had heard from his friend the lawyer required corroboration but yet it was necessary that he should know from herself that she had disposed of her handand it was necessary also that he should say some word to her as to their future standing and friendship  you must be very anxious to see how your farm goes on said she  he had not thought much of his agricultural venture at belton for the last three or four days and would hardly have been vexed had he been told that every head of cattle about the place had died of the murrain some general idea of the expediency of going on with a thing which he had commenced still actuated him but it was the principle involved and not the speculation itself which interested him but he could not explain all this and he therefore was driven to some cold agreement with her the farmyou mean the stock yes i shall go and have a look at them early tomorrow i suppose theyre all alive  pudge says that they are doing uncommonly well pudge was a leading man among the belton labourers whom will had hired to look after his concerns  thats all right i dare say pudge knows quite as much about it as i do  but the masters eye is everything  pudges eye is quite as good as mine and probably much better as he knows the country  you used to say that it was everything for a man to look after his own interests  and i do look after them pudge and i will go and have a look at every beast tomorrow and i shall look very wise and pretend to know more about it than he does in stockfarming the chief thing is not to have too many beasts they used to say that halfstocking was whole profit and wholestocking was half profit if the animals have plenty to eat and the rent isnt too high theyll take care of their owner  but then there is so much illness  i always insure  clara perceived that the subject of the cattle didnt suit the present occasion when he had before been at belton he had liked nothing so much as talking about the cattlesheds and the land and the kind of animals which would suit the place but now the novelty of the thing was goneand the farmer did not wish to talk of his farm in her anxiety to find a topic which would not be painful she went from the cattle to the cow you cant think what a pet bessy has been with us and she seems to think that she is privileged to go everywhere and do anything  i hope they have taken care that she has had winter food  winter food why pudge and all the pudges and all the family in the house and all your cattle would have to want before bessy would be allowed to miss a meal pudge always says with his sententious shake of the head that the young squire was very particular about bessy  those alderneys want a little carethats all  bessy was of no better service to clara in her present difficulty than the less aristocratic herd of common cattle there was a pause for a moment and then she began again how did you leave your sister will  much the same as usual i think she has borne the first of the cold weather better than she did last year  i do so wish that i knew her  perhaps you will some day but i dont suppose that you ever will  why not  its not likely that youll ever come to plaistow nowand mary never leaves it except to go to my uncles  clara instantly knew that he had heard of her engagement though she could not imagine from what source he had heard it there was something in the tone of his voicesomething especially in the expression of that word now which told her that it must be so i should be so glad to go there if i could she said with that special hypocrisy which belongs to women and is allowed to them but of course i cannot leave papa in his present state  and if you did leave him you would not go to plaistow  not unless you and mary asked me  and you wouldnt if we did how could you  what do you mean will it seems as though you were almost savage to me  am i welli feel savage but not to you  nor to any one i hope belonging to me she knew that it was all coming that the whole subject of her future life must now be discussed and she began to fear that the discussion might not be easy but she did not know how to give it a direction she feared that he would become angry and yet she knew not why he had accepted his own rejection tranquilly and could hardly take it as an offence that she should now be engaged to captain aylmer  mr green has told me said he that you are going to be married  how could mr green have known  he did knowat least i suppose he knew for he told me  how very odd  i suppose it is true clara did not make any immediate answer and then he repeated the question i suppose it is true  it is true that i am engaged  to captain aylmer  yes to captain aylmer you know that i had known him very long i hope that you are not angry with me because i did not write and tell you strange as it may seem seeing that you had heard it already it is not a week yet since it was settled and had i written to you i could only have addressed my letter to you here  i wasnt thinking about that i didnt specially want you to write to me what difference would it make  but i should have felt that i owed it to your kindness and yourregard for me  my regard whats the use of regard  you are not going to quarrel with me will becausebecausebecause if you had really been my brother as you once said you would be you could not but have approved of what i have done  but i am not your brother  oh will that sounds so cruel  i am not your brother and i have no right to approve or disapprove  i will not say that i could make my engagement with captain aylmer dependent on your approval it would not be fair to him to do so and it would put me into a false position  have i asked you to make any such absurd sacrifice  listen to me will i say that i could not do that but short of that there is nothing i would not do to satisfy you i think so much of your judgment and goodness and so very much of your affection i love you so dearly that oh will say a kind word to me  a kind word yes but what sort of kindness  you must know that captain aylmer  dont talk to me of captain aylmer have i said anything against him have i ventured to make any objection of course i know his superiority to myself i know that he is a man of the world and that i am not that he is educated and that i am ignorant that he has a position and that i have none that he has much to offer and that i have nothing of course i see the difference but that does not make me comfortable  will i had learned to love him before i had ever seen you  why didnt you tell me so that i might have known there was no hope and have gone away utterlyout of the kingdom if it was all settled then why didnt you tell me and save me from breaking my heart with false hopes  nothing was settled then i hardly knew my own mind but yet i loved him there cannot you understand it have i not told you enough  yes i understand it  and do you blame me  he paused awhile before he answered her no i do not blame you i suppose i must blame no one but myself but you should bear with me i was so happy and now i am so wretched  there was nothing that she could say to comfort him she had altogether mistaken the nature of the mans regard and had even mistaken the very nature of the man so much she now learned and could tell herself that had she known him better she would either have prevented this second visit or would have been careful that he should have learned the truth from herself before he came now she could only wait till he should again have got strength to hide his suffering under the veil of his own manliness  i have not a word to say against what you are doing he said at last not a word but you will understand what i mean when i tell you that it is not likely that you will come to plaistow  some day will when you have a wife of your own  very well but we wont talk about that at present if you please when i have things will be different in the meantime your course and mine will be separate you i suppose will be with him in london while i shall beat the devil as likely as not  how can you speak to me in that way is that like being my brother  i dont feel like being your brother however i beg your pardon and now we will have done with it spilt milk cant be helped and my milk pans have got themselves knocked over thats all dont you think we ought to go up to your father again  on the following day belton and mr amedroz discussed the same subject but the conversation went off very quietly will was determined not to exhibit his weakness before the father as he had done before the daughter when the squire with a maundering voice drawled out some expression of regret that his daughters choice had not fallen in another place will was able to say that bygones must be bygones he regretted it also but that was now over and when the squire endeavoured to say a few illnatured words about captain aylmer will stopped him at once by asserting that the captain was all that he ought to be  and it would have made me so happy to think that my daughters child should come to live in his grandfathers old house murmured mr amedroz  and theres no knowing that he maynt do so yet said will but all these things are so doubtful that a man is wrong to fix his happiness upon them after that he went out to ramble about the place and before the third day was over clara was able to perceive that in spite of what he had said he was as busy about the cattle as though his bread depended on them  nothing had been said as yet about the askertons and clara had resolved that their name should not first be mentioned by her mrs askerton had prophesied that will would have some communication to make about herself and clara would at any rate see whether her cousin would of his own accord introduce the subject but three days passed by and he had made no allusion to the cottage or its inhabitants this in itself was singular as the askertons were the only local friends whom clara knew and as belton had become personally acquainted with mrs askerton but such was the case and when mr amedroz once said something about mrs askerton in the presence of both clara and belton they both of them shrank from the subject in a manner that made clara understand that any conversation about the askertons was to be avoided on the fourth day clara saw mrs askerton but then will beltons name was not mentioned there was therefore among them all a sense of some mystery which made them uncomfortable and which seemed to admit of no solution clara was more sure than ever that her cousin had made no inquiries that he should not have made and that he would put no information that he might have to an improper use but of such certainty on her part she could say nothing  three weeks passed by and it seemed as though beltons visit were to come to an end without any further open trouble now and then something was said about captain aylmer but it was very little and belton made no further reference to his own feelings it had come to be understood that his visit was to be limited to a month and to both him and clara the month wore itself away slowly neither of them having much pleasure in the society of the other the old squire came downstairs once for an hour or two and spent the whole time in bitter complaints everything was wrong and everybody was illtreating him even with will he quarrelled or did his best to quarrel in regard to everything about the place though at the same time he did not cease to grumble at his visitor for going away and leaving him belton bore it all so well that the grumbling and quarrelling did not lead to much but it required all his goodhumour and broad common sense to prevent serious troubles and misunderstanding  during the period of her cousins visit at belton clara received two letters from captain aylmer who was spending the christmas holidays with his father and mother and on the day previous to that of her cousins departure there came a third in neither of these letters was there much said about sir anthony but they were all very full of lady aylmer in the first he wrote with something of the personal enthusiasm of a lover and therefore clara hardly felt the little drawbacks to her happiness which were contained in certain innuendoes respecting lady aylmers ideas and lady aylmers hopes and lady aylmers fears clara was not going to marry lady aylmer and did not fear but that she could hold her own against any motherinlaw in the world when once they should be brought face to face and as long as captain aylmer seemed to take her part rather than that of his mother it was all very well the second letter was more trying to her temper as it contained one or two small morsels of advice as to conduct which had evidently originated with her ladyship now there is nothing i take it so irritating to an engaged young lady as counsel from her intended husbands mamma an engaged young lady if she be really in love will take almost anything from her lover as long as she is sure that it comes altogether from himself he may take what liberties he pleases with her dress he may prescribe high church or low churchif he be not as is generally the case in a condition to accept rather than to give prescriptions on that subject he may order almost any course of readingproviding that he supply the books and he may even interfere with the style of dancing and recommend or prohibit partners but he may not thrust his mother down his future wifes throat in answer to the second letter clara did not say much to show her sense of objection indeed she said nothing but in saying nothing she showed her objection and captain aylmer understood it then came the third letter and as it contained matter touching upon our story it shall be given entireand i hope it may be taken by gentlemen about to marry as a fair specimen of the sort of letter they ought not to write to the girls of their hearts      aylmer castle 19th january 186     dearest clarai got your letter of the 16th yesterday    and was sorry you said nothing in reference to my mothers    ideas as to the house at perivale of course she knew that    i heard from you and was disappointed when i was obliged    to tell her that you had not alluded to the subject she    is very anxious about you and having now given her    assent to our marriage is of course desirous of knowing    that her kindly feeling is reciprocated i assured her    that my own clara was the last person to be remiss in such    a matter and reminded her that young ladies are seldom    very careful in their mode of answering letters remember    therefore that i am now your guarantee and send some    message to relieve me from my liability     when i told her of your fathers long illness which she    laments greatly and of your cousins continued presence    at belton castle she seemed to think that mr beltons    visit should not be prolonged when i told her that he was    your nearest relative she remarked that cousins are the    same as any other peoplewhich indeed they are i know    that my clara will not suppose that i mean more by this    than the words convey indeed i mean less but not having    the advantage of a mother of your own you will not be    sorry to know what are my mothers opinions on matters    which so nearly concern you     and now i come to another subject as to which what i    shall say will surprise you very much you know i think    that my aunt winterfield and i had some conversation about    your neighbours the askertons and you will remember    that my aunt whose ideas on such matters were always    correct was a little afraid that your father had not    made sufficient inquiry respecting them before he allowed    them to settle near him as tenants it now turns out that    she isvery far indeed from what she ought to be my    mother at first thought of writing to you about this but    she is a little fatigued and at last resolved that under    all the circumstances it might be as well that i should    tell you it seems that mrs askerton was married before    to a certain captain berdmore and that she left her    first husband during his lifetime under the protection    of colonel askerton i believe they the colonel and    mrs askerton have been since married captain berdmore    died about four years ago in india and it is probable    that such a marriage has taken place but under these    circumstances as lady aylmer says you will at once    perceive that all acquaintance between you and the lady    should be brought to an end indeed your own sense of    what is becoming to you either as an unmarried girl or as    my future wife or indeed as a woman at all will at once    make you feel that this must be so i think if i were    you i would tell the whole to mr amedroz but this i    will leave to your own discretion i can assure you that    lady aylmer has full proof as to the truth of what i tell    you     i go up to london in february i suppose i may hardly hope    to see you before the recess in july or august but i    trust that before that we shall have fixed the day when    you will make me the happiest of men     yours with truest affection     f f aylmer   it was a disagreeable nasty letter from the first line to the last there was not a word in it which did not grate against claras feelingsnot a thought expressed which did not give rise to fears as to her future happiness but the information which it contained about the askertonsthe communication as mrs askerton herself would have called itmade her for the moment almost forget lady aylmer and her insolence could this story be true and if true how far would it be imperative on her to take the hint or rather obey the order which had been given her what steps should she take to learn the truth then she remembered mrs askertons promiseif you want to ask any questions and will ask them of me i will answer them the communication as to which mrs askerton had prophesied had now been madebut it had been made not by will belton whom mrs askerton had reviled but by captain aylmer whose praises mrs askerton had so loudly sung as clara thought of this she could not analyse her own feelings which were not devoid of a certain triumph she had known that belton would not put on his armour to attack a woman captain aylmer had done so and she was hardly surprised at his doing it yet captain aylmer was the man she loved captain aylmer was the man she had promised to marry but in truth she hardly knew which was the man she loved  this letter came on a sunday morning and on that day she and belton went to church together on the following morning early he was to start for taunton at church they saw mrs askerton whose attendance there was not very frequent it seemed indeed as though she had come with the express purpose of seeing belton once during his visit as they left the church she bowed to him and that was all they saw of each other throughout the month that he remained in somersetshire  come to me tomorrow clara mrs askerton said as they all passed through the village together clara muttered some reply having not as yet made up her mind as to what her conduct must be early on the next morning will belton went away and again clara got up to give him his breakfast on this occasion he had no thought of kissing her he went away without having had a word said to him about mrs askerton and then clara settled herself down to the work of deliberation what should she do with reference to the communication that had been made to her by captain aylmer     chapter xvii  aylmer park   aylmer park and the great house of the aylmers together formed an important and as regarded in some minds an imposing country residence the park was large including some three or four hundred acres and was peopled rather thinly by aristocratic deer it was surrounded by an aristocratic paling and was entered at three different points by aristocratic lodges the sheep were more numerous than the deer because sir anthony though he had a large income was not in very easy circumstances the ground was quite flat and though there were thin belts of trees and some ornamental timber here and there it was not well wooded it had no special beauty of its own and depended for its imposing qualities chiefly on its size on its three sets of double lodges and on its oldestablished character as an important family place in the county the house was of stone with a portico of ionic columns which looked as though it hardly belonged of right to the edifice and stretched itself out grandly with two pretentious wings which certainly gave it a just claim to be called a mansion it required a great many servants to keep it in order and the numerous servants required an experienced duenna almost as grand in appearance as lady aylmer herself to keep them in order there was an open carriage and a close carriage and a butler and two footmen and three gamekeepers and four gardeners and there was a coachman and there were grooms and sundry inferior men and boys about the place to do the work which the gardeners and gamekeepers and grooms did not choose to do themselves and they all became fat and lazy and stupid and respectable together so that as the reader will at once perceive aylmer park was kept up in the proper english style sir anthony very often discussed with his steward the propriety of lessening the expenditure of his residence and lady aylmer always attended and probably directed these discussions but it was found that nothing could be done any attempt to remove a gamekeeper or a gardener would evidently throw the whole machinery of aylmer park out of gear if retrenchment was necessary aylmer park must be abandoned and the glory of the aylmers must be allowed to pale but things were not so bad as that with sir anthony the gardeners grooms and gamekeepers were maintained ten domestic servants sat down to four heavy meals in the servants hall every day and lady aylmer contented herself with receiving little or no company and with stingy breakfasts and bad dinners for herself and her husband and daughter by all this it must be seen that she did her duty as the wife of an english country gentleman and properly maintained his rank as a baronet  he was a heavy man over seventy years of age much afflicted with gout and given to no pursuit on earth which was available for his comfort he had been a hunting man and he had shot also but not with that energy which induces a sportsman to carry on those amusements in opposition to the impediments of age he had been and still was a county magistrate but he had never been very successful in the justiceroom and now seldom troubled the county with his judicial incompetence he had been fond of good dinners and good wine and still on occasions would make attempts at enjoyment in that line but the gout and lady aylmer together were too many for him and he had but small opportunity for filling up the blanks of his existence out of the kitchen or cellar he was a big man with a broad chest and a red face and a quantity of white hairand was much given to abusing his servants he took some pleasure in standing with two sticks on the top of the steps before his own front door and railing at any one who came in his way but he could not do this when lady aylmer was by and his dependents knowing his habits had fallen into an illnatured way of deserting the side of the house which he frequented with his eldest son anthony aylmer he was not on very good terms and though there was no positive quarrel the heir did not often come to aylmer park of his son frederic he was proudand the best days of his life were probably those which captain aylmer spent at the house the table was then somewhat more generously spread and this was an excuse for having up the special port in which he delighted altogether his life was not very attractive and though he had been born to a baronetcy and eight thousand ayear and the possession of aylmer park i do not think that he was or had been a happy man  lady aylmer was more fortunate she had occupations of which her husband knew nothing and for which he was altogether unfit though she could not succeed in making retrenchments she could and did succeed in keeping the household books sir anthony could only blow up the servants when they were thoughtless enough to come in his way and in doing that was restricted by his wifes presence but lady aylmer could get at them day and night she had no gout to impede her progress about the house and grounds and could make her way to places which the master never saw and then she wrote many letters daily whereas sir anthony hardly ever took a pen in his hand and she knew the cottages of all the poor about the place and knew also all their sins of omission and commission she was driven out too every day summer and winter wet and dry and consumed enormous packets of wool and worsted which were sent to her monthly from york and she had a companion in her daughter whereas sir anthony had no companion wherever lady aylmer went miss aylmer went with her and relieved what might otherwise have been the tedium of her life she had been a beauty on a large scale and was still aware that she had much in her personal appearance which justified pride she carried herself uprightly with a commanding nose and broad forehead and though the graces of her own hair had given way to a front there was something even in the front which added to her dignity if it did not make her a handsome woman  miss aylmer who was the eldest of the younger generation and who was now gently descending from her fortieth year lacked the strength of her mothers character but admired her mothers ways and followed lady aylmer in all thingsat a distance she was very goodas indeed was lady aylmerentertaining a high idea of duty and aware that her own life admitted of but little selfindulgence she had no pleasures she incurred no expenses and was quite alive to the fact that as aylmer park required a regiment of lazy gormandizing servants to maintain its position in the county the aylmers themselves should not be lazy and should not gormandize no one was more careful with her few shillings than miss aylmer she had indeed abandoned a lifes correspondence with an old friend because she would not pay the postage on letters to italy she knew that it was for the honour of the family that one of her brothers should sit in parliament and was quite willing to deny herself a new dress because sacrifices must be made to lessen electioneering expenses she knew that it was her lot to be driven about slowly in a carriage with a livery servant before her and another behind her and then eat a dinner which the cookmaid would despise she was aware that it was her duty to be snubbed by her mother and to encounter her fathers illtemper and to submit to her brothers indifference and to have so to say the slightest possible modicum of personal individuality she knew that she had never attracted a mans love and might hardly hope to make friends for the comfort of her coming age but still she was contented and felt that she had consolation for it all in the fact that she was an aylmer she read many novels and it cannot but be supposed that something of regret would steal over her as she remembered that nothing of the romance of life had ever or could ever come in her way she wept over the loves of many women though she had never been happy or unhappy in her own she read of gaiety though she never encountered it and must have known that the world elsewhere was less dull than it was at aylmer park but she took her life as it came without a complaint and prayed that god would make her humble in the high position to which it had pleased him to call her she hated radicals and thought that essays and reviews and bishop colenso came direct from the evil one she taught the little children in the parish being specially urgent to them always to curtsey when they saw any of the familyand was as ignorant meek and stupid a poor woman as you shall find anywhere in europe  it may be imagined that captain aylmer who knew the comforts of his club and was accustomed to life in london would feel the dulness of the paternal roof to be almost unendurable in truth he was not very fond of aylmer park but he was more gifted with patience than most men of his age and position and was aware that it behoved him to keep the fifth commandment if he expected to have his own days prolonged in the land he therefore made his visits periodically and contented himself with clipping a few days at both ends from the length prescribed by family tradition which his mother was desirous of exacting september was always to be passed at aylmer park because of the shooting in september indeed the eldest son himself was wont to be thereprobably with a friend or twoand the fat old servants bestirred themselves and there was something of life about the place at christmas captain aylmer was there as the only visitor and christmas was supposed to extend from the middle of december to the opening of parliament it must however be explained that on the present occasion his visit had been a matter of treaty and compromise he had not gone to aylmer park at all till his mother had in some sort assented to his marriage with clara amedroz to this lady aylmer had been very averse and there had been many serious letters belinda aylmer the daughter of the house had had a bad time in pleading her brothers causeand some very harsh words had been utteredbut ultimately the matter had been arranged and as is usual in such contests the mother had yielded to the son captain aylmer had therefore gone down a few days before christmas with a righteous feeling that he owed much to his mother for her condescension and almost prepared to make himself very disagreeable to clara by way of atoning to his family for his folly in desiring to marry her  lady aylmer was very plainspoken on the subject of all claras shortcomingsvery plainspoken and very inquisitive she will never have one shilling i suppose she said  yes maam captain aylmer always called his mother maam she will have that fifteen hundred pounds that i told you of  that is to say you will have back the money which you yourself have given her fred i suppose that is the english of it then lady aylmer raised her eyebrows and looked very wise  just so maam  you cant call that having anything of her own in point of fact she is penniless  it is no good harping on that said captain aylmer somewhat sharply  not in the least my dear no good at all of course you have looked it all in the face you will be a poor man instead of a rich man but you will have enough to live onthat is if she doesnt have a large familywhich of course she will  i shall do very well maam  you might do pretty well i dare say if you could live privatelyat perivale keeping up the old family house there and having no expenses but youll find even that close enough with your seat in parliament and the necessity there is that you should be half the year in london of course she wont go to london she cant expect it all that had better be made quite clear at once hence had come the letter about the house at perivale containing lady aylmers advice on that subject as to which clara made no reply  lady aylmer though she had given in her assent was still not altogether without hope it might be possible that the two young people could be brought to see the folly and error of their ways before it would be too late and that lady aylmer by a judicious course of constant advice might be instrumental in opening the eyes if not of the lady at any rate of the gentleman she had great reliance on her own powers and knew well that a falling drop will hollow a stone her son manifested no hot eagerness to complete his folly in a hurry and to cut the throat of his prospects out of hand time therefore would be allowed to her and she was a woman who could use time with patience having through her son despatched her advice about the house at perivalewhich simply amounted to this that clara should expressly state her willingness to live there alone whenever it might suit her husband to be in london or elsewhereshe went to work on other points connected with the amedroz family and eventually succeeded in learning something very much like the truth as to poor mrs askerton and her troubles at first she was so comfortably horrorstricken by the iniquity she had unravelledso delightfully shocked and astoundedas to believe that the facts as they then stood would suffice to annul the match  you dont tell me she said to belinda that frederics wife will have been the friend of such a woman as that and lady aylmer sitting upstairs with her household books before her put up her great fat hands and her great fat arms and shook her headfront and allin most satisfactory dismay  but i suppose clara did not know it belinda had considered it to be an act of charity to call miss amedroz clara since the family consent had been given  didnt know it they have been living in that sort of way that they must have been confidantes in everything besides i always hold that a woman is responsible for her female friends  i think if she consents to drop her at oncethat is absolutely to make a promise that she will never speak to her againfrederic ought to take that as sufficient that is of course mamma unless she has had anything to do with it herself  after this i dont know how im to trust her i dont indeed it seems to me that she has been so artful throughout it has been a regular case of catching  i suppose of course that she has been anxious to marry fredericbut perhaps that was natural  anxiouslook at her going there just when he had to meet his constituents how young women can do such things passes me and how it is that men dont see it all when its going on just under their noses i cant understand and then her getting my poor dear sister to speak to him when she was dying i didnt think your aunt would have been so weak it will be thus seen that there was entire confidence on this subject between lady aylmer and her daughter  we know what were the steps taken with reference to the discovery and how the family were waiting for claras reply lady aylmer though in her words she attributed so much mean cunning to miss amedroz still was disposed to believe that that lady would show rather a high spirit on this occasion and trusted to that high spirit as the means for making the breach which she still hoped to accomplish it had been intendedor rather desiredthat captain aylmers letter should have been much sharper and authoritative than he had really made it but the mother could not write the letter herself and had felt that to write in her own name would not have served to create anger on claras part against her betrothed but she had quite succeeded in inspiring her son with a feeling of horror against the iniquity of the askertons he was prepared to be indignantly moral and perhapsperhapsthe misguided clara might be silly enough to say a word for her lost friend such being the present position of affairs there was certainly ground for hope  and now they were all waiting for claras answer lady aylmer had well calculated the course of post and knew that a letter might reach them by wednesday morning of course she will not write on sunday she had said to her son but you have a right to expect that not another day should go by captain aylmer who felt that they were putting clara on her trial shook his head impatiently and made no immediate answer lady aylmer triumphantly feeling that she had the culprit on the hip did not care to notice this she was doing the best she could for his happinessas she had done for his health when in days gone by she had administered to him his infantine rhubarb and early senna but as she had never then expected him to like her doses neither did she now expect that he should be well pleased at the remedial measures to which he was to be subjected  no letter came on the wednesday nor did any come on the thursday and then it was thought by the ladies at the park that the time had come for speaking a word or two belinda at her mothers instance began the attacknot in her mothers presence but when she only was with her brother  isnt it odd frederic that clara shouldnt write about those people at belton  somersetshire is the other side of london and letters take a long time  but if she had written on monday her answer would have been here on wednesday morningindeed you would have had it tuesday evening as mamma sent over to whitby for the day mail letters poor belinda was a bad lieutenant and displayed too much of her senior officers tactics in thus showing how much calculation and how much solicitude there had been as to the expected letter  if i am contented i suppose you may be said the brother  but it does seem to me to be so very important if she hasnt got your letter you know it would be so necessary that you should write again so that thethethe contamination should be stopped as soon as possible captain aylmer shook his head and walked away he was no doubt prepared to be morally indignantmorally very indignantat the askerton iniquity but he did not like the word contamination as applied to his future wife  frederic said his mother later on the same daywhen the hardlyused groom had returned from his futile afternoons inquiry at the neighbouring posttowni think you should do something in this affair  do what maam go off to belton myself  no no i certainly would not do that in the first place it would be very inconvenient to you and in the next place it would not be fair upon us i did not mean that at all but i think that something should be done she should be made to understand  you may be sure maam that she understands as well as anybody  i dare say she is clever enough at these kind of things  what kind of things  dont bite my nose off frederic because i am anxious about your wife  what is it that you wish me to do i have written to her and can only wait for her answer  it may be that she feels a delicacy in writing to you on such a subject though i own however to make a long story short if you like i will write to her myself  i dont see that that would do any good it would only give her offence  give her offence frederic to receive a letter from her future motherinlawfrom me only think frederic what you are saying  if she thought she was being bullied about this she would turn rusty at once  turn rusty what am i to think of a young lady who is prepared to turn rustyat once too because she is cautioned by the mother of the man she professes to love against an improper acquaintanceagainst an acquaintance so very improper lady aylmers eloquence should have been heard to be appreciated it is but tame to say that she raised her fat arms and fat hands and wagged her fronther front that was the more formidable as it was the old one somewhat rough and dishevelled which she was wont to wear in the morning the emphasis of her words should have been heard and the fitting solemnity of her action should have been seen if there were any doubt she continued to say but there is no doubt there are the damning proofs there are certain words usually confined to the vocabularies of men which women such as lady aylmer delight to use on special occasions when strong circumstances demand strong language as she said this she put her hand below the table pressing it apparently against her own august person but she was in truth indicating the position of a certain valuable correspondence which was locked up in the drawer of her writingtable  you can write if you like it of course but i think you ought to wait a few more days  very well frederic then i will wait i will wait till sunday i do not wish to take any step of which you do not approve if you have not heard by sunday morning then i will write to heron monday  on the saturday afternoon life was becoming inexpressibly disagreeable to captain aylmer and he began to meditate an escape from the park in spite of the agreement between him and his mother which he understood to signify that nothing more was to be said as to claras wickedness at any rate till sunday after posthour lady aylmer had twice attacked him on the saturday and had expressed her opinion that affairs were in a very frightful position belinda went about the house in melancholy guise with her eyes rarely lifted off the ground as though she were prophetically weeping the utter ruin of her brothers respectability and even sir anthony had raised his eyes and shaken his head when on opening the postbag at the breakfasttablean operation which was always performed by lady aylmer in personher ladyship had exclaimed again no letter then captain aylmer thought that he would fly and resolved that in the event of such flight he would give special orders as to the redirection of his own letters from the postoffice at whitby  that evening after dinner as soon as his mother and sister had left the room he began the subject with his father i think i shall go up to town on monday sir said he  so soon as that i thought you were to stop till the 9th  there are things i must see to in london and i believe i had better go at once  your mother will be greatly disappointed  i shall be sorry for thatbut business is business you know then the father filled his glass and passed the bottle he himself did not at all like the idea of his sons going before the appointed time but he did not say a word of himself he looked at the redhot coals and a hazy glimmer of a thought passed through his mind that he too would escape from aylmer parkif it were possible  if youll allow me ill take the dogcart over to whitby on monday for the express train  you can do that certainly but  sir  have you spoken to your mother yet  not yet i will tonight  i think shell be a little angry fred there was a sudden tone of subdued confidence in the old mans voice as he made this suggestion which though it was by no means a customary tone his son well understood dont you think she will beeh a little  she shouldnt go on as she does with me about clara said the captain  ahi supposed there was something of that are you drinking port  of course i know that she means all that is good said the son passing back the bottle  oh yesshe means all that is good  she is the best mother in the world  you may say that fredand the best wife  but if she cant have her own way altogether then the son paused and the father shook his head  of course she likes to have her own way said sir anthony  its all very well in some things  yesits very well in some things  but there are things which a man must decide for himself  i suppose there are said sir anthony not venturing to think what those things might be as regarded himself  now with reference to marrying  i dont know what you want with marrying at all fred you ought to be very happy as you are by heavens i dont know any one who ought to be happier if i were you i know  but you see sir thats all settled  if its all settled i suppose theres an end of it  its no good my mother nagging at one  my dear boy shes been nagging at me as you call it for forty years thats her way the best woman in the world as we were sayingbut thats her way and its the way with most of them they can do anything if they keep it upanything the best thing is to bear it if youve got it to bear but why on earth you should go and marry seeing that youre not the eldest son and that youve got everything on earth that you want as a bachelor i cant understand i cant indeed fred by heaven i cant then sir anthony gave a long sigh and sat musing awhile thinking of the club in london to which he belonged but which he never enteredof the old days in which he had been master of a bedroom near st jamess streetof his old friends whom he never saw now and of whom he never heard except as one and another year after year shuffled away from their wives to that world in which there is no marrying or giving in marriage ah well he said i suppose we may as well go into the drawingroom if it is settled i suppose it is settled but it really seems to me that your mother is trying to do the best she can for you it really does  captain aylmer did not say anything to his mother that night as to his going but as he thought of his prospects in the solitude of his bedroom he felt really grateful to his father for the solicitude which sir anthony had displayed on his behalf it was not often that he received paternal counsel but now that it had come he acknowledged its value that clara amedroz was a selfwilled woman he thought that he was aware she was selfreliant at any rateand by no means ready to succumb with that pretty feminine docility which he would like to have seen her evince he certainly would not wish to be nagged by his wife indeed he knew himself well enough to assure himself that he would not stand it for a day in his own house he would be master and if there came tempests he would rule them he could at least promise himself that as his mother had been strong so had his father been weak but he hadas he felt thankful in knowinginherited his mothers strength rather than his fathers weakness but for all that why have a tempest to rule at all even though a man do rule his domestic tempests he cannot have a very quiet house with them then again he remembered how very easily clara had been won he wished to be just to all men and women and to clara among the number he desired even to be generous to herwith a moderate generosity but above all things he desired not to be duped what if clara had in truth instigated her aunt to that deathbed scene as his mother had more than once suggested he did not believe it he was sure that it had not been so but what if it were so his desire to be generous and trusting was moderatebut his desire not to be cheated not to be deceived was immoderate upon the whole might it not be well for him to wait a little longer and ascertain how clara really intended to behave herself in this emergency of the askertons perhaps after all his mother might be right  on the sunday the expected letter camebut before its contents are made known it will be well that we should go back to belton and see what was done by clara in reference to the tidings which her lover had sent her     chapter xviii  mrs askertons story   when clara received the letter from captain aylmer on which so much is supposed to hang she made up her mind to say nothing of it to any onenot to think of it if she could avoid thinking of ittill her cousin should have left her she could not mention it to him for though there was no one from whom she would sooner have asked advice than from him even on so delicate a matter as this she could not do so in the present case as her informant was her cousins successful rival when therefore mrs askerton on leaving the church had spoken some customary word to clara begging her to come to the cottage on the following day clara had been unable to answernot having as yet made up her mind whether she would or would not go to the cottage again of course the idea of consulting her father occurred to heror rather the idea of telling him but any such telling would lead to some advice from him which she would find it difficult to obey and to which she would be unable to trust and moreover why should she repeat this evil story against her neighbours  she had a long morning by herself after will had started and then she endeavoured to arrange her thoughts and lay down for herself a line of conduct presuming this story to be true to what did it amount it certainly amounted to very much if in truth this woman had left her own husband and gone away to live with another man she had by doing soat any rate while she was doing sofallen in such a way as to make herself unfit for the society of an unmarried young woman who meant to keep her name unblemished before the world clara would not attempt any further unravelling of the case even in her own mindbut on that point she could not allow herself to have a doubt without condemning the unhappy victim she understood well that she would owe it to all those who held her dear if not to herself to eschew any close intimacy with one in such a position the rules of the world were too plainly written to allow her to guide herself by any special judgment of her own in such a matter but if this friend of hershaving been thus unfortunatehad since redeemed or in part redeemed her position by a second marriage would it be then imperative upon her to remember the past for ever and to declare that the stain was indelible clara felt that with a previous knowledge of such a story she would probably have avoided any intimacy with mrs askerton she would then have been justified in choosing whether such intimacy should or should not exist and would so have chosen out of deference to the worlds opinion but now it was too late for that mrs askerton had for years been her friend and clara had to ask herself this question was it now needfuldid her own feminine purity demandthat she should throw her friend over because in past years her life had been tainted by misconduct  it was clear enough at any rate that this was expected from hernay imperatively demanded by him who was to be her lordby him to whom her future obedience would be due whatever might be her immediate decision he would have a right to call upon her to be guided by his judgment as soon as she would become his wife and indeed she felt that he had such right nowunless she should decide that no such right should be his now or ever it was still within her power to say that she could not submit herself to such a rule as hisbut having received his commands she must do that or obey them then she declared to herself not following the matter out logically but urged to her decision by sudden impulse that at any rate she would not obey lady aylmer she would have nothing to do in any such matter with lady aylmer lady aylmer should be no god to her that question about the house at perivale had been very painful to her she felt that she could have endured the dreary solitude at perivale without complaint if after her marriage her husbands circumstances had made such a mode of living expedient but to have been asked to pledge her consent to such a life before her marriage to feel that he was bargaining for the privilege of being rid of her to know that the aylmer people were arranging that he if he would marry her should be as little troubled with his wife as possibleall this had been very grievous to her she had tried to console herself by the conviction that lady aylmernot frederichad been the sinner but even in that consolation there had been the terrible flaw that the words had come to her written by frederics hand could will belton have written such a letter to his future wife  in her present emergency she must be guided by her own judgment or her own instinctsnot by any edicts from aylmer park if in what she might do she should encounter the condemnation of captain aylmer she would answer himshe would be driven to answer himby countercondemnation of him and his mother let it be so anything would be better than a mean truckling subservience to the imperious mistress of aylmer park  but what should she do as regarded mrs askerton that the story was true she was beginning to believe that there was some such history was made certain to her by the promise which mrs askerton had given her  if you want to ask any questions and will ask them of me i will answer them such a promise would not have been volunteered unless there was something special to be told it would be best perhaps to demand from mrs askerton the fulfilment of this promise but then in doing so she must own from whence her information had come mrs askerton had told her that the communication would be made by her cousin will her cousin will had gone away without a word of mrs askerton and now the communication had come from captain aylmer  the monday and tuesday were rainy days and the rain was some excuse for her not going to the cottage on the wednesday her father was ill and his illness made a further excuse for her remaining at home but on the wednesday evening there came a note to her from mrs askerton you naughty girl why do you not come to me colonel askerton has been away since yesterday morning and i am forgetting the sound of my own voice i did not trouble you when your divine cousin was herefor reasons but unless you come to me now i shall think that his divinity has prevailed colonel askerton is in ireland about some property and will not be back till next week  clara sent back a promise by the messenger and on the following morning she put on her hat and shawl and started on her dreaded task when she left the house she had not even yet quite made up her mind what she would do at first she put her lovers letter into her pocket so that she might have it for reference but on second thoughts she replaced it in her desk dreading lest she might be persuaded into showing or reading some part of it there had come a sharp frost after the rain and the ground was hard and dry in order that she might gain some further last moment for thinking she walked round up among the rocks instead of going straight to the cottage and for a momentthough the air was sharp with frostshe sat upon the stone where she had been seated when her cousin will blurted out the misfortune of his heart she sat there on purpose that she might think of him and recall his figure and the tones of his voice and the look of his eyes and the gesture of his face what a man he wasso tender yet so strong so thoughtful of others and yet so selfsufficient she had unconsciously imputed to him one fault that he had loved and then forgotten his loveunconsciously for she had tried to think that this was a virtue rather than a faultbut nowwith a full knowledge of what she was doing but without any intention of doing itshe acquitted him of that one fault now that she could acquit him she owned that it would have been a fault to have loved and so soon to have forgotten it no he had loved her truly and alas he was one who could not be made to forget it then she went on to the cottage exercising her thoughts rather on the contrast between the two men than on the subject to which she should have applied them  so you have come at last said mrs askerton till i got your message i thought there was to be some dreadful misfortune  what misfortune  something dreadful one often anticipates something very bad without exactly knowing what at least i do i am always expecting a catastrophewhen i am alone that isand then i am so often alone  that simply means low spirits i suppose  its more than that my dear  not much more i take it  once when we were in india we lived close to the powder magazine and we were always expecting to be blown up you never lived near a powder magazine  no neverunless theres one at belton but i should have thought that was exciting  and then there was the gentleman who always had the sword hanging over him by the horses hair  what do you mean mrs askerton  dont look so innocent clara you know what i mean what were the results at last of your cousins diligence as a detective officer  mrs askerton you wrong my cousin greatly he never once mentioned your name while he was with us he did not make a single allusion to you or to colonel askerton or to the cottage  he did not  never once  then i beg his pardon but not the less has he been busy making inquiries  but why should you say that there is a powder magazine or a sword hanging over your head  ah why  here was the subject ready opened to her hand and yet clara did not know how to go on with it it seemed to her now that it would have been easier for her to commence it if mrs askerton had made no commencement herself as it was she knew not how to introduce the subject of captain aylmers letter and was almost inclined to wait thinking that mrs askerton might tell her own story without any such introduction but nothing of the kind was forthcoming mrs askerton began to talk of the frost and then went on to abuse ireland complaining of the hardship her husband endured in being forced to go thither in winter to look after his tenants  what did you mean said clara at last by the sword hanging over your head  i think i told you what i meant pretty plainly if you did not understand me i cannot tell you more plainly  it is odd that you should say so much and not wish to say more  ahyou are making your inquiries now  in my place would not you do so too how can i help it when you talked of a sword of course you make me ask what the sword is  and am i bound to satisfy your curiosity  you told me just before my cousin came here that if i asked any question you would answer me  and i am to understand that you are asking such a question now  yesif it will not offend you  but what if it will offend meoffend me greatly who likes to be inquired into  but you courted such inquiry from me  no clara i did not do that ill tell you what i did i gave you to understand that if it was needful that you should hear about me and my antecedentscertain matters as to which mr belton had been inquiring into in a manner that i thought to be most unjustifiablei would tell you that story  and do so without being angry with me for asking  i meant of course that i would not make it a ground for quarrelling with you if i wished to tell you i could do so without any inquiry  i have sometimes thought that you did wish to tell me  sometimes i havealmost  but you have no such wish now  cant you understand it may well be that one so much alone as i amliving here without a female friend or even acquaintance except yourselfshould often feel a longing for that comfort which full confidence between us would give me  then why not  stop a moment cant you understand that i may feel this and yet entertain the greatest horror against inquiry we all like to tell our own sorrows but who likes to be inquired into many a woman burns to make a full confession who would be as mute as death before a policeman  i am no policeman  but you are determined to ask a policemans questions  to this clara made no immediate reply she felt that she was acting almost falsely in going on with such questions while she was in fact aware of all the circumstances which mrs askerton could tellbut she did not know how to declare her knowledge and to explain it she sincerely wished that mrs askerton should be made acquainted with the truth but she had fallen into a line of conversation which did not make her own task easy but the idea of her own hypocrisy was distressing to her and she rushed at the difficulty with hurried eager words resolving that at any rate there should be no longer any doubt between them  mrs askerton she said i know it all there is nothing for you to tell i know what the sword is  what is it that you know  that you were married long ago tomr berdmore  then mr belton did do me the honour of talking about me when he was here as she said this she rose from her chair and stood before clara with flashing eyes  not a word he never mentioned your name or the name of any one belonging to you i have heard it from another  from what other  i do not know that that signifiesbut i have learned it  welland what next  i do not know what next as so much has been told me and as you had said that i might ask you i have come to you yourself i shall believe your own story more thoroughly from yourself than from any other teller  and suppose i refuse to answer you  then i can say nothing further  and what will you do  ahthat i do not know but you are harsh to me while i am longing to be kind to you can you not see that this has been all forced upon mepartly by yourself  and the other partwho has forced that upon you who is your informant if you mean to be generous be generous altogether is it a man or a woman that has taken the trouble to rip up old sorrows that my name may be blackened but what matters therei was married to captain berdmore i left him and went away with my present husband for three years i was a mans mistress and not his wife when that poor creature died we were married and then came here now you know it allallallthough doubtless your informant has made a better story of it after that perhaps i have been very wicked to sully the air you breathe by my presence  why do you say thatto me  but noyou do not know it all no one can ever know it all no one can ever know how i suffered before i was driven to escape or how good to me has been he whowhowho then she turned her back upon clara and walking off to the window stood there hiding the tears which clouded her eyes and concealing the sobs which choked her utterance  for some momentsfor a space which seemed long to both of themclara kept her seat in silence she hardly dared to speak and though she longed to show her sympathy she knew not what to say at last she too rose and followed the other to the window she uttered no words however but gently putting her arm around mrs askertons waist stood there close to her looking out upon the cold wintry flowerbedsnot venturing to turn her eyes upon her companion the motion of her arm was at first very gentle but after a while she pressed it closer and thus by degrees drew her friend to her with an eager warm and enduring pressure mrs askerton made some little effort towards repelling her some faint motion of resistance but as the embrace became warmer the poor woman yielded herself to it and allowed her face to fall upon claras shoulder so they stood speaking no word making no attempt to rid themselves of the tears which were blinding their eyes but gazing out through the moisture on the bleak wintry scene before them claras mind was the more active at the moment for she was resolving that in this episode of her life she would accept no lesson whatever from lady aylmers teachingno nor any lesson whatever from the teaching of any aylmer in existence and as for the worlds rules she would fit herself to them as best she could but no such fitting should drive her to the unwomanly cruelty of deserting this woman whom she had known and lovedand whom she now loved with a fervour which she had never before felt towards her  you have heard it all now said mrs askerton at last  and is it not better so  ahi do not know how should i know  do you not know and as she spoke clara pressed her arm still closer do you not know yet then turning herself half round she clasped the other woman full in her arms and kissed her forehead and her lips  do you not know yet  but you will go away and people will tell you that you are wrong  what people said clara thinking as she spoke of the whole family at aylmer park  your husband will tell you so  i have no husbandas yetto order me what to think or what not to think  nonot quite as yet but you will tell him all this  he knows it it was he who told me  whatcaptain aylmer  yes captain aylmer  and what did he say  never mind captain aylmer is not my husbandnot as yet if he takes me he must take me as i am not as he might possibly have wished me to be lady aylmer  and does lady aylmer know it  yes lady aylmer is one of those hard severe women who never forgive  ah i see it all now i understand it all clara you must forget me and come here no more you shall not be ruined because you are generous  ruined if lady aylmers displeasure can ruin me i must put up with ruin i will not accept her for my guide i am too old and have had my own way too long do not let that thought trouble you in this matter i shall judge for myself i have judged for myself already  and your father  papa knows nothing of it  but you will tell him  i do not know poor papa is very ill if he were well i would tell him and he would think as i do  and your cousin  you say that he has heard it all  i think so do you know that i remembered him the first moment that i saw him but what could i do when you mentioned to me my old name my real name how could i be honest i have been driven to do that which has made honesty to me impossible my life has been a lie and yet how could i help it i must live somewhereand how could i live anywhere without deceit  and yet that is so sad  sad indeed but what could i do of course i was wrong in the beginning though how am i to regret it when it has given me such a husband as i have ahif you could know it all i thinki think you would forgive me  then by degrees she told it all and clara was there for hours listening to her story the reader will not care to hear more of it than he has heard nor would clara have desired any closer revelation but as it is often difficult to obtain a confidence so is it impossible to stop it in the midst of its effusion mrs askerton told the history of her lifeof her first foolish engagement her belief her halfbelief in the mans reformation of the miseries which resulted from his vices of her escape and shame of her welcome widowhood and of her second marriage and as she told it she paused at every point to insist on the goodness of him who was now her husband i shall tell him this she said at last as i do everything and then he will know that i have in truth got a friend  she asked again and again about mr belton but clara could only tell her that she knew nothing of her cousins knowledge will might have heard it all but if so he had kept his information to himself  and now what shall you do mrs askerton asked of clara at length prepared to go  do in what way i shall do nothing  but you will write to captain aylmer  yesi shall write to him  and about this  yesi suppose i must write to him  and what will you say  that i cannot tell i wish i knew what to say if it were to his mother i could write my letter easily enough  and what would you say to her  i would tell her that i was responsible for my own friends but i must go now papa will complain that i am so long away then there was another embrace and at last clara found her way out of the house and was alone again in the park  she clearly acknowledged to herself that she had a great difficulty before her she had committed herself altogether to mrs askerton and could no longer entertain any thought of obeying the very plainly expressed commands which captain aylmer had given her the story as told by captain aylmer had been true throughout but in the teeth of that truth she intended to maintain her acquaintance with mrs askerton from that there was now no escape she had been carried away by impulse in what she had done and said at the cottage but she could not bring herself to regret it she could not believe that it was her duty to throw over and abandon a woman whom she loved because that woman had once in her dire extremity fallen away from the path of virtue but how was she to write the letter  when she reached her father he complained of her absence and almost scolded her for having been so long at the cottage i cannot see said he what you find in that woman to make so much of her  she is the only neighbour i have papa  and better none than her if all that people say of her is true  all that people say is never true papa  there is no smoke without fire i am not at all sure that its good for you to be so much with her  oh papadont treat me like a child  and im sure its not good for me that you should be so much away for anything i have seen of you all day you might have been at perivale but you are going soon altogether so i suppose i may as well make up my mind to it  im not going for a long time yet papa  what do you mean by that  i mean that theres nothing to take me away from here at present  you are engaged to be married  but it will be a long engagement it is one of those engagements in which neither party is very anxious for an immediate change there was something bitter in claras tone as she said this which the old man perceived but could only half understand clara remained with him then for the rest of the day going downstairs for five minutes to her dinner and then returning to him and reading aloud while he dozed her winter evenings at belton castle were not very bright but she was used to them and made no complaint  when she left her father for the night she got out her desk and prepared herself for her letter to her lover she was determined that it should be finished that night before she went to bed and it was so finished though the writing of it gave her much labour and occupied her till the late hours had come upon her when completed it was as follows      belton castle thursday night     dear frederici received your letter last sunday    but i could not answer it sooner as it required much    consideration and also some information which i have only    obtained today about the plan of living at perivale i    will not say much now as my mind is so full of other    things i think however i may promise that i will never    make any needless difficulty as to your plans my cousin    will left us on monday so your mother need not have any    further anxiety on that head it does papa good to have    him here and for that reason i am sorry that he has gone    i can assure you that i dont think what you said about    him meant anything at all particular will is my nearest    cousin and of course you would be glad that i should like    himwhich i do very much     and now about the other subject which i own has    distressed me as you supposed it wouldi mean about    mrs askerton i find it very difficult in your letter to    divide what comes from your mother and what from yourself    of course i want to make the division as every word from    you has great weight with me at present i dont know lady    aylmer personally and i cannot think of her as i do of    you indeed were i to know her ever so well i could not    have the same deference for her that i have for the man    who is to be my husband i only say this as i fear that    lady aylmer and i may not perhaps agree about mrs    askerton     i find that your story about mrs askerton is in the main    true but the person who told it you does not seem to have    known any of the provocations which she received she    was very badly treated by captain berdmore who i am    afraid was a terrible drunkard and at last she found it    impossible to stay with him so she went away i cannot    tell you how horrid it all was but i am sure that if i    could make you understand it it would go a long way in    inducing you to excuse her she was married to colonel    askerton as soon as captain berdmore died and this took    place before she came to belton i hope you will remember    that it all occurred out in india and i really hardly    know what business we have to inquire about it now     at any rate as i have been acquainted with her a long    time and very intimately and as i am sure that she has    repented of anything that has been wrong i do not think    that i ought to quarrel with her now indeed i have    promised her that i will not i think i owe it you to tell    you the whole truth and that is the truth     pray give my regards to your mother and tell her that    i am sure she would judge differently if she were in my    place this poor woman has no other friend here and who    am i that i should take upon myself to condemn her i    cannot do it dear frederic pray do not be angry with    me for asserting my own will in this matter i think    you would wish me to have an opinion of my own in my    present position i am bound to have one as i am as yet    responsible for what i do myself i shall be very very    sorry if i find that you differ from me but still i    cannot be made to think that i am wrong i wish you were    here that we might talk it over together as i think that    in that case you would agree with me     if you can manage to come to us at easter or any other    time when parliament does not keep you in london we shall    be so delighted to see you     dear frederic    yours very affectionately     clara amedroz     chapter xix  miss amedroz has another chance   it was on a sunday morning that claras letter reached aylmer park and frederic aylmer found it on his plate as he took his place at the breakfasttable domestic habits at aylmer park had grown with the growth of years till they had become adamantine and domestic habits required prayers every morning at a quarter before nine oclock at twenty minutes before nine lady aylmer would always be in the diningroom to make the tea and open the postbag and as she was always there alone she knew more about other peoples letters than other people ever knew about hers when these operations were over she rang the bell and the servants of the family who by that time had already formed themselves into line in the hall would march in and settle themselves on benches prepared for them near the sideboardwhich benches were afterwards carried away by the retiring procession lady aylmer herself always read prayers as sir anthony never appeared till the middle of breakfast belinda would usually come down in a scurry as she heard her mothers bell in such a way as to put the army in the hall to some confusion but frederic aylmer when he was at home rarely entered the room till after the service was over at perivale no doubt he was more strict in his conduct but then at perivale he had special interests and influences which were wanting to him at aylmer park during those five minutes lady aylmer would deal round the letters to the several plates of the inmates of her housenot without looking at the postoffice marks upon them and on this occasion she had dealt a letter from clara to her son  the arrival of the letter was announced to frederic aylmer before he took his seat  frederic said her ladyship in her most portentous voice i am glad to say that at last there is a letter from belton  he made no immediate reply but making his way slowly to his place took up the little packet turned it over in his hand and then put it into his pocket having done this he began very slowly with his tea and egg for three minutes his mother was contented to make or to pretend to make some effort in the same direction then her impatience became too much for her and she began to question him  will you not read it frederic  of course i shall maam  but why not do so now when you know how anxious we are  there are letters which one would sooner read in private  but when a matter is of so much importance said belinda  the importance bel is to me and not to you said her brother  all we want to know is continued the sister that she promises to be guided by you in this matter and of course we feel quite sure that she will  if you are quite sure that must be sufficient for you  i really think you need not quarrel with your sister said lady aylmer because she is anxious as to thethe respectability i must say for there is no other word of a young lady whom you propose to make your wife i can assure you that i am very anxious myselfvery anxious indeed  captain aylmer made no answer to this but he did not take the letter from his pocket he drank his tea in silence and in silence sent up his cup to be refilled in silence also was it returned to him he ate his two eggs and his three bits of toast according to his custom and when he had finished sat out his three or four minutes as was usual then he got up to retire to his room with the envelope still unbroken in his pocket  you will go to church with us i suppose said lady aylmer  i wont promise maam but if i do ill walk across the parkso that you need not wait for me  then both the mother and sister knew that the member for perivale did not intend to go to church on that occasion to morning service sir anthony always went the habits of aylmer park having in them more of adamant in reference to him than they had as regarded his son  when the father mother and daughter returned captain aylmer had read his letter and had after doing so received further tidings from belton castlefurther tidings which for the moment prevented the necessity of any reference to the letter and almost drove it from his own thoughts when his mother entered the library he was standing before the fire with a scrap of paper in his hand  since you have been at church there has come a telegraphic message he said  what is it frederic do not frighten meif you can avoid it  you need not be frightened maam for you did not know him mr amedroz is dead  no said lady aylmer seating herself  dead said belinda holding up her hands  god bless my soul said the baronet who had now followed the ladies into the room dead why fred he was five years younger than i am  then captain aylmer read the words of the messagemr amedroz died this morning at five oclock i have sent word to the lawyer and to mr belton  who does it come from asked lady aylmer  from colonel askerton  lady aylmer paused and shook her head and moved her foot uneasily upon the carpet the tidings as far as they went might be unexceptionable but the source from whence they had come had evidently polluted them in her ladyships judgment then she uttered a series of interejaculations expressions of mingled sorrow and anger  there was no one else near her said captain aylmer apologetically  is there no clergyman in the parish  he lives a long way off the message had to be sent at once  are there no servants in the house it looksit looks but i am the last person in the world to form a harsh judgment of a young woman at such a moment as this what did she say in her letter fred  captain aylmer had devoted two hours of consideration to the letter before the telegram had come to relieve his mind by a fresh subject and in those two hours he had not been able to extract much of comfort out of the document it was as he felt a stubborn stiffnecked disobedient almost rebellious letter it contained a manifest defiance of his mother and exhibited doctrines of most questionable morality it had become to him a matter of doubt whether he could possibly marry a woman who could entertain such ideas and write such a letter if the doubt was to be decided in his own mind against clara he had better show the letter at once to his mother and allow her ladyship to fight the battle for hima task which as he well knew her ladyship would not be slow to undertake but he had not succeeded in answering the question satisfactorily to himself when the telegram arrived and diverted all his thoughts now that mr amedroz was dead the whole thing might be different clara would come away from belton and mrs askerton and begin life as it were afresh it seemed as though in such an emergency she ought to have another chance and therefore he did not hasten to pronounce his judgment lady aylmer also felt something of this and forbore to press her question when it was not answered  she will have to leave belton now i suppose said sir anthony  the property will belong to a distant cousina mr william belton  and where will she go said lady aylmer i suppose she has no place that she can call her home  would it not be a good thing to ask her here said belinda such a question as that was very rash on the part of miss aylmer in the first place the selection of guests for aylmer park was rarely left to her and in this special case she should have understood that such a proposal should have been fully considered by lady aylmer before it reached frederics ears  i think it would be a very good plan said captain aylmer generously  lady aylmer shook her head i should like much to know what she has said about that unfortunate connection before i offer to take her by the hand myself im sure fred will feel that i ought to do so  but fred retreated from the room without showing the letter he retreated from the room and betook himself to solitude that he might again endeavour to make up his mind as to what he would do he put on his hat and his greatcoat and gloves and went offwithout his luncheonthat he might consider it all clara amedroz had now no homeand indeed very little means of providing one if he intended that she should be his wife he must furnish her with a home at once it seemed to him that three houses might possibly be open to herof which one the only one which under such circumstances would be proper was aylmer park the other two were plaistow hall and mrs askertons cottage at belton as to the lattershould she ever take shelter there everything must be over between him and her on that point there could be no doubt he could not bring himself to marry a wife out of mrs askertons drawingroom nor could he expect his mother to receive a young woman brought into the family under such circumstances and plaistow hall was almost as bad it was as bad to him though it would perhaps be less objectionable in the eyes of lady aylmer should clara go to plaistow hall there must be an end to everything of that also he taught himself to be quite certain then he took out claras letter and read it again she acknowledged the story about the woman to be truesuch a story as it was tooand yet refused to quarrel with the womanhad absolutely promised the woman not to quarrel with her then he read and reread the passage in which clara claimed the right of forming her own opinion in such matters nothing could be more indelicatenothing more unfit for his wife he began to think that he had better show the letter to his mother and acknowledge that the match must be broken off that softening of his heart which had followed upon the receipt of the telegraphic message departed from him as he dwelt upon the stubborn stiffnecked unfeminine obstinacy of the letter then he remembered that nothing had as yet been done towards putting his aunts fifteen hundred pounds absolutely into claras hands and he remembered also that she might at the present moment be in great want william belton might not improbably assist her in her want and this idea was wormwood to him in spite of his almost formed resolution to give up his own claims he calculated that the income arising from fifteen hundred pounds would be very small and he wished that he had counselled his aunt to double the legacy he thought very much about the amount of the money and the way in which it might be best expended and was after his cold fashion really solicitous as to claras welfare if he could have fashioned her future life and his own too in accordance with his own now existing wishes i think he would have arranged that neither of them should marry at all and that to him should be assigned the duty and care of being claras protectorwith full permission to tell her his mind as often as he pleased on the subject of mrs askerton then he went in and wrote a note to mr green the lawyer desiring that the interest of the fifteen hundred pounds for one year might be at once remitted to miss amedroz he knew that he ought to write to her himself immediately without loss of a post but how was he to write while things were in their present position were he now to condole with her on her fathers death without any reference to the great askerton iniquity he would thereby be condoning all that was past and acknowledging the truth and propriety of her arguments and he would be doing even worse than that he would be cutting the ground absolutely from beneath his own feet as regarded that escape from his engagement which he was contemplating  what a coldhearted ungenerous wretch he must have been that will be the verdict against him but the verdict will be untrue coldhearted and ungenerous he was but he was no wretchas men and women are nowadays called wretches he was chilly hearted but yet quite capable of enough love to make him a good son a good husband and a good father too and though he was ungenerous from the nature of his temperament he was not closefisted or over covetous and he was a just man desirous of obtaining nothing that was not fairly his own but in truth the artists have been so much in the habit of painting for us our friends faces without any of those flaws and blotches with which work and high living are apt to disfigure us that we turn in disgust from a portrait in which the roughnesses and pimples are made apparent  but it was essential that he should now do something and before he sat down to dinner he did show claras letter to his mother mother he said as he sat himself down in her little room upstairsand she knew well by the tone of his voice and by the mode of his address that there was to be a solemn occasion and a serious deliberative council on the present existing family difficultymother of course i have intended to let you know what is the nature of claras answer to my letter  i am glad there is to be no secret between us frederic you know how i dislike secrets in families as she said this she took the letter out of her sons hands with an eagerness that was almost greedy as she read it he stood over her watching her eyes as they made their way down the first page and on to the second and across to the third and so gradually on till the whole reading was accomplished what clara had written about her cousin will lady aylmer did not quite understand and on this point now she was so little anxious that she passed over that portion of the letter readily but when she came to mrs askerton and the allusions to herself she took care to comprehend the meaning and weight of every word divide your words and mine why should we want to divide them not agree with me about mrs askerton how is it possible that any decent young woman should not agree with me it is a matter in which there is no room for a doubt truethe story true of course it is true does she not know that it would not have reached her from aylmer park if it were not true provocation badly treated went away married to colonel askerton as soon as captain berdmore died why frederic she cannot have been taught to understand the first principle of morals in life and she that was so much with my poor sister well well the reader should understand that the late mrs winterfield and lady aylmer had never been able to agree with each other on religious subjects remember that they are married why should we remember anything of the kind it does not make an atom of difference to the womans character repented how can clara say whether she has repented or not but that has nothing to do with it not quarrel with heras she calls it not give her up then frederic of course it must be all over as far as you are concerned when she had finished her reading she returned the letter still open to her son shaking her head almost triumphantly as far as i am a judge of a young womans character i can only give you one counsel said lady aylmer solemnly  i think that she should have another chance said captain aylmer  what other chance can you give her it seems to me that she is obstinately bent on her own destruction  you might ask her to come here as belinda suggested  belinda was very foolish to suggest anything of the kind without more consideration  i suppose that my future wife would be made welcome here  yes frederic certainly i do not know who could be more welcome but is she to be your wife  we are engaged  but does not that letter break any engagement is there not enough in that to make such a marriage quite out of the question what do you think about it yourself frederic  i think that she should have another chance  what would clara have thought of all this herself if she could have heard the conversation between lady aylmer and her betrothed husband and have known that her lover was proposing to give her another chance but it is lucky for us that we seldom know what our best friends say on our behalf when they discuss us and our faults behind our backs  what chance frederic can she have she knows all about this horrid woman and yet refuses to give her up what chance can she have after that  i think that you might have her hereand talk to her lady aylmer in answer to this simply shook her head and i think she was right in supposing that such shaking of her head was a sufficient reply to her sons proposition what talking could possibly be of service to such a one as this miss amedroz why should she throw her pearls before swine we must either ask her to come here or else i must go to her said captain aylmer  i dont see that at all frederic  i think it must be so as she is situated at present she has got no home and i think it would be very horrid that she should be driven into that womans house simply because she has no other shelter for her head  i suppose she can remain where she is for the present  she is all alone you know and it must be very gloomyand her cousin can turn her out at a moments notice  but all that would not entitle her to come here unless  noi quite understand that but you cannot wonder that i should feel the hardship of her position  who is to be blamed if it be hard you see frederic i take my standing upon that letterher own letter how am i to ask a young woman into my house who declares openly that my opinion on such a matter goes for nothing with her how am i to do it thats what i ask you how am i to do it its all very well for belinda to suggest this and that but how am i to do it thats what i want to know  but at last lady aylmer managed to answer the question for herself and did do it but this was not done on that sunday afternoon nor on the monday nor on the tuesday the question was closely debated and at last the anxious mother perceived that the giving of the invitation would be more safe than withholding it captain aylmer at last expressed his determination to go to belton unless the invitation were given and then should he do that there might be danger that he would never be again seen at aylmer park till he brought clara amedroz with him as his wife the position was one of great difficulty but the interests at stake were so immense that something must be risked it might be that clara would not come when invited and in that case her obstinacy would be a great point gained and if she did come well lady aylmer admitted to herself that the game would be difficultdifficult and very troublesome but yet it might be played and perhaps won lady aylmer was a woman who had great confidence in herself not so utterly had victory in such contests deserted her hands that she need fear to break a lance with miss amedroz beneath her own roof when the occasion was so pressing  the invitation was therefore sent in a note written by herself and was enclosed in a letter from her son after much consultation and many doubts on the subject it was at last agreed that nothing further should now be urged about mrs askerton she shall have her chance said lady aylmer over and over again repeating her sons words she shall have her chance lady aylmer therefore in her note confined herself strictly to the giving of the invitation and to a suggestion that as clara had now no settled home of her own a temporary sojourn at aylmer park might be expedient and captain aylmer in his letter hardly said much more he knew as he wrote the words that they were cold and comfortless and that he ought on such an occasion to have written words that should have been warm at any rate even though they might not have contained comfort but to have written with affection he should have written at once and he had postponed his letter from the sunday till the wednesday it had been absolutely necessary that that important question as to the invitation should be answered before he could write at all  when all this was settled he went up to london and there was an understanding between him and his mother that he should return to aylmer park with clara in the event of her acceptance of the invitation  you wont go down to belton for her said the mother  noi do not think that will be necessary said the son  i should think not said the mother     chapter xx  william belton does not go out hunting   we will now follow the other message which was sent down into norfolk and which did not get into beltons hands till the monday morning he was sitting with his sister at breakfast and was prepared for hunting when the paper was brought into the room telegraphic messages were not very common at plaistow hall and on the arrival of any that had as yet reached that house something of that awe had been felt with which such missives were always accompanied in their earliest days a telegruff message mum for mr william said the maid looking at her mistress with eyes opened wide as she handed the important bit of paper to her master will opened it rapidly laying down the knife and fork with which he was about to operate upon a ham before him he was dressed in boots and breeches and a scarlet coatin which garb he was in his sisters eyes the most handsome man in norfolk  oh mary he exclaimed  what is it will  mr amedroz is dead  miss belton put out her hand for the paper before she spoke again as though she could better appreciate the truth of what she heard when reading it herself on the telegraph slip than she had done from her brothers words how sudden how terribly sudden she said  sudden indeed when i left him he was not well certainly but i should have said that he might have lived for twenty years poor old man i can hardly say why it was so but i had taken a liking to him  you take a liking to everybody will  no i dont i know people i dont like will belton as he said this was thinking of captain aylmer and he pressed the heel of his boot hard against the floor  and mr amedroz is dead it seems to be so terribly sudden what will she do will  thats what im thinking about  of course you are my dear i can see that i wishi wish  its no good wishing anything mary i dont think wishing ever did any good yet if i might have my wish i shouldnt know how to have it  i was wishing that you didnt think so much about it  you need not be troubled about me i shall do very well but what is to become of hernow at once might she not come here you are now the nearest female relation that she has mary looked at him with her anxious painful eyes and he knew by her look that she did not approve of his plan i could go away he continued she could come to you without being troubled by seeing me  and where would you go will  what does it matter to the devil i suppose  oh will will  you know what i mean id go anywhere where is she to find a home tilltill she is married he had paused at the word but was determined not to shrink from it and bolted it out in a loud sharp tone so that both he and she recognised all the meaning of the wordall that was conveyed in the idea he hated himself when he endeavoured to conceal from his own mind any of the misery that was coming upon him he loved her he could not get over it the passion was on himlike a palsy for the shaking off of which no sufficient physical energy was left to him it clung to him in his goings out and comings in with a painful wearing tenacity against which he would now and again struggle swearing that it should be so no longerbut against which he always struggled in vain it was with him when he was hunting he was ever thinking of it when the bird rose before his gun as he watched the furrow as his men and horses would drive it straight and deep through the ground he was thinking of herand not of the straightness and depth of the furrow as had been his wont in former years then he would turn away his face and stand alone in his field blinded by the salt drops in his eyes weeping at his own weakness and when he was quite alone he would stamp his foot on the ground and throw abroad his arms and curse himself what nessuss shirt was this that had fallen upon him and unmanned him from the sole of his foot to the top of his head he went through the occupations of the week he hunted and shot and gave his orders and paid his men their wagesbut he did it all with a palsy of love upon him as he did it he wanted her and he could not overcome the want he could not bear to confess to himself that the thing by which he had set so much store could never belong to him his sister understood it all and sometimes he was almost angry with her because of her understanding it she sympathised with him in all his moods and sometimes he would shake away her sympathy as though it scalded him where is she to find a home tilltill she is married he said  not a word had as yet been said between them about the property which was now his estate he was now belton of belton and it must be supposed that both he and she had remembered that it was so but hitherto not a word had been said between them on that point now she was compelled to allude to it cannot she live at the castle for the present  whatall alone  of course she is remaining there now  yes said he of course she is there now now why remember what these telegraphic messages are he died only on yesterday morning of course she is there but i do not think it can be good that she should remain there there is no one near her where she is but that mrs askerton it can hardly be good for her to have no other female friend at such a time as this  i do not think that mrs askerton will hurt her  mrs askerton will not hurt her at alland as long as clara does not know the story mrs askerton may serve as well as another but yet  can i go to her will  no dearest the journey would kill you in winter and he would not like it we are bound to think of that for her sakecoldhearted thankless meagreminded creature as i know he is  i do not know why he should be so bad  no nor i but i know that he is never mind why should we talk about him i suppose shell have to go thereto aylmer park i suppose they will send for her and keep her there till its all finished ill tell you what maryi shall give her the place  whatbelton castle  why not will it ever be of any good to you or me do you want to go and live there  no indeednot for myself  and do you think that i could live there besides why should she be turned out of her fathers house  he would not be mean enough to take it  he would be mean enough for anything besides i should take very good care that it should be settled upon her  thats nonsense willit is indeed you are now william belton of belton and you must remain so  maryi would sooner be will belton with clara amedroz by my side to get through the world with me and not the interest of an acre either at belton castle or at plaistow hall and i believe i should be the richer man at the endif there were any good in that then he went out of the room and she heard him go through the kitchen and knew that he passed out into the farmyard towards the stable by the backdoor he intended it seemed to go on with his hunting in spite of this death which had occurred she was sorry for it but she could not venture to stop him and she was sorry also that nothing had been settled as to the writing of any letter to clara she however would take upon herself to write while he was gone  he went straight out towards the stables hardly conscious of what he was doing or where he was going and found his hack ready saddled for him in the stall then he remembered that he must either go or come to some decision that he would not go the horse that he intended to ride had been sent on to the meet and if he were not to be used some message must be despatched as to the animals return but will was half inclined to go although he knew that the world would judge him to be heartless if he were to go hunting immediately on the receipt of the tidings which had reached him that morning he thought that he would like to set the world at defiance in this matter let frederic aylmer go into mourning for the old man who was dead let frederic aylmer be solicitous for the daughter who was left lonely in the old house no doubt he will belton had inherited the dead mans estate and should therefore in accordance with all the ordinary rules of the world on such matters submit himself at any rate to the decency of funereal reserve an heir should not be seen out hunting on the day on which such tidings as to his heritage had reached him but he did not wish in his present mood to be recognised as the heir he did not want the property he would have preferred to rid himself altogether of any of the obligations which the ownership of the estate entailed upon him it was not permitted to him to have the custody of the old squires daughter and therefore he was unwilling to meddle with any of the old squires concerns  belton had gone into the stable and had himself loosed the animal leading him out into the yard as though he were about to mount him then he had given the reins to a stable boy and had walked away among the farm buildings not thinking of what he was doing the lad stood staring at him with open mouth not at all understanding his masters hesitation the meet as the boy knew was fourteen miles off and belton had not allowed himself above an hour and a half for the journey it was his practice to jump into the saddle and bustle out of the place as though seconds were important to him he would look at his watch with accuracy and measure his pace from spot to spot as though minutes were too valuable to be lost but now he wandered away like one distraught and the stable boy knew that something was wrong i thout he was a thinken of the white cow as choked erself with the tunnup that was skipped in the chopping said the boy as he spoke of his master afterwards to the old groom at last however a thought seemed to strike belton do you get on brag he said to the boy and ride off to goldingham corner and tell daniel to bring the horse home again i shant hunt today and i think i shall go away from home if so tell him to be sure the horses are out every morningand tell him to stop their beans i mightnt hunt again for the next month then he returned into the house and went to the parlour in which his sister was sitting i shant go out today he said  i thought you would not will she answered  not that i see any harm in it  i dont say that there is any harm but it is as well on such occasions to do as others do  thats humbug mary  no will i do not think that when any practice has become the fixed rule of the society in which we live it is always wise to adhere to that rule unless it call upon us to do something that is actually wrong one should not offend the prejudices of the world even if one is quite sure that they are prejudices  it hasnt been that that has brought me back mary ill tell you what i think ill go down to beltonafter all  his sister did not know what to say in answer to this her chief anxiety was of course on behalf of her brother that he should be made to forget clara amedroz if that were only possible was her great desire and his journey at such a time as this down to belton was not the way to accomplish such forgetting and then she felt that clara might very possibly not wish to see him had will simply been her cousin such a visit might be very well but he had attempted to be more than her cousin and therefore it would probably not be well captain aylmer might not like it and mary felt herself bound to consider even captain aylmers likings in such a matter and yet she could not bear to oppose him in anything it would be a very long journey she said  what does that signify  and then it might so probably be for nothing  why should it be for nothing  because  because what why dont you speak out you need not be afraid of hurting me nothing that you can say can make it at all worse than it is  dear will i wish i could make it better  but you cant nobody can make it either better or worse i promised her once before that i would go to her when she might be in trouble and i will be as good as my word i said i would be a brother to herand so i will so help me god i will then he rushed out of the room striding through the door as though he would knock it down and hurried upstairs to his own chamber when there he stripped himself of his hunting things and dressed himself again with all the expedition in his power and then he threw a heap of clothes into a large portmanteau and set himself to work packing as though everything in the world were to depend upon his catching a certain train and he went to a locked drawer and taking out a chequebook folded it up and put it into his pocket then he rang the bell violently and as he was locking the portmanteau pressing down the lid with all his weight and all his strength he ordered that a certain mare should be put into a certain dogcart and that somebody might be ready to drive over with him to the downham station within twenty minutes of the time of his rushing upstairs he appeared again before his sister with a greatcoat on and a railway rug hanging over his arm do you mean that you are going today said she  yes ill catch the 1140 uptrain at downham whats the good of going unless i go at once if i can be of any use it will be at the first it may be that she will have nobody there to do anything for her  there is the clergyman and colonel askertoneven if captain aylmer has not gone down  the clergyman and colonel askerton are nothing to her and if that man is there i can come back again  you will not quarrel with him  why should i quarrel with him what is there to quarrel about im not such a fool as to quarrel with a man because i hate him if he is there i shall see her for a minute or two and then i shall come back  i know it is no good my trying to dissuade you  none on earth if you knew it all you would not try to dissuade me before i thought of asking her to be my wifeand yet i thought of that very soonbut before i ever thought of that i told her that when she wanted a brothers help i would give it her of course i was thinking of the propertythat she shouldnt be turned out of her fathers house like a beggar i hadnt any settled plan thenhow could i but i meant her to understand that when her father died i would be the same to her that i am to you if you were alone in distress would i not go to you  but i have no one else will said she stretching out her hand to him where he stood  that makes no difference he replied almost roughly a promise is a promise and i resolved from the first that my promise should hold good in spite of my disappointment dear dearit seems but the other day when i made itand now already everything is changed as he was speaking the servant entered the room and told him that the horse and gig were ready for him i shall just do it nicely said he looking at his watch i have over an hour god bless you mary i shant be away long you may be sure of that  i dont suppose you can tell as yet will  what should keep me long i shall see green as i go by and that is half of my errand i dare say i shant stay above a night down in somersetshire  youll have to give some orders about the estate  i shall not say a word on the subjectto anybody that is not to anybody there i am going to look after her and not the estate then he stooped down and kissed his sister and in another minute was turning the corner out of the farmyard on to the road at a quick pace not losing a foot of ground in the turn in that fashion of rapidity which the horses at plaistow hall soon learned from their master the horse is a closely sympathetic beast and will make his turns and do his trottings and comport himself generally in strict unison with the pulsations of his masters heart when a horse wont jump it is generally the case that the inner man is declining to jump also let the outer man seem ever so anxious to accomplish the feat  belton who was generally very communicative with his servants always talking to any man he might have beside him in his dogcart about the fields and cattle and tillage around him said not a word to the boy who accompanied him on this occasion he had a good many things to settle in his mind before he got to london and he began upon the work as soon as he had turned the corner out of the farmyard as regarded this belton estate which was now altogether his own he had always had doubts and qualmsqualms of feeling rather than of conscience and he had also always entertained a strong family ambition his people ever so far back had been beltons of belton they told him that his family could be traced back to very early daysbefore the plantagenets as he believed though on this point of the subject he was very hazy in his informationand he liked the idea of being the man by whom the family should be reconstructed in its glory worldly circumstances had been so kind to him that he could take up the belton estate with more of the prestige of wealth than had belonged to any of the owners of the place for many years past should it come to pass that living there would be desirable he could rebuild the old house and make new gardens and fit himself out with all the pleasant braveries of a welltodo english squire there need be no pinching and scraping no question whether a carriage would be possible no doubt as to the prudence of preserving game all this had given much that was delightful to his prospects and he had too been instigated by a somewhat weak desire to emerge from that farmers rank into which he knew that many connected with him had supposed him to have sunk it was true that he farmed land that was half his ownand that even at plaistow he was a wealthy man but plaistow hall with all its comforts was a farmhouse and the ambition to be more than a farmer had been strong upon him  but then there had been the feeling that in taking the belton estate he would be robbing his cousin clara of all that should have been hers it must be remembered that he had not been brought up in the belief that he would ever become the owner of belton all his high ambition in that matter had originated with the wretched death of claras brother could he bring himself to take it all with pleasure seeing that it came to him by so sad a chanceby a catastrophe so deplorable when he would think of this his mind would revolt from its own desires and he would declare to himself that his inheritance would come to him with a stain of blood upon it he indeed would have been guiltless but how could he take his pleasure in the shades of belton without thinking of the tragedy which had given him the property such had been the thoughts and desires mixed in their nature and militating against each other which had induced him to offer his first visit to his cousins house we know what was the effect of that visit and by what pleasant scheme he had endeavoured to overcome all his difficulties and so to become master of belton that clara amedroz should also be its mistress there had been a way which after two days intimacy with clara seemed to promise him comfort and happiness on all sides but he had come too late and that way was closed against him now the estate was his and what was he to do with it clara belonged to his rival and in what way would it become him to treat her he was still thinking simply of the cruelty of the circumstances which had thrown captain aylmer between him and his cousin when he drove himself up to the railway station at downham  take her back steady jem he said to the boy  ill be sure to take her wery steady jem answered  and tell compton to have the samples of barley ready for me i may be back any day and we shall be sowing early this spring  then he left his cart followed the porter who had taken his luggage eagerly knowing that mr belton was always good for sixpence and in five minutes time he was again in motion  on his arrival in london he drove at once to the chambers of his friend mr green and luckily found the lawyer there had he missed doing this it was his intention to go out to his friends house and in that case he could not have gone down to taunton till the next morning but now he would be able to say what he wished to say and hear what he wished to hear and would travel down by the nightmail train he was anxious that clara should feel that he had hurried to her without a moments delay it would do no good he knew that nothing that he could do would alter her or be of any service to him she had accepted this man and had herself no power of making a change even if she should wish it but still there was to him something of gratification in the idea that she should be made to feel that he belton was more instant in his affection more urgent in his good offices more anxious to befriend her in her difficulties than the man whom she had consented to take for her husband aylmer would probably go down to belton but will was very anxious to be the first on the groundvery anxiousthough his doing so could be of no use all this was wrong on his part he knew that it was wrong and he abused himself for his own selfishness but such selfabuse gave him no aid in escaping from his own wickedness he would if possible be at belton before captain aylmer and he would if possible make clara feel that though he was not a member of parliament though he was not much given to books though he was only a farmer yet he had at any rate as much heart and spirit as the fine gentleman whom she preferred to him  i thought i should see you said the lawyer but i hardly expected you so soon as this  i ought to have been a day sooner only we dont get our telegraphic messages on a sunday he still kept his greatcoat on and it seemed by his manner that he had no intention of staying where he was above a minute or two  youll come out and dine with me today said mr green  i cant do that for i shall go down by the mail train  i never saw such a fellow in my life what good will that do it is quite right that you should be there in time for the funeral but i dont suppose he will be buried before this day week  but belton had never thought about the funeral when he had spoken to his sister of saying but a few words to clara and then returning he had forgotten that there would be any such ceremony or that he would be delayed by any such necessity  i was not thinking about the funeral said belton  youll only find yourself uncomfortable there  of course i shall be uncomfortable  you cant do anything about the property you know  what do you mean by doing anything said belton in an angry tone  you cant very well take possession of the place at any rate till after the funeral it would not be considered the proper thing to do  you think then that im a bird of prey smelling the feast from afar off and hurrying at the dead mans carcase as soon as the breath is out of his body  i dont think anything of the kind my dear fellow  yes you do or you wouldnt talk to me about doing the proper thing i dont care a straw about the proper thing if i find that theres anything to be done tomorrow that can be of any use i shall do it though all somersetshire should think it improper but im not going to look after my own interests  take off your coat and sit down will and dont look so angry at me i know that youre not greedy well enough tell me what you are going to do and let me see if i can help you  belton did as he was told he pulled off his coat and sat himself down by the fire i dont know that you can do anything to help meat least not as yet but i must go and see after her perhaps she may be all alone  i suppose she is all alone  he hasnt gone down then  whocaptain aylmer nohe hasnt gone down certainly he is in yorkshire  im glad of that  he wont hurry himself he never does i fancy i had a letter from him this morning about miss amedroz  and what did he say  he desired me to send her seventyfive poundsthe interest of her aunts money  seventyfive pounds said will belton contemptuously  he thought she might want money at once and i sent her the cheque today it will go down by the same train that carries you  seventyfive pounds and you are sure that he has not gone himself  it isnt likely that he should have written to me and passed through london himself at the same timebut it is possible no doubt i dont think he even knew the old squire and there is no reason why he should go to the funeral  no reason at all said beltonwho felt that captain aylmers presence at the castle would be an insult to himself i dont know what on earth he should do thereexcept that i think him just the fellow to intrude where he is not wanted and yet will was in his heart despising captain aylmer because he had not already hurried down to the assistance of the girl whom he professed to love  he is engaged to her you know said the lawyer in a low voice  what difference does that make with such a fellow as he is a coldblooded fish of a man who thinks of nothing in the world but being respectable engaged to her oh damn him  ive not the slightest objection i dont think however that youll find him at belton before you no doubt she will have heard from him and it strikes me as very possible that she may go to aylmer park  what should she go there for  would it not be the best place for her  no my house would be the best place for her i am her nearest relative why should she not come to us  mr green turned round his chair and poked the fire and fidgeted about for some moments before he answered my dear fellow you must know that that wouldnt do he then said you ought to feel that it wouldnt doyou ought indeed  why shouldnt my sister receive miss amedroz as well as that old woman down in yorkshire  if i may tell you i will  of course you may tell me  because miss amedroz is engaged to be married to that old womans son and is not engaged to be married to your sisters brother the thing is done and what is the good of interfering as far as she is concerned a great burden is off your hands  what do you mean by a burden  i mean that her engagement to captain aylmer makes it unnecessary for you to suppose that she is in want of any pecuniary assistance you told me once before that you would feel yourself called upon to see that she wanted nothing  so i do now  but captain aylmer will look after that  i tell you what it is joe i mean to settle the belton property in such a way that she shall have it and that he shant be able to touch it and it shall go to some one who shall have my namewilliam belton thats what i want you to arrange for me  after you are dead you mean  i mean now at once i wont take the estate from her i hate the place and everything belonging to it i dont mean her there is no reason for hating her  my dear will you are talking nonsense  why is it nonsense i may give what belongs to me to whom i please  you can do nothing of the kindat any rate not by my assistance you talk as though the world were all over with youas though you were never to be married or have any children of your own  i shall never marry  nonsense will dont make such an ass of yourself as to suppose that youll not get over such a thing as this youll be married and have a dozen children yet to provide for let the eldest have belton castle and everything will go on then in the proper way  belton had now got the poker into his hands and sat silent for some time knocking the coals about then he got up and took his hat and put on his coat of course i cant make you understand me he said at any rate not all at once im not such a fool as to want to give up my property just because a girl is going to be married to a man i dont like im not such an ass as to give him my estate for such a reason as thatfor it will be giving it to him let me tie it up as i may but ive a feeling about it which makes it impossible for me to take it how would you like to get a thing by another fellow having destroyed himself  you cant help that its yours by law  of course it is i know that and as its mine i can do what i like with it wellgoodbye when ive got anything to say ill write then he went down to his cab and had himself driven to the great western railway hotel  captain aylmer had sent to his betrothed seventyfive pounds the exact interest at five per cent for one year of the sum which his aunt had left her this was the first subject of which belton thought when he found himself again in the railway carriage and he continued thinking of it half the way down to taunton seventyfive pounds as though this favoured lover were prepared to give her exactly her due and nothing more than her due had he been so placed he will belton what would he have done seventyfive pounds might have been more money than she would have wanted for he would have taken her to his own houseto his own bosom as soon as she would have permitted and would have so laboured on her behalf taking from her shoulders all money troubles that there would have been no question as to principal or interest between them at any rate he would not have confined himself to sending to her the exact sum which was her due but then aylmer was a coldblooded manmore like a fish than a man belton told himself over and over again that he had discovered that at the single glance which he had had when he saw captain aylmer in greens chambers seventyfive pounds indeed he himself was prepared to give his whole estate to her if she would take iteven though she would not marry him even though she was going to throw herself away upon that fish then he felt somewhat as hamlet did when he jumped upon laertes at the grave of ophelia send her seventyfive pounds indeed while he was ready to drink up esil for her or to make over to her the whole belton estate and thus abandon the idea for ever of being belton of belton  he reached taunton in the middle of the nightduring the small hours of the morning in a winter night but yet he could not bring himself to go to bed so he knocked up an ostler at the nearest inn and ordered out a gig he would go down to the village of redicote on the minehead road and put up at the publichouse there he could not now have himself driven at once to belton castle as he would have done had the old squire been alive he fancied that his presence would be a nuisance if he did so so he went to the little inn at redicote reaching that place between four and five oclock in the morning and very uncomfortable he was when he got there but in his present frame of mind he preferred discomfort he liked being tired and cold and felt when he was put into a chill room without fire and with a sanded floor that things with him were as they ought to be  yeshe could have a fly over to belton castle after breakfast having learned so much and ordered a dish of eggs and bacon for his mornings breakfast he went upstairs to a miserable little bedroom to dress himself after his nights journey     chapter xxi  mrs askertons generosity   the death of the old man at belton castle had been very sudden at three oclock in the morning clara had been called into his room and at five oclock she was alone in the worldhaving neither father mother nor brother without a home without a shilling that she could call her ownwith no hope as to her future life ifas she had so much reason to supposecaptain aylmer should have chosen to accept her last letter as a ground for permanent separation but at this moment on this saddest morning she did not care much for that chance it seemed to be almost indifferent to her that question of lady aylmer and her anger the more that she was absolutely in need of external friendship the more disposed was she to reject it and to declare to herself that she was prepared to stand alone in the world  for the last week she had understood from the doctor that her father was in truth sinking and that she might hardly hope ever to see him again convalescent she had therefore in some sort prepared herself for her loneliness and anticipated the misery of her position as soon as it was known to the women in the room that life had left the old man one of them had taken her by the hand and led her back to her own chamber now miss clara you had better lie down on the bed againyou had indeed you can do nothing sitting up she took the old womans advice and allowed them to do with her as they would it was true that there was no longer any work by which she could make herself useful in that housein that house or as far as she could see in any other yes she would go to bed and lying there would feel how convenient it would be for many persons if she also could be taken away to her long rest as her father and aunt and brother had been taken before her her name and family had been unfortunate and it would be well that there should be no amedroz left to trouble those more fortunate persons who were to come after them in her sorrow and bitterness she included both her cousin will and captain aylmer among those more fortunate ones for whose sake it might be well that she should be made to vanish from off the earth she had read captain aylmers letter over and over again since she had answered it and had read nearly as often the copy of her own replyand had told herself as she read them that of course he would not forgive her he might perhaps pardon her if she would submit to him in everything but that she would not submit to his commands respecting mrs askerton she was fully resolvedand therefore there could be no hope then when she remembered how lately her dear fathers spirit had fled she hated herself for having allowed her mind to dwell on anything beyond her loss of him  she was still in her bedroom having fallen into that halfwaking slumber which the numbness of sorrow so often produces when word was brought to her that mrs askerton was in the house it was the first time that mrs askerton had ever crossed the door and the remembrance that it was so came upon her at once during her fathers lifetime it had seemed to be understood that their neighbour should have no admittance therebut nownow that her father was gonethe barrier was to be overthrown and why not why should not mrs askerton come to her why if mrs askerton chose to be kind to her should she not altogether throw herself into her friends arms of course her doing so would give mortal offence to everybody at aylmer park but why need she stop to think of that she had already made up her mind that she would not obey orders from aylmer park on this subject  she had not seen mrs askerton since that interview between them which was described some few chapters back then everything had been told between them so that there was no longer any mystery either on the one side or on the other then clara had assured her friend of her loving friendship in spite of any edicts to the contrary which might come from aylmer park and after that what could be more natural than that mrs askerton should come to her in her sorrow she says shell come up to you if youll let her said the servant but clara declined this proposition and in a few minutes went down to the small parlour in which she had lately lived and where she found her visitor  my poor dear this has been very sudden said mrs askerton  very suddenvery sudden and yet now that he has gone i know that i expected it  of course i came to you as soon as i heard of it because i knew you were all alone if there had been any one else i should not have come  it is very good of you  colonel askerton thought that perhaps he had better come i told him of all that which we said to each other the other day he thought at first that it would be better that i should not see you  it was very good of you to come said clara again and as she spoke she put out her hand and took mrs askertonscontinuing to hold it for awhile very good indeed  i told him that i could not but go down to youthat i thought you would not understand it if i stayed away  at any rate it was good of you to come to me  i dont believe said mrs askerton that what people call consolation is ever of any use it is a terrible thing to lose a father  very terrible ah dear i have hardly yet found out how sad it is as yet i have only been thinking of myself and wishing that i could be with him  nay clara  how can i help it what am i to do or where am i to go of what use is life to such a one as me and for himwho would dare to wish him back again when people have fallen and gone down in the world it is bad for them to go on living everything is a trouble and there is nothing but vexation  think what i have suffered dear  but you have had somebody to care for yousomebody whom you could trust  and have not you  no no one  what do you mean clara  i mean what i say i have no one it is no use asking questionsnot now at such a time as this and i did not mean to complain complaining is weak and foolish i have often told myself that i could bear anything and so i will when i can bring myself to think of what i have lost in my father i shall be better even though i shall be more sorrowful as it is i hate myself for being so selfish  you will let me come and stay with you today will you not  no dear not today  why not today clara  i shall be better alone i have so many things to think of  i know well that it would be better that you should not be alonemuch better but i will not press it i cannot insist with you as another woman would  you are wrong there quite wrong i would be led by you sooner than by any woman living what other woman is there to whom i would listen for a moment as she said this even in the depth of her sorrow she thought of lady aylmer and strengthened herself in her resolution to rebel against her lovers mother then she continued i wish i knew my cousin marymary belton but i have never seen her  is she nice  so will tells me and i know that what he says must be trueeven about his sister  will will you are always thinking of your cousin will if he be really so good he will show it now  how can he show it what can he do  does he not inherit all the property  of course he does and what of that when i say that i have no friend i am not thinking of my poverty  if he has that regard for you which he pretends he can do much to assist you why should he not come here at once  god forbid  why why do you say so he is your nearest relative  if you do not understand i cannot explain  has he been told what has happened mrs askerton asked  colonel askerton sent a message to him i believe  and to captain aylmer also  yes and to captain aylmer it was colonel askerton who sent it  then he will come of course  i think not why should he come he did not even know poor papa  but my dear clara has he not known you  you will see that he will not come and i tell you beforehand that he will be right to stay away indeed i do not know how he could comeand i do not want him here  i cannot understand you clara  i suppose not i cannot very well understand myself  i should not be at all surprised if lady aylmer were to come herself  oh heavens how little you can know of lady aylmers position and character  but if she is to be your motherinlaw  and even if she were the idea of lady aylmer coming away from aylmer parkall the way from yorkshire to such a house as this if they told me that the queen was coming it would hardly disconcert me more but dear there is no danger of that at least  i do not know what may have passed between you and him but unless there has been some quarrel he will come that is he will do so if he is at all like any men whom i have known  he will not come  then mrs askerton made some halfwhispered offers of services to be rendered by colonel askerton and soon afterwards took her leave having first asked permission to come again in the afternoon and when that was declined having promised to return on the following morning as she walked back to the cottage she could not but think more of claras engagement to captain aylmer than she did of the squires death as regarded herself of course she could not grieve for mr amedroz and as regarded clara claras father had for some time past been apparently so insignificant even in his own house that it was difficult to acknowledge the fact that the death of such a one as he might leave a great blank in the world but what had clara meant by declaring so emphatically that captain aylmer would not visit belton and by speaking of herself as one who had neither position nor friends in the world if there had been a quarrel indeed then it was sufficiently intelligibleand if there was any such quarrel from what source must it have arisen mrs askerton felt the blood rise to her cheeks as she thought of this and told herself that there could be but one such source mrs askerton knew that clara had received orders from aylmer castle to discontinue all acquaintance with herself and therefore there could be no doubt as to the cause of the quarrel it had come to this then that clara was to lose her husband because she was true to her friend or rather because she would not consent to cast an additional stone at one who for some years past had become a mark for many stones  i am not prepared to say that mrs askerton was a highminded woman misfortunes had come upon her in life of a sort which are too apt to quench high nobility of mind in woman there are calamities which by their natural tendencies elevate the character of women and add strength to the growth of feminine virtuesbut then again there are other calamities which few women can bear without some degradation without some injury to that delicacy and tenderness which is essentially necessary to make a woman charmingas a woman in this i think the world is harder to women than to men that a woman often loses much by the chance of adverse circumstances which a man only loses by his own misconduct that there are women whom no calamity can degrade is true enoughand so it is true that there are some men who are heroes but such are exceptions both among men and women not such a one had mrs askerton been calamity had come upon herpartly indeed by her own fault though that might have been pardonedbut the weight of her misfortunes had been too great for her strength and she had become in some degree hardened by what she had endured if not unfeminine still she was feminine in an inferior degree with womanly feelings of a lower order and she had learned to intrigue not being desirous of gaining aught by dishonest intriguing but believing that she could only hold her own by carrying on her battle after that fashion in all this i am speaking of the general character of the woman and am not alluding to the one sin which she had committed thus when she had first become acquainted with miss amedroz her conscience had not rebuked her in that she was deceiving her new friend when asked casually in conversation as to her maiden name she had not blushed as she answered the question with a falsehood when unfortunately the name of her first husband had in some way made itself known to clara she had been ready again with some prepared fib and when she had recognised william belton she had thought that the danger to herself of having any one near her who might know her quite justified her in endeavouring to create illwill between clara and her cousin selfpreservation is the first law of nature she would have said and would have failed to remember as she did always fail to rememberthat nature does not require by any of its laws that selfpreservation should be aided by falsehood  but though she was not highminded so also was she not ungenerous and now as she began to understand that clara was sacrificing herself because of that promise which had been given when they two had stood together at the window in the cottage drawingroom she was capable of feeling more for her friend than for herself she was capable even of telling herself that it was cruel on her part even to wish for any continuance of claras acquaintance i have made my bed and i must lie upon it she said to herself and then she resolved that instead of going up to the house on the following day she would write to clara and put an end to the intimacy which existed between them the world is hard and harsh and unjust she said still speaking to herself but that is not her fault i will not injure her because i have been injured myself  colonel askerton was up at the house on the same day but he did not ask for miss amedroz nor did she see him nobody else came to the house then or on the following morning or on that afternoon though clara did not fail to tell herself that captain aylmer might have been there if he had chosen to take the journey and to leave home as soon as he had received the message and she made the same calculation as to her cousin willthough in that calculation as we know she was wrong these two days had been very desolate with her and she had begun to look forward to mrs askertons comingwhen instead of that there came a messenger with a letter from the cottage  you can do as you like my dear colonel askerton had said on the previous evening to his wife he had listened to all she had been saying without taking his eyes from off his newspaper though she had spoken with much eagerness  but that is not enough you should say more to me than that  now i think you are unreasonable for myself i do not care how this matter goes nor do i care one straw what any tongues may say they cannot reach me excepting so far as they may reach me through you  but you should advise me  i always docopiously when i think that i know better than you but in this matter i feel so sure that you know better than i that i dont wish to suggest anything then he went on with his newspaper and she sat for a while looking at him as though she expected that something more would be said but nothing more was said and she was left entirely to her own guidance  since the days in which her troubles had come upon mrs askerton clara amedroz was the first female friend who had come near her to comfort her and she was very loth to abandon such comfort there had too been something more than comfort something almost approaching to triumph when she found that clara had clung to her with affection after hearing the whole story of her life though her conscience had not pricked her while she was exercising all her little planned deceits she had not taken much pleasure in them how should any one take pleasure in such work many of us daily deceive our friends and are so far gone in deceit that the deceit alone is hardly painful to us but the need of deceiving a friend is always painful the treachery is easy but to be treacherous to those we love is never easynever easy even though it be so common there had been a double delight to this poor woman in the near neighbourhood of clara amedroz since there had ceased to be any necessity for falsehood on her part but now almost before her joy had commenced almost before she had realised the sweetness of her triumph had come upon her this task of doing that herself which clara in her generosity had refused to do i have made my bed and i must lie upon it she said and then instead of going down to the house as she had promised she wrote the following letter to miss amedroz      the cottage monday     dearest clarai need not tell you that i write as i do    now with a bleeding heart a few days since i should have    laughed at any woman who used such a phrase of herself    and declared her to be an affected fool but now i know    how true such a word may be my heart is bleeding and    i feel myself to be overcome by my disgrace you told    me that i did not understand you yesterday of course i    understood you of course i know how it all is and why    you spoke as you did of captain aylmer he has chosen to    think that you could not know me without pollution and    has determined that you must give up either me or him    though he has judged me i am not going to judge him the    world is on his side and perhaps he is right he knows    nothing of my trials and difficultiesand why should    he i do not blame him for demanding that his future wife    shall not be intimate with a woman who is supposed to have    lost her fitness for the society of women     at any rate dearest you must obey himand we will see    each other no more i am quite sure that i should be very    wicked were i to allow you to injure your position in life    on my account you at any rate love him and would be    happy with him and as you are engaged to him you have no    just ground for resenting his interference     you will understand me now as well as though i were to    fill sheets and sheets of paper with what i could say    on the subject the simple fact is that you and i must    forget each other or simply remember one another as past    friends you will know in a day or two what your plans    are if you remain here we will go away if you go away    we will remain herethat is if your cousin will keep    us as tenants i do not of course know what you may have    written to captain aylmer since our interview up here    but i beg that you will write to him now and make him    understand that he need have no fears in respect of me    you may send him this letter if you will oh dear if you    could know what i suffer as i write this     i feel that i owe you an apology for harassing you on such    a subject at such a time but i know that i ought not to    lose a day in telling you that you are to see nothing more    of the friend who has loved you     mary askerton   claras first impulse on receiving this letter was to go off at once to the cottage and insist on her privilege of choosing her own friends if she preferred mrs askerton to captain aylmer that was no ones business but her own and she would have done so had she not been afraid of meeting with colonel askerton to him she would not have known how to speak on such a subjectnor would she have known how to conduct herself at the cottage without speaking of it and then after a while she felt that were she to do soshould she now deliberately determine to throw herself into mrs askertons armsshe must at the same time give up all idea of becoming captain aylmers wife as she thought of this she asked herself various questions concerning him which she did not find it easy to answer did she wish to be his wife could she assure herself that if they were married they would make each other happy did she love him she was still able to declare to herself that the answer to the last question should be an affirmative but nevertheless she thought that she could give him up without great unhappiness and when she began to think of lady aylmer and to remember that frederic aylmers imperative demands upon her obedience had in all probability been dictated by his mother she was again anxious to go at once to the cottage and declare that she would not submit to any interference with her own judgment  on the next morning the postman brought to her a letter which was of much moment to herbut he brought to her also tidings which moved her more even than the letter the letter was from the lawyer and enclosed a cheque for seventyfive pounds which he had been instructed to pay to her as the interest of the money left to her by her aunt what should be her answer to that letter she knew very welland she instantly wrote it sending back the cheque to mr green the postmans news more important than the letter told her that william belton was at the inn at redicote     chapter xxii  passionate pleading   clara wrote her letter to the lawyer returning the cheque before she would allow herself a moment to dwell upon the news of her cousins arrival she felt that it was necessary to do that before she should even see her cousinthus providing against any difficulty which might arise from adverse advice on his part and as soon as the letter was written she sent it to the postoffice in the village she would do almost anything that will might tell her to do but captain aylmers money she would not take even though will might so direct her they would tell her no doubt among them that the money was her ownthat she might take it without owing any thanks for it to captain aylmer but she knew better than thatas she told herself over and over again her aunt had left her nothing and nothing would she have from captain aylmerunless she had all that captain aylmer had to give after the fashion in which women best love to take such gifts  then when she had done that she was able to think of her cousins visit i knew he would come she said to herself as she sat herself in one of the old chairs in the hall with a large shawl wrapped round her shoulders she had just been to the front door with the nominal purpose of despatching her messenger thence to the postoffice but she had stood for a minute or two under the portico looking in the direction by which belton would come from redicote expecting or rather hoping that she might see his figure or hear the sound of his gig but she saw nothing and heard nothing and so returned into the hall slowly shutting the door i knew that he would come she said repeating to herself the same words over and over again yet when mrs askerton had told her that he would do this thing which he had now done she had expressed herself as almost frightened by the idea god forbid she had said nevertheless now that he was there at redicote she assured herself that his coming was a thing of which she had been certain and she took a joy in the knowledge of his nearness to her which she did not attempt to define to herself had he not said that he would be a brother to her and was it not a brothers part to go to a sister in affliction i knew that he would come i was sure of it he is so true as to captain aylmers not coming she said nothing even to herself but she felt that she had been equally sure on that subject of course captain aylmer would not come he had sent her seventyfive pounds in lieu of coming and in doing so was true to his character both men were doing exactly that which was to have been expected of them so at least clara amedroz now assured herself she did not ask herself how it was that she had come to love the thinner and the meaner of the two men but she knew well that such had been her fate  on a sudden she rose from her chair as though remembering a duty to be performed and went to the kitchen and directed that breakfast might be got ready for mr belton he would have travelled all nightand would be in want of food since the old squires death there had been no regular meal served in the house and clara had taken such scraps of food and cups of tea as the old servant of the house had brought to her but now the cloth must be spread again and as she did this with her own hands she remembered the dinners which had been prepared for captain aylmer at perivale after his aunts death it seemed to her that she was used to be in the house with death and that the sadness and solemn ceremonies of woe were becoming things familiar to her there grew upon her a feeling that it must be so with her always the circumstances of her life would ever be sad what right had she to expect any other fate after such a catastrophe as that which her brother had brought upon the family it was clear to her that she had done wrong in supposing that she could marry and live with a prosperous man of the world like captain aylmer their natures were different and no such union could lead to any good so she told herself with much misery of spirit as she was preparing the breakfasttable for william belton  but william belton did not come to eat the breakfast he got what he wanted in that way at the inn at redicote and even then hesitated loitering at the bar before he would go over what was he to say and how would he be received after all had he not done amiss in coming to a house at which he probably might not be wanted would it not be thought that his journey had been made solely with a view to his own property he would be regarded as the heir pouncing upon the inheritance before as yet the old owner was under the ground at any rate it would be too early for him to make his visit yet awhile and to kill time he went over to a carpenter who had been employed by him about the place at belton the carpenter spoke to him as though everything were his own and was very intent upon future improvements this made will more disgusted with himself than ever and before he could get out of the carpenters yard he thoroughly wished himself back at plaistow but having come so far he could hardly return without seeing his cousin and at last he had himself driven over reaching the house between eleven and twelve oclock in the day  clara met him in the hall and at once led him into the room which she had prepared for him he had given her his hand in the hall but did not speak to her till she had spoken to him after the closing of the room door behind them i thought that you would come she said still holding him by the hand  i did not know what to do he answered i couldnt say which was best now i am here i shall only be in your way he did not dare to press her hand nor could he bring himself to take his away from her  in my wayyes as an angel to tell me what to do in my trouble i knew you would come because you are so good but you will have breakfastsee i have got it ready for you  oh no i breakfasted at redicote i would not trouble you  trouble me will oh will if you knew then there came tears in her eyes and at the sight of them both his own were filled how was he to stand it to take her to his bosom and hold her there for always to wipe away her tears so that she should weep no more to devote himself and all his energy and all that was his to comfort herthis he could have done but he knew not how to do anything short of this every word that she spoke to him was an encouragement to this and yet he knew that it could not be so to say a word of his love or even to look it would now be an unmanly insult and yet how was he not to look itnot to speak of it it is such a comfort that you should be here with me she said  then i am glad i am here though i do not know what i can do did he suffer much clara  no i think not very little he sank at last quicker than i expected but just as i thought he would go he used to speak of you so often and always with regard and esteem  dear old man  yes will he was in spite of his little faults no father ever loved his daughter better than he loved me  after a while the servant brought in the tea explaining to belton that miss clara had neither eaten nor drank that morning she wouldnt take anything till you came sir then will added his entreaties and clara was persuaded and by degrees there grew between them more ease of manner and capability for talking than had been within their reach when they first met and during the morning many things were explained as to which clara would a few hours previously have thought it to be almost impossible that she should speak to her cousin she had told him of her aunts money and the way in which she had on that very morning sent back the cheque to the lawyer and she had said something also as to lady aylmers views and her own views as to lady aylmer with will this subject was one most difficult of discussion and he blushed and fidgeted in his chair and walked about the room and found himself unable to look clara in the face as she spoke to him but she went on goading him with the name which of all names was the most distasteful to him and mentioning that name almost in terms of reproachof reproach which he felt it would be ungenerous to reciprocate but which he would have exaggerated to unmeasured abuse if he had given his tongue licence to speak his mind  i was right to send back the moneywasnt i will say that i was right pray tell me that you think so  i dont understand it at present you see i am no lawyer  but it doesnt want a lawyer to know that i couldnt take the money from him i am sure you feel that  if a man owes money of course he ought to pay it  but he doesnt owe it will it is intended for generosity  you dont want anybodys generosity certainly then he reflected that clara must after all depend entirely on the generosity of some one till she was married and he wanted to explain to her that everything he had in the world was at her servicewas indeed her own or he would have explained if he knew how that he did not intend to take advantage of the entailthat the belton estate should belong to her as the natural heir of her father but he conceived that the moment for explaining this had hardly as yet arrived and that he had better confine himself to some attempt at teaching her that no extraneous assistance would be necessary to her in money matters said he of course you are to look to me that is a matter of course ill see green about the other affairs green and i are friends well settle it  thats not what i meant will  but its what i mean this is one of those things in which a man has to act on his own judgment your father and i understood each other  he did not understand that i was to accept your bounty  bounty is a nasty word and i hate it you accepted meas your brother and as such i mean to act the word almost stuck in his throat but he brought it out at last in a fierce tone of which she understood accurately the cause and meaning all money matters about the place must be settled by me indeed thats why i came down  not only for that will  just to be useful in that way i mean  you came to see mebecause you knew i should want you surely this was malice prepense knowing what was his want how could she exasperate it by talking thus of her own as for money i have no claim on any one no creature was ever more forlorn but i will not talk of that  did you not say that you would treat me as a brother  i did not mean that i was to be a burden on you  i know what i meant and that is sufficient  belton had been at the house some hours before he made any sign of leaving her and when he did so he had to explain something of his plans he would remain he said for about a week in the neighbourhood she of course was obliged to ask him to stay at the houseat the house which was in fact his own but he declined to do this blurting out his reason at last very plainly captain aylmer would not like it and i suppose you are bound to think of what he likes and dislikes i dont know what right captain aylmer would have to dislike any such thing said clara but nevertheless she allowed the reason to pass as current and did not press her invitation will declared that he would stay at the inn at redicote striving to explain in some very unintelligible manner that such an arrangement would be very convenient he would remain at redicote and would come over to belton every day during his sojourn in the country then he asked one question in a low whisper as to the last sad ceremony and having received an answer started off with the declared intention of calling on colonel askerton  the next two or three days passed uncomfortably enough with will belton he made his headquarters at the little inn of redicote and drove himself backwards and forwards between that place and the estate which was now his own on each of these days he saw colonel askerton whom he found to be a civil pleasant man willing enough to rid himself of the unpleasant task he had undertaken but at the same time willing also to continue his services if any further services were required of him but of mrs askerton on these occasions will saw nothing nor had he ever spoken to her since the time of his first visit to the castle then came the day of the funeral and after that rite was over he returned with his cousin to the house there was no will to be read the old squire had left no will nor was there anything belonging to him at the time of his death that he could bequeath the furniture in the house the wornout carpets and oldfashioned chairs belonged to clara but beyond that property had she none nor had it been in her fathers power to endow her with anything she was alone in the world penniless with a conviction on her own mind that her engagement with frederic aylmer must of necessity come to an end and with a feeling about her cousin which she could hardly analyse but which told her that she could not go to his house in norfolk nor live with him at belton castle nor trust herself in his hands as she would into those of a real brother  on the afternoon of the day on which her father had been buried she brought to him a letter asking him to read it and tell her what she should do the letter was from lady aylmer and contained an invitation to aylmer castle it had been accompanied as the reader may possibly remember by a letter from captain aylmer himself of this she of course informed her cousin but she did not find it to be necessary to show the letter of one rival to the other lady aylmers letter was cold in its expression of welcome but very dictatorial in pointing out the absolute necessity that clara should accept the invitation so given i think you will not fail to agree with me dear miss amedroz the letter said that under these strange and perplexing circumstances this is the only roof which can with any propriety afford you a shelter and why not the poorhouse she said aloud to her cousin when she perceived that his eye had descended so far on the page he shook his head angrily but said nothing and when he had finished the letter he folded it and gave it back still in silence and what am i to do she said you tell me that i am to come to you for advice in everything  you must decide for yourself here  and you wont advise me you wont tell me whether she is right  i suppose she is right  then i had better go  if you mean to marry captain aylmer you had better go  i am engaged to him  then you had better go  but i will not submit myself to her tyranny  let the marriage take place at once and you will have to submit only to his i suppose you are prepared for that  i do not know i do not like tyranny  again he stood silent for awhile looking at her and then he answered i should not tyrannise over you clara  oh will will do not speak like that do not destroy everything  what am i to say  what would you say if your sister your real sister asked advice in such a strait if you had a sister who came to you and told you all her difficulty you would advise her you would not say words to make things worse for her  it would be very different  but you said you would be my brother  how am i to know what you feel for this man it seems to me that you half hate him half fear him and sometimes despise him  hate himno i never hate him  go to him then and ask him what you had better do dont ask me then he hurried out of the room slamming the door behind him but before he had half gone down the stairs he remembered the ceremony at which he had just been present and how desolate she was in the world and he returned to her i beg your pardon clara he said i am passionate but i must be a beast to show my passion to you on such a day as this if i were you i should accept lady aylmers invitationmerely thanking her for it in the ordinary way i should then go and see how the land lay that is the advice i should give my sister  and i willif it is only because you tell me  but as for a hometell her you have one of your ownat belton castle from which no one can turn you out and where no one can intrude on you this house belongs to you then before she could answer him he had left the room and she listened to his heavy quick footsteps as he went across the hall and out of the front door  he walked across the park and entered the little gate of colonel askertons garden as though it were his habit to go to the cottage when he was at belton there had been various matters on which the two men had been brought into contact concerning the old squires death and the tenancy of the cottage so that they had become almost intimate belton had nothing new that he specially desired to say to colonel askerton whom indeed he had seen only a short time before at the funeral but he wanted the relief of speaking to some one before he returned to the solitude of the inn at redicote on this occasion however the colonel was out and the maid asked him if he would see mrs askerton when he said something about not troubling her the girl told him that her mistress wished to speak to him and then he had no alternative but to allow himself to be shown into the drawingroom  i want to see you a minute said mrs askerton bowing to him without putting out her hand that i might ask you how you find your cousin  she is pretty well i think  colonel askerton has seen more of her than i have since her fathers death and he says that she does not bear it well he thinks that she is ill  i do not think her ill of course she is not in good spirits  no exactly how should she be but he thinks she seems so worn i hope you will excuse me mr belton but i love her so well that i cannot bear to be quite in the dark as to her future is anything settled yet  she is going to aylmer castle  to aylmer castle is she indeed at once  very soon lady aylmer has asked her  lady aylmer then i suppose  you suppose what will belton asked  i did not think she would have gone to aylmer castlethough i dare say it is the best thing she could do she seemed to me to dislike the aylmersthat is lady aylmerso much but i suppose she is right  she is right to go if she likes it  she is circumstanced so cruelly is she not where else could she go i do so feel for her i believe i need hardly tell you mr belton that she would be as welcome here as flowers in maybut that i do not dare to ask her to come to us she said this in a low voice turning her eyes away from him looking first upon the ground and then again up at the windowbut still not daring to meet his eye  i dont exactly know about that said belton awkwardly  you know i hope that i love her dearly  everybody does that said will  you do mr belton  yesi do just as though she weremy sister  and as your sister would you let her come hereto us he sat silent for awhile thinking and she waited patiently for his answer but she spoke again before he answered her i am well aware that you know all my history mr belton  i shouldnt tell it her if you mean that though she were my sister if she were my wife i should tell her  and why your wife  because then i should be sure it would do no harm  then i find that you can be generous mr belton but she knows it all as well as you do  i did not tell her  nor did ibut i should have done so had not captain aylmer been before me and now tell me whether i could ask her to come here  it would be useless as she is going to aylmer castle  but she is going there simply to find a homehaving no other  that is not so mrs askerton she has a home as perfectly her own as any woman in the land belton castle is hers to do what she may please with it she can live here if she likes it and nobody can say a word to her she need not go to aylmer castle to look for a home  you mean you would lend her the house  it is hers  i do not understand you mr belton  it does not signifywe will say no more about it  and you think she likes going to lady aylmers  how should i say what she likes  then there was another pause before mrs askerton spoke again i can tell you one thing she said she does not like him  that is her affair  but she should be taught to know her own mind before she throws herself away altogether you would not wish your cousin to marry a man whom she does not love because at one time she had come to think that she loved him that is the truth of it mr belton if she goes to aylmer castle she will marry himand she will be an unhappy woman always afterwards if you would sanction her coming here for a few days i think all that would be cured she would come in a moment if you advised her  then he went away allowing himself to make no further answer at the moment and discussed the matter with himself as he walked back to redicote meditating on it with all his mind and all his heart and all his strength and as he meditated it came on to rain bitterlya cold piercing february rainand the darkness of night came upon him and he floundered on through the thick mud of the somersetshire lanes unconscious of the weather and of the darkness there was a way open to him by which he might even yet get what he wanted he thought he saw that there was a way open to him through the policy of this woman whom he perceived to have become friendly to him he saw or thought that he saw it all no day had absolutely been fixed for this journey to yorkshire and if clara were induced to go first to the cottage and stay there with mrs askerton no such journey might ever be taken he could well understand that such a visit on her part would give a mortal offence to all the aylmers that tyranny of which clara spoke with so much dread would be exhibited then without reserve and so there would be an end altogether of the aylmer alliance but were she once to start for aylmer park then there would be no hope for him then her fate would be decidedand his as far as he could see tooas far as he could see then there would be no dishonesty in this plan why should clara not go to mrs askertons house what could be more natural than such a visit at such a time if she were in truth his sister he would not interfere to prevent it if she wished it he had told himself that the woman should be forgiven her offence and had thought that that forgiveness should be complete if the aylmers were so unreasonable as to quarrel with her on this ground let them quarrel with her mrs askerton had told him that clara did not really like captain aylmer perhaps it was so and if so what greater kindness could he do her than give her an opportunity for escaping such a union  the whole of the next day he remained at redicote thinking doubting striving to reconcile his wishes and his honesty it rained all day and as he sat alone smoking in the comfortless inn he told himself that the rain was keeping himbut in truth it was not the rain had he resolved to do his best to prevent this visit to yorkshire or had he resolved to further it i think he would have gone to belton without much fear of the rain on the second day after the funeral he did go and he had then made up his mind clara if she would listen to him should show her independence of lady aylmer by staying a few days with the askertons before she went to yorkshire and by telling lady aylmer that such was her intention if she really loves the man he said to himself she will go at once in spite of anything that i can say if she does not i shall be saving her  how cruel of you not to come yesterday clara said as soon as she saw him  it rained hard he answered  but men like you care so little for rain but that is when you have business to take you outor pleasure  you need not be so severe the truth is i had things to trouble me  what troubled you will i thought all the trouble was mine  i suppose everybody thinks that his own shoe pinches the hardest  your shoe cant pinch you very bad i should think sometimes when i think of you it seems that you are an embodiment of prosperity and happiness  i dont see it myselfthats all did you write to lady aylmer clara  i wrote but i didnt send it i would not send any letter till i had shown it to you as you are my confessor and adviser there read it nothing i think could be more courteous or less humble he took the letter and read it clara had simply expressed herself willing to accept lady aylmers invitation and asked her ladyship to fix a day there was no mention of captain aylmers name in the note  and you think this is best he said his voice was hardly like his own as he spoke there was wanting to it that tone of selfassurance which his voice almost always possessed even when selfassurance was lacking to his words  i thought it was your own advice she said  wellyes that is i dont quite know you couldnt go for a week or so yet i suppose  perhaps in about a week  and what will you do till then  what will i do  yeswhere do you mean to stay  i thought will that perhaps you would let meremain here  let youoh heavens look here clara  what is it will  before heaven i want to do for you what may be the best for youwithout thinking of myselfwithout thinking of myself if i could only help it  i have never doubted you i never will doubt you i believe in you next to my god i do will i do he walked up and down the room halfadozen times before he spoke again while she stood by the table watching him i wish she said i knew what it is that troubles you to this he made no answer but went on walking till she came up to him and putting both her hands upon his arm said it will be better will that i should gowill it not speak to me and say so i feel that it will be better then he stopped in his walk and looked down upon her as her hands still rested upon his shoulder he gazed upon her for some few seconds remaining quite motionless and then opening his arms he surrounded her with his embrace and pressing her with all his strength close to his bosom kissed her forehead and her cheeks and her lips and her eyes his will was so masterful his strength so great and his motion so quick that she was powerless to escape from him till he relaxed his hold indeed she hardly struggled so much was she surprised and so soon released but the moment that he left her he saw that her face was burning red and that the tears were streaming from her eyes she stood for a moment trembling with her hands clenched and with a look of scorn upon her lips and brow that he had never seen before and then she threw herself on a sofa and burying her face sobbed aloud while her whole body was shaken as with convulsions he leaned over her repentant not knowing what to do not knowing how to speak all ideas of his scheme had gone from him now he had offended her for everpast redemption what could be the use now of any scheme and as he stood there he hated himself because of his scheme the utter misery and disgrace of the present moment had come upon him because he had thought more of himself than of her it was but a few moments since she had told him that she trusted him next to her god and yet in those few moments he had shown himself utterly unworthy of that trust and had destroyed all her confidence but he could not leave her without speaking to her clara he saidclara but she did not answer him clara will you not speak to me will you not let me ask you to forgive me but still she only sobbed for her at that moment we may say that sobbing was easier than speech how was she to pardon so great an offence how was she to resent such passionate love  but he could not continue to stand there motionless all but speechless while she lay with her face turned away from him he must at any rate in some manner take himself away out of the room and this he could not do even in his present condition of unlimited disgrace without a word of farewell perhaps i had better go and leave you he said  then at last there came a voice oh will why have you done this why have you treated me so badly when he had last seen her face her mouth had been full of scorn but there was no scorn now in her voice whywhywhy  why indeedexcept that it was needful for him that she should know the depth of his passion if you will forgive me clara i will not offend you so again he said  you have offended me what am i to say what am i to do i have no other friend  i am a wretch i know that i am a wretch  i did not suspect that you would be so cruel oh will  but before he went she told him that she had forgiven him and she had preached to him a solemn sweet sermon on the wickedness of yielding to momentary impulses her low grave words sank into his ears as though they were divine and when she said a word to him blushing as she spoke of the sin of his passion and of what her sin would be if she were to permit it he sat by her weeping like an infant tears which were certainly tears of innocence she had been very angry with him but i think she loved him better when her sermon was finished than she had ever loved him before  there was no further question as to her going to aylmer castle nor was any mention made of mrs askertons invitation to the cottage the letter for lady aylmer was sent and it was agreed between them that will should remain at redicote till the answer from yorkshire should come and should then convey clara as far as london on her journey and when he took leave of her that afternoon she was able to give him her hand in her old hearty loving way and to call him will with the old hearty loving tone and hehe was able to accept these tokens of her graciousness as though they were signs of a pardon which she had been good to give but which he certainly had not deserved  as he went back to redicote he swore to himself that he would never love any woman but hereven though she must be the wife of captain aylmer     chapter xxiii  the last day at belton   in course of post there came an answer from lady aylmer naming a day for claras journey to yorkshire and also a letter from captain aylmer in which he stated that he would meet her in london and convey her down to aylmer park the house is sitting he said and therefore i shall be a little troubled about my time but i cannot allow that your first meeting with my mother should take place in my absence this was all very well but at the end of the letter there was a word of caution that was not so well i am sure my dear clara that you will remember how much is due to my mothers age and character and position nothing will be wanted to the happiness of our marriage if you can succeed in gaining her affection and therefore i make it my first request to you that you should endeavour to win her good opinion there was nothing perhaps really amiss certainly nothing unreasonable in such words from a future husband to his future wife but clara as she read them shook her head and pressed her foot against the ground in anger it would not do sorrow would come and trouble and disappointment she did not say so even to herself in words but the words though not spoken were audible enough to herself she could not would not bend to lady aylmer and she knew that trouble would come of this visit  i fear that many ladies will condemn miss amedroz when i tell them that she showed this letter to her cousin will it does not promise well for any of the parties concerned when a young woman with two lovers can bring herself to show the loveletters of him to whom she is engaged to the other lover whom she has refused but i have two excuses to put forward in claras defence in the first place captain aylmers loveletters were not in truth loveletters but were letters of business and in the next place clara was teaching herself to regard will belton as her brother and to forget that he had ever assumed the part of a lover  she was so teaching herself but i cannot say that the lesson was one easily learned nor had the outrage upon her of which will had been guilty and which was described in the last chapter made the teaching easier but she had determined nevertheless that it should be so when she thought of will her heart would become very soft towards him and sometimes when she thought of captain aylmer her heart would become anything but soft towards him unloving feelings would be very strong within her bosom as she reread his letters and remembered that he had not come to her but had sent her seventyfive pounds to comfort her in her trouble nevertheless he was to be her husband and she would do her duty what might have happened had will belton come to belton castle before she had known frederic aylmerof that she stoutly resolved that she would never think at all and consequently the thought was always intruding upon her  you will sleep one night in town of course said will  i suppose so you know all about it i shall do as im told  you cant go down to yorkshire from here in one day where would you like to stay in london  how on earth should i know ladies do sleep at hotels in london sometimes i suppose  oh yes i can write and have rooms ready for you  then that difficulty is over said clara  but in beltons estimation the difficulty was not exactly over captain aylmer would of course be in london that night and it was a question with will whether or no clara was not bound in honour to tell theaccursed beast i am afraid mr belton called him in his soliloquieswhere she would lodge on the occasion or would it suffice that he will should hand her over to the enemy at the station of the great northern railway on the following morning all the little intricacies of the question presented themselves to wills imagination how careful he would be with her that the inn accommodation should suffice for her comfort with what pleasure would he order a little dinner for them two making something of a gentle fête of the occasion how sedulously would he wait upon her with those little attentions amounting almost to worship with which such men as will belton are prone to treat all women in exceptionable circumstances when the ordinary routine of life has been disturbed if she had simply been his cousin and if he had never regarded her otherwise how happily could he have done all this as things now were if it was left to him to do he should do it with what patience and grace might be within his power he would do it though he would be mindful every moment of the bitterness of the transfer which he would so soon be obliged to make but he doubted whether it would not be better for claras sake that the transfer should be made overnight he would take her up to london because in that way he could be useful and then he would go away and hide himself has captain aylmer said where he would meet you he asked after a pause  of course i must write and tell him  and is he to come to youwhen you reach london  he has said nothing about that he will probably be at the house of commons or too busy somewhere to come to me then but why do you ask do you wish to hurry through town  oh dear no  or perhaps you have friends you want to see pray dont let me be in your way i shall do very well you know  belton rebuked her by a look before he answered her i was only thinking he said of what would be most convenient for yourself i have nobody to see and nothing to do and nowhere to go to then clara understood it all and said that she would write to captain aylmer and ask him to join them at the hotel  she determined that she would see mrs askerton before she went and as that lady did not come to the castle clara called upon her at the cottage this she did the day before she left and she took her cousin with her belton had been at the cottage once or twice since the day on which mrs askerton had explained to him how the aylmer alliance might be extinguished but colonel askerton had always been there and no reference had been made to the former conversation colonel askerton was not there now and belton was almost afraid that words would be spoken to which he would hardly know how to listen  and so you are really going said mrs askerton  yes we start tomorrow said clara  i am not thinking of the journey to london said mrs askerton but of the danger and privations of your subsequent progress to the north  i shall do very well i am not afraid that any one will eat me  there are so many different ways of eating people are there not mr belton  i dont know about eating but there are a great many ways of boring people said he  and i should think they will be great at that kind of thing at aylmer castle one never hears of sir anthony but i can fancy lady aylmer to be a terrible woman  i shall manage to hold my own i dare say said clara  i hope you will i do hope you will said mrs askerton i dont know whether you will be powerful to do so or whether you will fail my heart is not absolute but i do know what will be the result if you are successful  it is much more then than i know myself  that i can believe too do you travel down to yorkshire alone  no captain aylmer will meet me in town  then mrs askerton looked at mr belton but made no immediate reply nor did she say anything further about claras journey she looked at mr belton and will caught her eye and understood that he was being rebuked for not having carried out that little scheme which had been prepared for him but he had come to hate the scheme and almost hated mrs askerton for proposing it he had declared to himself that her welfare claras welfare was the one thing which he should regard and he had told himself that he was not strong enough either in purpose or in wit to devise schemes for her welfare she was better able to manage things for herself than he was to manage them for her if she loved this accursed beast let her marry him onlyfor that was now his one difficultyonly he could not bring himself to think it possible that she should love him  i suppose you will never see this place again said mrs askerton after a long pause  i hope i shall very often said clara why should i not see it again it is not going out of the family  no not exactly out of the family that is it will belong to your cousin  and cousins may be as far apart as strangers you mean but will and i are not like that are we will  i hardly know what we are like said he  you do not mean to say that you will throw me over but the truth is mrs askerton that i do not mean to be thrown over i look upon him as my brother and i intend to cling to him as sisters do cling  you will hardly come back here before you are married said mrs askerton it was a terrible speech for her to make and could only be excused on the ground that the speaker was in truth desirous of doing that which she thought would benefit both of those whom she addressed of course you are going to your wedding now  i am doing nothing of the kind said clara how can you speak in that way to me so soon after my fathers death it is a rebuke to me for being here at all  i intend no rebuke as you well know what i mean is this if you do not stay in yorkshire till you are married let the time be when it may where do you intend to go in the meantime  my plans are not settled yet  she will have this house if she pleases said will there will be no one else here it will be her own to do as she likes with it  she will hardly come hereto be alone  i will not be inquired into my dear said clara speaking with restored goodhumour of course i am an unprotected female and subject to disadvantages perhaps i have no plans for the future and if i have plans perhaps i do not mean to divulge them  i had better come to the point at once said mrs askerton ififif it should ever suit you pray come here to us flowers shall not be more welcome in may it is difficult to speak of it all though you both understand everything as well as i do i cannot press my invitation as another woman might  yes you can said clara with energy of course you can  can i then i do dear clara do come to us and then as she spoke mrs askerton knelt on the ground at her visitors knees mr belton do tell her that when she is tired with the grandeur of aylmer park she may come to us here  i dont know anything about the grandeur of aylmer park said will suddenly  but she may come heremay she not  she will not ask my leave said he  she says that you are her brother whose leave should she ask  he knows that i should ask his rather than that of any living person said clara  there mr belton now you must say that she may comeor that she may not  i will say nothing she knows what to do much better than i can tell her  mrs askerton was still kneeling and again appealed to clara you hear what he says what do you say yourself will you come to usthat is if such a visit will suit youin point of convenience  i will make no promise but i know no reason why i should not  and i must be content with that well i will be content then she got up for such a one as i am that is a great deal and mr belton let me tell you thisi can be grateful to you though you cannot be gracious to me  i hope i have not been ungracious said he  upon my word i cannot compliment you but there is something so much better than grace that i can forgive you you know at any rate how thoroughly i wish you well  upon this clara got up to take her leave and the demonstrative affection of an embrace between the two women afforded a remedy for the awkwardness of the previous conversation  god bless you dearest said mrs askerton may i write to you  certainly said clara  and you will answer my letters  of course i will you must tell me everything about the placeand especially as to bessy bessy is never to be soldis she will bessy was the cow which belton had given her  not if you choose to keep her  i will go down and see to her myself said mrs askerton and will utter little prayers of my own over her hornsthat certain events that i desire may come to pass goodbye mr belton you may be as ungracious as you please but it will not make any difference  when clara and her cousin left the cottage they did not return to the house immediately but took a last walk round the park and through the shrubbery and up to the rocks on which a remarkable scene had once taken place between them few words were spoken as they were walking and there had been no agreement as to the path they would take each seemed to understand that there was much of melancholy in their present mood and that silence was more fitting than speech but when they reached the rocks belton sat himself down asking claras leave to stop there for a moment i dont suppose i shall ever come to this place again said he  you are as bad as mrs askerton said clara  i do not think i shall ever come to this place again said he repeating his words very solemnly at any rate i will never do so willingly unless  unless what  unless you are either my wife or have promised to become so  oh will you know that that is impossible  then it is impossible that i should come here again  you know that i am engaged to another man  of course i do i am not asking you to break your engagement i am simply telling you that in spite of that engagement i love you as well as i did love you before you had made it i have a right to let you know the truth as if she had not known it without his telling it to her now it was here that i told you that i loved you i now repeat it here and will never come here again unless i may say the same thing over and over and over that is all we might as well go on now but when he got up she sat down as though unwilling to leave the spot it was still winter and the rock was damp with cold drippings from the trees and the moss around was wet and little pools of water had formed themselves in the shallow holes upon the surface she did not speak as she seated herself but he was of course obliged to wait till she should be ready to accompany him it is too cold for you to sit there he said come clara i will not have you loiter here it is cold and wet  it is not colder for me than for you  you are not used to that sort of thing as i am  will she said you must never speak to me again as you spoke just now promise me that you will not  promises will do no good in such a matter  it is almost a repetition of what you did beforethough of course it is not so bad as that  everything i do is bad  no willdear will almost everything you do is good but of what use can it be to either of us for you to be thinking of that which can never be cannot you think of me as your sisterand only as your sister  no i cannot  then it is not right that we should be together  i know nothing of right you ask me a question and i suppose you dont wish that i should tell you a lie  of course i do not wish that  therefore i tell you the truth i love youas any other man loves the girl that he does love and as far as i know myself now i never can be happy unless you are my own  oh will how can that be when i am engaged to marry another man  as to your engagement i should care nothing does he love you as i love you if he loves you why is he not here if he loves you why does he let his mother illuse you and treat you with scorn if he loves you as i love you how could he write to you as he does write would i write to you such a letter as that would i let you be here without coming to youto be looked after by any one else if you had said that you would be my wife would i leave you in solitude and sorrow and then send you seventyfive pounds to console you if you think he loves you clara  he thought he was doing right when he sent me the money  but he shouldnt have thought it right never mind i dont want to accuse him but this i knowand you know he does not love you as i love you  what can i say to answer you  say that you will wait till you have seen him say that i may have a hopea chance that if he is cold and hard andandand just what we know he is then i may have a chance  how can i say that when i am engaged to him cannot you understand that i am wrong to let you speak of him as you do  how else am i to speak of him tell me this do you love him  yesi do  i dont believe it  will  i dont believe it nothing on earth shall make me believe it it is impossibleimpossible  do you mean to insult me will  no i do not mean to insult you but i mean to tell you the truth i do not think you love that man as you ought to love the man whom you are going to marry i should tell you just the same thing if i were really your brother of course it isnt that i suppose you love any one elseme for instance im not such a fool as that but i dont think you love him and im quite sure he doesnt love you thats just what i believe and if i do believe it how am i to help telling you  youve no right to have such beliefs  how am i to help it wellnever mind i wont let you sit there any longer at any rate youll be able to understand now that i shall never come to this place any more clara as she got up to obey him felt that she also ought never to see it againunless indeedunless  they passed that evening together without any reference to the scene on the rock or any allusion to their own peculiar troubles clara though she would not admit to mrs askerton that she was going away from the place for ever was not the less aware that such might very probably be the case she had no longer any rights of ownership at belton castle and all that had taken place between her and her cousin tended to make her feel that under no circumstances could she again reside there nor was it probable that she would be able to make to mrs askerton the visit of which they had been talking if lady aylmer were wiseso clara thoughtthere would be no mention of mrs askerton at aylmer park and if so of course she would not outrage her future husband by proposing to go to a house of which she knew that he disapproved if lady aylmer were not wiseif she should take upon herself the task of rebuking clara for her friendshipthen in such circumstances as those clara believed that the visit to mrs askerton might be possible  but she determined that she would leave the home in which she had been born and had passed so many happy and so many unhappy days as though she were never to see it again all her packing had been done down to the last fragment of an old letter that was stuffed into her writingdesk but nevertheless she went about the house with a candle in her hand as though she were still looking that nothing had been omitted while she was in truth saying farewell in her heart to every corner which she knew so well when at last she came down to pour out for her desolate cousin his cup of tea she declared that everything was done you may go to work now will she said and do what you please with the old place my jurisdiction in it is over  not altogether said he he no longer spoke like a despairing lover indeed there was a smile round his mouth and his voice was cheery  yesaltogether i give over my sovereignty from this momentand a dirty dilapidated sovereignty it is  thats all very well to say  and also very well to do what best pleases me in going to aylmer castle just now is the power it gives me of doing at once that which otherwise i might have put off till the doing of it had become much more unpleasant mr belton there is the key of the cellarwhich i believe gentlemen always regard as the real sign of possession i dont advise you to trust much to the contents he took the key from her and without saying a word chucked it across the room on to an old sofa if you wont take it you had better at any rate have it tied up with the others she said  i dare say youll know where to find it when you want it he answered  i shall never want it  then its as well there as anywhere else  but you wont remember will  i dont suppose i shall have occasion for remembering then he paused a moment before he went on i have told you before that i do not intend to take possession of the place i do not regard it as mine at all  and whose is it then  yours  no dear will it is not mine you know that  i intend that it shall be so and therefore you might as well put the keys where you will know how to find them  after he had gone she did take up the key and tied it with sundry others which she intended to give to the old servant who was to be left in charge of the house but after a few moments consideration she took the cellar key again off the bunch and put it back upon the sofain the place to which he had thrown it  on the following morning they started on their journey the old fly from redicote was not used on this occasion as belton had ordered a pair of posthorses and a comfortable carriage from taunton i think it such a shame said clara going away for the last time without having jerry and the grey horse jerry was the man who had once driven her to taunton when the old horse fell with her on the road but jerry and the grey horse could not have taken you and me too and all our luggage said will poor jerry i suppose not said clara but still there is an injury done in going without him  there were four or five old dependents of the family standing round the door to bid her adieu to all of whom she gave her hand with a cordial pressure they at least seemed to regard her departure as final and of course it was final she had assured herself of that during the night and just as they were about to start both colonel and mrs askerton walked up to the door he wouldnt let you go without bidding you farewell said mrs askerton i am so glad to shake hands with him clara answered then the colonel spoke a word to her and as he did so his wife contrived to draw will belton for a moment behind the carriage never give it up mr belton said she eagerly if you persevere shell be yours yet i fear not he said stick to her like a man said she pressing his hand in her vehemence if you do youll live to thank me for having told you so will had not a word to say for himself but he thought that he would stick to her indeed he thought that he had stuck to her pretty well  at last they were off and the village of belton was behind them will glancing into his cousins face saw that her eyes were laden with tears and refrained from speaking as they passed the ugly redbrick rectoryhouse clara for a moment put her face to the window and then withdrew it there is nobody there she said who will care to see me considering that i have lived here all my life is it not odd that there should be so few to bid me goodbye  people do not like to put themselves forward on such occasions said will  peoplethere are no people no one ever had so few to care for them as i have and now but never mind i mean to do very well and i shall do very well belton would not take advantage of her in her sadness and they reached the station at taunton almost without another word  of course they had to wait there for half an hour and of course the waiting was very tedious to will it was very tedious indeed as he was not by nature good at waiting to clara who on this occasion sat perfectly still in the waitingroom with her toes on the fender before the fire the evil of the occasion was not so severe the man would take two hours for the journey though i told him an hour and a half would be enough said will querulously  but we might have had an accident  an accident what accident people dont have accidents every day  at last the train came and they started clara though she had with her her best friendi may almost say the friend whom in the world she loved the bestdid not have an agreeable journey belton would not talk but as he made no attempt at reading clara did not like to have recourse to the book which she had in her travellingbag he sat opposite to her opening the window and shutting it as he thought she might like it but looking wretched and forlorn at swindon he brightened up for a moment under the excitement of getting her something to eat but that relaxation lasted only for a few minutes after that he relapsed again into silence till the train had passed slough and he knew that in another halfhour they would be in london then he leant over her and spoke  this will probably be the last opportunity i shall have of saying a few words to youalone  i dont know that at all will  it will be the last for a long time at any rate and as i have got something to say i might as well say it now i have thought a great deal about the propertythe belton estate i mean and i dont intend to take it as mine  that is sheer nonsense will you must take it as it is yours and cant belong to any one else  i have thought it over and i am quite sure that all the business of the entail was wrongradically wrong from first to last you are to understand that my special regard for you has nothing whatever to do with it i should do the same thing if i felt that i hated you  dont hate me will  you know what i mean i think the entail was all wrong and i shant take advantage of it its not common sense that i should have everything because of poor charleys misfortune  but it seems to me that it does not depend upon you or upon me or upon anybody it is yoursby law you know  and therefore it wont be sufficient for me to give it up without making it yours by law alsowhich i intend to do i shall stay in town tomorrow and give instructions to mr green i have thought it proper to tell you this now in order that you may mention it to captain aylmer  they were leaning over in the carriage one towards the other her face had been slightly turned away from him but now she slowly raised her eyes till they met his and looking into the depth of them and seeing there all his love and all his suffering and the great nobility of his nature her heart melted within her gradually as her tears camewould come in spite of all her constraint she again turned her face towards the window i cant talk now she said indeed i cant  there is no need for any more talking about it he replied and there was no more talking between them on that subject or on any other till the tickets had been taken and the train was again in motion then he referred to it again for a moment you will tell captain aylmer my dear  i will tell him what you say that he may know your generosity but of course he will agree with me that no such offer can be accepted it is quitequitequiteout of the question  you had better tell him and say nothing more or you can ask him to see mr greenafter tomorrow he as a man who understands business will know that this arrangement must be made if i choose to make it come here we are porter a fourwheeled cab do you go with him and ill look after the luggage  clara as she got into the cab felt that she ought to have been more stout in her resistance to his offer but it would be better perhaps that she should write to him from aylmer park and get frederic to write also     chapter xxiv  the great northern railway hotel   at the door of the hotel of the great northern railway station they met captain aylmer rooms had been taken there because they were to start by an early train on that line in the morning and captain aylmer had undertaken to order dinner there was nothing particular in the meeting to make it unpleasant to our friend will the fortunate rival could do no more in the hall of the inn than give his hand to his affianced bride as he might do to any other lady and then suggest to her that she should go upstairs and see her room when he had done this he also offered his hand to belton and will though he would almost sooner have cut off his own was obliged to take it in a few minutes the two men were standing alone together in the sittingroom  i suppose you found it cold coming up said the captain  not particularly said will  its rather a long journey from belton  not very long said will  not for you perhaps but miss amedroz must be tired  belton was angry at having his cousin called miss amedrozfeeling that the reserve of the name was intended to keep him at a distance but he would have been equally angry had aylmer called her clara  my cousin said will stoutly is able to bear slight fatigue of that kind without suffering  i didnt suppose she suffered but journeys are always tedious especially where there is so much road work i believe you are twenty miles from the station  belton castle is something over twenty miles from taunton  we are seven from our station at aylmer park and we think that a great deal  im more than that at plaistow said will  oh indeed plaistow is in norfolk i believe  yesplaistow is in norfolk  i suppose youll leave it now and go into somersetshire suggested captain aylmer  certainly not why should i leave it  i thought perhapsas belton castle is now your own  plaistow hall is more my own than belton castle if that signifies anythingwhich it doesnt this he said in an angry tone which as he became conscious of it he tried to rectify ive a deal of stock and all that sort of thing at plaistow and couldnt very well leave it even if i wished it he said  youve pretty good shooting too i suppose said aylmer  as far as partridges go ill back it against most properties of the same extent in any county  im too busy a man myself said the captain to do much at partridges we think more of pheasants down with us  i dare say  but a norfolk man like you is of course keen about birds  we are obliged to put up with what weve got you knownot but what i believe there is a better general head of game in norfolk than in any other county in england  thats what makes your hunting rather poor  our hunting poor why do you say its poor  so many of you are against preserving foxes  ill tell you what captain aylmer i dont know what pack you hunt with but ill bet you a fivepound note that we killed more foxes last year than you didthat is taking three days a week nineandtwenty brace and a half in a short season i dont call poor at all  captain aylmer saw that the man was waxing angry and made no further allusion either to the glories or deficiencies of norfolk as he could think of no other subject on which to speak at the spur of the moment he sat himself down and took up a paper belton took up another and so they remained till clara made her appearance that captain aylmer read his paper is probable enough he was not a man easily disconcerted and there was nothing in his present position to disconcert him but i feel sure that will belton did not read a word he was angry with this rival whom he hated and was angry with himself for showing his anger he would have wished to appear to the best advantage before this man or rather before clara in this mans presence and he knew that in claras absence he was making such a fool of himself that he would be unable to recover his prestige he had serious thoughts within his own breast whether it would not be as well for him to get up from his seat and give captain aylmer a thoroughly good thrashingdrop into him and punch his head as he himself would have expressed it for the moment such an exercise would give him immense gratification the final results would no doubt be disastrous but then all future results as far as he could see them were laden with disaster he was still thinking of this eyeing the man from under the newspaper and telling himself that the feat would probably be too easy to afford much enjoyment when clara reentered the room then he got up acting on the spur of the momentgot up quickly and suddenly and began to bid her adieu  but you are going to dine here will she said  no i think not  you promised you would you told me you had nothing to do tonight then she turned to captain aylmer you expect my cousin to dine with us today  i ordered dinner for three said captain aylmer  oh very well its all the same thing to me said will  and to me said captain aylmer  its not at all the same thing to me said clara i dont know when i may see my cousin again i should think it very bad of you will if you went away this evening  ill go out just for half an hour said he and be back to dinner  we dine at seven said the captain then belton took his hat and left the two lovers together  your cousin seems to be a rather surly sort of gentleman those were the first words which captain aylmer spoke when he was alone with the lady of his love nor was he demonstrative of his affection by any of the usual signs of regard which are permitted to accepted lovers he did not offer to kiss her nor did he attempt to take her hand with a warmer pressure now that he was alone with her he probably might have gone through some such ceremony had he first met clara in a position propitious to such purposes but as it was he had been a little ruffled by will beltons want of good breeding and had probably forgotten that any such privileges might have been his i wonder whether any remembrance flashed across claras mind at this moment of her cousin wills great iniquity in the sittingroom at belton castle she thought of it very often and may possibly have thought of it now  i dont believe that he is surly frederic she said he may perhaps be out of humour  and why should he be out of humour with me i only suggested to him that it might suit him to live at belton instead of at that farm of his down in norfolk  he is very fond of plaistow i fancy  but thats no reason why he should be cross with me i dont envy him his taste thats all if he cant understand that he with his name ought to live on the family property which belongs to him it isnt likely that anything that i can say will open his eyes upon the subject  the truth is frederic he has some romantic notion about the belton estate  what romantic notion  he thinks it should not be his at all  whose then who does he think should have it  of course there can be nothing in it you know of course its all nonsense  but what is his idea who does he think should be the owner  he meansthat it should bemine but of course frederic it is all nonsense we know that  it did not seem to be quite clear at the moment that frederic had altogether made up his mind upon the subject as he heard these tidings from clara there came across his face a puzzled dubious look as though he did not quite understand the proposition which had been suggested to himas though some consideration were wanted before he could take the idea home to himself and digest it so as to enable himself to express an opinion upon it there might be something in itsome show of reason which did not make itself clear to claras feminine mind i have never known what was the precise nature of your fathers marriage settlement said he  then clara began to explain with exceeding eagerness that there was no question as to the accuracy of the settlement or the legality of the entailthat indeed there was no question as to anything her cousin will was romantic and that was the end of it of coursequite as a matter of course this romance would lead to nothing and she had only mentioned the subject now to show that her cousins mind might possibly be disturbed when the question of his future residence was raised i quite feel with you she said that it will be much nicer that he should live at the old family place but just at present i do not speak about it  if he is thinking of not claiming belton it is quite another thing said aylmer  it is his without any claiming said clara  ah well it will all be settled before long said aylmer  it is settled already said clara  at seven the three met again and when the dinner was on the table there was some little trouble as to the helping of the fish which of the two men should take the lead on the occasion but clara decided the question by asking her cousin to make himself useful there can be little doubt but that captain aylmer would have distributed the mutton chops with much more grace and have carved the roast fowl with much more skill but it suited clara that will should have the employment and will did the work captain aylmer throughout the dinner endeavoured to be complaisant and clara exerted herself to talk as though all matters around them were easy will too made his effort every now and then speaking a word and restraining himself from snapping at his rival but the restraint was in itself evident and there were symptoms throughout the dinner that the untamed man was longing to fly at the throat of the man that was tamed  is it supposed that i ought to go away for a little while said clara as soon as she had drank her own glass of wine  oh dear no said the captain well have a cup of coffeethat is if mr belton likes it  its all the same to me said will  but wont you have some more wine clara asked  no more for me said captain aylmer perhaps mr belton  who i no i dont want any more wine said will and then they were all silent  it was very hard upon clara after a while the coffee came and even that was felt to be a comfort though there was no pouring out to be done no actual employment enacted still the manoeuvring of the cups created a diversion if either of you like to smoke she said i shant mind it in the least but neither of them would smoke at what hour shall we get to aylmer park tomorrow clara asked  at halfpast four said the captain  oh indeedso early as that what was she to say next will who had not touched his coffee and who was sitting stiffly at the table as though he were bound in duty not to move was becoming more and more grim every moment she almost repented that she had asked him to remain with them certainly there was no comfort in his company either to them or to himself how long shall you remain in town will before you go down to plaistow she asked  one day he replied  give my kind lovemy very kindest love to mary i wish i knew her i wish i could think that i might soon know her  youll never know her said belton the tone of his voice was actually savage as he spokeso much so that aylmer turned in his chair to look at him and clara did not dare to answer him but now that he had been made to speak it seemed that he was determined to persevere how should you ever know her nothing will ever bring you into norfolk and nothing will ever take her out of it  i dont quite see why either of those assertions should be made  nevertheless theyre both true had you ever meant to come to norfolk you would have come now he had not even asked her to come having arranged with his sister that in their existing circumstances any such asking would not be a kindness and yet he rebuked her now for not coming  my mother is very anxious that miss amedroz should pay her a visit at aylmer park said the captain  and shes going to aylmer park so your mothers anxiety need not disturb her any longer  come will dont be out of temper with us said clara it is our last night together we who are so dear to each other ought not to quarrel  im not quarrelling with you said he  i can hardly suppose that mr belton wants to quarrel with me said captain aylmer smiling  im sure he does not said clara belton sat silent with his eyes fixed upon the table and with a dark frown upon his brow he did long to quarrel with captain aylmer but was still anxious if it might be possible to save himself from what he knew would be a transgression  to use a phrase common with us down in yorkshire said aylmer i should say that mr belton had got out of bed the wrong side this morning  what the d does it matter to you sir what side i got out of bed said will clenching both his fists ohif he might only have been allowed to have a round of five minutes with aylmer he would have been restored to good temper for that night let the subsequent results have been what they might he moved his feet impatiently on the floor as though he were longing to kick something and then he pushed his coffeecup away from him upsetting half the contents upon the table and knocking down a wineglass which was broken  willwill said clara looking at him with imploring eyes  then he shouldnt talk to me about getting out of bed on the wrong side i didnt say anything to him  it is unkind of you will to quarrel with captain aylmer because he is my friend  i dont want to quarrel with him or rather as i wont quarrel with him because you dont wish it ill go away i cant do more than that i didnt want to dine with him here theres my cousin clara captain aylmer i love her better than all the world besides love her it seems to me that theres nothing else in the world for me to love id give my heart for her this minute all that i have in the world is hers ohlove her i dont believe that its in you to know what i mean when i say that i love her she tells me that shes going to be your wife you cant suppose that i can be very comfortable under those circumstancesor that i can be very fond of you im not very fond of you now ill go away and then i shant trouble you any more but look hereif ever you should illtreat her whether you marry her or whether you dont ill crush every bone in your skin having so spoken he went to the door but stopped himself before he left the room goodbye clara ive got a word or two more to say to you but ill write you a line downstairs you can show it to him if you please itll only be about business goodnight  she had got up and followed him to the door and he had taken her by the hand you shouldnt let your passion get the better of you in this way she said but the tone of her voice was very soft and her eyes were full of love  i suppose not said he  i can forgive him said captain aylmer  d your forgiveness said will belton then clara dropped the hand and started back and the door was shut and will belton was gone  your cousin seems to be a nice sort of young man said aylmer  cannot you understand it all frederic and pardon him  i can pardon him easily enough but one doesnt like men who are given to threatening hes not the sort of man that i took him to be  upon my word i think hes as nearly perfect as a man can be  then you like men to swear at you and to swagger like bobadils and to misbehave themselves so that one has to blush for them if a servant chances to hear them do you really think that he has conducted himself today like a gentleman  i know that he is a gentleman said clara  i must confess i have no reason for supposing him to be so but your assurance  and i hope that is sufficient frederic  captain aylmer did not answer her at once but sat for awhile silent considering what he would say clara who understood his moods knew that he did not mean to drop the subject and resolved that she would defend her cousin let captain aylmer attack him as he would  upon my word i hardly know what to say about it said aylmer  suppose then that we say nothing more will not that be best  no clara i cannot now let the matter pass by in that way you have asked me whether i do not think mr belton to be a gentleman and i must say that i doubt it pray hear me out before you answer me i do not want to be harder upon him than i can help and i would have borne and i did bear from him a great deal in silence but he said that to me which i cannot allow to pass without notice he had the bad taste to speak to me of hishis regard for you  i cannot see what harm he did by thatexcept to himself  i believe that it is understood among gentlemen that one man never speaks to another man about the lady the other man means to marry unless they are very intimate friends indeed what i mean is that if mr belton had understood how gentlemen live together he would never have said anything to me about his affection for you he should at any rate have supposed me to be ignorant of it there is something in the very idea of his doing so that is in the highest degree indelicate i wonder clara that you do not see this yourself  i think he was indiscreet  indiscreet indiscreet is not the word for such conduct i must say that as far as my opinion goes it was ungentlemanlike  i dont believe that there is a noblerminded gentleman in all london than my cousin will  perhaps it gratified you to hear from him the assurance of his love said captain aylmer  if it is your wish to insult me frederic i will leave you  it is my wish to make you understand that your judgment has been wrong  that is simply a matter of opinion and as i do not wish to argue with you about it i had better go at any rate i am very tired goodnight frederic he then told her what arrangements he had made for the morrow at what hour she would be called and when she would have her breakfast after that he let her go without making any further allusion to will belton  it must be admitted that the meeting between the lovers had not been auspicious and it must be acknowledged also that will belton had behaved very badly i am not aware of the existence of that special understanding among gentlemen in respect to the ladies they are going to marry which captain aylmer so eloquently described but nevertheless i must confess that belton would have done better had he kept his feelings to himself and when he talked of crushing his rivals bones he laid himself justly open to severe censure but for all that he was no bobadil he was angry sore and miserable and in his anger soreness and misery he had allowed himself to be carried away he felt very keenly his own folly even as he was leaving the room and as he made his way out of the hotel he hated himself for his own braggadocio i wish some one would crush my bones he said to himself almost audibly no one ever deserved to be crushed better than i do  clara when she got to her own room was very serious and very sad what was to be the end of it all this had been her first meeting after her fathers death with the man whom she had promised to marry indeed it was the first meeting after her promise had been given and they had only met to quarrel there had been no word of love spoken between them she had parted from him now almost in anger without the slightest expression of confidence between themalmost as those part who are constrained by circumstances to be together but who yet hate each other and know that they hate each other was there in truth any love between him and her and if there was none could there be any advantage any good either to him or to her in this journey of hers to aylmer park would it not be better that she should send for him and tell him that they were not suited for each other and that thus she should escape from all the terrors of lady aylmer as she thought of this she could not but think of will belton also not a gentleman if will belton was not a gentleman she desired to know nothing further of gentlemen women are so good and kind that those whom they love they love almost the more when they commit offences because of the offences so committed will belton had been guilty of great offencesof offences for which clara was prepared to lecture him in the gravest manner should opportunities for such lectures ever comebut i think that they had increased her regard for him rather than diminished it she could not however make up her mind to send for captain aylmer and when she went to bed she had resolved that the visit to yorkshire must be made  before she left the room the following morning a letter was brought to her from her cousin which had been written that morning she asked the maid to inquire for him and sent down word to him that if he were in the house she specially wished to see him but the tidings came from the hall porter that he had gone out very early and had expressly said that he should not breakfast at the inn  the letter was as follows      dear clara     i meant to have handed to you the enclosed in person but    i lost my temper last nightlike a fool as i amand so    i couldnt do it you need not have any scruple about the    money which i send£100 in ten tenpound notesas it    is your own there is the rent due up to your fathers    death which is more than what i now enclose and there    will be a great many other items as to all of which you    shall have a proper account when you want more you had    better draw on me till things are settled it shall all    be done as soon as possible it would not be comfortable    for you to go away without money of your own and i    suppose you would not wish that he should pay for your    journeys and things before you are married     of course i made a fool of myself yesterday i believe    that i usually do it is not any good my begging your    pardon for i dont suppose i shall ever trouble you any    more goodbye and god bless you     your affectionate cousin     william belton     it was a bad day for me when i made up my mind to go to    belton castle last summer   clara when she had read the letter sat down and cried holding the bundle of notes in her hand what would she do with them should she send them back oh noshe would do nothing to displease him or to make him think that she was angry with him besides she had none of that dislike to taking his money which she had felt as to receiving money from captain aylmer he had said that she would be his sister and she would take from him any assistance that a sister might properly take from a brother  she went downstairs and met captain aylmer in the sittingroom he stepped up to her as soon as the door was closed and she could at once see that he had determined to forget the unpleasantnesses of the previous evening he stepped up to her and gracefully taking her by one hand and passing the other behind her waist saluted her in a becoming and appropriate manner she did not like it she especially disliked it believing in her heart of hearts that she would never become the wife of this man whom she had professed to loveand whom she really had once loved but she could only bear it and to say the truth there was not much suffering of that kind to be borne  their journey down to yorkshire was very prosperous he maintained his good humour throughout the day and never once said a word about will belton nor did he say a word about mrs askerton do your best to please my mother clara he said as they were driving up from the park lodges to the house this was fair enough and she therefore promised him that she would do her best     chapter xxv  miss amedroz has some hashed chicken   clara felt herself to be a coward as the aylmer park carriage which had been sent to meet her at the station was drawn up at sir anthony aylmers door she had made up her mind that she would not bow down to lady aylmer and yet she was afraid of the woman as she got out of the carriage she looked up expecting to see her in the hall but lady aylmer was too accurately acquainted with the weights and measures of society for any such movement as that had her son brought lady emily to the house as his future bride lady aylmer would probably have been in the hall when the arrival took place and had clara possessed ten thousand pounds of her own she would probably have been met at the drawingroom door but as she had neither money nor titleas she in fact brought with her no advantages of any sort lady aylmer was found stitching a bit of worsted as though she had expected no one to come to her and belinda aylmer was stitching alsoby special order from her mother the reader will remember that lady aylmer was not without strong hope that the engagement might even yet be broken off snubbing she thought might probably be efficacious to this purpose and so clara was to be snubbed  clara who had just promised to do her best to gain lady aylmers opinion and who desired to be in some way true to her promise though she thoroughly believed that her labour would be in vain put on her pleasantest smile as she entered the room belinda under the pressure of the circumstances forgetting somewhat of her mothers injunctions hurried to the door to welcome the stranger lady aylmer kept her chair and even maintained her stitch till clara was half across the room then she got up and with great mastery over her voice made her little speech  we are delighted to see you miss amedroz she said putting out her handof which clara however felt no more than the finger  quite delighted said belinda yielding a fuller grasp then there were affectionate greetings between frederic and his mother and frederic and his sister during which clara stood by ill at ease captain aylmer said not a word as to the footing on which his future wife had come to his fathers house he did not ask his mother to receive her as another daughter or his sister to take his clara to her heart as a sister there had been no word spoken of recognised intimacy clara knew that the aylmers were cold people she had learned as much as that from captain aylmers words to herself and from his own manner but she had not expected to be so frozen by them as was the case with her now in ten minutes she was sitting down with her bonnet still on and lady aylmer was again at her stitches  shall i show you your room said belinda  wait a moment my dear said lady aylmer frederic has gone to see if sir anthony is in his study  sir anthony was found in his study and now made his appearance  so this is clara amedroz he said my dear you are welcome to aylmer park this was so much better that the kindness expressedthough there was nothing special in itbrought a tear into claras eye and almost made her love sir anthony  by the by sir anthony have you seen darvel darvel was wanting to see you especially about nuggins nuggins says that hell take the bullocks now this was said by lady aylmer and was skilfully arranged by her to put a stop to anything like enthusiasm on the part of sir anthony clara amedroz had been invited to aylmer park and was to be entertained there but it would not be expedient that she should be made to think that anybody was particularly glad to see her or that the family was at all proud of the proposed connection within five minutes after this she was up in her room and had received from belinda tenders of assistance as to her ladys maid both the mother and daughter had been anxious to learn whether clara would bring her own maid lady aylmer thinking that she would do so had already blamed her for extravagance of course fred will have to pay for the journey and all the rest of it she had said but as soon as she had perceived that clara had come without a servant she had perceived that any young woman who travelled in that way must be unfit to be mated with her son clara whose intelligence in such matters was sharp enough assured belinda that she wanted no assistance i dare say you think it very odd she said but i really can dress myself and when the maid did come to unpack the things clara would have sent her away at once had she been able but the maid who was not a young woman was obdurate oh no miss my lady wouldnt be pleased if you please miss ill do it and so the things were unpacked  clara was told that they dined at halfpast seven and she remained alone in her room till dinnertime although it had not yet struck five when she had gone upstairs the maid had brought her a cup of tea and she seated herself at her fire turning over in her mind the different members of the household in which she found herself it would never do she told herself over and over again that it would never come to pass that that woman should be her motherinlaw or that that other woman should be her sister it was manifest to her that she was distasteful to them and she had not lost a moment in assuring herself that they were distasteful to her what purpose could it answer that she should strivenot to like them for no such strife was possiblebut to appear to like them the whole place and everything about it was antipathetic to her would it not be simply honest to captain aylmer that she should tell him so at once and go away then she remembered that frederic had not spoken to her a single word since she had been under his fathers roof what sort of welcome would have been accorded to her had she chosen to go down to plaistow hall  at halfpast seven she made her way by herself downstairs in this there was some difficulty as she remembered nothing of the rooms below and she could not at first find a servant but a man at last did come to her in the hall and by him she was shown into the drawingroom here she was alone for a few minutes as she looked about her she thought that no room she had ever seen had less of the comfort of habitation it was not here that she had met lady aylmer before dinner there had at any rate been in that other room work things and the look of life which life gives to a room but here there was no life the furniture was all in its place and everything was cold and grand and comfortless they were making company of her at aylmer park clara was intelligent in such matters and understood it all thoroughly  lady aylmer was the first person to come to her i hope my maid has been with you said sheto which clara muttered something intended for thanks youll find richards a very clever woman and quite a proper person  i dont at all doubt that  she has been here a good many years and has perhaps little ways of her ownbut she means to be obliging  i shall give her very little trouble lady aylmer i am used to dress myself i am afraid this was not exactly true as to claras past habits but she could dress herself and intended to do so in future and in this way justified the assertion to herself  you had better let richards come to you my dear while you are here said lady aylmer with a slight smile on her countenance which outraged clara more even than the words we like to see young ladies nicely dressed here to be told that she was to be nicely dressed because she was at aylmer park her whole heart was already up in rebellion do her best to please lady aylmer it would be utterly impossible to her to make any attempt whatever in that direction there was something in her ladyships eyea certain mixture of cunning and power and hardness in the slight smile that would gather round her mouth by which clara was revolted she already understood much of lady aylmer but in one thing she was mistaken she thought that she saw simply the natural woman but she did in truth see the woman specially armed with an intention of being disagreeable made up to give offence and prepared to create dislike and enmity at the present moment nothing further was said as captain aylmer entered the room and his mother immediately began to talk to him in whispers  the two first days of claras sojourn at aylmer park passed by without the occurrence of anything that was remarkable that which most surprised and annoyed her as regarded her own position was the coldness of all the people around her as connected with the actual fact of her engagement sir anthony was very courteous to her but had never as yet once alluded to the fact that she was to become one of his family as his daughterinlaw lady aylmer called her miss amedrozusing the name with a peculiar emphasis as though determined to show that miss amedroz was to be miss amedroz as far as any one at aylmer park was concernedand treated her almost as though her presence in the house was intrusive belinda was as cold as her mother in her mothers presence but when alone with clara would thaw a little she in her difficulty studiously avoided calling the newcomer by any name at all as to captain aylmer it was manifest to clara that he was suffering almost more than she suffered herself his position was so painful that she absolutely pitied him for the misery to which he was subjected by his own mother they still called each other frederic and clara and that was the only sign of special friendship which manifested itself between them and clara though she pitied him could not but learn to despise him she had hitherto given him credit at any rate for a will of his own she had believed him to be a man able to act in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience but now she perceived him to be so subject to his mother that he did not dare to call his heart his own what was to be the end of it all and if there could only be one end would it not be well that that end should be reached at once so that she might escape from her purgatory  but on the afternoon of the third day there seemed to have come a change over lady aylmer at lunch she was especially civilcivil to the extent of picking out herself for clara with her own fork the breast of a hashed fowl from a dish that was before her this she did with considerable carei may say with a show of care and then though she did not absolutely call clara by her christian name she did call her my dear clara saw it all and felt that the usual placidity of the afternoon would be broken by some special event at three oclock when the carriage as usual came to the door belinda was out of the way and clara was made to understand that she and lady aylmer were to be driven out without any other companion belinda is a little busy my dear so if you dont mind well go alone clara of course assented and got into the carriage with a conviction that now she would hear her fate she was rather inclined to think that lady aylmer was about to tell her that she had failed in obtaining the approbation of aylmer park and that she must be returned as goods of a description inferior to the order given if such were the case the breast of the chicken had no doubt been administered as consolation clara had endeavoured since she had been at aylmer park to investigate her own feelings in reference to captain aylmer but had failed and knew that she had failed she wished to think that she loved him as she could not endure the thought of having accepted a man whom she did not love and she told herself that he had done nothing to forfeit her love a woman who really loves will hardly allow that her love should be forfeited by any fault true love breeds forgiveness for all faults and after all of what fault had captain aylmer been guilty he had preached to her out of his mothers mouth that had been all she had first accepted him and then rejected him and then accepted him again and now she would fain be firm if firmness were only possible to her nevertheless if she were told that she was to be returned as inferior she would hold up her head under such disgrace as best she might and would not let the tidings break her heart  my dear said lady aylmer as soon as the trotting horses and rolling wheels made noise enough to prevent her words from reaching the servants on the box i want to say a few words to youand i think that this will be a good opportunity  a very good opportunity said clara  of course my dear you are aware that i have heard of something going on between you and my son frederic now that lady aylmer had taught herself to call clara my dear it seemed that she could hardly call her so often enough  of course i know that captain aylmer has told you of our engagement but for that i should not be here  i dont know how that might be said lady aylmer but at any rate my dear he has told me that since the day of my sisters death there has beenin point of fact a sort of engagement  i dont think captain aylmer has spoken of it in that way  in what way of course he has not said a word that was not nice and loverlike and all that sort of thing i believe he would have done anything in the world that his aunt had told him and as to his  lady aylmer said clara feeling that her voice was almost trembling with anger i am sure you cannot intend to be unkind to me  certainly not  or to insult me  insult you my dear you should not use such strong words my dear indeed you should not nothing of the kind is near my thoughts  if you disapprove of my marrying your son tell me so at once and i shall know what to do  it depends my dearit depends on circumstances and that is just why i want to speak to you  then tell me the circumstancesthough indeed i think it would have been better if they could have been told to me by captain aylmer himself  there my dear you must allow me to judge as a mother of course i am anxious for my son now frederic is a poor man considering the kind of society in which he has to live and the position which he must maintain as a member of parliament he is a very poor man  this was an argument which clara certainly had not expected that any of the aylmer family would condescend to use she had always regarded captain aylmer as a rich man since he had inherited mrs winterfields property knowing that previously to that he had been able to live in london as rich men usually do live is he said she it may seem odd to you lady aylmer but i do not think that a word has ever passed between me and your son as to the amount of his income  not odd at all my dear young ladies are always thoughtless about those things and when they are looking to be married think that money will come out of the skies  if you mean that i have been looking to be married  wellexpecting i suppose you have been expecting it then she paused but as clara said nothing she went on of course frederic has got my sisters moiety of the perivale propertyabout eight hundred a year or something of that sort when all deductions are made he will have the other moiety when i die and if you and he can be satisfied to wait for that eventwhich may not perhaps be very long then there was another pause indicative of the melancholy natural to such a suggestion during which clara looked at lady aylmer and made up her mind that her ladyship would live for the next twentyfive years at least if you can wait for that she continued it may be all very well and though you will be poor people in frederics rank of life you will be able to live  that will be so far fortunate said clara  but youll have to wait said lady aylmer turning upon her companion almost fiercely that is you certainly will have to do so if you are to depend upon frederics income alone  i have nothing of my ownas he knows absolutely nothing  that does not seem to be quite so clear said lady aylmer speaking now very cautiouslyor rather with a purpose of great caution i dont think that that is quite so clear frederic has been telling me that there seems to be some sort of a doubt about the settlement of the belton estate  there is no sort of doubt whatsoeverno shadow of a doubt he is quite mistaken  dont be in such a hurry my dear it is not likely that you yourself should be a very good lawyer  lady aylmer i must be in a hurry lest there should be any mistake about this there is no question here for lawyers frederic must have been misled by a word or two which i said to him with quite another purpose everybody concerned knows that the belton estate goes to my cousin will my poor father was quite aware of it  that is all very well and pray remember my dear that you need not attack me in this way i am endeavouring if possible to arrange the accomplishment of your own wishes it seems that mr belton himself does not claim the property  there is no question of claiming because he is a man more generous than any other person in the worldromantically generous he has offered to give me the property which was my fathers for his lifetime but i do not suppose that you would wish or that captain aylmer would wish that i should accept such an offer as that there was a tone in her voice as she said this and a glance in her eye as she turned her face full upon her companion which almost prevailed against lady aylmers force of character  i really dont know my dear said lady aylmer you are so violent  i certainly am eager about this no consideration on earth would induce me to take my cousins property from him  it always seemed to me that that entail was a most unfair proceeding  what would it signify even if it werewhich it was not papa got certain advantages on those conditions but what can all that matter it belongs to will belton  then there was another pause and clara thought that that subject was over between them but lady aylmer had not as yet completed her purpose shall i tell you my dear what i think you ought to do  certainly lady aylmer if you wish it  i can at any rate tell you what it would become any young lady to do under such circumstances i suppose you will give me credit for knowing as much as that any young lady placed as you are would be recommended by her friendsif she had friends able and fit to give her adviceto put the whole matter into the hands of her natural friends and her lawyer together hear me out my dear if you please at least you can do that for me as i am taking a great deal of trouble on your behalf you should let frederic see mr green i understand that mr green was your fathers lawyer and then mr green can see mr belton and so the matter can be arranged it seems to me from what i hear that in this way and in this way only something can be done as to the proposed marriage in no other way can anything be done  then lady aylmer had finished her argument and throwing herself back into the carriage seemed to intimate that she desired no reply she had believed and did believe that her guest was so intent upon marrying her son that no struggle would be regarded as too great for the achievement of that object and such belief was natural on her part mothers always so think of girls engaged to their sons and so think especially when the girls are penniless and the sons are well to do in the world but such belief though it is natural is sometimes wrongand it was altogether wrong in this instance then said clara speaking very plainly nothing can be done  very well my dear  after that there was not a word said between them till the carriage was once more within the park then lady aylmer spoke again i presume you see my dear that under these circumstances any thought of marriage between you and my son must be quite out of the questionat any rate for a great many years  i will speak to captain aylmer about it lady aylmer  very well my dear so do of course he is his own master but he is my son as well and i cannot see him sacrificed without an effort to save him  when clara came down to dinner on that day she was again miss amedroz and she could perceivefrom belindas manner quite as plainly as from that of her ladyshipthat she was to have no more titbits of hashed chicken specially picked out for her by lady aylmers own fork that evening and the two next days passed just as had passed the two first days and everything was dull cold and uncomfortable twice she had walked out with frederic and on each occasion had thought that he would refer to what his mother had said but he did not venture to touch upon the subject clara more than once thought that she would do so herself but when the moments came she found that it was impossible she could not bring herself to say anything that should have the appearance of a desire on her part to hurry on a marriage she could not say to him if you are too poor to be marriedor even if you mean to put forward that pretence say so at once he still called her clara and still asked her to walk with him and still talked when they were alone together in a distant cold way of the events of their future combined life would they live at perivale would it be necessary to refurnish the house should he keep any of the land on his own hands these are all interesting subjects of discussion between an engaged man and the girl to whom he is engaged but the man if he wish to make them thoroughly pleasant to the lady should throw something of the urgency of a determined and immediate purpose into the discussion something should be said as to the actual destination of the rooms a day should be fixed for choosing the furnishing or the gentleman should declare that he will at once buy the cows for the farm but with frederic aylmer all discussions seemed to point to some cold distant future to which clara might look forward as she did to the joys of heaven will belton would have bought the ring long since and bespoken the priest and arranged every detail of the honeymoon tourand very probably would have stood looking into a cradle shop with longing eyes  at last there came an absolute necessity for some plain speaking captain aylmer declared his intention of returning to london that he might resume his parliamentary duties he had purposed to remain till after easter but it was found to be impossible i find i must go up tomorrow he said at breakfast they are going to make a stand about the poorrates and i must be in the house in the evening clara felt herself to be very cold and uncomfortable as things were at present arranged she was to be left at aylmer park without a friend and how long was she to remain there no definite ending had been proposed for her visit something must be said and something settled before captain aylmer went away  you will come down for easter of course said his mother  yes i shall come down for easter i thinkor at any rate at whitsuntide  you must come at easter frederic said his mother  i dont doubt but i shall said he  miss amedroz should lay her commands upon him said sir anthony gallantly  nonsense said lady aylmer  i have commands to lay upon him all the same said clara and if he will give me half an hour this morning he shall have them to this captain aylmer of course assentedas how could he escape from such assentand a regular appointment was made captain aylmer and miss amedroz were to be closeted together in the little back drawingroom immediately after breakfast clara would willingly have avoided any such formality could she have done so compatibly with the exigencies of the occasion she had been obliged to assert herself when lady aylmer had rebuked sir anthony and then lady aylmer had determined that an air of business should be assumed clara as she was marched off into the back drawingroom followed by her lover with more sheeplike gait even than her own felt strongly the absurdity and the wretchedness of her position but she was determined to go through with her purpose  i am very sorry that i have to leave you so soon said captain aylmer as soon as the door was shut and they were alone together  perhaps it may be better as it is frederic as in this way we shall all come to understand each other and something will be settled  well yes perhaps that will be best  your mother has told me that she disapproves of our marriage  no not that i think i dont think she can have quite said that  she says that you cannot marry while she is alivethat is that you cannot marry me because your income would not be sufficient  i certainly was speaking to her about my income  of course i have got nothing here she paused not a pennypiece in the world that i can call my own  oh yes you have  nothing nothing  you have your aunts legacy  no i have not she left me no legacy but as that is between you and me if we think of marrying each other that would make no difference  none at all of course  but in truth i have got nothing your mother said something to me about the belton estate as though there was some idea that possibly it might come to me  your cousin himself seemed to think so  frederic do not let us deceive ourselves there can be nothing of the kind i could not accept any portion of the property from my cousineven though our marriage were to depend upon it  of course it does not  but if your means are not sufficient for your wants i am quite ready to accept that reason as being sufficient for breaking our engagement  there need be nothing of the kind  as for waiting for the death of another personfor your mothers death i should think it very wrong of course if our engagement stands there need be no hurry butsome time should be fixed clara as she said this felt that her face and forehead were suffused with a blush but she was determined that it should be said and the words were pronounced  i quite think so too said he  i am glad that we agree of course i will leave it to you to fix the time  you do not mean at this very moment said captain aylmer almost aghast  no i did not mean that  ill tell you what ill make a point of coming down at easter i wasnt sure about it before but now i will be and then it shall be settled  such was the interview and on the next morning captain aylmer started for london clara felt aware that she had not done or said all that should have been done and said but nevertheless a step in the right direction had been taken     chapter xxvi  the aylmer park hashed chicken comes to an end   easter in this year fell about the middle of april and it still wanted three weeks of that time when captain aylmer started for london clara was quite alive to the fact that the next three weeks would not be a happy time for her she looked forward indeed to so much wretchedness during this period that the days as they came were not quite so bad as she had expected them to be at first lady aylmer said little or nothing to her it seemed to be agreed between them that there was to be war but that there was no necessity for any of the actual operations of war during the absence of captain aylmer clara had become miss amedroz again and though an offer to be driven out in the carriage was made to her every day she was in general able to escape the inflictionso that at last it came to be understood that miss amedroz did not like carriage exercise she has never been used to it said lady aylmer to her daughter i suppose not said belinda but if she wasnt so very cross shed enjoy it just for that reason clara sometimes walked about the grounds with belinda but on such occasions there was hardly anything that could be called conversation between them and frederic aylmers name was never mentioned  captain aylmer had not been gone many days before she received a letter from her cousin in which he spoke with absolute certainty of his intention of giving up the estate he had he said consulted mr green and the thing was to be done but it will be better i think he went on to say that i should manage it for you till after your marriage i simply mean what i say you are not to suppose that i shall interfere in any way afterwards of course there will be a settlement as to which i hope you will allow me to see mr green on your behalf in the first draught of his letter he had inserted a sentence in which he expressed a wish that the property should be so settled that it might at last all come to some one bearing the name of belton but as he read this over the conditionfor coming from him it would be a conditionseemed to him to be ungenerous and he expunged it what does it matter who has it he said to himself bitterly or what he is called i will never set my eyes upon his children nor yet upon the place when he has become the master of it clara wrote both to her cousin and to the lawyer repeating her assurancewith great violence as lady aylmer would have saidthat she would have nothing to do with the belton estate she told mr green that it would be useless for him to draw up any deeds it cant be made mine unless i choose to have it she said and i dont choose to have it then there came upon her a terrible fear what if she should marry captain aylmer after all and what if he when he should be her husband should take the property on her behalf something must be done before her marriage to prevent the possibility of such resultssomething as to the efficacy of which for such prevention she could feel altogether certain  but could she marry captain aylmer at all in her present mood during these three weeks she was unconsciously teaching herself to hope that she might be relieved from her engagement she did not love him she was becoming aware that she did not love him she was beginning to doubt whether in truth she had ever loved him but yet she felt that she could not escape from her engagement if he should show himself to be really actuated by any fixed purpose to carry it out nor could she bring herself to be so weak before lady aylmer as to seem to yield the necessity of not striking her colours was forced upon her by the warfare to which she was subjected she was unhappy feeling that her present position in life was bad and unworthy of her she could have brought herself almost to run away from aylmer park as a boy runs away from school were it not that she had no place to which to run she could not very well make her appearance at plaistow hall and say that she had come there for shelter and succour she could indeed go to mrs askertons cottage for awhile and the more she thought of the state of her affairs the more did she feel sure that that would before long be her destiny it must be her destinyunless captain aylmer should return at easter with purposes so firmly fixed that even his mother should not be able to prevail against them  and now in these days circumstances gave her a new friendor perhaps rather a new acquaintance where she certainly had looked neither for the one or for the other lady aylmer and belinda and the carriage and the horses used as i have said to go off without her this would take place soon after luncheon most of us know how the events of the day drag themselves on tediously in such a country house as aylmer parka country house in which people neither read nor flirt nor gamble nor smoke nor have resort to the excitement of any special amusement lunch was on the table at halfpast one and the carriage was at the door at three eating and drinking and the putting on of bonnets occupied the hour and a half from breakfast to lunch lady aylmer with her old front would occupy herself with her household accounts for some days after claras arrival she put on her new front before lunch but of latesince the long conversation in the carriagethe new front did not appear till she came down for the carriage according to the theory of her life she was never to be seen by any but her own family in her old front at breakfast she would appear with head so mysteriously envelopedwith such a bewilderment of morning caps that old front or new front was all the same when sir anthony perceived this changewhen he saw that clara was treated as though she belonged to aylmer park then he told himself that his sons marriage with miss amedroz was to be and as miss amedroz seemed to him to be a very pleasant young woman he would creep out of his own quarters when the carriage was gone and have a little chat with herbeing careful to creep away again before her ladyships return this was claras new friend  have you heard from fred since he has been gone the old man asked one day when he had come upon clara still seated in the parlour in which they had lunched he had been out at the front of the house scolding the undergardener but the man had taken away his barrow and left him and sir anthony had found himself without employment  only a line to say that he is to be here on the sixteenth  i dont think people write so many loveletters as they did when i was young said sir anthony  to judge from the novels i should think not the old novels used to be full of loveletters  fred was never good at writing i think  members of parliament have too much to do i suppose said clara  but he always writes when there is any business hes a capital man of business i wish i could say as much for his brotheror for myself  lady aylmer seems to like work of that sort  so she does shes fond of iti am not i sometimes think that fred takes after her where was it you first knew him  at perivale we used both of us to be staying with mrs winterfield  yes yes of course the most natural thing in life well my dear i can assure you that i am quite satisfied  thank you sir anthony im glad to hear you say even as much as that  of course money is very desirable for a man situated like fred but hell have enough and if he is pleased i am personally as regards yourself i am more than pleased i am indeed  its very good of you to say so  sir anthony looked at clara and his heart was softened towards her as he saw that there was a tear in her eye a mans heart must be very hard when it does not become softened by the trouble of a woman with whom he finds himself alone i dont know how you and lady aylmer get on together said he but it will not be my fault if we are not friends  i am afraid that lady aylmer does not like me said clara  indeed i was afraid there was something of that but you must remember she is hard to please youll find shell come round in time  she thinks that captain aylmer should not marry a woman without money  thats all very well but i dont see why fred shouldnt please himself hes old enough to know what he wants  is he sir anthony thats just the question im not quite sure that he does know what he wants  fred doesnt know do you mean  i dont quite think he does sir and the worst of it is i am in doubt as well as he  in doubt about marrying him  in doubt whether it will be good for him or for any of us i dont like to come into a family that does not desire to have me  you shouldnt think so much of lady aylmer as all that my dear  but i do think a great deal of her  i shall be very glad to have you as a daughterinlaw and as for lady aylmerbetween you and me my dear you shouldnt take every word she says so much to heart shes the best woman in the world and im sure im bound to say so but she has her temper you know and i dont think you ought to give way to her altogether theres the carriage it wont do you any good if were found together talking over it all will it then the baronet hobbled off and lady aylmer when she entered the room found clara sitting alone  whether it was that the wife was clever enough to extract from her husband something of the conversation that had passed between him and clara or whether she had some other source of informationor whether her conduct might proceed from other grounds we need not inquire but from that afternoon lady aylmers manner and words to clara became much less courteous than they had been before she would always speak as though some great iniquity was being committed and went about the house with a portentous frown as though some terrible measure must soon be taken with the object of putting an end to the present extremely improper state of things all this was so manifest to clara that she said to sir anthony one day that she could no longer bear the look of lady aylmers displeasureand that she would be forced to leave aylmer park before frederics return unless the evil were mitigated she had by this time told sir anthony that she much doubted whether the marriage would be possible and that she really believed that it would be best for all parties that the idea should be abandoned sir anthony when he heard this could only shake his head and hobble away the trouble was too deep for him to cure  but clara still held on and now there wanted but two days to captain aylmers return when all suddenly there arose a terrible storm at aylmer park and then came a direct and positive quarrel between lady aylmer and claraa quarrel direct and positive and on the part of both ladies very violent  nothing had hitherto been said at aylmer park about mrs askertonnothing that is since claras arrival and clara had been thankful for this silence the letter which captain aylmer had written to her about mrs askerton will perhaps be remembered and claras answer to that letter the aylmer park opinion as to this poor woman and as to claras future conduct towards the poor woman had been expressed very strongly and clara had as strongly resolved that she would not be guided by aylmer park opinions in that matter she had anticipated much that was disagreeable on this subject and had therefore congratulated herself not a little on the absence of all allusion to it but lady aylmer had in truth kept mrs askerton in reserve as a battery to be used against miss amedroz if all other modes of attack should failas a weapon which would be powerful when other weapons had been powerless for awhile she had thought it possible that clara might be the owner of the belton estate and then it had been worth the careful mothers while to be prepared to accept a daughterinlaw so dowered we have seen how the question of such ownership had enabled her to put forward the plea of poverty which she had used on her sons behalf but since that frederic had declared his intention of marrying the young woman in spite of his poverty and clara seemed to be equally determined he has been fool enough to speak the word and she is determined to keep him to it said lady aylmer to her daughter therefore the askerton battery was brought to bearnot altogether unsuccessfully  the three ladies were sitting together in the drawingroom and had been as mute as fishes for half an hour in these sittings they were generally very silent speaking only in short little sentences will you drive with us today miss amedroz not today i think lady aylmer as you are reading perhaps you wont mind our leaving you pray do not put yourself to inconvenience for me miss aylmer such and such like was their conversation but on a sudden after a full halfhours positive silence lady aylmer asked a question altogether of another kind i think miss amedroz my son wrote to you about a certain mrs askerton  clara put down her work and sat for a moment almost astonished it was not only that lady aylmer had asked so very disagreeable a question but that she had asked it with so peculiar a voicea voice as it were a command in a manner that was evidently intended to be taken as serious and with a look of authority in her eye as though she were resolved that this battery of hers should knock the enemy absolutely in the dust belinda gave a little spring in her chair looked intently at her work and went on stitching faster than before yes he did said clara finding that an answer was imperatively demanded from her  it was quite necessary that he should write i believe it to be an undoubted fact that mrs askerton isisisnot at all what she ought to be  which of us is what we ought to be said clara  miss amedroz on this subject i am not at all inclined to joke is it not true that mrs askerton  you must excuse me lady aylmer but what i know of mrs askerton i know altogether in confidence so that i cannot speak to you of her past life  but miss amedroz pray excuse me if i say that i must speak of it when i remember the position in which you do us the honour of being our visitor here how can i help speaking of it belinda was stitching very hard and would not even raise her eyes clara who still held her needle in her hand resumed her work and for a moment or two made no further answer but lady aylmer had by no means completed her task miss amedroz she said you must allow me to judge for myself in this matter the subject is one on which i feel myself obliged to speak to you  but i have got nothing to say about it  you have i believe admitted the truth of the allegations made by us as to this woman clara was becoming very angry a red spot showed itself on each cheek and a frown settled upon her brow she did not as yet know what she would say or how she would conduct herself she was striving to consider how best she might assert her own independence but she was fully determined that in this matter she would not bend an inch to lady aylmer i believe we may take that as admitted said her ladyship  i am not aware that i have admitted anything to you lady aylmer or said anything that can justify you in questioning me on the subject  justify me in questioning a young woman who tells me that she is to be my future daughterinlaw  i have not told you so i have never told you anything of the kind  then on what footing miss amedroz do you do us the honour of being with us here at aylmer park  on a very foolish footing  on a foolish footing what does that mean  it means that i have been foolish in coming to a house in which i am subjected to such questioning  belinda did you ever hear anything like this miss amedroz i must persevere however much you may dislike it the story of this womans lifewhether she be mrs askerton or not i dont know  she is mrs askerton said clara  as to that i do not profess to know and i dare say that you are no wiser than myself but what she has been we do know here lady aylmer raised her voice and continued to speak with all the eloquence which assumed indignation could give her what she has been we do know and i ask you as a duty which i owe to my son whether you have put an end to your acquaintance with so very disreputable a persona person whom even to have known is a disgrace  i know her and  stop one minute if you please my questions are thesehave you put an end to that acquaintance and are you ready to give a promise that it shall never be resumed  i have not put an end to that acquaintanceor rather that affectionate friendship as i should call it and i am ready to promise that it shall be maintained with all my heart  belinda do you hear her  yes mamma and belinda slowly shook her head which was now bowed lower than ever over her lap  and that is your resolution  yes lady aylmer that is my resolution  and you think that becoming to you as a young woman  just so i think that becoming to meas a young woman  then let me tell you miss amedroz that i differ from you altogetheraltogether lady aylmer as she repeated the last word raised her folded hands as though she were calling upon heaven to witness how thoroughly she differed from the young woman  i dont see how i am to help that lady aylmer i dare say we may differ on many subjects  i dare say we do i dare say we do and i need not point out to you how very little that would be a matter of regret to me but for the hold you have upon my unfortunate son  hold upon him lady aylmer how dare you insult me by such language hereupon belinda again jumped in her chair but lady aylmer looked as though she enjoyed the storm  you undoubtedly have a hold upon him miss amedroz and i think that it is a great misfortune of course when he hears what your conduct is with reference to thisperson he will release himself from his entanglement  he can release himself from his entanglement whenever he chooses said clara rising from her chair indeed he is released i shall let captain aylmer know that our engagement must be at an end unless he will promise that i shall never in future be subjected to the unwarrantable insolence of his mother then she walked off to the door not regarding and indeed not hearing the parting shot that was fired at her  and now what was to be done clara went up to her own room making herself strong and even comfortable with an inward assurance that nothing should ever induce her even to sit down to table again with lady aylmer she would not willingly enter the same room with lady aylmer or have any speech with her but what should she at once do she could not very well leave aylmer park without settling whither she would go nor could she in any way manage to leave the house on that afternoon she almost resolved that she would go to mrs askerton everything was of course over between her and captain aylmer and therefore there was no longer any hindrance to her doing so on that score but what would be her cousin wills wish he now was the only friend to whom she could trust for good council what would be his advice should she write and ask him noshe could not do that she could not bring herself to write to him telling him that the aylmer entanglement was at an end were she to do so he with his temperament would take such letter as meaning much more than it was intended to mean but she would write a letter to captain aylmer this she thought that she would do at once and she began it she got as far as my dear captain aylmer and then she found that the letter was one which could not be written very easily and she remembered as the greatness of the difficulty of writing the letter became plain to her that it could not now be sent so as to reach captain aylmer before he would leave london if written at all it must be addressed to him at aylmer park and the task might be done tomorrow as well as today so that task was given up for the present  but she did write a letter to mrs askertona letter which she would send or not on the morrow according to the state of her mind as it might then be in this she declared her purpose of leaving aylmer park on the day after captain aylmers arrival and asked to be taken in at the cottage an answer was to be sent to her addressed to the great northern railway hotel  richards the maid came up to her before dinner with offers of assistance for dressingoffers made in a tone which left no doubt on claras mind that richards knew all about the quarrel but clara declined to be dressed and sent down a message saying that she would remain in her room and begging to be supplied with tea she would not even condescend to say that she was troubled with a headache then belinda came up to her just before dinner was announced and with a fluttered gravity advised miss amedroz to come downstairs mamma thinks it will be much better that you should show yourself let the final result be what it may  but i have not the slightest desire to show myself  there are the servants you know  but miss aylmer i dont care a straw for the servantsreally not a straw  and papa will feel it so  i shall be sorry if sir anthony is annoyedbut i cannot help it it has not been my doing  and mamma says that my brother would of course wish it  after what your mother has done i dont see what his wishes would have to do with iteven if she knew themwhich i dont think she does  but if you will think of it im sure youll find it is the proper thing to do there is nothing to be avoided so much as an open quarrel that all the servants can see  i must say miss aylmer that i disregard the servants after what passed downstairs of course i have had to consider what i should do will you tell your mother that i will stay here if she will permit it  of course she will be delighted  i will remain if she will permit it till the morning after captain aylmers arrival then i shall go  where to miss amedroz  i have already written to a friend asking her to receive me  miss aylmer paused a moment before she asked her next questionbut she did ask it showing by her tone and manner that she had been driven to summon up all her courage to enable her to do so to what friend miss amedroz mamma will be glad to know  that is a question which lady aylmer can have no right to ask said clara  ohvery well of course if you dont like to tell theres no more to be said  i do not like to tell miss aylmer  clara had her tea in her room that evening and lived there the whole of the next day the family downstairs was not comfortable sir anthony could not be made to understand why his guest kept her roomwhich was not odd as lady aylmer was very sparing in the information she gave him and belinda found it to be impossible to sit at table or to say a few words to her father and mother without showing at every moment her consciousness that a crisis had occurred by the next days post the letter to mrs askerton was sent and at the appointed time captain aylmer arrived about an hour after he entered the house belinda went upstairs with a message from himwould miss amedroz see him miss amedroz would see him but made it a condition of doing so that she should not be required to meet lady aylmer she need not be afraid said lady aylmer unless she sends me a full apology with a promise that she will have no further intercourse whatever with that woman i will never willingly see her again a meeting was therefore arranged between captain aylmer and miss amedroz in a sittingroom upstairs  what is all this clara said captain aylmer at once  simply thisthat your mother has insulted me most wantonly  she says that it is you who have been uncourteous to her  be it soyou can of course believe whichever you please and it is desirable no doubt that you should prefer to believe your mother  but i do not wish there to be any quarrel  but there is a quarrel captain aylmer and i must leave your fathers house i cannot stay here after what has taken place your mother told mei cannot tell you what she told me but she made against me just those accusations which she knew it would be the hardest for me to bear  im sure you have mistaken her  no i have not mistaken her  and where do you propose to go  to mrs askerton  oh clara  i have written to mrs askerton to ask her to receive me for awhile indeed i may almost say that i had no other choice  if you go there clara there will be an end to everything  and there must be an end of what you call everything captain aylmer said she smiling it cannot be for your good to bring into your family a wife of whom your mother would think so badly as she thinks of me  there was a great deal said and captain aylmer walked very often up and down the room endeavouring to make some arrangement which might seem in some sort to appease his mother would clara only allow a telegram to be sent to mrs askerton to explain that she had changed her mind but clara would allow no such telegram to be sent and on that evening she packed up all her things captain aylmer saw her again and again sending belinda backwards and forwards and making different appointments up to midnight but it was all to no purpose and on the next morning she took her departure alone in the aylmer park carriage for the railway station captain aylmer had proposed to go with her but she had so stoutly declined his company that he was obliged to abandon his intention she saw neither of the ladies on that morning but sir anthony came out to say a word of farewell to her in the hall i am very sorry for all this said he it is a pity said clara but it cannot be helped goodbye sir anthony i hope we may meet again under pleasanter circumstances said the baronet to this clara made no reply and was then handed into the carriage by captain aylmer  i am so bewildered said he that i cannot now say anything definite but i shall write to you and probably follow you  do not follow me pray captain aylmer said she then she was driven to the station and as she passed through the lodges of the park entrance she took what she intended to be a final farewell of aylmer park     chapter xxvii  once more back to belton   when the carriage was driven away sir anthony and captain aylmer were left standing alone at the hall door of the house the servants had slunk off and the father and son looking at each other felt that they also must slink away or else have some words together on the subject of their guests departure the younger gentleman would have preferred that there should be no words but sir anthony was curious to know something of what had passed in the house during the last few days im afraid things are not going quite comfortable he said  it seems to me sir said his son that things very seldom do go quite comfortable  but fredwhat is it all about your mother says that miss amedroz is behaving very badly  and miss amedroz says that my mother is behaving very badly  of coursethats only natural and what do you say  i say nothing sir the less said the soonest mended  thats all very well but it seems to me that you in your position must say something the long and the short of it is this is she to be your wife  upon my word sir i dont know  they were still standing out under the portico and as sir anthony did not for a minute or two ask any further questions captain aylmer turned as though he were going into the house but his father had still a word or two to say stop a moment fred i dont often trouble you with advice  im sure im always glad to hear it when you offer any  i know very well that in most things your opinion is better than mine youve had advantages which i never had but ive had more experience than you my dear boy it stands to reason that in some things i must have had more experience than you there was a tone of melancholy in the fathers voice as he said this which quite touched his son and which brought the two closer together out in the porch take my word for it continued sir anthony that you are much better off as you are than you could be with a wife  do you mean to say that no man should marry  noi dont mean to say that an eldest son ought to marry so that the property may have an heir and poor men should marry i suppose as they want wives to do for them and sometimes no doubt a man must marrywhen he has got to be very fond of a girl and has compromised himself and all that kind of thing i would never advise any man to sully his honour as sir anthony said this he raised himself a little with his two sticks and spoke out in a bolder voice the voice however sank again as he descended from the realms of honour to those of prudence but none of these cases are yours fred to be sure youll have the perivale property but that is not a family estate and youll be much better off by turning it into money and in the way of comfort you can be a great deal more comfortable without a wife than you can with one what do you want a wife for and then as to miss amedrozfor myself i must say that i like her uncommonly she has been very pleasant in her ways with me butsomehow or another i dont think you are so much in love with her but what you can do without her hereupon he paused and looked his son full in the face fred had also been thinking of the matter in his own way and asking himself the same questionwhether he was in truth so much in love with clara that he could not live without her of course i dont know continued sir anthony what has taken place just now between you and her or what between her and your mother but i suppose the whole thing might fall through without any further trouble to youor without anything unhandsome on your part but captain aylmer still said nothing the whole thing might no doubt fall through but he wished to be neither unjust nor ungenerousand he specially wished to avoid anything unhandsome after a further pause of a few minutes sir anthony went on again pouring forth the words of experience of course marriage is all very well i married rather early in life and have always found your mother to be a most excellent woman a better woman doesnt breathe im as sure of that as i am of anything but god bless meof course you can see i cant call anything my own im tied down here and i cant move ive never got a shilling to spend while all these lazy hounds about the place are eating me up there isnt a clerk with a hundred a year in london that isnt better off than i am as regards ready money and what comfort have i in a big house and no end of gardens and a place like this what pleasures do i get out of it that comes of marrying and keeping up ones name in the county respectably what do i care for the county d the county i often wish that id been a younger sonas you are  captain aylmer had no answer to make to all this it was no doubt the fact that age and good living had made sir anthony altogether incapable of enjoying the kind of life which he desiderated and that he would probably have eaten and drunk himself into his grave long since had that kind of life been within his reach this however the son could not explain to the father but in fitting as he endeavoured to do his fathers words to his own case captain aylmer did perceive that a bachelors life might perhaps be the most suitable to his own peculiar case only he would do nothing unhandsome as to that he was quite resolved of course clara must show herself to be in some degree amenable to reason and to the ordinary rules of the world but he was aware that his mother was hottempered and he generously made up his mind that he would give miss amedroz even yet another chance  at the hotel in london clara found a short note from mrs askerton in which she was warmly assured that everything should be done to make her comfortable at the cottage as long as she should wish to stay there but the very warmth of affection thus expressed made her almost shrink from what she was about to do mrs askerton was no doubt anxious for her coming but would her cousin will belton approve of the visit and what would her cousin mary say about it if she was being driven into this step against her own approval by the insolence of lady aylmerif she was doing this thing simply because lady aylmer had desired her not to do it and was doing it in opposition to the wishes of the man she had promised to marry as well as to her own judgment there could not but be cause for shrinking and yet she believed that she was right if she could only have had some one to tell hersome one in whom she could trust implicitly to direct her she had hitherto been very much prone to rebel against authority against her aunt she had rebelled and against her father and against her lover but now she wished with all her heart that there might be some one to whom she could submit with perfect faith if she could only know what her cousin will would think in him she thought she could have trusted with that perfect faithif only he would have been a brother to her  but it was too late now for doubting and on the next day she found herself getting out of the old redicote fly at colonel askertons door he came out to meet her and his greeting was very friendly hitherto there had been no great intimacy between him and her owing rather to the manner of life adopted by him than to any cause of mutual dislike between them mrs askerton had shown herself desirous of some social intercourse since she had been at belton but with colonel askerton there had been nothing of this he had come there intending to live alone and had been satisfied to carry out his purpose but now clara had come to his house as a guest and he assumed towards her altogether a new manner we are so glad to have you he said taking both her hands then she passed on into the cottage and in a minute was in her friends arms  dear claradearest clara i am so glad to have you here  it is very good of you  no dear the goodness is with you to come but we wont quarrel about that we will both be ever so good and he is so happy that you should be here youll get to know him now but come upstairs theres a fire in your room and ill be your maid for the occasionbecause then we can talk clara did as she was bid and went upstairs and as she sat over the fire while her friend knelt beside herfor mrs askerton was given to such kneelingsshe could not but tell herself that belton cottage was much more comfortable than aylmer park during the whole time of her sojourn at aylmer park no word of real friendship had once greeted her ears everything there had been cold and formal till coldness and formality had given way to violent insolence  and so you have quarrelled with her ladyship said mrs askerton i knew you would  i have not said anything about quarrelling with her  but of course you have come now dont make yourself disagreeable you have had a downright battlehave you not  something very like it im afraid  i am so glad said mrs askerton rubbing her hands  that is illnatured  very well let it be illnatured one isnt to be goodnatured all round or what would be the use of it and what sort of woman is she  oh dear i couldnt describe her she is very large and wears a great wig and manages everything herself and ive no doubt shes a very good woman in her own way  i can see her at onceand a very pillar of virtue as regards morality and going to church poor me does she know that you have come here  i have no doubt she does i did not tell her nor would i tell her daughter but i told captain aylmer  that was right that was very right im so glad of that but who would doubt that you would show a proper spirit and what did he say  not much indeed  i wont trouble you about him i dont in the least doubt but all that will come right and what sort of man is sir anthony  a commonplace sort of a man very gouty and with none of his wifes strength i liked him the best of them all  because you saw the least of him i suppose  he was kind in his manner to me  and they were like shedragons i understand it all and can see them just as though i had been there i felt that i knew what would come of it when you first told me that you were going to aylmer park i did indeed i could have prophesied it all  what a pity you did not  it would have done no goodand your going there has done good it has opened your eyes to more than one thing i dont doubt but tell mehave you told them in norfolk that you were coming here  noi have not written to my cousin  dont be angry with me if i tell you something i have  have what  i have told mr belton that you were coming here it was in this way i had to write to him about our continuing in the cottage colonel askerton always makes me write if its possible and of course we were obliged to settle something as to the place  im sorry you said anything about me  how could i help it what would you have thought of me or what would he have thought if when writing to him i had not mentioned such a thing as your visit besides its much better that he should know  i am sorry that you said anything about it  you are ashamed that he should know that you are here said mrs askerton in a tone of reproach  ashamed no i am not ashamed but i would sooner that he had not been toldas yet of course he would have been told before long  but you are not angry with me  angry how can i be angry with any one who is so kind to me  that evening passed by very pleasantly and when she went again to her own room clara was almost surprised to find how completely she was at home on the next day she and mrs askerton together went up to the house and roamed through all the rooms and clara seated herself in all the accustomed chairs on the sofa just in the spot to which belton had thrown it she found the key of the cellar she took it up in her hand thinking that she would give it to the servant but again she put it back upon the sofa it was his key and he had left it there and if ever there came an occasion she would remind him where he had put it then they went out to the cow who was at her ease in a little home paddock  dear bessy said clara see how well she knows me but i think the tame little beast would have known any one else as well who had gone up to her as clara did with food in her hand she is quite as sacred as any cow that ever was worshipped among the cowworshippers said mrs askerton i suppose they milk her and sell the butter but otherwise she is not regarded as an ordinary cow at all poor bessy said clara i wish she had never come here what is to be done with her done with her shell stay here till she dies a natural death and then a romantic pair of mourners will follow her to her grave mixing their sympathetic tears comfortably as they talk of the old days and in future years bessy will grow to be a divinity of the past never to be mentioned without tenderest reminiscences i have not the slightest difficulty in prophesying as to bessys future life and posthumous honours they roamed about the place the whole morning through the garden and round the farm buildings and in and out of the house and at every turn something was said about will belton but clara would not go up to the rocks although mrs askerton more than once attempted to turn in that direction he had said that he never would go there again except under certain circumstances she knew that those circumstances would never come to pass but yet neither would she go there she would never go there till her cousin was married then if in those days she should ever be present at belton castle she would creep up to the spot all alone and allow herself to think of the old days  on the following morning there came to her a letter bearing the downham postmarkbut at the first glance she knew that it was not from her cousin will will wrote with a bold round hand that was extremely plain and caligraphic when he allowed himself time for the work in hand as he did with the commencement of his epistles but which would become confused and altogether anticaligraphic when he fell into a hurry towards the end of his performanceas was his wont but the address of this letter was written in a pretty small female handvery careful in the perfection of every letter and very neat in every stroke it was from mary belton between whom and clara there had never hitherto been occasion for correspondence the letter was as follows      plaistow hall april 186     my dear cousin clara     william has heard from your friends at belton who are    tenants on the estate and as to whom there seems to be    some question whether they are to remain he has written    saying i believe that there need be no difficulty if    they wish to stay there but we learn also from mrs    askertons letter that you are expected at the cottage    and therefore i will address this to belton supposing    that it may find you there     you and i have never yet known each otherwhich has    been a grief to me but this grief i hope may be cured    some day before long i myself as you know am such a    poor creature that i cannot go about the world to see my    friends as other people doat least not very well and    therefore i write to you with the object of asking you to    come and see me here this is an interesting old house in    its way and though i must not conceal from you that life    here is very very quiet i would do my best to make the    days pass pleasantly with you i had heard that you were    gone to aylmer park indeed william told me of his taking    you up to london now it seems you have left yorkshire    and i suppose you will not return there very soon if it    be so will it not be well that you should come to me for    a short time     both william and i feel that just for the presentfor    a little timeyou would perhaps prefer to be alone    with me he must go to london for awhile and then on to    belton to settle your affairs and his he intends to be    absent for six weeks if you would not be afraid of the    dullness of this house for so long a time pray come to    us the pleasure to me would be very great and i hope    that you have some of that feeling which with me is so    strong that we ought not to be any longer personally    strangers to each other you could then make up your mind    as to what you would choose to do afterwards i think    that by the end of that timethat is when william    returnsmy uncle and aunt from sleaford will be with    us he is a clergyman you know and if you then like to    remain they will be delighted to make your acquaintance     it seems to be a long journey for a young lady to make    alone from belton to plaistow but travelling is so easy    nowadays and young ladies seem to be so independent    that you may be able to manage it hoping to see you soon    i remain     your affectionate cousin     mary belton   this letter she received before breakfast and was therefore able to read it in solitude and to keep its receipt from the knowledge of mrs askerton if she should be so minded she understood at once all that it intended to conveya hint that plaistow hall would be a better resting place for her than mrs askertons cottage and an assurance that if she would go to plaistow hall for her convenience no advantage should be taken of her presence there by the owner of the house for his convenience as she sat thinking of the offer which had been made to her she fancied that she could see and hear her cousin will as he discussed the matter with his sister and with a half assumption of surliness declared his own intention of going away captain aylmer after that interview in london had spoken of beltons conduct as being unpardonable but clara had not only pardoned him but had in her own mind pronounced his virtues to be so much greater than his vices as to make him almost perfect but i will not drive him out of his own house she said what does it matter where i go  colonel askerton has had a letter from your cousin said mrs askerton as soon as the two ladies were alone together  and what does he say  not a word about you  so much the better i have given him trouble enough and am glad to think that he should be free of me for awhile is colonel askerton to stay at the cottage  now clara you are a hypocrite you know that you are a hypocrite  very likelybut i dont know why you should accuse me just now  yes you do have not you heard from norfolk also  yesi have  i was sure of it i knew he would never have written in that way in answer to my letter ignoring your visit here altogether unless he had written to you also  but he has not written to me my letter is from his sister there it is whereupon she handed the letter to mrs askerton and waited patiently while it was being read her friend returned it to her without a word and clara was the first to speak again it is a nice letter is it not i never saw her you know  so she says  but is it not a kind letter  i suppose it is meant for kindness it is not very complimentary to me it presumes that such a one as i may be treated without the slightest consideration and so i may it is only fit that i should be so treated if you ask my advice i advise you to go at onceat once  but i have not asked your advice dear nor do i intend to ask it  you would not have shown it me if you had not intended to go  how unreasonable you are you told me just now that i was a hypocrite for not telling you of my letter and now you are angry with me because i have shown it you  i am not angry i think you have been quite right to show it me i dont know how else you could have acted upon it  but i do not mean to act upon it i shall not go to plaistow there are two reasons against it each sufficient i shall not leave you just yetunless you send me away and i shall not cause my cousin to be turned out of his own house  why should he be turned out why should you not go to him you love himand as for him he is more in love than any man i ever knew go to plaistow hall and everything will run smooth  no dear i shall not do that  then you are foolish i am bound to tell you so as i have inveigled you here  i thought i had invited myself  no i asked you to come and when i asked you i knew that i was wrong though i meant to be kind i knew that i was unkind i saw that my husband disapproved it though he had not the heart to tell me so i wish he had i wish he had  mrs askerton i cannot tell you how much you wrong yourself and how you wrong me also i am more than contented to be here  but you should not be contented to be here it is just that in learning to love meor rather perhaps to pity me you lower yourself do you think that i do not see it all and know it all of course it is bad to be alone but i have no right not to be alone there was nothing for clara to do but to draw herself once again close to the poor woman and to embrace her with protestations of fair honest equal regard and friendship do you think i do not understand that letter continued mrs askerton if it had come from lady aylmer i could have laughed at it because i believe lady aylmer to be an overbearing virago whom it is good to put down in every way possible but this comes from a pureminded woman one whom i believe to be little given to harsh judgments on her fellowsinners and she tells you in her calm wise way that it is bad for you to be here with me  she says nothing of the kind  but does she not mean it tell me honestlydo you not know that she means it  i am not to be guided by what she means  but you are to be guided by what her brother means it is to come to that and you may as well bend your neck at once it is to come to that and the sooner the better for you it is easy to see that you are badly off for guidance when you take up me as your friend when she had so spoken mrs askerton got up and went to the door no clara do not come with me not now she said turning to her companion who had risen as though to follow her i will come to you soon but i would rather be alone now and look here dear you must answer your cousins letter do so at once and say that you will go to plaistow in any event it will be better for you  clara when she was alone did answer her cousins letter but she did not accept the invitation that had been given her she assured miss belton that she was most anxious to know her and hoped that she might do so before long either at plaistow or at belton but that at present she was under an engagement to stay with her friend mrs askerton in an hour or two mrs askerton returned and clara handed to her the note to read then all i can say is you are very silly and dont know on which side your bread is buttered it was evident from mrs askertons voice that she had recovered her mood and tone of mind i dont suppose it will much signify as it will all come right at last she said afterwards and then after luncheon when she had been for a few minutes with her husband in his own room she told clara that the colonel wanted to speak to her youll find him as grave as a judge for he has got something to say to you in earnest nobody can be so stern as he is when he chooses to put on his wig and gown so clara went into the colonels study and seated herself in a chair which he had prepared for her  she remained there for over an hour and during the hour the conversation became very animated colonel askertons assumed gravity had given way to ordinary eagerness during which he had walked about the room in the vehemence of his argument and clara in answering him had also put forth all her strength she had expected that he also was going to speak to her on the propriety of her going to norfolk but he made no allusion to that subject although all that he did say was founded on will beltons letter to himself belton in speaking of the cottage had told colonel askerton that miss amedroz would be his future landlord and had then gone on to explain that it was his beltons intention to destroy the entail and allow the property to descend from the father to the daughter as miss amedroz is with you now he said may i beg you to take the trouble to explain the matter to her at length and to make her understand that the estate is now at this moment in fact her own her possession of it does not depend on any act of hersor indeed upon her own will or wish in the matter on this subject colonel askerton had argued using all his skill to make clara in truth perceive that she was her fathers heiressthrough the generosity undoubtedly of her cousinand that she had no alternative but to assume the possession which was thus thrust upon her  and so eloquent was the colonel that clara was staggered though she was not convinced it is quite impossible she said though he may be able to make it over to me i can give it back again  i think not in such a matter as this a lady in your position can only be guided by her natural advisersher fathers lawyer and other family friends  i dont know why a young lady should be in any way different from an old gentleman  but an old gentleman would not hesitate under such circumstances the entail in itself was a cruelty and the operation of it on your poor brothers death was additionally cruel  it is cruel that any one should be poor argued clara but that does not take away the right of a rich man to his property  there was much more of this sort said between them till clara was at any rate convinced that colonel askerton believed that she ought to be the owner of the property and then at last he ventured upon another argument which soon drove clara out of the room there is i believe one way in which it can all be made right said he  what way said clara forgetting in her eagerness the obviousness of the mode which her companion was about to point out  of course i know nothing of this myself he said smiling but mary thinks that you and your cousin might arrange it between you if you were together  you must not listen to what she says about that colonel askerton  must i not well i will not listen to more than i can help but mary as you know is a persistent talker i at any rate have done my commission then clara left him and was alone for what remained of the afternoon  it could not be she said to herself that the property ought to be hers it would make her miserable were she once to feel that she had accepted it some small allowance out of it coming to her from the brotherly love of her cousinsome moderate stipend sufficient for her livelihood she thought she could accept from him it seemed to her that it was her destiny to be dependent on charityto eat bread given to her from the benevolence of a friend and she thought that she could endure his benevolence better than that of any other benevolence from aylmer park or from perivale would be altogether unendurable  but why should it not be as colonel askerton had proposed that this cousin of hers loved her with all his heartwith a constancy for which she had at first given him no credit she was well aware and as regarded herself she loved him better than all the world beside she had at last become conscious that she could not now marry captain aylmer without sinwithout false vows and fatal injury to herself and him to the prospect of that marriage as her future fate an end must be put at any ratean end if that which had already taken place was not to be regarded as end enough but yet she had been engaged to captain aylmerwas engaged to him even now when last her cousin had mentioned to her captain aylmers name she had declared that she loved him still how then could she turn round now and so soon accept the love of another man how could she bring herself to let her cousin assume to himself the place of a lover when it was but the other day that she had rebuked him for expressing the faintest hope in that direction  but yetyet as for going to plaistow that was quite out of the question  so you are to be the heiress after all said mrs askerton to her that night in her bedroom  no i am not to be the heiress after all said clara rising against her friend impetuously  youll have to be lady of belton in one way or the other at any rate said mrs askerton     chapter xxviii  miss amedroz is pursued   i suppose now my dear it may be considered that everything is settled about that young lady said lady aylmer to her son on the same day that miss amedroz left aylmer park  nothing is settled maam said the captain  you dont mean to tell me that after what has passed you intend to follow her up any further  i shall certainly endeavour to see her again  then frederic i must tell you that you are very wrong indeedalmost worse than wrong i would say wicked only i feel sure that you will think better of it you cannot mean to tell me that you wouldmarry her after what has taken place  the question is whether she would marry me  that is nonsense frederic i wonder that you who are generally so clearsighted cannot see more plainly than that she is a scheming artful young woman who is playing a regular game to catch a husband  if that were so she would have been more humble to you maam  not a bit fred thats just it that has been her cleverness she tried that on at first and found that she could not get round me dont allow yourself to be deceived by that i pray and then there is no knowing how she may be bound up with those horrid people so that she cannot throw them over even if she would  i dont think you understand her maam  ohvery well but i understand this and you had better understand it toothat she will never again enter a house of which i am the mistress nor can i ever enter a house in which she is received if you choose to make her your wife after that i have done lady aylmer had not done or nearly done but we need hear no more of her threats or entreaties her son left aylmer park immediately after easter sunday and as he went the mother nodding her head declared to her daughter that that marriage would never come off let clara amedroz be ever so sly or ever so clever  think of what i have said to you fred said sir anthony as he took his leave of his son  yes sir i will  you cant be better off than you areyou cant indeed with these words in his ears captain aylmer started for london intending to follow clara down to belton he hardly knew his own mind on this matter of his purposed marriage he was almost inclined to agree with his father that he was very well off as he was he was almost inclined to agree with his mother in her condemnation of claras conduct he was almost inclined to think that he had done enough towards keeping the promise made to his aunt on her deathbedbut still he was not quite contented with himself he desired to be honest and true as far as his ideas went of honesty and truth and his conscience told him that clara had been treated with cruelty by his mother i am inclined to think that lady aylmer in spite of her high experience and character for wisdom had not fought her battle altogether well no man likes to be talked out of his marriage by his mother and especially not so when the talking takes the shape of threats when she told him that under no circumstances would she again know clara amedroz he was driven by his spirit of manhood to declare to himself that that menace from her should not have the slightest influence on him the word or two which his father said was more effective after all it might be better for him in his peculiar position to have no wife at all he did begin to believe that he had no need for a wife he had never before thought so much of his fathers example as he did now clara was manifestly a hottempered womana very hottempered woman indeed now his mother was also a hottempered woman and he could see the result in the present condition of his fathers life he resolved that he would follow clara to belton so that some final settlement might be made between them but in coming to this resolution he acknowledged to himself that should she decide against him he would not break his heart she however should have her chance undoubtedly it was only right that she should have her chance  but the difficulty of the circumstances in which he was placed was so great that it was almost impossible for him to make up his mind fixedly to any purpose in reference to clara as he passed through london on his way to belton he called at mr greens chambers with reference to that sum of fifteen hundred pounds which it was now absolutely necessary that he should make over to miss amedroz and from mr green he learned that william belton had given positive instructions as to the destination of the belton estate he would not inherit it or have anything to do with it under the entailfrom the effects of which he desired to be made entirely free mr green who knew that captain aylmer was engaged to marry his client and who knew nothing of any interruption to that agreement felt no hesitation in explaining all this to captain aylmer i suppose you had heard of it before said mr green captain aylmer certainly had heard of it and had been very much struck by the idea but up to this moment he had not quite believed in it coming simply from william belton to clara amedroz such an offer might be no more than a strong argument used in lovemaking take back the property but take me with it of course that captain aylmer thought might have been the correct translation of mr william beltons romance but he was forced to look at the matter differently when he found that it had been put into a lawyers hands yes said he i have heard of it mr belton mentioned it to me himself this was not strictly true clara had mentioned it to him but belton had come into the room immediately afterwards and captain aylmer might probably have been mistaken  hes quite in earnest said mr green  of course i can say nothing mr green as i am myself so nearly interested in the matter it is a great question no doubt how far such an entail as that should be allowed to operate  i think it should stand as a matter of course i think belton is wrong said mr green  of course i can give no opinion said the other  ill tell you what you can do captain aylmer you can suggest to miss amedroz that there should be a compromise let them divide it they are both clients of mine and in that way i shall do my duty to each let them divide it belton has money enough to buy up the other moiety and in that way would still be belton of belton  captain aylmer had not the slightest objection to such a plan indeed he regarded it as in all respects a wise and salutary arrangement the moiety of the belton estate might probably be worth twentyfive thousand pounds and the addition of such a sum as that to his existing means would make all the difference in the world as to the expediency of his marriage his fathers arguments would all fall to the ground if twentyfive thousand pounds were to be obtained in this way and he had but little doubt that such a change in affairs would go far to mitigate his mothers wrath but he was by no means mercenary in his viewsso at least he assured himself clara should have her chance with or without the belton estateor with or without the half of it he was by no means mercenary had he not made his offer to herand repeated it almost with obstinacy when she had no prospect of any fortune he could always remember that of himself at least and remembering that now he could take a delight in these bright money prospects without having to accuse himself in the slightest degree of mercenary motives this fortune was a godsend which he could take with clean handsif only he should ultimately be able to take the lady who possessed the fortune  from london he wrote to clara telling her that he proposed to visit her at belton his letter was written before he had seen mr green and was not very fervent in its expressions but nevertheless it was a fair letter written with the intention of giving her a fair chance he had seen with great sorrowwith heartfelt grief that quarrel between his mother and his own clara thinking as he felt himself obliged to think about mrs askerton he could not but feel that his mother had cause for her anger but he himself was unprejudiced and was ready and anxious alsothe word anxious was underscoredto carry out his engagement a few words between them might probably set everything right and therefore he proposed to meet her at the belton castle house at such an hour on such a day he should run down to perivale on his journey and perhaps clara would let him have a line addressed to him there such was his letter  what do you think of that said clara showing it to mrs askerton on the afternoon of the day on which she had received it  what do you think of it said mrs askerton i can only hope that he will not come within the reach of my hands  you are not angry with me for showing it to you  nowhy should i be angry with you of course i knew it all without any showing do not tell colonel askerton or they will be killing each other  of course i shall not tell colonel askerton but i could not help showing this to you  and you will meet him  yes i shall meet him what else can i do  unless indeed you were to write and tell him that it would do no good  it will be better that he should come  if you allow him to talk you over you will be a wretched woman all your life  it will be better that he should come said clara again and then she wrote to captain aylmer at perivale telling him that she would be at the house at the hour he had named on the day he had named  when that day came she walked across the park a little before the time fixed not wishing to meet captain aylmer before she had reached the house it was now nearly the middle of april and the weather was soft and pleasant it was almost summer again and as she felt this she thought of all the events which had occurred since the last summerof their agony of grief at the catastrophe which had closed her brothers life of her aunts death first and then of her fathers following so close upon the other and of the two offers of marriage made to heras to which she was now aware that she had accepted the wrong man and rejected the wrong man she was steadily minded now at this moment that before she parted from captain aylmer her engagement with him should be brought to a close now at this coming interview so much at any rate should be done she had tried to make herself believe that she felt for him that sort of affection which a woman should have for the man she is to marry but she had failed she hardly knew whether she had in truth ever loved him but she was quite sure that she did not love him now noshe had done with aylmer park and she could feel thankful amidst all her troubles that that difficulty should vex her no more in showing captain aylmers letter to mrs askerton she had made no such promise as this but her mind had been quite made up he certainly shall not talk me over she said to herself as she walked across the park  but she could not see her way so clearly out of that further difficulty with regard to her cousin it might be that she would be able to rid herself of the one lover with comparative ease but she could not bring herself to entertain the idea of accepting the other it was true that this man longed for herdesired to call her his own with a wearing anxious painful desire which made his heart grievously heavyheavy as though with lead hanging to its strings and it was true that clara knew that it was so it was true also that his spirit had mastered her spirit and that his persistence had conquered her resistancethe resistance that is of her feelings but there remained with her a feminine shame which made it seem to her to be impossible that she should now reject captain aylmer and as a consequence of that rejection accept will beltons hand as she thought of this she could not see her way out of her trouble in that direction with any of that clearness which belonged to her in reference to captain aylmer  she had been an hour in the house before he came and never did an hour go so heavily with her there was no employment for her about the place and mrs bunce the old woman who now lived there could not understand why her late mistress chose to remain seated among the unused furniture clara had of course told her that a gentleman was coming not mr will said the woman no it is not mr will said clara his name is captain aylmer oh indeed and then mrs bunce looked at her with a mystified look why on earth should not the gentleman call on miss amedroz at mrs askertons cottage ill be sure to show un up when a comes at any rate said the old woman solemnlyand clara felt that it was all very uncomfortable  at last the gentleman did come and was shown up with all the ceremony of which mrs bunce was capable here he be mum then mrs bunce paused a moment before she retreated anxious to learn whether the new comer was a friend or a foe she concluded from the captains manner that he was a very dear friend and then she departed  i hope you are not surprised at my coming said captain aylmer still holding clara by the hand  a little surprised she said smiling  but not annoyed  nonot annoyed  as soon as you had left aylmer park i felt that it was the right thing to dothe only thing to doas i told my mother  i hope you have not come in opposition to her wishes said clara unable to control a slight tone of banter as she spoke  in this matter i found myself compelled to act in accordance with my own judgment said he untouched by her sarcasm  then i suppose that lady aylmer isis vexed with you for coming here i shall be so sorry for thatso very sorry as no good can come of it  welli am not so sure of that my mother is a most excellent woman one for whose opinions on all matters i have the highest possible valuea value so high thatthatthat  that you never ought to act in opposition to it that is what you really mean captain aylmer and upon my word i think that you are right  no clara that is not what i meannot exactly that indeed just at present i mean the reverse of that there are some things on which a man must act on his own judgment irrespectively of the opinions of any one else  not of a mother captain aylmer  yesof a mother that is to say a man must do so with a lady of course it is different i was very very sorry that there should have been any unpleasantness at aylmer park  it was not pleasant to me certainly  nor to any of us clara  at any rate it need not be repeated  i hope not  noit certainty need not be repeated i know now that i was wrong to go to aylmer park i felt sure beforehand that there were many things as to which i could not possibly agree with lady aylmer and i ought not to have gone  i dont see that at all clara  i do see it now  i cant understand you what things why should you be determined to disagree with my mother surely you ought at any rate to endeavour to think as she thinks  i cannot do that captain aylmer  i am sorry to hear you speak in this way i have come here all the way from yorkshire to try to put things straight between us but you receive me as though you would remember nothing but that unpleasant quarrel  it was so unpleasantso very unpleasant i had better speak out the truth at once i think that lady aylmer illused me cruelly i do no one can talk me out of that conviction of course i am sorry to be driven to say as much to youand i should never have said it had you not come here but when you speak of me and your mother together i must say what i feel your mother and i captain aylmer are so opposed to each other not only in feeling but in opinions also that it is impossible that we should be friendsimpossible that we should not be enemies if we are brought together  this she said with great energy looking intently into his face as she spoke he was seated near her on a chair from which he was leaning over towards her holding his hat in both hands between his legs now as he listened to her he drew his chair still nearer ridding himself of his hat which he left upon the carpet and keeping his eyes upon hers as though he were fascinated i am sorry to hear you speak like this he said  it is best to say the truth  but clara if you intend to be my wife  oh nothat is impossible now  what is impossible  impossible that i should become your wife indeed i have convinced myself that you do not wish it  but i do wish it  nono if you will question your heart about it quietly you will find that you do not wish it  you wrong me clara  at any rate it cannot be so  i will not take that answer from you he said getting up from his chair and walking once up and down the room then he returned to it and repeated his words i will not take that answer from you an engagement such as ours cannot be put aside like an old glove you do not mean to tell me that all that has been between us is to mean nothing there was something now like feeling in his tone something like passion in his gesture and clara though she had no thought of changing her purpose was becoming unhappy at the idea of his unhappiness  it has meant nothing she said we have been like children together playing at being in love it is a game from which you will come out scatheless but i have been scalded  scalded  wellnever mind i do not mean to complain and certainly not of you  i have come here all the way from yorkshire in order that things may be put right between us  you have been very goodvery good to come and i will not say that i regret your trouble it is best i think that we should meet each other once more face to face so that we may understand each other there was no understanding anything during those terrible days at aylmer park then she paused but as he did not speak at once she went on i do not blame you for anything that has taken place but i am quite sure of thisthat you and i could never be happy together as man and wife  i do not know why you say so i do not indeed  you would disapprove of everything that i should do you do disapprove of what i am doing now  disapprove of what  i am staying with my friend mrs askerton  he felt that this was hard upon him as she had shown herself inclined to withdraw herself from him he had become more resolute in his desire to follow her up and to hold by his engagement he was not employed now in giving her another chanceas he had proposed to himself to dobut was using what eloquence he had to obtain another chance for himself lady aylmer had almost made him believe that clara would be the suppliant but now he was the suppliant himself in his anxiety to keep her he was willing even to pass over her terrible iniquity in regard to mrs askertonthat great sin which had led to all these troubles he had once written to her about mrs askerton using very strong language and threatening her with his mothers full displeasure at that time mrs askerton had simply been her friend there had been no question then of her taking refuge under that womans roof now she had repelled lady aylmers counsels with scorn was living as a guest in mrs askertons house and yet he was willing to pass over the askerton difficulty without a word he was willing not only to condone past offences but to wink at existing iniquity but sheshe who was the sinner would not permit of this she herself dragged up mrs askertons name and seemed to glory in her own shame  i had not intended said he to speak of your friend  i only mention her to show how impossible it is that we should ever agree upon some subjectsas to which a husband and wife should always be of one mind i knew this from the moment in which i got your letterand only that i was a coward i should have said so then  and you mean to quarrel with me altogether  nowhy should we quarrel  why indeed said he  but i wish it to be settledquite settled as from the nature of things it must be that there shall be no attempt at renewal of our engagement after what has passed how could i enter your mothers house  but you need not enter it now in his emergency he was willing to give up anythingeverything he had been prepared to talk her over into a reconciliation with his mother to admit that there had been faults on both sides to come down from his high pedestal and discuss the matter as though clara and his mother stood upon the same footing having recognised the spirit of his ladylove he had told himself that so much indignity as that must be endured but now he had been carried so far beyond this that he was willing in the sudden vehemence of his love to throw his mother over altogether and to accede to any terms which clara might propose to him of course i would wish you to be friends he said using now all the tones of a suppliant but if you found that it could not be so  do you think that i would divide you from your mother  there need be no question as to that  ahthere you are wrong there must be such questions i should have thought of it sooner  clara you are more to me than my mother ten times more as he said this he came up and knelt down beside her you are everything to me you will not throw me over he was a suppliant indeed and such supplications are very potent with women men succeed often by the simple earnestness of their prayers women cannot refuse to give that which is asked for with so much of the vehemence of true desire clara you have promised to be my wife you have twice promised and can have no right to go back because you are displeased with what my mother may have said i am not responsible for my mother clara say that you will be my wife as he spoke he strove to take her hand and his voice sounded as though there were in truth something of passion in his heart     chapter xxix  there is nothing to tell   captain aylmer had never before this knelt to clara amedroz such kneeling on the part of lovers used to be the fashion because lovers in those days held in higher value than they do now that which they asked their ladies to giveor because they pretended to do so the forms at least of supplication were used whereas in these wiser days augustus simply suggests to caroline that they two might as well make fools of themselves togetherand so the thing is settled without the need of much prayer captain aylmers engagement had been originally made somewhat after this fashion he had not indeed spoken of the thing contemplated as a folly not being a man given to little waggeries of that nature but he had been calm unenthusiastic and reasonable he had not attempted to evince any passion and would have been quite content that clara should believe that he married as much from obedience to his aunt as from love for herself had he not found that clara would not take him at all under such a conviction but though she had declined to come to him after that fashionthough something more than that had been neededstill she had been won easily and therefore lightly prized i fear that it is so with everything that we valuewith our horses our houses our wines and above all with our women where is the man who has heart and soul big enough to love a woman with increased force of passion because she has at once recognised in him all that she has herself desired captain aylmer having won his spurs easily had taken no care in buckling them and now found to his surprise that he was like to lose them he had told himself that he would only be too glad to shuffle his feet free of their bondage but now that they were going from him he began to find that they were very necessary for the road that he was to travel clara he said kneeling by her side you are more to me than my mother ten times more  this was all new to her hitherto though she had never desired that he should assume such attitude as this she had constantly been unconsciously wounded by his coldnessby his cold propriety and unbending selfpossession his cold propriety and unbending selfpossession were gone now and he was there at her feet such an argument used at aylmer park would have conquered herwould have won her at once in spite of herself but now she was minded to be resolute she had sworn to herself that she would not peril herself or him by joining herself to a man with whom she had so little sympathy and who apparently had none with her but in what way was she to answer such a prayer as that which was now made to her the man who addressed her was entitled to use all the warmth of an accepted lover he only asked for that which had already been given to him  captain aylmer she began  why is it to be captain aylmer what have i done that you should use me in this way it was not i whowhomade you unhappy at aylmer park  i will not go back to that it is of no use pray get up it shocks me to see you in this way  tell me then that it is once more all right between us say that and i shall be happier than i ever was beforeyes than i ever was before i know how much i love you now how sore it would be to lose you i have been wrong i had not thought enough of that but i will think of it now  she found that the task before her was very difficultso difficult that she almost broke down in performing it it would have been so easy and for the moment so pleasant to have yielded he had his hand upon her arm having attempted to take her hand in preventing that she had succeeded but she could not altogether make herself free from him without rising for a moment she had pausedpaused as though she were about to yield for a moment as he looked into her eyes he had thought that he would again be victorious perhaps there was something in his glance some too visible return of triumph to his eyes which warned her of her danger no she said getting up and walking away from him no  and what does no mean clara then he also rose and stood leaning on the table does it mean that you will be forsworn  it means thisthat i will not come between you and your mother that i will not be taken into a family in which i am scorned that i will not go to aylmer park myself or be the means of preventing you from going there  there need be no question of aylmer park  there shall be none  but so much being allowed you will be my wife  no captain aylmerno i cannot be your wife do not press it further you must know that on such a subject i would think much before i answered you i have thought much and i know that i am right  and your promised word is to go for nothing  if it will comfort you to say so you may say it if you do not perceive that the mistake made between us has been as much your mistake as mine and has injured me more than it has injured you i will not remind you of itwill never remind you of it after this  but there has been no mistakeand there shall be no injury  ah captain aylmer you do not understand you cannot understand i would not for worlds reproach you but do you think i suffered nothing from your mother  and must i pay for her sins  there shall be no paying no punishment and no reproaches there shall be none at least from me butdo not think that i speak in anger or in pridei will not marry into lady aylmers family  this is too badtoo bad after all that is past it is too bad  what can i say would you advise me to do that which would make us both wretched  it would not make me wretched it would make me happy it would satisfy me altogether  it cannot be captain aylmer it cannot be when i speak to you in that way will you not let it be final  he paused a moment before he spoke again and then he turned sharp upon her tell me this clara do you love me have you ever loved me she did not answer him but stood there listening quietly to his accusations you have never loved me and yet you have allowed yourself to say that you did is not that true still she did not answer i ask you whether that is not true but though he asked her and paused for an answer looking the while full into her face yet she did not speak and now i suppose you will become your cousins wife he said it will suit you to change and to say that you love him  then at last she spoke i did not think that you would have treated me in this way captain aylmer i did not expect that you would insult me  i have not insulted you  but your manner to me makes my task easier than i could have hoped it to be you asked me whether i ever loved you i once thought that i did so and so thinking told you without reserve all my feeling when i came to find that i had been mistaken i conceived myself bound by my engagement to rectify my own error as best i could and i resolved wronglyas i now think very wronglythat i could learn as your wife to love you then came circumstances which showed me that a release would be good for both of us and which justified me in accepting it no girl could be bound by any engagement to a man who looked on and saw her treated in his own home by his own mother as you saw me treated at aylmer park i claim to be released myself and i know that this release is as good for you as it is for me  i am the best judge of that  for myself at any rate i will judge for myself i have decided now i have answered the questions which you asked me as to my love for yourself to that other question which you have thought fit to put to me about my cousin i refuse to give any answer whatsoever then having said so much she walked out of the room closing the door behind her and left him standing there alone  we need not follow her as she went up almost mechanically into her own roomthe room that used to be her ownand then shut herself in waiting till she should be assured first by sounds in the house and then by silence that he was gone that she fell away greatly from the majesty of her demeanour when she was thus alone and descended to the ordinary ways of troubled females we may be quite sure but to her there was no further difficulty her work for the day was done in due time she would take herself to the cottage and all would be well or at any rate comfortable with her but what was he to do how was he to get himself out of the house and take himself back to london while he had been in pursuit of her and when he was leaving his vehicle at the publichouse in the village of belton helike some other invading generalshad failed to provide adequately for his retreat when he was alone he took a turn or two about the room half thinking that clara would return to him she could hardly leave him alone in a strange househim who as he had twice told her had come all the way from yorkshire to see her but she did not return and gradually he came to understand that he must provide for his own retreat without assistance he was hardly aware even now how greatly he had transcended his usual modes of speech and action both in the energy of his supplication and in the violence of his rebuke he had been lifted for awhile out of himself by the excitement of his position and now that he was subsiding into quiescence he was unconscious that he had almost mounted into passionthat he had spoken of love very nearly with eloquence but he did recognise this as a factthat clara was not to be his wife and that he had better get back from belton to london as quickly as possible it would be well for him to teach himself to look back on the result of his aunts dying request as an episode in his life satisfactorily concluded his mother had undoubtedly been right clara he could now see would have led him a devil of a life and even had she come to him possessed of a moiety of the propertya supposition as to which he had very strong doubtsstill she might have been dear at the money no real feeling he said to himself as he walked about the roomnone whatever and then so deficient in delicacy but still he was discontentedbecause he had been rejected and therefore tried to make himself believe that he could still have her if he chose to persevere but no he said as he continued to pace the room i have done everythingmore than everything that honour demands i shall not ask her again it is her own fault she is an imperious woman and my mother read her character aright it did not occur to him as he thus consoled himself for what he had lost that his mothers accusation against clara had been altogether of a different nature when we console ourselves by our own arguments we are not apt to examine their accuracy with much strictness  but whether he were consoled or not it was necessary that he should go and in his going he felt himself to be illtreated he left the room and as he went downstairs was disturbed and tormented by the creaking of his own boots he tried to be dignified as he walked through the hall and was troubled at his failure though he was not conscious of any one looking at him then it was grievous that he should have to let himself out of the front door without attendance at ordinary times he thought as little of such things as most men and would not be aware whether he opened a door for himself or had it opened for him by anotherbut now there was a distressing awkwardness in the necessity for selfexertion he did not know the turn of the handle and was unfamiliar with the manner of exit he was being treated with indignity and before he had escaped from the house had come to think that the amedroz and belton people were somewhat below him he endeavoured to go out without a noise but there was a slam of the door without which he could not get the lock to work and clara up in her own room knew all about it  carriageyes of course i want the carriage he said to the unfortunate boy at the publichouse didnt you hear me say that i wanted it he had come down with a pair of horses and as he saw them being put to the vehicle he wished he had been contented with one as he was standing there waiting a gentleman rode by and the boy in answer to his question told him that the horseman was colonel askerton before the day was over colonel askerton would probably know all that had happened to him do move a little quicker will you he said to the boy and the old man who was to drive him then he got into the carriage and was driven out of belton devoutly purposing that he never would return and as he made his way back to perivale he thought of a certain lady emily who would as he assured himself have behaved much better than clara amedroz had done in any such scene as that which had just taken place  when clara was quite sure that captain aylmer was off the premises she too descended but she did not immediately leave the house she walked through the room and rang for the old woman and gave certain directionsas to the performance of which she certainly was not very anxious and was careful to make mrs bunce understand that nothing had occurred between her and the gentleman that was either exalting or depressing in its nature i suppose captain aylmer went out mrs bunce oh yes miss a went out i stood and seed un from the top of the kitchen stairs you might have opened the door for him mrs bunce indeed then i never thought of it miss seeing the house so empty and the like clara said that it did not signify and then after an hour of composure she walked back across the park to the cottage  well said mrs askerton as soon as clara was inside the drawingroom  well replied clara  what have you got to tell do tell me what you have to tell  i have nothing to tell  clara that is impossible have you seen him i know you have seen him because he went by from the house about an hour since  oh yes i have seen him  and what have you said to him  pray do not ask me these questions just now i have got to think of it allto think what he did say and what i said  but you will tell me  yes i suppose so then mrs askerton was silent on the subject for the remainder of the day allowing clara even to go to bed without another question and nothing was asked on the following morningnothing till the usual time for the writing of letters  shall you have anything for the post said mrs askerton  there is plenty of time yet  not too much if you mean to go out at all come clara you had better write to him at once  write to whom i dont know that i have any letter to write at all then there was a pause as far as i can see she said i may give up writing altogether for the future unless some day you may care to hear from me  but you are not going away  not just yetif you will keep me to tell you the truth mrs askerton i do not yet know where on earth to take myself  wait here till we turn you out  i have got to put my house in order you know what i mean the job ought not to be a troublesome one for it is a very small house  i suppose i know what you mean  it will not be a very smart establishment but i must look it all in the face must i not though it were to be no house at all i cannot stay here all my life  yes you may you have lost aylmer park because you were too noble not to come to us  no said clara speaking aloud with bright eyesalmost with her hands clenched noi deny that  i shall choose to think so for my own purposes clara you are savage to mealmost always savage but next to him i love you better than all the world beside and so does he its her courage he said to me the other day that she should dare to do as she pleases here is nothing but to have dared to persevere in the fangs of that old dragonit was just what he saidthat was wonderful  there is an end of the old dragon now so far as i am concerned  of course there isand of the young dragon too you wouldnt have had the heart to keep me in suspense if you had accepted him again you couldnt have been so pleasant last night if that had been so  i did not know i was very pleasant  yes you were you were soft and graciousgracious for you at least and now dear do tell me about it of course i am dying to know  there is nothing to tell  that is nonsense there must be a thousand things to tell at any rate it is quite decided  yes it is quite decided  all the dragons old and young are banished into outer darkness  either that or else they are to have all the light to themselves  such light as glimmers through the gloom of aylmer park and was he contented i hope not i hope you had him on his knees before he left you  why should you hope that how can you talk such nonsense  because i wish that he should recognise what he has lostthat he should know that he has been a foola mean fool  mrs askerton i will not have him spoken of like that he is a man very estimableof estimable qualities  fiddlededee he is an apea monkey to be carried on his mothers organ his only good quality was that you could have carried him on yours i can tell you one thingthere is not a woman breathing that will ever carry william belton on hers whoever his wife may be she will have to dance to his piping  with all my heartand i hope the tunes will be good  but i wish i could have been present to have heard what passedhidden you know behind a curtain you wont tell me  i will tell you not a word more  then i will get it out from mrs bunce ill be bound she was listening  mrs bunce will have nothing to tell you i do not know why you should be so curious  answer me one question at leastwhen it came to the last did he want to go on with it was the final triumph with him or with you  there was no final triumph such things when they have to end do not end triumphantly  and is that to be all  yesthat is to be all  and you say that you have no letter to write  noneno letter none at present none about this affair captain aylmer no doubt will write to his mother and then all those who are concerned will have been told  clara amedroz held her purpose and wrote no letter but mrs askerton was not so discreet or so indiscreet as the case might be she did writenot on that day or on the next but before a week had passed by she wrote to norfolk telling clara not a word of her letter and by return of post the answer came but the answer was for clara not for mrs askerton and was as follows      plaistow hall april 186     my dear clara     i dont know whether i ought to tell you but i suppose i    may as well tell you that mary has had a letter from mrs    askerton it was a kind obliging letter and i am very    grateful to her she has told us that you have separated    yourself altogether from the aylmer park people i dont    suppose youll think i ought to pretend to be very sorry    i cant be sorry even though i know how much you have    lost in a worldly point of view i could not bring myself    to like captain aylmer though i tried hard  oh mr belton mr belton     he and i never could have been friends and it is no use    my pretending regret that you have quarrelled with them    but that i suppose is all over and i will not say a    word more about the aylmers     i am writing now chiefly at marys advice and because she    says that something should be settled about the estate of    course it is necessary that you should feel yourself to be    the mistress of your own income and understand exactly    your own position mary says that this should be arranged    at once so that you may be able to decide how and    where you will live i therefore write to say that i    will have nothing to do with your fathers estate at    beltonnothing that is for myself i have written to    mr green to tell him that you are to be considered as the    heir if you will allow me to undertake the management of    the property as your agent i shall be delighted i think    i could do it as well as any one else and as we agreed    that we would always be dear and close friends i think    that you will not refuse me the pleasure of serving you in    this way     and now mary has a proposition to make as to which she    will write herself tomorrow but she has permitted me to    speak of it first if you will accept her as a visitor    she will go to you at belton she thinks and i think too    that you ought to know each other i suppose nothing would    make you come here at present and therefore she must    go to you she thinks that all about the estate would be    settled more comfortably if you two were together at any    rate it would be very nice for herand i think you    would like my sister mary she proposes to start about the    10th of may i should take her as far as london and see    her off and she would bring her own maid with her in    this way she thinks that she would get as far as taunton    very well she had perhaps better stay there for one    night but that can all be settled if you will say that    you will receive her at the house     i cannot finish my letter without saying one word for    myself you know what my feelings have been and i think    you know that they still are and always must be the    same from almost the first moment that i saw you i have    loved you when you refused me i was very unhappy but    i thought i might still have a chance and therefore i    resolved to try again then when i heard that you were    engaged to captain aylmer i was indeed brokenhearted of    course i could not be angry with you i was not angry but    i was simply brokenhearted i found that i loved you so    much that i could not make myself happy without you it    was all of no use for i knew that you were to be married    to captain aylmer i knew it or thought that i knew it    there was nothing to be doneonly i knew that i was    wretched i suppose it is selfishness but i felt and    still feel that unless i can have you for my wife i    cannot be happy or care for anything now you are free    againfree i mean from captain aylmerand how is it    possible that i should not again have a hope nothing but    your marriage or death could keep me from hoping     i dont know much about the aylmers i know nothing of    what has made you quarrel with the people at aylmer    parknor do i want to know to me you are once more that    clara amedroz with whom i used to walk in belton park    with your hand free to be given wherever your heart can    go with it while it is free i shall always ask for it    i know that it is in many ways above my reach i quite    understand that in education and habits of thinking you    are my superior but nobody can love you better than i do    i sometimes fancy that nobody could ever love you so well    mary thinks that i ought to allow a time to go by before    i say all this againbut what is the use of keeping it    back it seems to me to be more honest to tell you at once    that the only thing in the world for which i care one    straw is that you should be my wife     your most affectionate cousin     william belton   miss belton is coming here to the castle in a fortnight said clara that morning at breakfast both colonel askerton and his wife were in the room and she was addressing herself chiefly to the former  indeed miss belton and is he coming said colonel askerton  so you have heard from plaistow said mrs askerton  yesin answer to your letter no colonel askerton my cousin william is not coming but his sister purposes to be here and i must go up to the house and get it ready  that will do when the time comes said mrs askerton  i did not mean quite immediately  and are you to be her guest or is she to be yours said colonel askerton  its her brothers home and therefore i suppose i must be hers indeed it must be so as i have no means of entertaining any one  something no doubt will be settled said the colonel  oh what a weary word that is said clara weary at least for a womans ears it sounds of poverty and dependence and endless trouble given to others and all the miseries of female dependence if i were a young man i should be allowed to settle for myself  there would be no question about the property in that case said the colonel  and there need be no question now said mrs askerton  when the two women were alone together clara of course scolded her friend for having written to norfolk without letting it be known that she was doing soscolded her and declared how vain it was for her to make useless efforts for an unattainable end but mrs askerton always managed to slip out of these reproaches neither asserting herself to be right nor owning herself to be wrong but you must answer his letter she said  of course i shall do that  i wish i knew what he said  i shant show it you if you mean that  all the same i wish i knew what he said  clara of course did answer the letter but she wrote her answer to mary sending however one little scrap to marys brother she wrote to mary at great length striving to explain with long and laborious arguments that it was quite impossible that she should accept the belton estate from her cousin that subject however and the manner of her future life she would discuss with her dear cousin mary when mary should have arrived and then clara said how she would go to taunton to meet her cousin and how she would prepare williams house for the reception of williams sister and how she would love her cousin when she should come to know her all of which was exceedingly proper and pretty then there was a little postscript give the enclosed to william and this was the note to william      dear william     did you not say that you would be my brother be my    brother always i will accept from your hands all that    a brother could do and when that arrangement is quite    fixed i will love you as much as mary loves you and    trust you as completely and i will be obedient as a    younger sister should be     your loving sister     c a   its all no good said william belton as he crunched the note in his hand i might as well shoot myself get out of the way there will you and the injured groom scudded across the farmyard knowing that there was something wrong with his master     chapter xxx  mary belton   it was about the middle of the pleasant month of may when clara amedroz again made that often repeated journey to taunton with the object of meeting mary belton she had transferred herself and her own peculiar belongings back from the cottage to the house and had again established herself there so that she might welcome her new friend but she was not satisfied with simply receiving her guest at belton and therefore she made the journey to taunton and settled herself for the night at the inn she was careful to get a bedroom for an invalid lady close to the sittingroom and before she went down to the station she saw that the cloth was laid for tea and that the tea parlour had been made to look as pleasant as was possible with an inn parlour  she was very nervous as she stood upon the platform waiting for the new comer to show herself she knew that mary was a cripple but did not know how far her cousin was disfigured by her infirmity and when she saw a palefaced little woman somewhat melancholy but yet pretty withal with soft clear eyes and only so much appearance of a stoop as to soften the hearts of those who saw her clara was agreeably surprised and felt herself to be suddenly relieved of an unpleasant weight she could talk to the woman she saw there as to any other woman without the painful necessity of treating her always as an invalid i think you are miss belton she said holding out her hand the likeness between mary and her brother was too great to allow of clara being mistaken  and you are clara amedroz it is so good of you to come to meet me  i thought you would be dull in a strange town by yourself  it will be much nicer to have you with me  then they went together up to the inn and when they had taken their bonnets off mary belton kissed her cousin you are very nearly what i fancied you said mary  am i i hope you fancied me to be something that you could like  something that i could love very dearly you are a little taller than what will said but then a gentleman is never a judge of a ladys height and he said you were thin  i am not very fat  no not very fat but neither are you thin of course you know i have thought a great deal about you it seems as though you had come to be so very near to us and blood is thicker than water is it not if cousins are not friends who can be  in the course of that evening they became very confidential together and clara thought that she could love mary belton better than any woman that she had ever known of course they were talking about william and clara was at first in constant fear lest some word should be said on her lovers behalfsome word which would drive her to declare that she would not admit him as a lover but mary abstained from the subject with marvellous care and tact though she was talking through the whole evening of her brother she so spoke of him as almost to make clara believe that she could not have heard of that episode in his life mrs askerton would have dashed at the subject at once but then as clara told herself mary belton was better than mrs askerton  a few words were said about the estate and they originated in claras declaration that mary would have to be regarded as the mistress of the house to which they were going i cannot agree to that said mary  but the house is williams you know said clara  he says not  but of course that must be nonsense mary  it is very evident that you know nothing of plaistow ways or you would not say that anything coming from william was nonsense we are accustomed to regard all his words as law and when he says that a thing is to be so it always is so  then he is a tyrant at home  a beneficent despot some despots you know always were beneficent  he wont have his way in this thing  ill leave you and him to fight about that my dear i am so completely under his thumb that i always obey him in everything you must not therefore expect to range me on your side  the next day they were at belton castle and in a very few hours clara felt that she was quite at home with her cousin on the second day mrs askerton came up and calledaccording to an arrangement to that effect made between her and clara ill stay away if you like it mrs askerton had said but clara had urged her to come arguing with her that she was foolish to be thinking always of her own misfortune of course i am always thinking of it she had replied and always thinking that other people are thinking of it your cousin miss belton knows all my history of course but what matters i believe it would be better that everybody should know it i suppose shes very straightlaced and prim she is not prim at all said clara well ill come said mrs askerton but i shall not be a bit surprised if i hear that she goes back to norfolk the next day  so mrs askerton came and miss belton did not go back to norfolk indeed at the end of the visit mrs askerton had almost taught herself to believe that william belton had kept his secret even from his sister shes a dear little woman mrs askerton afterwards said to clara  is she not  and so thoroughly like a lady  yes i think she is a lady  a princess among ladies what a pretty little conscious way she has of asserting herself when she has an opinion and means to stick to it i never saw a woman who got more strength out of her weakness who would dare to contradict her  but then she knows everything so well said clara  and how like her brother she is  yesthere is a great family likeness  and in character too im sure youd find if you were to try her that she has all his personal firmness though she cant show it as he does by kicking out his feet and clenching his fist  im glad you like her said clara  i do like her very much  it is so oddthe way you have changed you used to speak of him as though he was merely a clod of a farmer and of her as a stupid old maid now nothing is too good to say of them  exactly my dearand if you do not understand why you are not so clever as i take you to be  life went on very pleasantly with them at belton for two or three weeksbut with this drawback as regarded clara that she had no means of knowing what was to be the course of her future life during these weeks she twice received letters from her cousin will and answered both of them but these letters referred to matters of business which entailed no contradictionto certain details of money due to the estate before the old squires death and to that vexed question of aunt winterfields legacy which had by this time drifted into beltons hands and as to which he was inclined to act in accordance with his cousins wishes though he was assured by mr green that the legacy was as good a legacy as had ever been left by an old woman i think he said in his last letter that we shall be able to throw him over in spite of mr green clara as she read this could not but remember that the man to be thrown over was the man to whom she had been engaged and she could not but remember also all the circumstances of the intended legacyof her aunts death and of the scenes which had immediately followed her death it was so odd that william belton should now be discussing with her the means of evading all her aunts intentionsand that he should be doing so not as her accepted lover he had indeed called himself her brother but he was in truth her rejected lover  from time to time during these weeks mrs askerton would ask her whether mr belton was coming to belton and clara would answer her with perfect truth that she did not believe that he had any such intention but he must come soon mrs askerton would say and when clara would answer that she knew nothing about it mrs askerton would ask further questions about mary belton your cousin must know whether her brother is coming to look after the property but miss belton though she heard constantly from her brother gave no such intimation if he had any intention of coming she did not speak of it during all these days she had not as yet said a word of her brothers love though his name was daily in her mouthand latterly was frequently mentioned by clarathere had been no allusion to that still enduring hope of which will belton himself could not but speakwhen he had any opportunity of speaking at all and this continued till at last clara was driven to suppose that mary belton knew nothing of her brothers hopes  but at last there came a changea change which to clara was as great as that which had affected her when she first found that her delightful cousin was not safe against lovemaking she had made up her mind that the sister did not intend to plead for her brotherthat the sister probably knew nothing of the brothers necessity for pleadingthat the brother probably had no further need for pleading when she remembered his last passionate words she could not but accuse herself of hypocrisy when she allowed place in her thoughts to this latter supposition he had been so intently earnest the nature of the man was so eager and true but yet in spite of all that had been said of all the fire in his eyes and life in his words and energy in his actions he had at last seen that his aspirations were foolish and his desires vain it could not otherwise be that she and mary should pass these hours in such calm repose without an allusion to the disturbing subject after this fashion and with such meditations as these had passed by the last weeksand then at last there came the change  i have had a letter from william this morning said mary  and so have not i said clara and yet i expect to hear from him  he means to be here soon said mary  oh indeed  he speaks of being here next week  for a moment or two clara had yielded to the agitation caused by her cousins tidings but with a little gush she recovered her presence of mind and was able to speak with all the hypothetical propriety of a female i am glad to hear it she said it is only right that he should come  he has asked me to say a word to youas to the purport of his journey  then again claras courage and hypocrisy were so far subdued that they were not able to maintain her in a position adequate to the occasion well she said laughing what is the word i hope it is not that i am to pack up bag and baggage and take myself elsewhere cousin william is one of those persons who are willing to do everything except what they are wanted to do he will go on talking about the belton estate when i want to know whether i may really look for as much as twelve shillings a week to live upon  he wants me to speak to you aboutabout the earnest love he bears for you  oh dear marycould you not suppose it all to be said it is an old trouble and need not be repeated  no said mary i cannot suppose it to be all said clara looking up as she heard the voice was astonished both by the fire in the womans eye and by the force of her tone i will not think so meanly of you as to believe that such words from such a man can be passed by as meaning nothing i will not say that you ought to be able to love him in that you cannot control your heart but if you cannot love him the want of such love ought to make you sufferto suffer much and be very sad  i cannot agree to that mary  is all his life nothing then do you know what love means with himthis love which he bears to you do you understand that it is everything to himthat from the first moment in which he acknowledged to himself that his heart was set upon you he could not bring himself to set it upon any other thing for a moment perhaps you have never understood this have never perceived that he is so much in earnest that to him it is more than money or land or healthmore than life itselfthat he so loves that he would willingly give everything that he has for his love have you known this  clara would not answer these questions for a while what if she had known it all was she therefore bound to sacrifice herself could it be the duty of any woman to give herself to a man simply because a man wanted her that was the argument as it was put forward now by mary belton  dear dearest clara said mary belton stretching herself forward from her chair and putting out her thin almost transparent hand i do not think that you have thought enough of this or perhaps you have not known it but his love for you is as i say to him it is everything it pervades every hour of every day every corner in his life he knows nothing of anything else while he is in his present state  he is very goodmore than good  he is very good  but i do not see thatthat of course i know how disinterested he is  disinterested is a poor word it insinuates that in such a matter there could be a question of what people call interest  and i know too how much he honours me  honour is a cold word it is not honour but lovedownright true honest love i hope he does honour you i believe you to be an honest true woman and as he knows you well he probably does honour youbut i am speaking of love again clara was silent she knew what should be her argument if she were determined to oppose her cousins pleadings and she knew alsoshe thought she knewthat she did intend to oppose them but there was a coldness in the argument to which she was averse you cannot be insensible to such love as that said mary going on with the cause which she had in hand  you say that he is fond of me  fond of you i have not used such trifling expressions as that  that he loves me  you know he loves you have you ever doubted a word that he has spoken to you on any subject  i believe he speaks truly  you know he speaks truly he is the very soul of truth  but mary  well clara but remember do not answer me lightly do not play with a mans heart because you have it in your power  you wrong me i could never do like that you tell me that he loves mebut what if i do not love him love will not be constrained am i to say that i love him because i believe that he loves me  this was the argument and clara found herself driven to use itnot so much from its special applicability to herself as on account of its general fitness whether it did or did not apply to herself she had no time to ask herself at that moment but she felt that no man could have a right to claim a womans hand on the strength of his own loveunless he had been able to win her love she was arguing on behalf of women in general rather than on her own behalf  if you mean to tell me that you cannot love him of course i must give over said mary not caring at all for men and women in general but full of anxiety for her brother do you mean to say thatthat you can never love him it almost seemed from her face that she was determined utterly to quarrel with her newfound cousinto quarrel and to go at once away if she got an answer that would not please her  dear mary do not press me so hard  but i want to press you hard it is not right that he should lose his life in longing and hoping  he will not lose his life mary  i hope notnot if i can help it i trust that he will be strong enough to get rid of his troubleto put it down and trample it under his feet clara as she heard this began to ask herself what it was that was to be trampled under wills feet i think he will be man enough to overcome his passion and then perhapsyou may regret what you have lost  now you are unkind to me  well what would you have me say do i not know that he is offering you the best gift that he can give did i not begin by swearing to you that he loved you with a passion of love that cannot but be flattering to you if it is to be love in vain this to him is a great misfortune and yet when i say that i hope that he will recover you tell me that i am unkind  nonot for that  may i tell him to come and plead for himself  again clara was silent not knowing how to answer that last question and when she did answer it she answered it thoughtlessly of course he knows that he can do that  he says that he has been forbidden  oh mary what am i to say to you you know it all and i wonder that you can continue to question me in this way  know all what  that i have been engaged to captain aylmer  but you are not engaged to him now  noi am not  and there can be no renewal there i suppose  oh no  not even for my brother would i say a word if i thought  nothere is nothing of that but if you cannot understand i do not think that i can explain it it seemed to clara that her cousin in her anxiety for her brother did not conceive that a woman even if she could suddenly transfer her affections from one man to another could not bring herself to say that she had done so  i must write to him today said mary and i must give him some answer shall i tell him that he had better not come here till you are gone  that will perhaps be best said clara  then he will never come at all  i can gocan go at once i will go at once you shall never have to say that my presence prevented his coming to his own house i ought not to be here i know it now i will go away and you may tell him that i am gone  no dear you will not go  yesi must go i fancied things might be otherwise because he once told me thathewouldbea brother to me and i said i would hold him to thatnot only because i want a brother so badly but because i love him so dearly but it cannot be like that  you do not think that he will ever desert you  but i will go away so that he may come to his own house i ought not to be here of course i ought not to be at beltoneither in this house or in any other tell him that i will be gone before he can come and tell him also that i will not be too proud to accept from him what it may be fit that he should give me i have no one but himno one but himno one but him then she burst into tears and throwing back her head covered her face with her hands  miss belton upon this rose slowly from the chair on which she was sitting and making her way painfully across to clara stood leaning on the weeping girls chair you shall not go while i am here she said  yes i must go he cannot come till i am gone  think of it all once again clara may i not tell him to come and that while he is coming you will see if you cannot soften your heart towards him  soften my heart oh if i could only harden it  he would wait if you would only bid him wait he would be so happy in waiting  yestill tomorrow morning i know him hold out your little finger to him and he has your whole hand and arm in a moment  i want you to say that you will try to love him  but clara was in truth trying not to love him she was ashamed of herself because she did love the one man when but a few weeks since she had confessed that she loved another she had mistaken herself and her own feelings not in reference to her cousin but in supposing that she could really have sympathised with such a man as captain aylmer it was necessary to her selfrespect that she should be punished because of that mistake she could not save herself from this condemnationshe would not grant herself a respitebecause by doing so she would make another person happy had captain aylmer never crossed her path she would have given her whole heart to her cousin nay she had so given ithad done so although captain aylmer had crossed her path and come in her way but it was matter of shame to her to find that this had been possible and she could not bring herself to confess her shame  the conversation at last ended as such conversations always do end without any positive decision mary wrote of course to her brother but clara was not told of the contents of the letter we however may know them and may understand their nature without learning above two lines of the letter if you can be content to wait awhile you will succeed said mary but when were you ever content to wait for anything if there is anything i hate it is waiting said will when he received the letter nevertheless the letter made him happy and he went about his farm with a sanguine heart as he arranged matters for another absence away long he said in answer to a question asked him by his head man how on earth can i say how long i shall be away you can go on well enough without me by this time i should think you will have to learn for there is no knowing how often i may be away or for how long  when mary said that the letter had been written clara again spoke about going and where will you go said mary  i will take a lodging in taunton  he would only follow you there and there would be more trouble that would be all he must act as your guardian and in that capacity at any rate you must submit to him clara therefore consented to remain at belton but before will arrived she returned from the house to the cottage  of course i understand all about it said mrs askerton and let me tell you thisthat if it is not all settled within a week from his coming here i shall think that you are without a heart he is to be knocked about and cuffed and kept from his work and made to run up and down between here and norfolk because you cannot bring yourself to confess that you have been a fool  i have never said that i have not been a fool said clara  you have made a mistakeas young women will do sometimes even when they are as prudent and circumspect as you areand now you dont quite like the task of putting it right  it was all true and clara knew that it was true the putting right of mistakes is never pleasant and in this case it was so unpleasant that she could not bring herself to acknowledge that it must be done and yet i think that by this time she was aware of the necessity     chapter xxxi  taking possession   i want her to have it all said william belton to mr green the lawyer when they came to discuss the necessary arrangements for the property  but that would be absurd  never mind it is what i wish i suppose a man may do what he likes with his own  she wont take it said the lawyer  she must take it if you manage the matter properly said will  i dont suppose it will make much difference said the lawyernow that captain aylmer is out of the running  i know nothing about that of course i am very glad that he should be out of the running as you call it he is a bad sort of fellow and i didnt want him to have the property but all that has had nothing to do with it im not doing it because i think she is ever to be my wife  from this the reader will understand that belton was still fidgeting himself and the lawyer about the estate when he passed through london the matter in dispute however was so important that he was induced to seek the advice of others besides mr green and at last was brought to the conclusion that it was his paramount duty to become belton of belton there seemed in the minds of all these councillors to be some imperative and almost imperious requirement that the acres should go back to a man of his name now as there was no one else of the family who could stand in his way he had no alternative but to become belton of belton he would however sell his estate in norfolk and raise money for endowing clara with commensurate riches such was his own planbut having fallen among counsellors he would not exactly follow his own plan and at last submitted to an arrangement in accordance with which an annuity of eight hundred pounds a year was to be settled upon clara and this was to lie as a charge upon the estate in norfolk  it seems to me to be very shabby said william belton  it seems to me to be very extravagant said the leader among the counsellors she is not entitled to sixpence  but at last the arrangement as above described was the one to which they all assented  when belton reached the house which was now his own he found no one there but his sister clara was at the cottage as he had been told that she was to return there he had no reason to be annoyed but nevertheless he was annoyed or rather discontented and had not been a quarter of an hour about the place before he declared his intention to go and seek her  do no such thing will pray do not said his sister  and why not  because it will be better that you should wait you will only injure yourself and her by being impetuous  but it is absolutely necessary that she should know her own position it would be cruelty to keep her in ignorancethough for the matter of that i shall be ashamed to tell her yesi shall be ashamed to look her in the face what will she think of it after i had assured her that she should have the whole  but she would not have taken it will and had she done so she would have been very wrong now she will be comfortable  i wish i could be comfortable said he  if you will only wait  i hate waiting i do not see what good it will do besides i dont mean to say anything about thatnot today at least i dont indeed as for being here and not seeing her that is out of the question of course she would think that i had quarrelled with her and that i meant to take everything to myself now that i have the power  she wont suspect you of wishing to quarrel with her will  i should in her place it is out of the question that i should be here and not go to her it would be monstrous i will wait till they have done lunch and then i will go up  it was at last decided that he should walk up to the cottage call upon colonel askerton and ask to see clara in the colonels presence it was thought that he could make his statement about the money better before a third person who could be regarded as claras friend than could possibly be done between themselves he did therefore walk across to the cottage and was shown into colonel askertons study  there he is mrs askerton said as soon as she heard the sound of the bell i knew that he would come at once  during the whole morning mrs askerton had been insisting that belton would make his appearance on that very daythe day of his arrival at belton and clara had been asserting that he would not do so  why should he come clara had said  simply to take you to his own house like any other of his goods and chattels  i am not his goods or his chattels  but you soon will be and why shouldnt you accept your lot quietly he is belton of belton and everything here belongs to him  i do not belong to him  what nonsense when a man has the command of the situation as he has he can do just what he pleases if he were to come and carry you off by violence i have no doubt the beltonians would assist him and say that he was right and you of course would forgive him belton of belton may do anything  that is nonsense if you please  indeed if you had any of that decent feeling of feminine inferiority which ought to belong to all women he would have found you sitting on the doorstep of his house waiting for him  that had been said early in the morning when they first knew that he had arrived but they had been talking about him ever sincetalking about him under pressure from mrs askerton till clara had been driven to long that she might be spared if he chooses to come he will come she said of course he will come mrs askerton had answered and then they heard the ring of the bell there he is i could swear to the sound of his foot doesnt he step as though he were belton of belton and conscious that everything belonged to him then there was a pause he has been shown in to colonel askerton what on earth could he want with him  he has called to tell him something about the cottage said clara endeavouring to speak as though she were calm through it all  cottage fiddlestick the idea of a man coming to look after his trumpery cottage on the first day of his showing himself as lord of his own property perhaps he is demanding that you shall be delivered up to him if he does i shall vote for obeying  and i for disobeyingand shall vote very strongly too  their suspense was yet prolonged for another ten minutes and at the end of that time the servant came in and asked if miss amedroz would be good enough to go into the masters room mr belton is there fanny asked mrs askerton the girl confessed that mr belton was there and then clara without another word got up and left the room she had much to do in assuming a look of composure before she opened the door but she made the effort and was not unsuccessful in another second she found her hand in her cousins and his bright eye was fixed upon her with that eager friendly glance which made his face so pleasant to those whom he loved  your cousin has been telling me of the arrangements he has been making for you with the lawyers said colonel askerton i can only say that i wish all the ladies had cousins so liberal and so able to be liberal  i thought i would see colonel askerton first as you are staying at his house and as for liberalitythere is nothing of the kind you must understand clara that a fellow cant do what he likes with his own in this country i have found myself so bullied by lawyers and that sort of people that i have been obliged to yield to them i wanted that you should have the old place to do just what you pleased with it  that was out of the question will  of course it was said colonel askerton then as belton himself did not proceed to the telling of his own story the colonel told it for him and explained what was the income which clara was to receive  but that is as much out of the question said she as the other i cannot rob you in that way i cannot and i shall not and why should i what do i want with an income something i ought to have if only for the credit of the family and that i am willing to take from your kindness but  its all settled now clara  i dont think that you can lessen the weight of your obligation miss amedroz after what has been done up in london said the colonel  if you had said a hundred a year  i have been allowed to say nothing said belton those people have said eightand so it is settled when are you coming over to see mary  to this question he got no definite answer and as he went away immediately afterwards he hardly seemed to expect one he did not even ask for mrs askerton and as that lady remarked behaved altogether like a bear but what a munificent bear she said fancyeight hundred a year of your own one begins to doubt whether it is worth ones while to marry at all with such an income as that to do what one likes with however it all means nothing it will all be his own again before you have even touched it  you must not say anything more about that said clara gravely  and why must i not  because i shall hear nothing more of it there is an end of all thatas there ought to be  why an end i dont see an end there will be no end till belton of belton has got you and your eight hundred a year as well as everything else  you will find thathedoes not meananythingmore said clara  you think not  i amsure of it then there was a little sound in her throat as though she were in some danger of being choked but she soon recovered herself and was able to express herself clearly i have only one favour to ask you now mrs askerton and that is that you will never say anything more about him he has changed his mind of course he has or he would not come here like that and have gone away without saying a word  not a word a man gives you eight hundred a year and that is not saying a word  not a word except about money but of course he is right i know that he is right after what has passed he would be very wrong totothink about it any more you joke about his being belton of belton but it does make a difference  it doesdoes it  it has made a difference i see and feel it now i shall neverhear himask methat questionany more  and if you did hear him what answer would you make him  i dont know  that is just it women are so crossgrained that it is a wonder to me that men should ever have anything to do with them they have about them some madness of a phantasy which they dignify with the name of feminine pride and under the cloak of this they believe themselves to be justified in tormenting their lovers lives out the only consolation is that they torment themselves as much can anything be more crossgrained than you are at this moment you were resolved just now that it would be the most unbecoming thing in the world if he spoke a word more about his love for the next twelve months  mrs askerton i said nothing about twelve months  and now you are brokenhearted because he did not blurt it all out before colonel askerton in a business interview which was very properly had at once and in which he has had the exceeding good taste to confine himself altogether to the one subject  i am not complaining  it was good taste though if he had not been a bear he might have asked after me who am fighting his battles for him night and day  but what will he do next  eat his dinner i should think as it is now nearly five oclock your father used always to dine at five  i cant go to see mary she said till he comes here again  he will be here fast enough i shouldnt wonder if he was to come here tonight and he did come again that night  when beltons interview was over in the colonels study he left the housewithout even asking after the mistress as that mistress had taken care to find outand went off rambling about the estate which was now his own it was a beautiful place and he was not insensible to the gratification of being its owner there is much in the glory of ownershipof the ownership of land and houses of beeves and woolly flocks of wide fields and thickgrowing woods even when that ownership is of late date when it conveys to the owner nothing but the realisation of a property on the soil but there is much more in it when it contains the memories of old years when the glory is the glory of race as well as the glory of power and property there had been beltons of belton living there for many centuries and now he was the belton of the day standing on his own groundthe descendant and representative of the beltons of oldbelton of belton without a flaw in his pedigree he felt himself to be proud of his positionprouder than he could have been of any other that might have been vouchsafed to him and yet amidst it all he was somewhat ashamed of his pride the man who can do it for himself is the real man after all he said but i have got it by a flukeand by such a sad chance too then he wandered on thinking of the circumstances under which the property had fallen into his hands and remembering how and when and where the first idea had occurred to him of making clara amedroz his wife he had then felt that if he could only do that he could reconcile himself to the heirship and the idea had grown upon him instantly and had become a passion by the eagerness with which he had welcomed it from that day to this he had continued to tell himself that he could not enjoy his good fortune unless he could enjoy it with her there had come to be a horrid impediment in his waya barrier which had seemed to have been placed there by his evil fortune to compensate the gifts given to him by his good fortune and that barrier had been captain aylmer he had not in fact seen much of his rival but he had seen enough to make it matter of wonder to him that clara could be attached to such a man he had thoroughly despised captain aylmer and had longed to show his contempt of the man by kicking him out of the hotel at the london railway station at that moment all the world had seemed to him to be wrong and wretched  but now it seemed that all the world might so easily be made right again the impediment had got itself removed belton did not even yet altogether comprehend by what means clara had escaped from the meshes of the aylmer park people but he did know that she had escaped her eyes had been opened before it was too late and she was a free womanto be compassed if only a man might compass her while she had been engaged to captain aylmer will had felt that she was not assailable though he had not been quite able to restrain himselfas on that fatal occasion when he had taken her in his arms and kissed herstill he had known that as she was an engaged woman he could not without insulting her press his own suit upon her but now all that was over let him say what he liked on that head she would have no proper plea for anger she was assailableand as this was so why the mischief should he not set about the work at once his sister bade him to wait why should he wait when one fortunate word might do it wait he could not wait how are you to bid a starving man to wait when you put him down at a wellcovered board here was he walking about belton parkjust where she used to walk with himand there was she at belton cottage within half an hour of him at this moment if he were to go quickly and yet mary was telling him to wait no he would not wait there could be no reason for waiting wait indeed till some other captain aylmer should come in the way and give him more trouble  so he wandered on resolving that he would see his cousin again that very day such an interview as that which had just taken place between two such dear friends was not naturalwas not to be endured what might not clara think of it to meet her for the first time after her escape from aylmer park and to speak to her only on matters concerning money he would certainly go to her again on that afternoon in his walking he came to the bottom of the rising ground on the top of which stood the rock on which he and clara had twice sat but he turned away and would not go up to it he hoped that he might go up to it very soonbut except under certain circumstances he would never go up to it again  i am going across to the cottage immediately after dinner he said to his sister  have you an appointment  no i have no appointment i suppose a man doesnt want an appointment to go and see his own cousin down in the country  i dont know what their habits are  i shant ask to go in but i want to see her  mary looked at him with loving sorrowing eyes but she said no more she loved him so well that she would have given her right hand to get for him what he wantedbut she sorrowed to think that he should want such a thing so sorely immediately after his dinner he took his hat and went out without saying a word further and made his way once more across to the gate of the cottage it was a lovely summer evening at that period of the year in which our summer evenings just begin when the air is sweeter and the flowers more fragrant and the forms of the foliage more lovely than at any other time it was now eight oclock but it was hardly as yet evening none at least of the gloom of evening had come though the sun was low in the heavens at the cottage they were all sitting out on the lawn and as belton came near he was seen by them and he saw them  i told you so said mrs askerton to clara in a whisper  he is not coming in clara answered he is going on  but when he had come nearer colonel askerton called to him over the garden paling and asked him to join them he was now standing within ten or fifteen yards of them though the fence divided them i have come to ask my cousin clara to take a walk with me he said she can be back by your tea time he made his request very placidly and did not in any way look like a lover  i am sure she will be glad to go said mrs askerton but clara said nothing  do take a turn with me if you are not tired said he  she has not been out all day and cannot be tired said mrs askerton who had now walked up to the paling clara get your hat but mr belton what have i done that i am to be treated in this way perhaps you dont remember that you have not spoken to me since your arrival  upon my word i beg your pardon said he endeavouring to stretch his hand across the bushes i forgot i didnt see you this morning  i suppose i mustnt be angry as this is your day of taking possession but it is exactly on such days as this that one likes to be remembered  i didnt mean to forget you mrs askerton i didnt indeed and as for the special day thats all bosh you know i havent taken particular possession of anything that i know of  i hope you will mr belton before the day is over said she clara had at length arisen and had gone into the house to fetch her hat she had not spoken a word and even yet her cousin did not know whether she was coming i hope you will take possession of a great deal that is very valuable clara has gone to get her hat  do you think she means to walk  i think she does mr belton and there she is at the door mind you bring her back to tea  clara as she came forth felt herself quite unable to speak or walk or look after her usual manner she knew herself to be a victimto be so far a victim that she could no longer control her own fate to captain aylmer at any rate she had never succumbed in all her dealings with him she had fought upon an equal footing she had never been compelled to own herself mastered but now she was being led out that she might confess her own submission and acknowledge that hitherto she had not known what was good for her she knew that she would have to yield she must have known how happy she was to have an opportunity of yielding but yetyet had there been any room for choice she thought she would have refrained from walking with her cousin that evening she had wept that afternoon because she had thought that he would not come again and now that he had come at the first moment that was possible for him she was almost tempted to wish him once more away  i suppose you understand that when i came up this morning i came merely to talk about business said belton as soon as they were off together  it was very good of you to come at all so soon after your arrival  i told those people in london that i would have it all settled at once and so i wanted to have it off my mind  i dont know what i ought to say to you of course i shall not want so much money as that  we wont talk about the money any more today i hate talking about money  it is not the pleasantest subject in the world  no said he no indeed i hate itparticularly between friends so you have come to grief with your friends the aylmers  i hope i havent come to griefand the aylmers as a family never were my friends im obliged to contradict you point by pointyou see  i dont like captain aylmer at all said will after a pause  so i saw will and i dare say he was not very fond of you  fond of me i didnt want him to be fond of me i dont suppose he ever thought much about me i could not help thinking of himshe had nothing to say to this and therefore walked on silently by his side i suppose he has not any idea of coming back here again  what to belton no i do not think he will come to belton any more  nor will you go to aylmer park  no certainly not of all the places on earth will to which you could send me aylmer park is the one to which i should go most unwillingly  i dont want to send you there  you never could be made to understand what a woman she is how disagreeable how cruel how imperious how insolent  was she so bad as all that  indeed she was will i cant but tell the truth to you  and he was nearly as bad as she  no will no do not say that of him  he was such a quarrelsome fellow he flew at me just because i said we had good hunting down in norfolk  we need not talk about all that will  noof course not its all passed and gone i suppose  yesit is all passed and gone you did not know my aunt winterfield or you would understand my first reason for liking him  no said will i never saw her  then they walked on together for a while without speaking and clara was beginning to feel some reliefsome relief at first but as the relief came there came back to her the dead dull feeling of heaviness at her heart which had oppressed her after his visit in the morning she had been right and mrs askerton had been wrong he had returned to her simply as her cousin and now he was walking with her and talking to her in this strain to teach her that it was so but of a sudden they came to a place where two paths diverged and he turned upon her and asked her quickly which path they should take look clara he said will you go up there with me it did not need that she should look as she knew that the way indicated by him led up among the rocks  i dont much care which way she said faintly  do you not but i do i care very much dont you remember where that path goes she had no answer to give to this she remembered well and remembered how he had protested that he would never go to the place again unless he could go there as her accepted lover and she had asked herself sundry questions as to that protestation could it be that for her sake he would abstain from visiting the prettiest spot on his estatethat he would continue to regard the ground as hallowed because of his memories of her which way shall we go he asked  i suppose it does not much signify said she trembling  but it does signify it signifies very much to me will you go up to the rocks  i am afraid we shall be late if we stay out long  what matters how late will you come  i suppose soif you wish it will  she had anticipated that the high rock was to be the altar at which the victim was to be sacrificed but now he would not wait till he had taken her to the sacred spot he had of course intended that he would there renew his offer but he had perceived that his offer had been renewed and had in fact been accepted during this little parley as to the pathway there was hardly any necessity for further words so he must have thought for as quick as lightning he flung his arms around her and kissed her again as he had kissed her on that other terrible occasionthat occasion on which he had felt that he might hardly hope for pardon  william william she said how can you serve me like that but he had a full understanding as to his own privileges and was well aware that he was in the right now as he had been before that he was trespassing egregiously why are you so rough with me she said  clara say that you love me  i will say nothing to you because you are so rough  they were now walking up slowly towards the rocks and as he had his arm round her waist he was contented for awhile to allow her to walk without speaking but when they were on the summit it was necessary for him that he should have a word from her of positive assurance clara say that you love me  have i not always loved you will since almost the first moment that i saw you  but that wont do you know that is not fair come clara ive had a deal of troubleand grief too havent i you should say a word to make up for itthat is if you can say it  what can a word like that signify to you today you have got everything  have i got you still she paused i will have an answer have i got you are you now my own  i suppose so will dont now i will not have it again does not that satisfy you  tell me that you love me  you know that i love you  better than anybody in the world  yesbetter than anybody in the world  and after all you will bemy wife  oh willhow you question one  you shall say it and then it will all be fair and honest  say what im sure i thought i had said everything  say that you mean to be my wife  i suppose soif you wish it  wish it said he getting up from his seat and throwing his hat into the bushes on one side wish it i dont think you have ever understood how i have wished it look here clara i found when i got down to norfolk that i couldnt live without you upon my word it is true i dont suppose youll believe me  i didnt think it could be so bad with you as that  noi dont suppose women ever do believe and i wouldnt have believed it of myself i hated myself for it by george i did that is when i began to think it was all up with me  all up with you oh will  i had quite made up my mind to go to new zealand i had indeed i couldnt have kept my hands off that man if we had been living in the same country i should have wrung his neck  will how can you talk so wickedly  theres no understanding it till you have felt it but never mind its all right now isnt it clara  if you think so  think so oh clara i am such a happy fellow do give me a kiss you have never given me one kiss yet  what nonsense i didnt think you were such a baby  by george but you shallor you shall never get home to tea tonight my own own own darling upon my word clara when i begin to think about it i shall be half mad  i think you are quite that already  no im notbut i shall be when im alone what can i say to you clara to make you understand how much i love you you remember the song for bonnie annie laurie id lay me down and dee of course it is all nonsense talking of dying for a woman what a man has to do is to live for her but that is my feeling im ready to give you my life if there was anything to do for you id do it if i could whatever it was do you understand me  dear will dearest will  am i dearest  are you not sure of it  but i like you to tell me so i like to feel that you are not ashamed to own it you ought to say it a few times to me as i have said it so very often to you  youll hear enough of it before youve done with me  i shall never have heard enough of it oh heavens only think when i was coming down in the train last night i was in such a bad way  and are you in a good way now  yes in a very good way i shall crow over mary so when i get home  and what has poor mary done  never mind  i dare say she knows what is good for you better than you know yourself i suppose she has told you that you might do a great deal better than trouble yourself with a wife  never mind what she has told me it is settled nowis it not  i hope so will  but not quite settled as yet when shall it be that is the next question  but to that question clara positively refused to make any reply that her lover would consider to be satisfactory he continued to press her till she was at last driven to remind him how very short a time it was since her father had been among them and then he was very angry with himself and declared himself to be a brute anything but that she said you are the kindest and the best of menbut at the same time the most impatient  thats what mary says but whats the good of waiting she wanted me to wait today  and as you would not you have fallen into a trap out of which you can never escape but pray let us go what will they think of us  i shouldnt wonder if they didnt think something near the truth  whatever they think we will go back it is ever so much past nine  before you stir clara tell me one thing are you really happy  very happy  and are you glad that this has been done  very glad will that satisfy you  and you do love me  i doi doi do can i say more than that  more than anybody else in the world  better than all the world put together  then said he holding her tight in his arms show me that you love me and as he made his request he was quick to explain to her what according to his ideas was the becoming mode by which lovers might show their love i wonder whether it ever occurred to clara as she thought of it all before she went to bed that night that captain aylmer and william belton were very different in their manners and if so i must wonder further whether she most approved the manners of the patient man or the man who was impatient     chapter xxxii  conclusion   about two months after the scene described in the last chapter when the full summer had arrived clara received two letters from the two lovers the history of whose loves have just been told and these shall be submitted to the reader as they will serve to explain the manner in which the two men proposed to arrange their affairs we will first have captain aylmers letter which was the first read clara kept the latter for the last as children always keep their sweetest morsels      aylmer park august 186     my dear miss amedroz     i heard before leaving london that you are engaged to    marry your cousin mr william belton and i think that    perhaps you may be satisfied to have a line from me to let    you know that i quite approve of the marriage  i do not care very much for his approval or disapproval said clara as she read this     no doubt it will be the best thing you can do especially    as it will heal all the sores arising from the entail  there never was any sore said clara     pray give my compliments to mr belton and offer him    my congratulations and tell him that i wish him all    happiness in the married state  married fiddlestick said clara in this she was unreasonable but the euphonious platitudes of captain aylmer were so unlike the vehement protestations of mr belton that she must be excused if by this time she had come to entertain something of an unreasonable aversion for the former     i hope you will not receive my news with perfect    indifference when i tell you that i also am going to be    married the lady is one whom i have known for a long    time and have always esteemed very highly she is lady    emily tagmaggert the youngest daughter of the earl of    mull  why clara should immediately have conceived a feeling of supreme contempt for lady emily tagmaggert and assured herself that her ladyship was a thin dry cross old maid with a red nose i cannot explain but i do know that such were her thoughts almost instantaneously in reference to captain aylmers future bride     lady emily is a very intimate friend of my sisters and    you who know how our family cling together will feel how    thankful i must be when i tell you that my mother quite    approves of the engagement i suppose we shall be married    early in the spring we shall probably spend some months    every year at perivale and i hope that we may look    forward to the pleasure of seeing you sometimes as a guest    beneath our roof  on reading this clara shuddered and made some inward protestation which seemed to imply that she had no wish whatever to revisit the dull streets of the little town with which she had been so well acquainted i hope shell be good to poor mr possit said clara and give him port wine on sundays     i have one more thing that i ought to say you will    remember that i intended to pay my aunts legacy    immediately after her death but that i was prevented    by circumstances which i could not control i have paid    it now into mr greens hands on your account together    with the sum of £59 18s 3d which is due upon it as    interest at the rate of five per cent i hope that this    may be satisfactory  it is not satisfactory at all said clara putting down the letter and resolving that will belton should be instructed to repay the money instantly it may however be explained here that in this matter clara was doomed to be disappointed and that she was forced by mr greens arguments to receive the money then it shall go to the hospital at perivale she declared when those arguments were used as to that mr green was quite indifferent but i do not think that the legacy which troubled poor aunt winterfield so much on her dying bed was ultimately applied to so worthy a purpose  and now my dear miss amedroz continued the letter     i will say farewell with many assurances of my unaltered    esteem and with heartfelt wishes for your future    happiness believe me to be always     most faithfully and sincerely yours     frederic f aylmer   esteem said clara as she finished the letter i wonder which he esteems the most me or lady emily tagmaggert he will never get beyond esteem with any one  the letter which was last read was as follows      plaistow august 186     dearest clara     i dont think i shall ever get done and i am coming to    hate farming it is awful lonely here too and i pass all    my evenings by myself wondering why i should be doomed    to this kind of thing while you and mary are comfortable    together at belton we have begun with the wheat and as    soon as that is safe i shall cut and run i shall leave    the barley to bunce bunce knows as much about it as i    doand as for remaining here all the summer its out of    the question     my own dear darling love of course i dont intend to    urge you to do anything that you dont like but upon my    honour i dont see the force of what you say you know i    have as much respect for your fathers memory as anybody    but what harm can it do to him that we should be married    at once dont you think he would have wished it himself    it can be ever so quiet so long as its done i dont    care a straw how its done indeed for the matter of    that i always think it would be best just to walk to    church and to walk home again without saying anything to    anybody i hate fuss and nonsense and really i dont    think anybody would have a right to say anything if we    were to do it at once in that sort of way i have had a    bad time of it for the last twelvemonth you must allow    that and i think that i ought to be rewarded     as for living you shall have your choice indeed you    shall live anywhere you pleaseat timbuctoo if you like    it i dont want to give up plaistow because my father    and grandfather farmed the land themselves but i am quite    prepared not to live here i dont think it would suit    you because it has so much of the farmhouse about it    only i should like you sometimes to come and look at the    old place what i should like would be to pull down the    house at belton and build another but you mustnt propose    to put it off till thats done as i should never have the    heart to do it if you think that would suit you ill    make up my mind to live at belton for a constancy and    then id go in for a lot of cattle and dont doubt id    make a fortune im almost sick of looking at the straight    ridges in the big square fields every day of my life     give my love to mary i hope she fights my battle for me    pray think of all this and relent if you can i do so    long to have an end of this purgatory if there was any    use i wouldnt say a word but theres no good in being    tortured when there is no use god bless you dearest    love i do love you so well     yours most affectionately     w belton   she kissed the letter twice pressed it to her bosom and then sat silent for half an hour thinking of itof it and the man who wrote it and of the man who had written the other letter she could not but remember how that other man had thought to treat her when it was his intention and her intention that they two should join their lots togetherhow cold he had been how full of caution and counsel how he had preached to her himself and threatened her with the preaching of his mother how manifestly he had purposed to make her life a sacrifice to his life how he had premeditated her incarceration at perivale while he should be living a bachelors life in london will beltons ideas of married life were very different only come to me at oncenow immediately and everything else shall be disposed just as you please this was his offer what he proposed to giveor rather his willingness to be thus generous was very sweet to her but it was not half so sweet as his impatience in demanding his reward how she doted on him because he considered his present state to be a purgatory how could she refuse anything she could give to one who desired her gifts so strongly  as for her future residence it would be a matter of indifference to her where she should live so long as she might live with him but for himshe felt that but one spot in the world was fit for him he was belton of belton and it would not be becoming that he should live elsewhere of course she would go with him to plaistow hall as often as he might wish it but belton castle should be his permanent restingplace it would be her duty to be proud for him and therefore for his sake she would beg that their home might be in somersetshire  mary she said to her cousin soon afterwards will sends his love to you  and what else does he say  i couldnt tell you everything you shouldnt expect it  i dont expect it but perhaps there may be something to be told  nothing that i need tellspecially you who know him so well can imagine what he would say  dear will i am sure he would mean to write what was pleasant  then the matter would have dropped had clara been so mindedbut she in truth was anxious to be forced to talk about the letter she wished to be urged by mary to do that which will urged her to door at least to learn whether mary thought that her brothers wish might be gratified without impropriety dont you think we ought to live here she said  by all meansif you both like it  he is so goodso unselfish that he will only ask me to do what i like best  and which would you like best  i think he ought to live here because it is the old family property i confess that the name goes for something with me he says that he would build a new house  does he think he could have it ready by the time you are married  ahthat is just the difficulty perhaps after all you had better read his letter i dont know why i should not show it to you it will only tell you what you know alreadythat he is the most generous fellow in all the world then mary read the letter what am i to say to him clara asked it seems so hard to refuse anything to one who is so true and good and generous  it is hard  but you see my poor dear fathers death has been so recent  i hardly know said mary how the world feels about such things  i think we ought to wait at least twelve months said clara very sadly  poor will he will be brokenhearted a dozen times before that but then when his happiness does come he will be all the happier clara when she heard this almost hated her cousin marynot for her own sake but on wills account will trusted so implicitly to his sister and yet she could not make a better fight for him than this it almost seemed that mary was indifferent to her brothers happiness had will been her brother clara thought and had any girl asked her advice under similar circumstances she was sure that she would have answered in a different way she would have told such girl that her first duty was owing to the man who was to be her husband and would not have said a word to her about the feeling of the world after all what did the feeling of the world signify to them who were going to be all the world to each other  on that afternoon she went up to mrs askertons and succeeded in getting advice from her also though she did not show wills letter to that lady of course i know what he says said mrs askerton unless i have mistaken the man he wants to be married tomorrow  he is not so bad as that said clara  then the next day or the day after of course he is impatient and does not see any earthly reason why his impatience should not be gratified  he is impatient  and i suppose you hesitate because of your fathers death  it seems but the other daydoes it not said clara  everything seems but the other day to me it was but the other day that i myself was married  and of course though i would do anything i could that he would ask me to do  but would you do anything  anything that was not wrong i would why should i not when he is so good to me  then write to him my dear and tell him that it shall be as he wishes it believe me the days of jacob are over men dont understand waiting now and its always as well to catch your fish when you can  you dont suppose i have any thought of that kind  i am sure you have notand im sure that he deserves no such thoughtbut the higher that are his deserts the greater should be his reward if i were you i should think of nothing but him and i should do exactly as he would have me clara kissed her friend as she parted from her and again resolved that all that womans sins should be forgiven her a woman who could give such excellent advice deserved that every sin should be forgiven her theyll be married yet before the summer is over mrs askerton said to her husband that afternoon i believe a man may have anything he chooses to ask for if hell only ask hard enough  and they were married in the autumn if not actually in the summer with what precise words clara answered her lovers letter i will not say but her answer was of such a nature that he found himself compelled to leave plaistow even before the wheat was garnered great confidence was placed in bunce on that occasion and i have reason to believe that it was not misplaced they were married in septemberyes in september although that letter of wills was written in august and by the beginning of october they had returned from their wedding trip to plaistow clara insisted that she should be taken to plaistow and was very anxious when there to learn all the particulars of the farm she put down in a little book how many acres there were in each field and what was the average produce of the land she made inquiry about fourcrop rotation and endeavoured with bunce to go into the great subject of stallfeeding but belton did not give her as much encouragement as he might have done well come here for the shooting next year he said that is if there is nothing to prevent us  i hope therell be nothing to prevent us  there might be perhaps but well always come if there is not for the rest of it ill leave it to bunce and just run over once or twice in the year it would not be a nice place for you to live at long  i like it of all things i am quite interested about the farm  youd get very sick of it if you were here in the winter the truth is that if you farm well you must farm ugly the picturesque nooks and corners have all to be turned inside out and the hedgerows must be abolished because we want the sunshine now down at belton just about the house we wont mind farming well but will stick to the picturesque  the new house was immediately commenced at belton and was made to proceed with all imaginable alacrity it was supposed at one timeat least belton himself said that he so supposedthat the building would be ready for occupation at the end of the first summer but this was not found to be possible we must put it off till may after all said belton as he was walking round the unfinished building with colonel askerton its an awful bore but theres no getting people really to pull out in this country  i think theyve pulled out pretty well of course you couldnt have gone into a damp house for the winter  other people can get a house built within twelve months look what they do in london  and other people with their wives and children die in consequence of colds and sore throats and other evils of that nature i wouldnt go into a new house i know till i was quite sure it was dry  as will at this time was hardly ten months married he was not as yet justified in thinking about his own wife and children but he had already found it expedient to make arrangements for the autumn which would prevent that annual visit to plaistow which clara had contemplated and which he had regarded with his characteristic prudence as being subject to possible impediments he was to be absent himself for the first week in september but was to return immediately after that this he did and before the end of that month he was justified in talking of his wife and family i suppose it wouldnt have done to have been moving nowunder all the circumstances he said to his friend mrs askerton as he still grumbled about the unfinished house  i dont think it would have done at all under all the circumstances said mrs askerton  but in the following spring or early summer they did get into the new houseand a very nice house it was as will i think be believed by those who have known mr william belton and when they were well settled at which time little will belton was some seven or eight months oldlittle will for whom great bonfires had been lit as though his birth in those parts was a matter not to be regarded lightly for was he not the first belton of belton who had been born there for more than a centurywhen that time came visitors appeared at the new belton castle visitors of importance who were entitled to and who received great consideration these were no less than captain aylmer member for perivale and his newlymarried bride lady emily aylmer née tagmaggert they were then just married and had come down to belton castle immediately after their honeymoon trip how it had come to pass that such friendship had sprung upor rather how it had been revivedit would be bootless here to say but old alliances such as that which had existed between the aylmer and the amedroz families do not allow themselves to die out easily and it is well for us all that they should be longlived so captain aylmer brought his bride to belton park and a small fatted calf was killed and the askertons came to dinneron which occasion captain aylmer behaved very well though we may imagine that he must have had some misgivings on the score of his young wife the askertons came to dinner and the old rector and the squire from a neighbouring parish and everything was very handsome and very dull captain aylmer was much pleased with his visit and declared to lady emily that marriage had greatly improved mr william belton now will had been very dull the whole evening and very unlike the fiery violent unreasonable man whom captain aylmer remembered to have met at the station hotel of the great northern railway  i was as sure of it as possible clara said to her husband that night  sure of what my dear  that she would have a red nose  who has got a red nose  dont be stupid will who should have it but lady emily  upon my word i didnt observe it  you never observe anything will do you but dont you think she is very plain  upon my word i dont know she isnt as handsome as some people  dont be a fool will how old do you suppose her to be  how old let me see thirty perhaps  if shes not over forty ill consent to change noses with her  nowe wont do that not if i know it  i cannot conceive why any man should marry such a woman as that not but what shes a very good woman i dare say only what can a man get by it to be sure theres the title if thats worth anything  but will belton was never good for much conversation at this hour and was too fast asleep to make any rejoinder to the last remark
