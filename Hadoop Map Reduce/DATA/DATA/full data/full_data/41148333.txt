usage no fiercer cruelty was ever experienced by a woman than that which fell to the lot of josephine murray from the hands of earl lovel to whom she was married in the parish church of applethwaitea parish without a village lying among the mountains of cumberlandon the 1st of june 181 that her marriage was valid according to all the forms of the church if lord lovel were then capable of marrying no one ever doubted nor did the earl ever allege that it was not so lovel grange is a small house surrounded by a small domainsmall as being the residence of a rich nobleman lying among the mountains which separate cumberland from westmoreland about ten miles from keswick very lovely from the brightness of its own green sward and the luxuriance of its wild woodland from the contiguity of overhanging mountains and from the beauty of lovel tarn a small lake belonging to the property studded with little islands each of which is covered with its own thicket of hollies birch and dwarfed oaks the house itself is poor ill built with straggling passages and low rooms and is a sombre illomened looking place when josephine murray was brought there as a bride she thought it to be very sombre and illomened but she loved the lakes and mountains and dreamed of some vague mysterious joy of life which was to come to her from the wildness of her domicile  i fear that she had no other ground firmer than this on which to found her hopes of happiness she could not have thought lord lovel to be a good man when she married him and it can hardly be said that she loved him she was then twentyfour years old and he had counted double as many years she was very beautiful dark with large bold blue eyes with hair almost black tall well made almost robust a wellborn brave ambitious woman of whom it must be acknowledged that she thought it very much to be the wife of a lord though our story will be concerned much with her sufferings the record of her bridal days may be very short it is with struggles that came to her in after years that we shall be most concerned and the reader therefore need be troubled with no long description of josephine murray as she was when she became the countess lovel it is hoped that her wrongs may be thought worthy of sympathyand may be felt in some sort to atone for the ignoble motives of her marriage  the earl when he found his bride had been living almost in solitude for a twelvemonth among the neighbouring gentry in the lake country he kept no friendly relations his property there was small and his character was evil he was an english earl and as such known in some unfamiliar fashion to those who know all earls but he was a man never seen in parliament who had spent the greater part of his manhood abroad who had sold estates in other counties converting unentailed acres into increased wealth but wealth of a kind much less acceptable to the general english aristocrat than that which comes direct from land lovel grange was his only remaining english property and when in london he had rooms at an hotel he never entertained and he never accepted hospitality it was known of him that he was very rich and men said that he was mad such was the man whom josephine murray had chosen to marry because he was an earl  he had found her near keswick living with her father in a pretty cottage looking down upon derwentwatera thorough gentleman for captain murray had come of the right murraysand thence he had carried her to lovel grange she had brought with her no penny of fortune and no settlement had been made on her her father who was then an old man had mildly expostulated but the ambition of the daughter had prevailed and the marriage was accomplished the beautiful young woman was carried off as a bride it will be unnecessary to relate what efforts had been made to take her away from her fathers house without bridal honours but it must be told that the earl was a man who had never yet spared a woman in his lust it had been the rule almost the creed of his life that woman was made to gratify the appetite of man and that the man is but a poor creature who does not lay hold of the sweetness that is offered to him he had so lived as to teach himself that those men who devote themselves to their wives as a wife devotes herself to her husband are the poor lubberly clods of creation who had lacked the power to reach the only purpose of living which could make life worth having women had been to him a prey as the fox is a prey to the huntsman and the salmon to the angler but he had acquired great skill in his sport and could pursue his game with all the craft which experience will give he could look at a woman as though he saw all heaven in her eyes and could listen to her as though the music of the spheres was to be heard in her voice then he could whisper words which to many women were as the music of the spheres and he could persevere abandoning all other pleasures devoting himself to the one wickedness with a perseverance which almost made success certain but with josephine murray he could be successful on no other terms than those which enabled her to walk out of the church with him as countess lovel  she had not lived with him six months before he told her that the marriage was no marriage and that she washis mistress there was an audacity about the man which threw aside all fear of the law and which was impervious to threats and interference he assured her that he loved her and that she was welcome to live with him but that she was not his wife and that the child which she bore could not be the heir to his title and could claim no heirship to his property he did love herhaving found her to be a woman of whose company he had not tired in six months he was going back to italy and he offered to take her with himbut he could not he said permit the farce of her remaining at lovel grange and calling herself the countess lovel if she chose to go with him to palermo where he had a castle and to remain with him in his yacht she might for the present travel under the name of his wife but she must know that she was not his wife she was only his mistress  of course she told her father of course she invoked every murray in and out of scotland of course there were many threats a duel was fought up near london in which lord lovel consented to be shot at twicedeclaring that after that he did not think that the circumstances of the case required that he should be shot at any more in the midst of this a daughter was born to her and her father diedduring which time she was still allowed to live at lovel grange but what was it expedient that she should do he declared that he had a former wife when he married her and that therefore she was not and could not be his wife should she institute a prosecution against him for bigamy thereby acknowledging that she was herself no wife and that her child was illegitimate from such evidence as she could get she believed that the italian woman whom the earl in former years had married had died before her own marriage the earl declared that the countess the real countess had not paid her debt to nature till some months after the little ceremony which had taken place in applethwaite church in a moment of weakness josephine fell at his feet and asked him to renew the ceremony he stooped over her kissed her and smiled my pretty child he said why should i do that he never kissed her again  what should she do before she had decided he was in his yacht sailing to palermosailing no doubt not alone what should she do he had left her an incomesufficient for the castoff mistress of an earlsome few hundreds a year on condition that she would quietly leave lovel grange cease to call herself a countess and take herself and her bairnwhither she would every abode of sin in london was open to her for what he cared but what should she do it seemed to her to be incredible that so great a wrong should befall her and that the man should escape from her and be free from punishmentunless she chose to own the baseness of her own position by prosecuting him for bigamy the murrays were not very generous in their succour as the old man had been much blamed for giving his daughter to one of whom all the world knew nothing but evil one murray had fired two shots on her behalf in answer to each one of which the earl had fired into the air but beyond this the murrays could do nothing josephine herself was haughty and proud conscious that her rank was greater than that of any of the murrays with whom she came in contact but what should she do  the earl had been gone five years sailing about the world she knew not where when at last she determined to institute a prosecution for bigamy during these years she was still living at the grange with her child and the courts of law had allotted her some sum by way of alimony till her cause should be decided but upon this alimony she found it very difficult to lay her handsquite impossible to lay her hands upon the entirety of it and then it came to pass that she was eaten up by lawyers and tradesmen and fell into bad repute as asserting that claims made against her should legally be made against the very man whom she was about to prosecute because she was not his wife and this went on till further life at lovel grange became impossible to her  in those days there was living in keswick a certain mr thomas thwaite a tailor who by degrees had taken a strong part in denouncing the wrongs to which lady lovel had been subjected he was a powerful sturdy man with good means for his position a wellknown radical in a county in which radicals have never been popular and in which fifty years ago they were much rarer than they are now at this time keswick and its vicinities were beginning to be known as the abodes of poets and thomas thwaite was acquainted with southey and wordsworth he was an intelligent upstanding impulsive man who thought well of his own position in the world and who could speak his mind he was tall massive and square tenderhearted and very generous and he hated the earl of lovel with all his heart once the two men had met since the story of the countesss wrongs had become known and the tailor had struck the earl to the ground this had occurred as the earl was leaving lovel grange and when he was starting on his long journey the scene took place after he had parted from his countesswhom he never was to see again he rose to his feet and rushed at the tailor but the two were separated and the earl thought it best to go on upon his journey nothing further was done as to the blow and many years rolled by before the earl came back to cumberland  it became impossible for the countess and her daughter the young lady anna as she was usually called to remain at lovel grange and they were taken to the house of mr thwaite in keswick as a temporary residence at this time the countess was in debt and already there were lawsuits as to the practicability of obtaining payment of those debts from the husbands estate and as soon as it was determined that the prosecution for bigamy should be instituted the confusion in this respect was increased the countess ceased to call herself a countess as she certainly would not be a countess should she succeed in proving the earl to have been guilty and had he been guilty of bigamy the decree under which alimony was assigned to her would become void should she succeed she would be a penniless unmarried female with a daughter her child would be unfathered and base and heas far as she could seewould be beyond the reach of punishment but in truth she and her friend the tailor were not in quest of success she and all her friends believed that the earl had committed no such crime but if he were acquitted then would her claim to be called lady lovel and to enjoy the appanages of her rank be substantiated or at least something would have been done towards substantiating those claims but during this time she called herself mrs murray and the little lady anna was called anna murray  it added much to the hardship of the womans case that public sympathy in distant parts of the countryup in london and in southern counties and even among a portion of the gentry in cumberland and westmorelanddid not go with her she had married without due care some men saidand many women repeated the storythat she had known of the existence of the former wife when she had married the earl she had run into debt and then repudiated her debts she was now residing in the house of a low radical tailor who had assaulted the man she called her husband and she was living under her maiden name tales were told of her which were utterly falseas when it was said that she drank others were reported which had in them some grains of truthas that she was violent stiffnecked and vindictive had they said of her that it had become her one religion to assert her daughters rightper fas aut nefasto assert it by right or wrong to do justice to her child let what injustice might be done to herself or othersthen the truth would have been spoken  the case dragged itself on slowly and little anna murray was a child of nine years old when at last the earl was acquitted of the criminal charge which had been brought against him during all this time he had been absent even had there been a wish to bring him personally into court the law would have been powerless to reach him but there was no such wish it had been found impossible to prove the former marriage which had taken place in sicilyor if not impossible at least no adequate proof was forthcoming there was no real desire that there should be such proof the earls lawyers abstained as far as they could abstain from taking any steps in the matter they spent what money was necessary and the attorneygeneral of the day defended him in doing so the attorneygeneral declared that he had nothing to do with the earls treatment of the lady who now called herself mrs murray he knew nothing of the circumstances of that connection and would not travel beyond his brief he was there to defend earl lovel on a charge of bigamy this he did successfully and the earl was acquitted then in court the counsel for the wife declared that his client would again call herself lady lovel  but it was not so easy to induce other people to call her lady lovel  and now not only was she much hampered by money difficulties but so also was the tailor but thomas thwaite never for a moment slackened in his labours to make good the position of the woman whom he had determined to succour and for another and a longer period of eight years the battle went on it went on very slowly as is the wont with such battles and very little way was made the world as a rule did not believe that she who now again called herself the countess lovel was entitled to that name the murrays her own peopleas far as they were her own peoplehad been taught to doubt her claim if she were a countess why had she thrown herself into the arms of an old tailor why did she let her daughter play with the tailors childif in truth that daughter was the lady anna why above all things was the name of the lady anna allowed to be mentioned as it was mentioned in connection with that of daniel thwaite the tailors son  during these eight weary years lady lovelfor so she shall be calledlived in a small cottage about a mile from keswick on the road to grassmere and ambleside which she rented from quarter to quarter she still obtained a certain amount of alimony which however was dribbled out to her through various sieves and which reached her with protestations as to the impossibility of obtaining anything like the moderate sum which had been awarded to her and it came at last to be the case that she hardly knew what she was struggling to obtain it was of course her object that all the world should acknowledge her to be the countess lovel and her daughter to be the lady anna but all the world could not be made to do this by course of law nor could the law make her lord come home and live with her even such a cat and dog life as must in such case have been hers her money rights were all that she could demandand she found it to be impossible to get anybody to tell her what were her money rights to be kept out of the poorhouse seemed to be all that she could claim but the old tailor was true to herswearing that she should even yet become countess lovel in very truth  then of a sudden she heard one daythat earl lovel was again at the grange living there with a strange woman     chapter ii  the earls will   not a word had been heard in keswick of the proposed return of the old lordfor the earl was now an old manpast his sixtieth year and in truth with as many signs of age as some men bear at eighty the life which he had led no doubt had had its allurements but it is one which hardly admits of a hale and happy evening men who make women a prey prey also on themselves but there he was back at lovel grange and no one knew why he had come nor whence nor how to lovel grange in those days now some forty years ago there was no road for wheels but that which ran through keswick through keswick he had passed in the middle of the night taking on the posthorses which he had brought with him from grassmere so that no one in the town should see him and his companion but it was soon known that he was there and known also that he had a companion for months he resided thus and no one saw him but the domestics who waited upon him but rumours got abroad as to his conduct and people through the county declared that earl lovel was a maniac still his property was in his own control and he did what it listed him to do  as soon as men knew that he was in the land claim after claim was made upon him for money due on behalf of his wife and loudest among the claimants was thomas thwaite the tailor he was loudest and fiercest among the claimants but was loud and fierce not in enmity to his old friend the countess but with a firm resolve to make the lord pay the only price of his wickedness which could be exacted from him and if the earl could be made to pay the claims against him which were made by his wifes creditors then would the law so far have decided that the woman was his wife no answer was made to any letter addressed to the earl and no one calling at the grange could obtain speech or even sight of the noble owner the lords steward at the grange referred all comers to the lords attorneys in london and the lords attorneys simply repeated the allegation that the lady was not the lords wife at last there came tidings that an inquiry was to be made as to the state of the lords health and the state of the lords mind on behalf of frederic lovel the distant heir to the title let that question of the lords marriage with josephine murray go as it might frederic lovel who had never seen his faraway cousin must be the future earl of that there was no doubtand new inquiries were to be made but it might well be that the interest of the young heir would be more deeply involved in the marriage question than in other matters concerning the family lovel grange and the few mountain farms attached to the cumberland estate must become his let the frantic earl do what damage he might to those who bore his name but the bulk of the property the wealth of the lovels the great riches which had enabled this mighty lord to live as a beast of prey among his kind were at his own disposal he had one child certainly the lady anna who would inherit it all were the father to die intestate and were the marriage proved the young heir and those near to him altogether disbelieved the marriageas was natural they had never seen her who now called herself the countess but who for some years after her child was born had called herself mrs murraywho had been discarded by her own relations and had taken herself to live with a country tailor as years had rolled by the memory of what had really occurred in applethwaite church had become indistinct and though the reader knows that that marriage was capable of easy proofthat there would have been but little difficulty had the only difficulty consisted in proving thatthe young heir and the distant lovels were not assured of it their interest was adverse and they were determined to disbelieve but the earl might and probably would leave all his wealth to a stranger he had never in any way noticed his heir he cared for none that bore his name those ties in the world which we call love and deem respectable and regard as happy because they have to do with marriage and blood relationship as established by all laws since the days of moses were odious to him and ridiculous in his sight because all obligations were distasteful to himand all laws except those which preserved to him the use of his own money but now there came up the great question whether he was mad or sane it was at once rumoured that he was about to leave the country and fly back to sicily then it was announced that he was dead  and he was dead he had died at the age of sixtyseven in the arms of the woman he had brought there his evil career was over and his soul had gone to that future life for which he had made it fit by the life he had led here his body was buried in applethwaite churchyard in the further corner of which long straggling valley parish lovel grange is situated at his grave there stood no single mournerbut the young lord was there of his right disdaining even to wear a crape band round his hat but the woman remained shut up in her own chambera difficulty to the young lord and his lawyer who could hardly tell the foreigner to pack and begone before the body of her latelover had been laid in the grave it had been simply intimated to her that on such a datewithin a week from the funeralher presence in the house could not longer be endured she had flashed round upon the lawyer who had attempted to make this award known to her in broken french but had answered simply by some words of scorn spoken in italian to her waitingmaid  then the will was read in the presence of the young earlfor there was a will everything that the late lord had possessed was left in one line to his bestbeloved friend the signorina camilla spondi and it was stated and very fully explained that camilla spondi was the italian lady living at the grange at the date on which the will was made of the old lords heir the now existing earl lovel no mention was made whatever there were however two other clauses or parts in the will there was a schedule giving in detail the particulars of the property left to camilla spondi and there was a rambling statement that the maker of the will acknowledged anna murray to be his illegitimate daughterthat anna murrays mother had never been the testators legitimate wife as his real wife the true countess lovel for whom he had separately made adequate provision was still alive in sicily at the date of that willand that by a former will now destroyed he had made provision for anna murray which provision he had revoked in consequence of the treatment which he had received from josephine murray and her friends they who believed the statements made in this will afterwards asserted that anna had been deprived of her inheritance by the blow with which the tailor had felled the earl to the earth  to camilla spondi intimation was given of the contents of the earls will as far as they concerned her but she was told at the same time that no portion of the dead mans wealth would be placed in her hands till the courts should have decided whether or no the old lord had been sane or insane when he signed the document a sum of money was however given her on condition that she should take her immediate departureand she departed with her personally we need have no further concern of her cause and of her claim some mention must be made but in a few pages she will drop altogether from our story  a copy of the will was also sent to the lawyers who had hitherto taken charge of the interests of the repudiated countess and it was intimated that the allowance hitherto made to her must now of necessity cease if she thought fit to prosecute any further claim she must do so by proving her marriageand it was explained to her probably without much of legal or precise truth in the explanation that such proof must include the disproving of the assertion made in the earls will as it was the intention of the heir to set aside that will such assurance was to say the least of it disingenuous but the whole thing had now become so confused that it could hardly be expected that lawyers should be ingenuous in discussing it  the young earl clearly inherited the title and the small estate at lovel grange the italian woman was primâ facie heiress to everything elseexcept to such portion of the large personal property as the widow could claim as widow in the event of her being able to prove that she had been a wife but in the event of the will being no will the italian woman would have nothing in such case the male heir would have all if the marriage were no marriagebut would have nothing if the marriage could be made good if the marriage could be made good the lady anna would have the entire property except such portion as would be claimed of right by her mother the widow thus the italian woman and the young lord were combined in interest against the mother and daughter as regarded the marriage and the young lord and the mother and daughter were combined against the italian woman as regarded the willbut the young lord had to act alone against the italian woman and against the mother and daughter whom he and his friends regarded as swindlers and impostors it was for him to set aside the will in reference to the italian woman and then to stand the brunt of the assault made upon him by the soidisant wife  in a very short time after the old earls death a double compromise was offered on behalf of the young earl the money at stake was immense would the italian woman take £10000 and go her way back to italy renouncing all further claim and would the soidisant countess abandon her title acknowledge her child to be illegitimate and go her way with another £10000or with £20000 as was soon hinted by the gentlemen acting on the earls behalf the proposition was one somewhat difficult in the making as the compromise if made with both would be excellent but could not be made to any good effect with one only the young earl certainly could not afford to buy off the italian woman for £10000 if the effect of such buying off would only be to place the whole of the late lords wealth in the hands of his daughter and of his daughters mother  the italian woman consented she declared with italian energy that her late loving friend had never been a day insane but she knew nothing of english laws and but little of english money she would take the £10000having had a calculation made for her of the number of lire into which it would run the number was enormous and she would take the offer but when the proposal was mentioned to the countess and explained to her by her old friend thomas thwaite who had now become a poor man in her cause she repudiated it with bitter scornwith a scorn in which she almost included the old man who had made it to her is it for that that i have been fighting she said  for that in part said the old man  no mr thwaite not for that at all but that my girl may have her birth allowed and her name acknowledged  her name shall be allowed and her birth shall be acknowledged said the tailor in whose heart there was nothing base she shall be the lady anna and her mother shall be the countess lovel the estate of the countess if she had an estate then owed the tailor some five or six thousand pounds and the compromise offered would have paid the tailor every shilling and have left a comfortable income for the two women  for myself i care but little said the mother taking the tailors hand in hers and kissing it my child is the lady anna and i do not dare to barter away her rights this took place down at the cottage in cumberland and the tailor at once went up to london to make known the decision of the countessas he invariably called her  then the lawyers went to work as the double compromise could not be effected the single compromise could not stand the italian woman raved and stamped and swore that she must have her half million of lire but of course no right to such a claim had been made good to her and the lawyers on behalf of the young earl went on with their work public sympathy as a matter of course went with the young earl as against the italian woman he had with him every english man and woman it was horrible to the minds of english men and english women that an old english earldom should be starved in order that an italian harlot might revel in untold riches it was felt by most men and protested by all women that any sign of madness be it what it mighthowever insignificantshould be held to be sufficient against such a claimant was not the fact that the man had made such a will in itself sufficient proof of his madness there were not a few who protested that no further proof could be necessary but with us the law is the same for an italian harlot and an english widow and it may well be that in its niceties it shall be found kinder to the former than to the latter but the earl had been mad and the law said that he was mad when he had made his willand the italian woman went away raging into obscurity  the italian woman was conquered and now the battle was open and free between the young earl and the claimant countess applications were made on behalf of the countess for funds from the estate wherewith to prove the claim and to a certain limited amount they were granted such had been the life of the late earl that it was held that the cost of all litigation resulting from his misdeeds should be paid from his estatebut ready money was wanted immediate ready money to be at the disposal of the countess to any amount needed by her agent and this was hardly to be obtained by this time public sympathy ran almost entirely with the earl though it was acknowledged that the late lord was mad and though it had become a cause of rejoicing that the italian woman had been sent away penniless howling into obscurity because of the old mans madness still it was believed that he had written the truth when he declared that the marriage had been a mock marriage it would be better for the english world that the young earl should be a rich man fit to do honour to his position fit to marry the daughter of a duke fit to carry on the glory of the english peerage than that a woman ill reputed in the world should be established as a countess with a daughter dowered with tens of thousands as to whom it was already said that she was in love with a tailors son nothing could be more touching more likely to awaken sympathy than the manner in which josephine murray had been carried away in marriage and then roughly told by the man who should have protected her from every harshly blowing wind of heaven that he had deceived her and that she was not his wife no usage to which woman had ever been subjected as has been said before was more adapted to elicit compassion and energetic aid but nineteen years had now passed by since the deed was done and the facts were forgotten one energetic friend there still wasor we may say two the tailor and his son daniel but public belief ran against the countess and nobody who was anybody in the world would give her her title bets were laid two and three to one against her and it was believed that she was an impostor the earl had all the glory of success over his first opponent and the loud boasting of selfconfident barristers buoyed up his cause  but loudboasting barristers may nevertheless be wise lawyers and the question of a compromise was again mooted if the lady would take thirty thousand pounds and vanish she should have the money clear of deduction and all expenses should be paid the amount offered was thought to be very liberal but it did not amount to the annual income that was at stake it was rejected with scorn had it been quadrupled it would have been rejected with equal scorn the loudboasting barristers were still confident but though it was never admitted in words still it was felt that there might be a doubt what if the contending parties were to join forces if the countessship of the countess were to be admitted and the heiressship of the lady anna and if the earl and the lady anna were to be united in holy wedlock might there not be a safe solution from further difficulty in that way     chapter iii  lady anna   the idea of this further compromise of this something more than compromise of this half acknowledgment of their own weakness came from mr flick of the firm of norton and flick the solicitors who were employed in substantiating the earls position when mr flick mentioned it to sir william patterson the great barrister who was at that time solicitorgeneral and leading counsel on behalf of lord lovel sir william patterson stood aghast and was dismayed sir william intended to make mincemeat of the countess it was said of him that he intended to crossexamine the countess off her legs right out of her claim and almost into her grave he certainly did believe her to be an impostor who had not thought herself to be entitled to her name when she first assumed it  i should be sorry mr flick to be driven to think that anything of that kind could be expedient  it would make sure of the fortune to the family said mr flick  and what about our friend the countess  let her call herself countess lovel sir william that will break no bones as to the formality of her own marriage there can be no doubt about that  we can prove by grogram that she was told that another wife was living said sir william grogram was an old butler who had been in the old earls service for thirty years  i believe we can sir william but it is quite clear that we shall never get the other wife to come over and face an english jury it is of no use blinking it the gentleman whom we have sent over doubts her altogether that there was a marriage is certain but he fears that this woman is not the old countess there were two sisters and it may be that this was the other sister  sir william was a good deal dismayed but he recovered himself the stakes were so high that it was quite possible that the gentleman who had been sent over might have been induced to open his eyes to the possibility of such personation by overtures from the other side sir william was of opinion that mr flick himself should go to sicily he was not sure that he sir william her majestys solicitorgeneral would not make the journey in person he was by no means disposed to give way they tell me that the girl is no better than she should be he said to mr flick  i dont think so bad as that of her said mr flick  is she a ladyor anything like a lady  i am told she is very beautiful  i dare sayand so was her mother before her i never saw a handsomer woman of her age than our friend the countess but i could not recommend the young lord to marry an underbred bad girl and a bastard who claims to be his cousinand support my proposition merely on the ground of her looks  thirtyfive thousand a year sir william pleaded the attorney  i hope we can get the thirtyfive thousand a year for our client without paying so dear for them  it had been presumed that the real countess the original countess the italian lady whom the earl had married in early life would be brought over with properly attested documentary evidence in her pocket to prove that she was the existing countess and that any other countess must be either an impostor or a deluded dupe no doubt the old earl had declared when first informing josephine murray that she was not his wife that his real wife had died during the few months which had intervened since his mock marriage but it was acknowledged on all sides that the old earl had been a villain and a liar it was no part of the duty of the young earl or of those who acted for him to defend the character of the old earl to wash that blackamoor white or even to make him whitybrown was not necessary to anybody no one was now concerned to account for his crooked courses but if it could be shown that he had married the lady in italyas to which there was no doubtand that the lady was still alive or that she had been alive when the second marriage took place then the lady anna could not inherit the property which had been freed from the grasp of the italian mistress but it seemed that the lady if she lived could not be made to come mr flick did go to sicily and came back renewing his advice to sir william that lord lovel should be advised to marry the lady anna  at this time the countess with her daughter had moved their residence from keswick up to london and was living in very humble lodgings in a small street turning out of the new road near the yorkshire stingo old thomas thwaite had accompanied them from cumberland but the rooms had been taken for them by his son daniel thwaite who was at this time foreman to a somewhat celebrated tailor who carried on his business in wigmore street and he daniel thwaite had a bedroom in the house in which the countess lodged the arrangement was not a wise one as reports had already been spread abroad as to the partiality of the lady anna for the young tailor but how should she not have been partial both to the father and to the son feeling as she did that they were the only two men who befriended her cause and her mothers as to the countess herself she perhaps alone of all those who interested themselves in her daughters cause had heard no word of these insinuations against her child to her both thomas and daniel thwaite were dear friends to repay whom for their exertions with lavish generosityshould the means to do so ever come within her reachwas one of the dreams of her existence but she was an ambitious woman thinking much of her rank thinking much even of the blood of her own ancestors constantly urgent with her daughter in teaching her the duties and privileges of wealth and rank for the countess never doubted that she would at last attain success that the lady anna should throw herself away upon daniel thwaite did not occur to her as a possibility she had not even dreamed that daniel thwaite would aspire to her daughters hand and yet every shopboy and every shopgirl in keswick had been so saying for the last twelvemonth and rumours which had hitherto been confined to keswick and its neighbourhood were now common in london for the case was becoming one of the celebrated causes of the age and all the world was talking of the countess and her daughter no momentary suspicion had crossed the mind of the countess till after their arrival in london and then when the suspicion did touch her it was not love that she suspectedbut rather an unbecoming familiarity which she attributed to her childs ignorance of the great life which awaited her my dear she said one day when daniel thwaite had left them you should be less free in your manner with that young man  what do you mean mamma said the daughter blushing  you had better call him mr thwaite  but i have called him daniel ever since i was born  he always calls you lady anna  sometimes he does mamma  i never heard him call you anything else said the countess almost with indignation it is all very well for the old man because he is an old man and has done so much for us  so has danielquite as much mamma they have both done everything  true they have both been warm friends and if ever i forget them may god forget me i trust that we may both live to show them that they are not forgotten but it is not fitting that there should exist between you and him the intimacy of equal positions you are not and cannot be his equal he has been born to be a tailor and you are the daughter and heiress of an earl  these last words were spoken in a tone that was almost awful to the lady anna she had heard so much of her fathers rank and her fathers wealthrank and wealth which were always to be hers but which had never as yet reached her which had been a perpetual trouble to her and a crushing weight upon her young life that she had almost learned to hate the title and the claim of course it was a part of the religion of her life that her mother had been duly married to her father it was beyond a doubt to her that such was the case but the constant battling for denied rights the assumption of a position which could not be attained the use of titles which were simply ridiculous in themselves as connected with the kind of life which she was obliged to leadthese things had all become odious to her she lacked the ambition which gave her mother strength and would gladly have become anna murray or anna lovel with a girls ordinary privilege of loving her lover had such an easy life been possible to her  in person she was very lovely less tall and robust than her mother had been but with a sweeter softer face her hair was less dark and her eyes were neither blue nor bold but they were bright and soft and very eloquent and when laden with tears would have softened the heartalmost of her father she was as yet less powerful than her mother both in body and mind but probably better calculated to make a happy home for a husband and children she was affectionate selfdenying and feminine had that offer of compromise for thirty twenty or for ten thousand pounds been made to her she would have accepted it willinglycaring little for her name little even for fame so that she might have been happy and quiet and at liberty to think of a lover as are other girls in her present condition how could she have any happy love she was the lady anna lovel heir to a ducal fortunebut she lived in small close lodgings in wyndham street new road she did not believe in the good time coming as did her mother their enemy was an undoubted earl undoubtedly owner of lovel grange of which she had heard all her life would it not be better to take what the young lord chose to give them and to be at rest but she did not dare to express such thoughts to her mother her mother would have crushed her with a look  i have told mr thwaite the mother said to her daughter what we were saying this morning  about his son  yesabout his son  oh mamma  i was bound to do so  and what did he say mamma  he did not like it and told me that he did not like itbut he admitted that it was true he admitted that his son was no fitting intimate for lady anna lovel  what should we have done without him  badly indeed but that cannot change his duty or ours he is helping us to struggle for that which is our own but he would mar his generosity if he put a taint on that which he is endeavouring to restore to us  put a taint mamma  yesa taint would rest upon your rank if you as lady anna lovel were familiar with daniel thwaite as with an equal his father understands it and will speak to him  mamma daniel will be very angry  then will he be very unreasonablebut anna i will not have you call him daniel any more     chapter iv  the tailor of keswick   old thomas thwaite was at this time up in london about the business of the countess but had no intention of residing there he still kept his shop in keswick and still made coats and trousers for cumberland statesmen he was by no means in a condition to retire from business having spent the savings of his life in the cause of the countess and her daughter men had told him that had he not struck the earl in the yard of the crown at keswick as horses were being brought out for the lords travelling carriage ample provision would have been made by the rich old sinner for his daughter that might have been so or might not but the saying instigated the tailor to further zeal and increased generosity to oppose an earl even though it might be on behalf of a countess was a joy to him to set wrong right and to put down cruelty and to relieve distressed women was the pride of his heartespecially when his efforts were made in antagonism to one of high rank and he was a man who would certainly be thorough in his work though his thoroughness should be ruinous to himself he had despised the murrays who ought to have stuck to their distant cousin and had exulted in his heart at thinking that the world would say how much better and truer had been the keswick tailor than the wellborn and comparatively wealthy scotch relations and the poets of the lakes who had not as yet become altogether tories had taken him by the hand and praised him the rights of the countess and the wrongs of the countess had become his life but he still kept on a diminished business in the north and it was now needful that he should return to cumberland he had heard that renewed offers of compromise were to be madethough no idea of the proposed marriage between the distant cousins had been suggested to him he had been discussing the question of some compromise with the countess when she spoke to him respecting his son and had recommended that certain terms should if possible be effected let the money be divided on condition that the marriage were allowed there could be no difficulty in this if the young lord would accede to such an arrangement as the marriage must be acknowledged unless an adverse party should bring home proof from italy to the contrary the sufficiency of the ceremony in applethwaite church was incontestable let the money be divided and the countess be countess lovel and lady anna be the lady anna to all the world old thomas thwaite himself had seemed to think that there would be enough of triumph in such a settlement but the woman might afterwards be bribed to come over and renew her claim said the countess unless it be absolutely settled now they will say when i am dead and gone that my daughter has no right to her name then the tailor said that he would make further inquiry how that might be he was inclined to think that there might be a decision which should be absolute even though that decision should be reached by compromise between the now contending parties  then the countess had said her word about daniel thwaite the son and thomas thwaite the father had heard it with illconcealed anger to fight against an earl on behalf of the earls injured wife had been very sweet to him but to be checked in his fight because he and his were unfit to associate with the child of that injured wife was very bitter and yet he had sense to know that what the countess said to him was true as far as words went he admitted the truth but his face was more eloquent than his words and his face showed plainly his displeasure  it is not of you that i am speaking said the countess laying her hand upon the old mans sleeve  daniel is at any rate fitter than i said the tailor he has been educated and i never was  he is as good as gold it is not of that i speak you know what i mean  i know very well what you mean lady lovel  i have no friend like you mr thwaitenone whom i love as i do you and next to you is your son for myself there is nothing that i would not do for him or youno service however menial that i would not render you with my own hands there is no limit to the gratitude which i owe you but my girl is young and if this burden of rank and wealth is to be hersit is proper that she do honour to it  and it is not honourable that she should be seen speakingto a tailor  ahif you choose to take it so  how should i take it what i say is true and what you say is true also i will speak to daniel but she knew well as he left her that his heart was bitter against her  the old man did speak to his son sitting with him up in the bedroom over that which the countess occupied old thomas thwaite was a strong man but his son was in some respects stronger as his father had said of him he had been educatedor rather instructed and instruction leads to the power of thinking he looked deeper into things than did his father and was governed by wider and greater motives his father had been a radical all his life guided thereto probably by some early training and made steadfast in his creed by feelings which induced him to hate the pretensions of an assumed superiority old thwaite could not endure to think that one man should be considered to be worthier than another because he was richer he would admit the riches and even the justice of the richeshaving been himself during much of his life a rich man in his own sphere but would deny the worthiness and would adduce in proof of his creed the unworthiness of certain exalted sinners the career of the earl lovel had been to him a sure proof of the baseness of english aristocracy generally he had dreams of a republic in which a tailor might be president or senator or something almost noble but no rational scheme of governance among mankind had ever entered his mind and of pure politics he knew no more than the journeyman who sat stitching upon his board  but daniel thwaite was a thoughtful man who had read many books mores utopia and harringtons oceana with many a tale written in the same spirit had taught him to believe that a perfect form of government or rather of policy under which all men might be happy and satisfied was practicable upon earth and was to be achievednot merely by the slow amelioration of mankind under gods fostering ordinancesbut by the continued efforts of good and wise men who by their goodness and wisdom should be able to make the multitude believe in them to diminish the distances not only between the rich and the poor but between the high and the low was the grand political theory upon which his mind was always running his father was ever thinking of himself and of earl lovel while daniel thwaite was considering the injustice of the difference between ten thousand aristocrats and thirty million of people who were for the most part ignorant and hungry but it was not that he also had not thoughts of himself gradually he had come to learn that he need not have been a tailors foreman in wigmore street had not his father spent on behalf of the countess lovel the means by which he the son might already have become a master tradesman and yet he had never begrudged it he had been as keen as his father in the cause it had been the romance of his life since his life had been capable of romancebut with him it had been no respect for the rank to which his father was so anxious to restore the countess no value which he attached to the names claimed by the mother and the daughter he hated the countessship of the countess and the ladyship of the lady anna he would fain that they should have abandoned them they were to him odious signs of iniquitous pretensions but he was keen enough to punish and to remedy the wickedness of the wicked earl he reverenced his father because he assaulted the wicked earl and struck him to the ground he was heart and soul in the cause of the injured wife and then the one thing on earth that was really dear to him was the lady anna  it had been the romance of his life they had grown up together as playmates in cumberland he had fought scores of battles on her behalf with those who had denied that she was the lady annaeven though he had then hated the title boys had jeered him because of his noble little sweetheart and he had exulted at hearing her so called his only sister and his mother had died when he was young and there had been none in the house but his father and himself as a boy he had ever been at the cottage of the countess and he had sworn to lady anna a thousand times that he would do and die in her service now he was a strong man and was more devoted to her than ever it was the great romance of his life how could it be brought to pass that the acknowledged daughter of an earl dowered with enormous wealth should become the wife of a tailor and yet such was his ambition and such his purpose it was not that he cared for her dower it was not at any rate the hope of her dower that had induced him to love her his passion had grown and his purpose had been formed before the old earl had returned for the last time to lovel grangewhen nothing was known of the manner in which his wealth might be distributed that her prospect of riches now joined itself to his aspirations it would be an affectation to deny the man who is insensible to the power which money brings with it must be a dolt and daniel thwaite was not a dolt and was fond of power but he was proud of heart and he said to himself over and over again that should it ever come to pass that the possession of the girl was to depend on the abandonment of the wealth the wealth should be abandoned without a further thought  it may be imagined that with such a man the words which his father would speak to him about the lady anna suggesting the respectful distance with which she should be approached by a tailors foreman would be very bitter they were bitter to the speaker and very bitter to him who heard them daniel said the father this is a queer life you are leading with the countess and lady anna just beneath you in the same house  it was a quiet house for them to come toand cheap  quiet enough and as cheap as any i dare saybut i dont know whether it is well that you should be thrown so much with them they are different from us the son looked at his father but made no immediate reply our lot has been cast with theirs because of their difficulties continued the old man but the time is coming when we had better stand aloof  what do you mean father  i mean that we are tailors and these people are born nobles  they have taken our help father  well yes they have but it is not for us to say anything of that it has been given with a heart  certainly with a heart  and shall be given to the end but the end of it will come soon now one will be a countess and the other will be the lady anna are they fit associates for such as you and me  if you ask me father i think they are  they dont think so you may be sure of that  have they said so father  the countess has said so she has complained that you call her daughter simply anna in future you must give her a handle to her name daniel thwaite was a dark brown man with no tinge of ruddiness about him a thin spare man almost swarthy whose hands were as brown as a nut and whose cheeks and forehead were brown but now he blushed up to his eyes the hue of the blood as it rushed to his face forced itself through the darkness of his visage and he blushed as such men do blushwith a look of indignation on his face just call her lady anna said the father  the countess has been complaining of me then  she has hinted that her daughter will be injured by your familiarity and she is right i suppose that the lady anna lovel ought to be treated with deference by a tailoreven though the tailor may have spent his last farthing in her service  do not let us talk about the money father  well no id as lief not think about the money either the world is not ripe yet daniel  nothe world is not ripe  there must be earls and countesses  i see no must in it there are earls and countesses as there used to be mastodons and other senseless overgrown brutes roaming miserable and hungry through the undrained woodscold comfortless unwieldy things which have perished in the general progress the big things have all to give way to the intellect of those which are more finely made  i hope men and women will not give way to bugs and fleas said the tailor who was wont to ridicule his sons philosophy  the son was about to explain his theory of the perfected mean size of intellectual created beings when his heart was at the present moment full of anna lovel father he said i think that the countess might have spared her observations  i thought so toobut as she said it it was best that i should tell you youll have to marry some day and it wouldnt do that you should look there for your sweetheart when the matter was thus brought home to him daniel thwaite would argue it no further it will all come to an end soon continued the old man and it may be that they had better not move till it is settled theyll divide the money and there will be enough for both in all conscience the countess will be the countess and the lady anna will be the lady anna and then there will be no more need of the old tailor from keswick they will go into another world and we shall hear from them perhaps about christmas time with a hamper of game and may be a little wine as a gift  you do not think that of them father  what else can they do the lawyers will pay the money and they will be carried away they cannot come to our house nor can we go to theirs i shall leave tomorrow my boy at six oclock and my advice to you is to trouble them with your presence as little as possible you may be sure that they do not want it  daniel thwaite was certainly not disposed to take his fathers advice but then he knew much more than did his father the above scene took place in the evening when the sons work was done as he crept down on the following morning by the door of the room in which the two ladies slept he could not but think of his fathers words it wouldnt do that you should look there for your sweetheart why should it not do but any such advice as that was now too late he had looked there for his sweetheart he had spoken and the girl had answered him he had held her close to his heart and had pressed her lips to his own and had called her his anna his wellbeloved his pearl his treasure and sheshe had only sighed in his arms and yielded to his embrace she had wept alone when she thought of it with a conscious feeling that as she was the lady anna there could be no happy love between herself and the only youth whom she had known but when he had spoken and had clasped her to his heart she had never dreamed of rebuking him she had known nothing better than he and desired nothing better than to live with him and to be loved by him she did not think that it could be possible to know any one better this weary weary title filled her with dismay daniel as he walked along thinking of her embrace thinking of those kisses and thinking also of his fathers caution swore to himself that the difficulties in his way should never stop him in his course     chapter v  the solicitorgeneral makes a proposition   when mr flick returned from sicily he was very strongly in favour of some compromise he had seen the socalled italian countesswho certainly was now called contessa by everybody around herand he did not believe that she had ever been married to the old earl that an italian lady had been married to the old lord now twentyfive years ago he did believeprobably the younger sister of this womanand he also believed that this wife had been dead before the marriage at applethwaite that was his private opinion mr flick was in his way an honest manone who certainly would have taken no conscious part in getting up an unjust claim but he was now acting as legal agent for the young earl and it was not his business to get up evidence for the earls opponents he did think that were he to use all his ingenuity and the funds at his disposal he would be able to reach the real truth in such a manner that it should be made clear and indubitable to an english jury but if the real truth were adverse to his side why search for it he understood that the english countess would stand her ground on the legality of the applethwaite marriage and on the acquittal of the old earl as to the charge of bigamy the english countess being firm so far as that ground would make her firm it would in reality be for the other sidefor the young earlto prove a former marriage the burden of the proof would be with him and not with the english countess to disprove it disingenuous lawyersmr flick who though fairly honest could be disingenuous among the numberhad declared the contrary but such was the case and as money was scarce with the countess and her friends no attempt had been made on their part to bring home evidence from sicily all this mr flick knew and doubted how far it might be wise for him further to disturb that sicilian romance the italian countess who was a hideous wornout old woman professing to be fortyfour probably fiftyfive and looking as though she were seventyseven would not stir a step towards england she would swear and had sworn any number of oaths documentary evidence from herself from various priests from servants and from neighbours there was in plenty mr flick learned through his interpreter that a certain old priest ridiculed the idea of there being a doubt and there were lettersletters alleged to have been written by the earl to the living wife in the old days which were shown to mr flick mr flick was an educated man and knew many things he knew something of the manufacture of paper and would not look at the letters after the first touch it was not for him to get up evidence for the other side the hideous old woman was clamorous for money the priests were clamorous for money the neighbours were clamorous for money had not they all sworn anything that was wanted and were they not to be paid some moderate payment was made to the hideous screeching greedy old woman some trivial paymentas to which mr flick was heartily ashamed of himselfwas made to the old priest and then mr flick hurried home fully convinced that a compromise should be made as to the money and that the legality of the titles claimed by the two english ladies should be allowed it might be that that hideous hag had once been the countess lovel it certainly was the case that the old earl in latter years had so called her though he had never once seen her during his last residence in sicily it might be that the clumsy fiction of the letters had been perpetrated with the view of bolstering up a true case with false evidence but mr flick thought that there should be a compromise and expressed his opinion very plainly to sir william patterson you mean a marriage said the solicitorgeneral at this time mr hardy qc the second counsel acting on behalf of the earl was also present  not necessarily by a marriage sir william they could divide the money  the girl is not of age said mr hardy  she is barely twenty as yet said sir william  i think it might be managed on her behalf said the attorney  who could be empowered to sacrifice her rights said mr hardy who was a gruff man  we might perhaps contrive to tide it over till she is of age said the solicitorgeneral who was a sweetmannered mild man among his friends though he could crossexamine a witness off his legsor hers if the necessity of the case required him to do so  of course we could do that sir william what is a year in such a case as this  not much among lawyers is it mr flick you think that we shouldnt bring our case into court  it is a good case sir william no doubt theres the womancountess we will call herready to swear and has sworn that she was the old earls wife all the people round call her the countess the earl undoubtedly used to speak of her as the countess and send her little dribbles of money as being his countess during the ten years and more after he left lovel grange there is the old priest who married them  the devils in it if that is not a good case said mr hardy  go on mr flick said the solicitorgeneral  ive got all the documentary evidence of course sir william  go on mr flick  mr flick scratched his head its a very heavy interest sir william  no doubt it is go on  i dont know that ive anything further to say except that id arrange it if i could our client sir william would be in a very pretty position if he got half the income which is at stake  or the whole with the wife said the solicitorgeneral  or the whole with the wife sir william if he were to lose it all hed beso to say nowhere  nowhere at all said the solicitorgeneral the entailed property isnt worth above a thousand a year  id make some arrangement said mr flick whose mind may perhaps have had a not unnatural bend towards his own very large venture in this concern that his bill including the honorarium of the barristers would sooner or later be paid out of the estate he did not doubtbut a compromise would make the settlement easy and pleasant  mr hardy was in favour of continued fighting a keener honester more enlightened lawyer than mr hardy did not wear silk at that moment but he had not the gift of seeing through darkness which belonged to the solicitorgeneral when mr flick told them of the strength of their case as based on various heads of evidence in their favour mr hardy believed mr flicks words and rejected mr flicks opinion he believed in his heart that the english countess was an impostor not herself believing in her own claim and it would be gall and wormwood to him to give to such a one a moiety of the wealth which should go to support the ancient dignity and aristocratic grace of the house of lovel he hated compromise and desired justiceand was a great rather than a successful lawyer sir william had at once perceived that there was something in the background on which it was his duty to calculate which he was bound to considerbut with which at the same time it was inexpedient that he should form a closer or more accurate acquaintance he must do the best he could for his client earl lovel with a thousand a year and that probably already embarrassed would be a poor wretched creature a mock lord an earl without the very essence of an earldom but earl lovel with fifteen or twenty thousand a year would be as good as most other earls it would be but the difference between two powdered footmen and four between four hunters and eight between belgrave square and eaton place sir william had he felt confident would of course have preferred the four footmen for his client and the eight hunters and belgrave square even though the poor english countess should have starved or been fed by the tailors bounty but he was not confident he began to think that that wicked old earl had been too wicked for them all they say shes a very nice girl said sir william  very handsome indeed im told said mr flick  and in love with the son of the old tailor from keswick said mr hardy  shell prefer the lord to the tailor for a guinea said sir william  and thus it was decided after some indecisive fashion that their client should be sounded as to the expedience of a compromise it was certain to them that the poor woman would be glad to accept for herself and her daughter half of the wealth at stake which half would be to her almost unlimited riches on the condition that their rank was secured to themtheir rank and all the privileges of honest legitimacy but as to such an arrangement the necessary delay offered no doubt a serious impediment and it was considered that the wisest course would be to propose the marriage but who should propose it and how should it be proposed sir william was quite willing to make the suggestion to the young lord or the young lords family whose consent must of course be first obtained but who should then break the ice to the countess i suppose we must ask our friend the serjeant said mr flick serjeant bluestone was the leading counsel for our countess and was vehemently energetic in this case he swore everywhere that the solicitorgeneral hadnt a leg to stand upon and that the solicitorgeneral knew that he hadnt a leg let them bring that italian countess over if they dared hed countess her and discountess her too since he had first known the english courts of law there had been no case hard as this was hard had not the old earl been acquitted of the charge of bigamy when the unfortunate woman had done her best to free herself from her position serjeant bluestone who was a very violent man taking up all his cases as though the very holding of a brief opposite to him was an insult to himself had never before been so violent the serjeant will take it as a surrender said mr flick  we must get round the serjeant said sir william there are ladies in the lovel family we must manage it through them and so it was arranged by the young lords lawyers that an attempt should be made to marry him to the heiress  the two cousins had never seen each other lady anna had hardly heard of frederic lovel before her fathers death but since that had been brought up to regard the young lord as her natural enemy the young lord had been taught from his youth upwards to look upon the soidisant countess and her daughter as impostors who would some day strive to rob him of his birthrightand in these latter days as impostors who were hard at work upon their project and he had been told of the intimacy between the countess and the old tailorand also of that between the socalled lady anna and the young tailor to these distant lovelsto frederic lovel who had been brought up with the knowledge that he must be the earl and to his uncle and aunt by whom he had been brought upthe women down at keswick had been represented as vulgar odious and disreputable we all know how firm can be the faith of a family in such matters the lovels were not without fear as to the result of the attempt that was being made they understood quite as well as did mr flick the glory of the position which would attend upon success and the wretchedness attendant upon a pauper earldom they were nervous enough and in some moods frightened but their trust in the justice of their cause was unbounded the old earl whose memory was horrible to them had purposely left two enemies in their way there had been the italian mistress backed up by the will and there had been this illegitimate child the one was vanquished but the other ahit would be bad with them indeed if that enemy could not be vanquished too they had offered £30000 to the enemy but the enemy would not accept the bribe the idea of ending all their troubles by a marriage had never occurred to them had mrs lovel been asked about it she would have said that anna murrayas she always studiously called the lady anna was not fit to be married  the young lord who a few months after his cousins death had been old enough to take his seat in the house of peers was a gayhearted kindly young man who had been brought home from sea at the age of twenty on the death of an elder brother some of the family had wished that he should go on with his profession in spite of the earldom but it had been thought unfit that he should be an earl and a midshipman at the same time and his cousins death while he was still on shore settled the question he was a fairhaired wellmade young lad looking like a sailor and every inch a gentleman had he believed that the lady anna was the lady anna no earthly consideration would have induced him to meddle with the money since the old lords death he had lived chiefly with his uncle charles lovel having passed some two or three months at lovel grange with his uncle and aunt charles lovel was a clergyman with a good living at yoxham in yorkshire who had married a rich wife a woman with some two thousand a year of her own and was therefore well to do in the world his two sons were at harrow and he had one other child a daughter with them also lived a miss lovel aunt juliawho was supposed of all the lovels to be the wisest and most strongminded the parson though a popular man was not strongminded he was passionate loud generous affectionate and indiscreet he was very proud of his nephews position as head of the familyand very full of his nephews wrongs arising from the fraud of those murray women he was a violent tory and had heard much of the keswick radical he never doubted for a moment that both old thwaite and young thwaite were busy in concocting an enormous scheme of plunder by which to enrich themselves to hear that they had both been convicted and transported was the hope of his life that a radical should not be worthy of transportation was to him impossible that a radical should be honest was to him incredible but he was a thoroughly humane and charitable man whose good qualities were as little intelligible to old thomas thwaite as were those of thomas thwaite to him  to whom should the solicitorgeneral first break the matter he had already had some intercourse with the lovels and had not been impressed with a sense of the parsons wisdom he was a whig solicitorgeneral for there were still whigs in those days and mr lovel had not much liked him mr flick had seen much of the familyhaving had many interviews with the young lord with the parson and with aunt julia it was at last settled by sir williams advice that a letter should be written to aunt julia by mr flick suggesting that she should come up to town  mr lovel will be very angry said mr flick  we must do the best we can for our client said sir william the letter was written and miss lovel was informed in mr flicks most discreet style that as sir william patterson was anxious to discuss a matter concerning lord lovels case in which a womans voice would probably be of more service than that of a man perhaps miss lovel would not object to the trouble of a journey to london miss lovel did come up and her brother came with her  the interview took place in sir williams chambers and no one was present but sir william miss lovel and mr flick mr flick had been instructed to sit still and say nothing unless he were asked a question and he obeyed his instructions after some apologies which were perhaps too soft and sweetand which were by no means needed as miss lovel herself though very wise was neither soft nor sweetthe great man thus opened his case this is a very serious matter miss lovel  very serious indeed  you can hardly perhaps conceive how great a load of responsibility lies upon a lawyers shoulders when he has to give advice in such a case as this when perhaps the prosperity of a whole family may turn upon his words  he can only do his best  ah yes miss lovel that is easy to say but how shall he know what is the best  i suppose the truth will prevail at last it is impossible to think that a young man such as my nephew should be swindled out of a noble fortune by the intrigues of two such women as these i cant believe it and i wont believe it of course i am only a woman but i always thought it wrong to offer them even a shilling sir william smiled and rubbed his head fixing his eyes on those of the lady though he smiled she could see that there was real sadness in his face you dont mean to say you doubt she said  indeed i do  you think that a wicked scheme like this can succeed before an english judge  but if the scheme be not wicked let me tell you one or two things miss lovelor rather my own private opinion on one or two points i do not believe that these two ladies are swindlers  they are not ladies and i feel sure that they are swindlers said miss lovel very firmly turning her face as she spoke to the attorney  i am telling you of course merely my own opinion and i will beg you to believe of me that in forming it i have used all the experience and all the caution which a long course of practice in these matters has taught me your nephew is entitled to my best services and at the present moment i can perhaps do my duty to him most thoroughly by asking you to listen to me the lady closed her lips together and sat silent whether mrs murray as we have hitherto called her was or was not the legal wife of the late earl i will not just now express an opinion but i am sure that she thinks that she was the marriage was formal and accurate the earl was tried for bigamy and acquitted the people with whom we have to do across the water in sicily are not respectable they cannot be induced to come here to give evidence an english jury will be naturally averse to them the question is one simply of facts for a jury and we cannot go beyond a jury had the daughter been a son it would have been in the house of lords to decide which young man should be the peerbut as it is it is simply a question of property and of facts as to the ownership of the property should we lose the case your nephew would bea very poor man  a very poor man indeed sir william  his position would be distressing i am bound to say that we should go into court to try the case with very great distrust mr flick quite agrees with me  quite so sir william said mr flick  miss lovel again looked at the attorney closed her lips tighter than ever but did not say a word  in such cases as this prejudices will arise miss lovel it is natural that you and your family should be prejudiced against these ladies for myself i am not aware that anything true can be alleged against them  the girl has disgraced herself with a tailors son almost screamed miss lovel  you have been told so but i do not believe it to be true they were no doubt brought up as children together and mr thwaite has been most kind to both the ladies it at once occurred to miss lovel that sir william was a whig and that there was in truth but little difference between a whig and a radical to be at heart a gentleman or at heart a lady it was to her thinking necessary to be a tory it would be a thousand pities that so noble a property should pass out of a family which by its very splendour and ancient nobility is placed in need of ample means on hearing this sentiment which might have become even a tory miss lovel relaxed somewhat the muscles of her face were the earl to marry his cousin  she is not his cousin  were the earl to marry the young lady who it may be will be proved to be his cousin the whole difficulty would be cleared away  marry her  i am told that she is very lovely and that pains have been taken with her education her mother was well born and well bred if you would get at the truth miss lovel you must teach yourself to believe that they are not swindlers they are no more swindlers than i am a swindler i will go furtherthough perhaps you and the young earl and mr flick may think me unfit to be intrusted any longer with this case after such a declarationi believe though it is with a doubting belief that the elder lady is the countess lovel and that her daughter is the legitimate child and the heir of the late earl  mr flick sat with his mouth open as he heard thisbeating his breast almost with despair his opinion tallied exactly with sir williams indeed it was by his opinion hardly expressed but perfectly understood that sir william had been led but he had not thought that sir william would be so bold and candid  you believe that anna murray is the real heir gasped miss lovel  i dowith a doubting belief i am inclined that wayhaving to form my opinion on very conflicting evidence mr flick was by this time quite sure that sir william was right in his opinionthough perhaps wrong in declaring ithaving been corroborated in his own belief by the reflex of it on a mind more powerful than his own thinking as i do continued sir williamwith a natural bias towards my own clientwhat will a jury think who will have no such bias if they are cousinsdistant cousinswhy should they not marry and be happy one bringing the title and the other the wealth there could be no more rational union miss lovel  then there was a long pause before any one spoke a word mr flick had been forbidden to speak and sir william having made his proposition was determined to await the ladys reply the lady was aghast and for awhile could neither think nor utter a word at last she opened her mouth i must speak to my brother about this  quite right miss lovel  now i may go sir william  good morning miss lovel and miss lovel went  you have gone farther than i thought you would sir william said mr flick  i hardly went far enough mr flick we must go farther yet if we mean to save any part of the property for the young man what should we gain even if we succeeded in proving that the earl was married in early life to the old sicilian hag that still lives she would inherit the property thennot the earl     chapter vi  yoxham rectory   miss lovel wise and strongminded as she was did not dare to come to any decision on the proposition made to her without consulting some one strong as she was she found herself at once to be too weak to speak to her nephew on the subject of her late interview with the great lawyer without asking her brothers opinion the parson had accompanied her up to london in a state of wrath against sir william in that he had not been sent for instead of his sister and to him she told all that had been said her brother was away at his club when she got back to her hotel and she had some hours in which to think of what had taken place she could not at once bring herself to believe that all her former beliefs were vain and ill founded  but if the opinion of the solicitorgeneral had not prevailed with her it prevailed still less when it reached her brother secondhand she had been shaken but mr lovel at first was not shaken at all sir william was a whig and a traitor he had never known a whig who was not a traitor sir william was throwing them over the murray people who were all whigs had got hold of him he mr lovel would go at once to mr hardy and tell mr hardy what he thought the case should be immediately taken out of the hands of messrs norton and flick did not all the world know that these impostors were impostors sir william should be exposed and degradedthough in regard to this threatened degradation mr lovel was almost of opinion that his party would like their solicitorgeneral better for having shown himself to be a traitor and therefore proved himself to be a good whig he stormed and flew about the room using language which hardly became his cloth if his nephew married the girl he would never own his nephew again if that swindle was to prevail let his nephew be poor and honest he would give half of all he had towards supporting the peerage and was sure that his boys would thank him for what he had done but they should never call that woman cousin and as for himself might his tongue be blistered if ever he spoke of either of those women as countess lovel he was inclined to think that the whole case should immediately be taken out of the hands of norton and flick without further notice and another solicitor employed but at last he consented to call on mr norton on the following morning  mr norton was a heavy honest old man who attended to simple conveyancing and sat amidst the tin boxes of his broadacred clients he had no alternative but to send for mr flick and mr flick came when mr lovel showed his anger mr flick became somewhat indignant mr flick knew how to assert himself and mr lovel was not quite the same man in the lawyers chambers that he had been in his own parlour at the hotel mr flick was of opinion that no better counsel was to be had in england than the solicitorgeneral and no opinion more worthy of trust than his if the earl chose to put his case into other hands of course he could do so but it would behove his lordship to be very careful lest he should prejudice most important interests by showing his own weakness to his opponents mr flick spoke in the interests of his clientso he saidand not in his own mr flick was clearly of opinion that a compromise should be arranged and having given that opinion could say nothing more on the present occasion on the next day the young earl saw mr flick and also saw sir william and was then told by his aunt of the proposition which had been made the parson retired to yoxham and miss lovel remained in london with her nephew by the end of the week miss lovel was brought round to think that some compromise was expedient all this took place in may the cause had been fixed for trial in the following november the long interval having been allowed because of the difficulty expected in producing the evidence necessary for rebutting the claims of the late earls daughter  by the middle of june all the lovels were again in londonthe parson his sister the parsons wife and the earl i never saw the young woman in my life said the earl to his aunt  as for that said his aunt no doubt you could see her if you thought it wise to do so  i suppose she might be asked to the rectory said mrs lovel  that would be giving up altogether said the rector  sir william said that it would not be against us at all said aunt julia  you would have to call her lady anna said mrs lovel  i couldnt do it said the rector it would be much better to give her half  but why should she take the half if the whole belongs to her said the young lord and why should i ask even for the half if nothing belongs to me at this time the young lord had become almost despondent as to his alleged rights and now and again had made everybody belonging to him miserable by talking of withdrawing from his claim he had come to understand that sir william believed that the daughter was the real heir and he thought that sir william must know better than others he was downhearted and low in spirits but not the less determined to be just in all that he did  i have made inquiry said aunt julia and i do believe that the stories which we heard against the girl were untrue  the tailor and his son have been their most intimate friends said mr lovel  because they had none others said mrs lovel  it had been settled that by the 24th of june the lord was to say whether he would or would not take sir williams advice if he would do so sir william was to suggest what step should next be taken as to making the necessary overtures to the two ladies if he would not then sir william was to advise how best the case might be carried on they were all again at yoxham that day and the necessary communication was to be made to mr flick by post the young man had been alone the whole morning thinking of his condition and undoubtedly the desire for the money had grown on him strongly why should it not have done so is there a nobleman in great britain who can say that he could lose the fortune which he possesses or the fortune which he expects without an agony that would almost break his heart young lord lovel sighed for the wealth without which his title would only be to him a terrible burden and yet he was resolved that he would take no part in anything that was unjust this girl he heard was beautiful and soft and pleasant and now they told him that the evil things which had been reported against her had been slanders he was assured that she was neither coarse nor vulgar nor unmaidenly two or three old men of equal rank with his ownmen who had been his fathers friends and were allied to the lovels and had been taken into confidence by sir williamtold him that the proper way out of the difficulty had been suggested to him there could be nothing they said more fitting than that two cousins so situated should marry with such an acknowledgment of her rank and birth everybody would visit his wife there was not a countess or a duchess in london who would not be willing to take her by the hand his two aunts had gradually given way and it was clear to him that his uncle would give wayeven his uncleif he would but yield himself it was explained to him that if the girl came to yoxham with the privilege of being called lady anna by the inhabitants of the rectory she would of course do so on the understanding that she should accept her cousins hand but she might not like me said the young earl to his aunt  not like you said mrs lovel putting her hand up to his brow and pushing away his hair was it possible that any girl should not like such a man as that and he an earl  and if i did not like her aunt lovel  then i would not ask her to be my wife he thought that there was an injustice in this and yet before the day was over he had assented  i do not think that i can call her lady anna said the rector i dont think i can bring my tongue to do it     chapter vii  the solicitorgeneral perseveres   there was considerable difficulty in making the overture to the two ladiesor rather in making it to the elder lady for the suggestion if made to the daughter must of course come to her from her mother it had been decided at last that the lady anna could not be invited to the rectory till it had been positively settled that she should be the lady anna without further opposition and that all opposition to the claim should be withdrawn at any rate till it was found that the young people were not inclined to be engaged to each other how can i call her lady anna before i have made up my mind to think that she is lady anna said the parson almost in tears as to the rest of the family it may be said that they had come silently to think that the countess was the countess and that the lady anna was the lady annasilently in reference to each other for not one of them except the young lord had positively owned to such a conviction sir william patterson had been too strong for them it was true that he was a whig it was possible that he was a traitor but he was a man of might and his opinion had domineered over theirs to make things as straight as they could be made it would be well that the young people should be married what would be the earldom of lovel without the wealth which the old mad earl had amassed  sir william and mr flick were strongly in favour of the marriage and mr hardy at last assented the worst of it was that something of all this doubt on the part of the earl and his friends was sure to reach the opposite party they are shaking in their shoes serjeant bluestone said to his junior counsel mr mainsail i do believe they are not going to fight at all he said to mr goffe the attorney for the countess mr mainsail rubbed his hands mr goffe shook his head mr goffe was sure that they would fight mr mainsail who had worked like a horse in getting up and arranging all the evidence on behalf of the countess and in sifting as best he might the italian documents was delighted all this sir william feared and he felt that it was quite possible that the earls overture might be rejected because the earl would not be thought to be worth having we must count upon his coronet said sir william to mr flick she could not do better even if the property were undoubtedly her own  but how was the first suggestion to be made mr hardy was anxious that everything should be straightforwardand sir william assented with a certain inward peevishness at mr hardys stiffnecked propriety sir william was anxious to settle the thing comfortably for all parties mr hardy was determined not only that right should be done but also that it should be done in a righteous manner the great question now was whether they could approach the widow and her daughter otherwise than through serjeant bluestone the serjeant is such a blunderbuss said the solicitorgeneral but the serjeant was counsel for these ladies and it was at last settled that there should be a general conference at sir williams chambers a very short note was written by mr flick to mr goffe stating that the solicitorgeneral thought that a meeting might be for the advantage of all partiesand the meeting was arranged there were present the two barristers and the one attorney for each side and many an anxious thought was given to the manner in which the meeting should be conducted serjeant bluestone was fully resolved that he would hold his own against the solicitorgeneral and would speak his mind freely mr mainsail got up little telling questions mr goffe and mr flick both felt that it would behove them to hold their peace unless questioned but were equally determined to hang fast by their clients mr hardy in his heart of hearts thought that his learned friend was about to fling away his case sir william had quite made up his mind as to his line of action he seated them all most courteously giving them place according to their ranka great armchair for serjeant bluestone from which the serjeant would hardly be able to use his arms with his accustomed energyand then he began at once gentlemen said he it would be a great pity that this property should be wasted  no fear of that mr solicitor said the serjeant  it would be a great pity that this property should be wasted repeated sir william bowing to the serjeant and i am disposed to think that the best thing the two young people can do is to marry each other then he paused and the three gentlemen opposite sat erect the barristers as speechless as the attorneys but the solicitorgeneral had nothing to add he had made his proposition and was desirous of seeing what effect it might have before he spoke another word  then you acknowledge the countesss marriage of course said the serjeant  pardon me serjeant we acknowledge nothing as a matter of course she is the countess till it be proved that another wife was living when she was married  quite as a matter of course said the serjeant  quite as a matter of course if that will make the case stronger continued sir william her marriage was formal and regular that she believed her marriage to be a righteous marriage before god i have never doubted god forbid that i should have a harsh thought against a poor lady who has suffered so much cruel treatment  why have things been said then asked the serjeant beginning to throw about his left arm  if i am not mistaken said mr mainsail evidence has been prepared to show that the countess is a party to a contemplated fraud  then you are mistaken mr mainsail said sir william i admit at once and clearly that the lady is not suspected of any fraud whether she be actually the countess lovel or not it mayi fear it musttake years to prove if the law be allowed to take its course  we think that we can dispose of any counterclaim in much less time than that said the serjeant  it may be so i myself think that it would not be so our evidence in favour of the lady who is now living some two leagues out of palermo is very strong she is a poor creature old ignorantfairly well off through the bounty of the late earl but always craving for some trifle moreunwilling to come to this countrychildless and altogether indifferent to the second marriage except in so far as might interfere with her hopes of getting some further subsidy from the lovel family one is not very anxious on her behalf one is only anxiouscan only be anxiousthat the vast property at stake should not get into improper hands  and that justice should be done said mr hardy  and that justice should be done of course as my friend observes here is a young man who is undoubtedly earl of lovel and who claims a property as heir to the late earl and here is a young lady i am told very beautiful and highly educated who is the daughter of the late earl and who claims that property believing herself to be his legitimate heiress the question between them is most intricate  the onus probandi lies with you mr solicitor said the serjeant  we acknowledge that it does but the case on that account is none the less intricate with the view of avoiding litigation and expense and in the certainty that by such an arrangement the enjoyment of the property will fall to the right owner we propose that steps shall be taken to bring these two young people together the lady whom for the occasion i am quite willing to call the countess the mother of the lady whom i hope the young earl will make his own countess has not been sounded on this subject  i should hope not said the serjeant  my excellent friend takes me up a little short said sir william laughing you gentlemen will probably consult together on the subject and whatever may be the advice which you shall consider it to be your duty to give to the motherand i am sure that you will feel bound to let her know the proposition that has been made i do not hesitate to say that we have a right to expect that it shall be made known to heri need hardly remark that were the young lady to accept the young lords hand we should all be in a boat together in reference to the mothers rank and to the widows claim upon the personal property left behind him by her late husband  and so the solicitorgeneral had made his proposition and the conference was broken up with a promise that mr flick should hear from mr goffe upon the subject but the serjeant had at once made up his mind against the compromise now proposed he desired the danger and the dust and the glory of the battle he was true to his clients interests no doubtintended to be intensely true but the personal doggish love of fighting prevailed in the man and he was clear as to the necessity of going on they know they are beat he said to mr goffe mr solicitor knows as well as i do that he has not an inch of ground under his feet therefore mr goffe wrote the following letter to messrs norton and flick      raymonds buildings grays inn    1st july 183     dear sirs     in reference to the interview which took place at the    chambers of the solicitorgeneral on the 27th ult we    are to inform you that we are not disposed as acting for    our clients the countess of lovel and her daughter the    lady anna lovel to listen to the proposition then made    apart from the very strong feeling we entertain as to the    certainty of our clients successwhich certainly was    not weakened by what we heard on that occasionwe are    of opinion that we could not interfere with propriety in    suggesting the marriage of two young persons who have not    as yet had any opportunity of becoming acquainted with    each other should the earl of lovel seek the hand of    his cousin the lady anna lovel and marry her with the    consent of the countess we should be delighted at such    a family arrangement but we do not think that we as    lawyersor if we may be allowed to say so that you as    lawyershave anything to do with such a matter     we are dear sirs    yours very faithfully     goffe and goffe     messrs norton and flick   balderdash said sir william when he had read the letter we are not going to be done in that way it was all very well going to that serjeant as he has the case in hand though a worse messenger in an affair of love  not love as yet mr solicitor said mr flick  i mean it to be love and im not going to be put off by serjeant bluestone we must get to the lady by some other means do you write to that tailor down at keswick and say that you want to see him  will that be regular sir william  ill stand the racket mr flick mr flick did write to thomas thwaite and thomas thwaite came up to london and called at mr flicks chambers  when thomas thwaite received his commission he was much rejoiced injustice would be done him unless so much were owned on his behalf but nevertheless some feeling of disappointment which he could not analyze crept across his heart if once the girl were married to earl lovel there would be an end of his services and of his sons he had never really entertained an idea that his son would marry the girl as the reader will perhaps remember he had warned his son that he must seek a sweetheart elsewhere he had told himself over and over again that when the countess came to her own there must be an end of this intimacythat there could be nothing in common between him the radical tailor of keswick and a really established countess the countess while not yet really established had already begged that his son might be instructed not to call her daughter simply by her christian name old thwaite on receiving this intimation of the difference of their positions though he had acknowledged its truth had felt himself bitterly aggrieved and now the moment had come of course the countess would grasp at such an offer of course it would give her all that she had desired and much more than she expected in adjusting his feelings on the occasion the tailor thought but little of the girl herself why should she not be satisfied of the young earl he had only heard that he was a handsome modest gallant lad who only wanted a fortune to make him one of the most popular of the golden youth of england why should not the girl rejoice at the prospect of winning such a husband to have a husband must necessarily be in her heart whether she were the lady anna lovel or plain anna murray and what espousals could be so auspicious as these feeling all this without much of calculation the tailor said that he would do as he was bidden we have sent for you because we know that you have been so old a friend said mr flick who did not quite approve of the emissary whom he had been instructed by sir william to employ  i will do my best sir said mr thwaite making his bow thomas thwaite as he went along the streets alone determined that he would perform this new duty imposed upon him without any reference to his son     chapter viii  impossible   they sent for me lady lovel to bid me come to your ladyship and ask your ladyship whether you would consent to a marriage between the two young people it was thus that the tailor repeated for the second time the message which had been confided to him showing the gall and also the pride which were at work about his heart by the repeated titles which he gave to his old friend  they desire that anna should marry the young lord  yes my lady thats the meaning of it  and what am i to be  just the countess lovelwith a third of the property as your own i suppose it would be a third but you might trust the lawyers to settle that properly when once they take your daughter among them they wont scrimp you in your honours theyll all swear that the marriage was good enough then they know that already and have made this offer because they know it your ladyship neednt fear now but what all the world will own you as the countess lovel i dont suppose ill be troubled to come up to london any more  oh my friend the ejaculation she made feeling the necessity of saying something to soothe the tailors pride but her heart was fixed upon the fruition of that for which she had spent so many years in struggling was it to come to her at last could it be that now now at once people throughout the world would call her the countess lovel and would own her daughter to be the lady annatill she also should become a countess of the young man she had heard nothing but good and it was impossible that she should have fear in that direction even had she been timorous by nature but she was bold and eager hopeful in spite of all that she had suffered full of ambition and not prone to feminine scruples she had been fighting all her life in order that she and her daughter might be acknowledged to be among the aristocrats of her country she was so far a loving devoted mother that in all her battles she thought more of her child than of herself she would have consented to carry on the battle in poverty to the last gasp of her own breath could she thereby have insured success for her surviving daughter but she was not a woman likely to be dismayed at the idea of giving her girl in marriage to an absolute stranger when that stranger was such a one as the young earl lovel she herself had been a countess but a wretched unacknowledged povertystricken countess for the last half of her eventful life this marriage would make her daughter a countess prosperous accepted by all and very wealthy what better end could there be to her long struggles of course she would assent  i dont know why they should have troubled themselves to send for me said the tailor  because you are the best friend that i have in the world whom else could i have trusted as i do you has the earl agreed to it  they didnt tell me that my lady  they would hardly have sent unless he had agreed dont you think so mr thwaite  i dont know much about such things my lady  you have tolddaniel  no my lady  oh mr thwaite do not talk to me in that way it sounds as though you were deserting me  therell be no reason for not deserting now youll have friends by the score more fit to see you through this than old thomas thwaite and to own the truth now that the matter is coming to an end i am getting weary of it im not so young as i was and id be better left at home to my business  i hope that you may disregard your business now without imprudence mr thwaite  no my ladya man should always stick to his business i hope that daniel will do so better than his father before himso that his son may never have to go out to be servant to another man  you are speaking daggers to me  i have not meant it then i am rough by nature i know and perhaps a little low just at present there is something sad in the parting of old friends  old friends neednt be parted mr thwaite  when your ladyship was good enough to point out to me my boys improper manner of speech to lady anna i knew how it must be you were quite right my lady there can be no becoming friendship between the future lady lovel and a journeyman tailor i was wrong from the beginning  oh mr thwaite without such wrong where should we have been  there can be no holding ground of friendship between such as you and such as we lords and ladies earls and countesses are our enemies and we are theirs we may make their robes and take their money and deal with them as the jew dealt with the christians in the play but we cannot eat with them or drink with them  how often have i eaten and drank at your table when no other table was spread for me  you were a jew almost as ourselves then we cannot now well stand shoulder to shoulder and arm to arm as friends should do  how often has my child lain in your arms when she was a baby and been quieter there than she would be even in her mothers  that has all gone by other arms will be open to receive her as the tailor said this he remembered how his boy used to take the little child out to the mountain side and how the two would ramble away together through the long summer evenings and he reflected that the memory of those days was no doubt still strong in the heart of his son some shadow of the grief which would surely fall upon the young man now fell upon the father and caused him almost to repent of the work of his life tailors should consort with tailors he said and lords and ladies should consort together  something of the same feeling struck the countess also if it were not for the son the father after all that he had done for them might be almost as near and as dear to them as ever he might have called the lady anna by her christian name at any rate till she had been carried away as a bride by the earl but though all this was so exquisitely painful it had been absolutely necessary to check the son ah well she said it is hardly to be hoped that so many crooked things should be made straight without much pain if you knew mr thwaite how little it is that i expect for myself  it is because i have known it that i am here  it will be well for herwill it notto be the wife of her cousin  if he be a good man a woman will not always make herself happy by marrying an earl  how many daggers you can use mr thwaite but this young man is good you yourself have said that you have heard so  i have heard nothing to the contrary my lady  and what shall i do  just explain it all to lady anna i think it will be clear then  you believe that she will be so easily pleased  why should she not be pleased shell have some maiden scruples doubtless what maid would not but shell exult at such an end to all her troublesand what maid would not let them meet as soon as may be and have it over when he shall have placed the ring on her finger your battle will have been won  then the tailor felt that his commission was done and he might take his leave it had been arranged that in the event of the countess consenting to the proposed marriage he should call upon mr flick to explain that it was so had she dissented a short note would have been sufficient had such been the case the solicitorgeneral would have instigated the young lord to go and try what he himself could do with the countess and her daughter the tailor had suggested to the mother that she should at once make the proposition known to lady anna but the countess felt that one other word was necessary as her old friend left her will you go back at once to keswick mr thwaite  tomorrow morning my lady  perhaps you will not tell your son of thisyet  no my lady i will not tell my son of thisyet my son is highminded and stiffnecked and of great heart if he saw aught to object to in this marriage it might be that he would express himself loudly then the tailor took his leave without even shaking hands with the countess  the woman sat alone for the next two hours thinking of what had passed there had sprung up in these days a sort of friendship between mrs bluestone and the two miss bluestones and the lady anna arising rather from the forlorn condition of the young lady than from any positive choice of affection mrs bluestone was kind and motherly the girls were girlish and good the father was the jupiter tonans of the householdas was of course properand was worshipped in everything to the world at large serjeant bluestone was a thundering blundering sanguine energetic lawyer whom nobody disliked very much though he was so big and noisy but at home serjeant bluestone was all the judges of the land rolled into one but he was a kindhearted man and he had sent his wife and girls to call upon the disconsolate countess the disconsolate lady anna having no other friends had found the companionship of the bluestone girls to be pleasant to her and she was now with them at the serjeants house in bedford square mrs bluestone talked of the wrongs and coming rights of the countess lovel wherever she went and the bluestone girls had all the case at their fingers ends to doubt that the serjeant would succeed or to doubt that the success of the countess and her daughter would have had any other source than the serjeants eloquence and the serjeants zeal would have been heresy in bedford square the grand idea that young jack bluestone who was up at brasenose should marry the lady anna had occurred only to the mother  lady anna was away with her friends as the countess sat brooding over the new hopes that had been opened to her at first she could not tear her mind away from the position which she herself would occupy as soon as her daughter should have been married and taken away from her the young earl would not want his motherinlawa motherinlaw who had spent the best years of her life in the society of a tailor and the daughter who would still be young enough to begin a new life in a new sphere would no longer want her mother to help her as regarded herself the countess was aware that the life she had led so long and the condition of agonizing struggling to which she had been brought had unfitted her for smiling happy prosperous aristocratic luxury there was but one joy left for her and that was to be the joy of success when that cup should have been drained there would be nothing left to her she would have her rank of courseand money enough to support it she no longer feared that any one would do her material injury her daughters husband no doubt would see that she had a fitting home with all the appanages and paraphernalia suited to a dowager countess but who would share her home with her and where should she find her friends even now the two miss bluestones were more to her daughter than she was when she should be established in her new luxurious home with servants calling her my lady with none to contradict her right she would no longer be enabled to sit late into the night discussing matters with her friend the tailor as regarded herself it would have been better for her perhaps if the fight had been carried on  but the fight had been not for herself but for her child and the victory for her girl would have been won by her own perseverance her whole life had been devoted to establishing the rights of her daughter and it should be so devoted to the end it had been her great resolve that the world should acknowledge the rank of her girl and now it would be acknowledged not only would she become the countess lovel by marriage but the name which had been assumed for her amidst the ridicule of many and in opposition to the belief of nearly all would be proved to have been her just and proper title and then at last it would be known by all men that she herself the illused suffering mother had gone to the house of that wicked man not as his mistress but as his true wife  hardly a thought troubled her then as to the acquiescence of her daughter she had no faintest idea that the girls heart had been touched by the young tailor she had so lived that she knew but little of lovers and their love and in her fear regarding daniel thwaite she had not conceived danger such as that it had to her simply been unfitting that there should be close familiarity between the two she expected that her daughter would be ambitious as she was ambitious and would rejoice greatly at such perfect success she herself had been preaching ambition and practising ambition all her life it had been the necessity of her career that she should think more of her right to a noble name than of any other good thing under the sun it was only natural that she should believe that her daughter shared the feeling  and then lady anna came in they wanted me to stay and dine mamma but i did not like to think that you should be left alone  i must get used to that my dear  why mamma wherever we have been we have always been together mrs bluestone was quite unhappy because you would not come they are so goodnatured i wish you would go there  i am better here my dear then there was a pause for a few moments but i am glad that you have come home this evening  of course i should come home  i have something special to say to you  to me mamma what is it mamma  i think we will wait till after dinner the things are here now go upstairs and take off your hat and i will tell you after dinner  mamma lady anna said as soon as the maid had left the room has old mr thwaite been here  yes my dear he was here  i thought so because you have something to tell me it is something from him  not from himself annathough he was the messenger come and sit here my dearclose to me have you ever thought anna that it would be good for you to be married  no mamma why should i but that surely was a lie how often had she thought that it would be good to be married to daniel thwaite and to have done with this weary searching after rank and now what could her mother mean thomas thwaite had been there but it was impossible that her mother should think that daniel thwaite would be a fit husband for her daughter no mammawhy should i  it must be thought of my dearest  why now she could understand perfectly that there was some special cause for her mothers manner of speech  after all that we have gone through we are about to succeed at last they are willing to own everything to give us all our rightson one condition  what condition mamma  come nearer to me dearest it would not make you unhappy to think that you were going to be the wife of a man you could love  nonot if i really loved him  you have heard of your cousinthe young earl  yes mammai have heard of him  they say that he is everything that is good what should you think of having him for your husband  that would be impossible mamma  impossiblewhy impossible what could be more fitting your rank is equal to hishigher even in this that your father was himself the earl in fortune you will be much more than his equal in age you are exactly suited why should it be impossible  oh mamma it is impossible  what makes you say so anna  we have never seen each other  tush my child why should you not see each other  and then we are his enemies  we are no longer enemies dearest they have sent to say that if weyou and iwill consent to this marriage then will they consent to it also it is their wish and it comes from them there can be no more proper ending to all this weary lawsuit it is quite right that the title and the name should be supported it is quite right that the fortune which your father left should in this way go to support your fathers family you will be the countess lovel and all will have been conceded to us there cannot possibly be any fitter way out of our difficulties lady anna sat looking at her mother in dismay but could say nothing you need have no fear about the young man every one tells me that he is just the man that a mother would welcome as a husband for her daughter will you not be glad to see him but the lady anna would only say that it was impossible why impossible my dearwhat do you mean by impossible  oh mamma it is impossible  the countess found that she was obliged to give the subject up for that night and could only comfort herself by endeavouring to believe that the suddenness of the tidings had confused her child     chapter ix  it isnt law   on the next morning lady anna was ill and would not leave her bed when her mother spoke to her she declared that her head ached wretchedly and she could not be persuaded to dress herself  is it what i said to you last night asked the countess  oh mamma that is impossible she said  it seemed to the mother that the mention of the young lords name had produced a horror in the daughters mind which nothing could for the present subdue before the day was over however the girl had acknowledged that she was bound in duty at any rate to meet her cousin and the countess forced to satisfy herself with so much of concession and acting upon that fixed herself in her purpose to go on with the project the lawyers on both sides would assist her it was for the advantage of them all that there should be such a marriage she determined therefore that she would at once see mr goffe her own attorney and give him to understand in general terms that the case might be proceeded with on this new matrimonial basis  but there was a grievous doubt on her minda fear a spark of suspicion of which she had unintentionally given notice to thomas thwaite when she asked him whether he had as yet spoken of the proposed marriage to his son he had understood what was passing in her mind when she exacted from him a promise that nothing should as yet be said to daniel thwaite upon the matter and yet she assured herself over and over again that her girl could not be so weak so vain so foolish so wicked as that it could not be that after all the struggles of her lifewhen at last success perfect success was within their grasp when all had been done and all well done when the great reward was then coming up to their very lips with a full tideit could not be that in the very moment of victory all should be lost through the base weakness of a young girl was it possible that her daughterthe daughter of one who had spent the very marrow of her life in fighting for the position that was due to hershould spoil all by preferring a journeyman tailor to a young nobleman of high rank of ancient lineage and one too who by his marriage with herself would endow her with wealth sufficient to make that rank splendid as well as illustrious but if it were not so what had the girl meant by saying that it was impossible that the word should have been used once or twice in maidenly scruple the countess could understand but it had been repeated with a vehemence beyond that which such natural timidity might have produced and now the girl professed herself to be ill in bed and when the subject was broached would only weep and repeat the one word with which she had expressed her repugnance to the match  hitherto she had not been like this she had in her own quiet way shared her mothers aspirations and had always sympathised with her mothers sufferings and she had been dutiful through it all carrying herself as one who was bound to special obedience by the peculiarity of her parents position she had been keenly alive to the wrongs that her mother endured and had in every respect been a loving child but now she protested that she would not do the one thing necessary to complete their triumph and would give no reason for not doing so as the countess thought of all this she swore to herself that she would prefer to divest her bosom of all soft motherly feeling than be vanquished in this matter by her own child her daughter should find that she could be stern and rough enough if she were really thwarted what would her life be worth to her if her child lady anna lovel the heiress and only legitimate offspring of the late earl lovel were to marry atailor  and then again she told herself that there was no sufficient excuse for such alarm her daughters demeanour had ever been modest she had never been given to easy friendship or to that propensity to mens acquaintance which the world calls flirting it might be that the very absence of such propensitythe very fact that hitherto she had never been thrust into society among her equalshad produced that feeling almost of horror which she had expressed but she had been driven at any rate to say that she would meet the young man and the countess acting upon that called on mr goffe in his chambers and explained to that gentleman that she proposed to settle the whole question in dispute by giving her daughter to the young earl in marriage mr goffe who had been present at the conference among the lawyers understood it all in a moment the overture had been made from the other side to his client  indeed my lady said mr goffe  do you not think it will be an excellent arrangement  in his heart of hearts mr goffe thought that it would be an excellent arrangement but he could not commit himself to such an opinion serjeant bluestone thought that the matter should be fought out and mr goffe was not prepared to separate himself from his legal adviser as serjeant bluestone had said after the conference with much argumentative vehemenceif we were to agree to this how would it be if the marriage should not come off the court cant agree to a marriage the court must direct to whom the property belongs they profess that they can prove that our marriage was no marriage they must do so or else they must withdraw the allegation suppose the italian woman were to come forward afterwards with her claim as the widow where then would be my clients position and her title as dowager countess and her claim upon her husbands personal estate i never heard anything more irregular in my life it is just like patterson who always thinks he can make laws according to the light of his own reason so serjeant bluestone had said to the lawyers who were acting with him and mr goffe though he did himself think that this marriage would be the best thing in the world could not differ from the serjeant  no doubt there might even yet be very great difficulties even though the young earl and lady anna lovel should agree to be married mr goffe on that occasion said very little to the countess and she left him with a feeling that a certain quantity of cold water had been thrown upon the scheme but she would not allow herself to be disturbed by that the marriage could go on without any consent on the part of the lawyers and the countess was quite satisfied that should the marriage be once completed the money and the titles would all go as she desired she had already begun to have more faith in the solicitorgeneral than in mr goffe or in serjeant bluestone  but serjeant bluestone was not a man to bear such treatment and be quiet under it he heard that very day from mr goffe what had been done and was loud in the expression of his displeasure it was the most irregular thing that he had ever known no other man except patterson in the whole profession would have done it the counsel on the other sideprobably patterson himselfhad been to his client and given advice to his client and had done so after her own counsel had decided that no such advice should be given he would see the attorneygeneral and ask the attorneygeneral what he thought about it now it was supposed in legal circles just at this period that the attorneygeneral and the solicitorgeneral were not the best friends in the world and the latter was wont to call the former an old fogey and the former to say of the latter that he might be a very clever philosopher but certainly no lawyer and so by degrees the thing got much talked about in the profession and there was perhaps a balance of opinion that the solicitorgeneral had done wrong  but this was certainthat no one could be put into possession of the property till the court had decided to whom it belonged if the earl withdrew from his claim the widow would simply be called on to prove her own marriagewhich had in truth been proved more than once alreadyand the right of her legitimate child would follow as a matter of course it was by no means probable that the woman over in italy would make any claim on her own behalfand even should she do so she could not find the means of supporting it they must be asses said the solicitorgeneral not to see that i am fighting their battle for them and that i am doing so because i can best secure my own clients interests by securing theirs also but even he became nervous after a day or two and was anxious to learn that the marriage scheme was progressing he told his client lord lovel that it would be well that the marriage should take place before the court sat in november in that case settlements will of course have been made and we shall simply withdraw we shall state the fact of this new marriage and assert ourselves to be convinced that the old marriage was good and valid but you should lose no time in the wooing my lord at this time the earl had not seen his cousin and it had not yet been decided when they should meet  it is my duty to explain to you lady lovel as my client said serjeant bluestone to the countess that this arrangement cannot afford a satisfactory mode to you of establishing your own position  it would be so happy for the whole family  as to that i can know nothing lady lovel if your daughter and the earl are attached to each other there can be no reason on earth why they should not be married but it should be a separate thing your position should not be made to depend upon hers  but they will withdraw serjeant bluestone  how do you know that they will withdraw supposing at the last moment lady anna were to decline the alliance would they withdraw then not a bit of it the matter would be further delayed and referred over to next year you and your daughter would be kept out of your money and there would still be danger  i should not care for thatif they were married  and they have set up this italian countesswho never was a countessany more than i am now they have put her up they are bound to dispose of her if she came forward afterwards on her own behalf where would you all be then  my daughter would at any rate be safe  the serjeant did not like it at all he felt that he was being thrown over not only by his client the countessas to which he might have been indifferent knowing that the world at large the laity as distinguished from the lawyers the children of the world as all who were not lawyers seemed to him to be will do and must be expected to do foolish things continually they cannot be persuaded to subject themselves to lawyers in all their doings and of course go wrong when they do not do so the infinite simplicity and silliness of mankind and womankind at large were too well known to the serjeant to cause him dismay let them be shown in ever so egregious a fashion but in this case the fault came from another lawyer who had tampered with his clients and who seemed to be himself as ignorant as though he belonged to the outside world and this man had been made solicitorgeneralover the heads of half the professionsimply because he could make a speech in parliament  but the solicitorgeneral was himself becoming uneasy when at the end of a fortnight he learned that the young peopleas he had come to call them on all occasionshad not as yet seen each other he would not like to have it said of him that he had thrown over his client and there were some who still believed that the italian marriage had been a real marriage and the italian wife alive at the time of the cumberland marriagethough the italian woman now living had never been the countess mr hardy so believed and in his private opinion thought that the solicitorgeneral had been very indiscreet  i dont think that we could ever dare to face a jury said sir william to mr hardy when they discussed the matter about a fortnight after the proposition had been made  why did the earl always say that the italian woman was his wife  because the earl was a very devil  mr flick does not think so  yes he does but mr flick like all attorneys with a bad case does not choose to say quite what he thinks even to his own counsel mr flick does not like to throw his client over nor do i nor do you but with such a case we have no right to create increased expenses and all the agony of prolonged fallacious hope the girl is her fathers heir do you suppose i would not stick to my brief if i did not feel sure that it is so  then let the earl be told and let the girl have her rights  ah there you have me it may be that such would be the juster course but then hardy cannot you understand that though i am sure i am not quite sure that though the case is a bad one it may not be quite bad enough to be thrown up it is just the case in which a compromise is expedient if but a quarter or but an eighth of a probability be with you take your proportion of the thing at stake but here is a compromise that gives all to each who would wish to rob the girl of her noble name and great inheritance if she be the heiress not i though the earl be my client and yet how sad would it be to have to tell that young man that there was nothing for him but to submit to lose all the wealth belonging to the family of which he has been born the head if we can bring them together there will be nothing to make sore the hearts of any of us  mr hardy acknowledged to himself that the solicitorgeneral pleaded his own case very well but yet he felt that it wasnt law     chapter x  the first interview   for some days after the intimation of her mothers purpose lady anna kept her bed she begged that she might not see a doctor she had a headachenothing but a headache but it was quite impossible that she should ever marry earl lovel this she said whenever her mother would revert to that subjecti have not seen him mamma i do not know him i am sure it would be impossible then when at last she was induced to dress herself she was still unwilling to be forced to undergo the interview to which she had acknowledged that she must be subjected at last she consented to spend a day in bedford square to dine there and to be brought home in the evening the countess was at this time not very full of trust in the serjeant having learned that he was opposed to the marriage scheme but she was glad that her daughter should be induced to go out even to the serjeants house as after that visit the girl could have no ground on which to oppose the meeting which was to be arranged she could hardly plead that she was too ill to see her cousin when she had dined with mrs bluestone  during this time many plans had been proposed for the meeting the solicitorgeneral discussing the matter with the young lord had thought it best that lady anna should at once be asked down to yoxhamas the lady anna and the young lord would have been quite satisfied with such an arrangement he could have gone about his obligatory wooing among his own friends in the house to which he had been accustomed with much more ease than in a london lodging but his uncle who had corresponded on the subject with mr hardy still objected we should be giving up everything he said if we were once to call her lady anna where should we be then if they didnt hit it off together i dont believe and i never shall believe that she is really lady anna lovel the solicitorgeneral when he heard of this objection shook his head finding himself almost provoked to anger what asses were these people not to understand that he could see further into the matter than they could do and that their best way out of their difficulty would be frankly to open their arms to the heiress should they continue to be pigheaded and prejudiced everything would soon be gone  then he had a scheme for inviting the girl to his own house and to that scheme he obtained his wifes consent but here his courage failed him or it might be fairer to say that his prudence prevailed he was very anxious intensely eager so to arrange this great family dispute that all should be benefitedbelieving nay feeling positively certain that all concerned in the matter were honest but he must not go so far as to do himself an absolute and grievous damage should it at last turn out that he was wrong in any of his surmises so that plan was abandoned  there was nothing left for it but that the young earl should himself face the difficulty and be introduced to the girl at the lodging in wyndham street but as a prelude to this a meeting was arranged at mr flicks chambers between the countess and her proposed soninlaw that the earl should go to his own attorneys chambers was all in rule while he was there the countess camewhich was not in rule and almost induced the serjeant to declare when he heard it that he would have nothing more to do with the case my lord said the countess i am glad to meet you and i hope that we may be friends the young man was less collected and stammered out a few words that were intended to be civil  it is a pity that you should have conflicting interests said the attorney  i hope it need not continue to be so said the countess my heart lord lovel is all in the welfare of our joint family we will begrudge you nothing if you will not begrudge us the names which are our own and without which we cannot live honourably before the world then some other few words were muttered and the earl promised to come to wyndham street at a certain hour not a word was then said about the marriage even the countess with all her resolution and all her courage did not find herself able in set terms to ask the young man to marry her daughter  she is a very handsome woman said the lord to the attorney when the countess had left them  yes indeed  and like a lady  quite like a lady she herself was of a good family  i suppose she certainly was the late earls wife mr flick  who can say my lord that is just the question the solicitorgeneral thinks that she would prove her right and i do not know that i have ever found him to be wrong when he has had a steadfast opinion  why should we not give it up to her at once  i couldnt recommend that my lord why should we give it up the interests at stake are very great i couldnt for a moment think of suggesting to you to give it up  i want nothing mr flick that does not belong to me  just so but then perhaps it does belong to you we can never be sure no doubt the safest way will be for you to contract an alliance with this lady of course we should give it up then but the settlements would make the property all right the young earl did not quite like it he would rather have commenced his wooing after the girl had been established in her own right and when she would have had no obligation on her to accept him but he had consented and it was too late for him now to recede it had been already arranged that he should call in wyndham street at noon on the following day in order that he might be introduced to his cousin  on that evening the countess sat late with her daughter purposing that on the morrow nothing should be said before the interview calculated to disturb the girls mind but as they sat together through the twilight and into the darkness of night close by the open window through which the heavily laden air of the metropolis came to them hot with all the heat of a london july day very many words were spoken by the countess it will be for you tomorrow to make or to mar all that i have been doing since the day on which you were born  oh mamma that is so terrible a thing to say  but terrible things must be said if they are true it is so it is for you to decide whether we shall triumph or be utterly and for ever crushed  i cannot understand it why should we be crushed he would not wish to marry me if this fortune were not mine he is not coming mamma because he loves me  you say that because you do not understand do you suppose that my name will be allowed to me if you should refuse your cousins suit if so you are very much mistaken the fight will go on and as we have not money we shall certainly go to the wall at last why should you not love him there is no one else that you care for  no mamma she said slowly  then what more can you want  i do not know him mamma  but you will know him according to that no girl would ever get married is it not a great thing that you should be asked to assume and to enjoy the rank which has belonged to your mother but which she has never been able to enjoy  i do not think mamma that i care much about rank  anna the mothers mind as she heard this flew off to the young tailor had misery so great as this overtaken her after all  i mean that i dont care so much about it it has never done us any good  but if it is a thing that is your own that you are born to you must bear it whether it be in sorrow or in joy whether it be a blessing or a curse if it be yours you cannot fling it away from you you may disgrace it but you must still have it though you were to throw yourself away upon a chimneysweeper you must still be lady anna the daughter of earl lovel  i neednt call myself so  others must call you so it is your name and you cannot be rid of it it is yours of right as my name has been mine of right and not to assert it not to live up to it not to be proud of it would argue incredible baseness noblesse oblige you have heard that motto and know what it means and then would you throw away from you in some childish phantasy all that i have been struggling to win for you during my whole life have you ever thought of what my life has been anna  yes mamma  would you have the heart to disappoint me now that the victory is wonnow that it may be made our own by your help and what is it that i am asking you to do if this man were badif he were such a one as your father if he were drunken cruel illconditioned or even heavy foolish or deformed had you been told stories to set you against him as that he had been false with other women i could understand it in that case we would at any rate find out the truth before we went on but of this man we hear that he is good and pleasant an excellent young man who has endeared himself to all who know him such a one that all the girls of his own standing in the world would give their eyes to win him  let some girl win him then who cares for him  but he wishes to win you dearest  not because he loves me how can he love me when he never saw me how can i love him when i never saw him  he wishes to win you because he has heard what you are and because he knows that by doing so he can set things right which for many years have been wrong  it is because he would get all this money  you would both get it he desires nothing unfair whatever he takes from you so much he will give and it is not only for this generation is it nothing to you that the chiefs of your own family who shall come after you shall be able to hold their heads up among other british peers would you not wish that your own son should come to be earl lovel with wealth sufficient to support the dignity  i dont think it would make him happy mamma  there is something more in this anna than i can understand you used not to be so when we talked of these things in past years you used not to be indifferent  i was not asked then totomarry a man i did not care for  there is something else anna  no mamma  if there be nothing else you will learn to care for him you will see him tomorrow and will be left alone with him i will sit with you for a time and then i will leave you all that i ask of you is to receive him tomorrow without any prejudice against him you must remember how much depends on you and that you are not as other girls are after that lady anna was allowed to go to her bed and to weep in solitude over the wretchedness of her condition it was not only that she loved daniel thwaite with all her heartloved him with a love that had grown with every year of her growthbut that she feared him also the man had become her master and even could she have brought herself to be false she would have lacked the courage to declare her falsehood to the man to whom she had vowed her love  on the following morning lady anna did not come down to breakfast and the countess began to fear that she would be unable to induce her girl to rise in time to receive their visitor but the poor child had resolved to receive the mans visit and contemplated no such escape as that at eleven oclock she slowly dressed herself and before twelve crept down into the one sittingroom which they occupied the countess glanced round at her anxious to see that she was looking her best certain instructions had been given as to her dress and the garniture of her hair and the disposal of her ribbons all these had been fairly well obeyed but there was a fixed determined hardness in her face which made her mother fear that the earl might be dismayed the mother knew that her child had never looked like that before  punctually at twelve the earl was announced the countess received him very pleasantly and with great composure she shook hands with him as though they had known each other all their lives and then introduced him to her daughter with a sweet smile i hope you will acknowledge her as your faraway cousin my lord blood they say is thicker than water and if so you two ought to be friends  i am sure i hope we may be said the earl  i hope so toomy lord said the girl as she left her hand quite motionless in his  we heard of you down in cumberland said the countess it is long since i have seen the old place but i shall never forget it there is not a bush among the mountains there that i shall not rememberay into the next world if aught of our memories are left to us  i love the mountains but the house is very gloomy  gloomy indeed if you found it sad what must it have been to me i hope that i may tell you some day of all that i suffered there there are things to tell of which i have never yet spoken to human being she poor child has been too young and too tender to be troubled by such a tale i sometimes think that no tragedy ever written no story of horrors ever told can have exceeded in description the things which i endured in that one year of my married life then she went on at length not telling the details of that terrible year but speaking generally of the hardships of her life i have never wondered lord lovel that you and your nearest relations should have questioned my position a bad man had surrounded me with such art in his wickedness that it has been almost beyond my strength to rid myself of his toils all this she had planned beforehand having resolved that she would rush into the midst of things at once and if possible enlist his sympathies on her side  i hope it may be over now he said  yes she replied rising slowly from her seat i hope it may be over now the moment had come in which she had to play the most difficult stroke of her whole game and much might depend on the way in which she played it she could not leave them together walking abruptly out of the room without giving some excuse for so unusual a proceeding indeed i hope it may be over now both for us and for you lord lovel that wicked man in leaving behind such cause of quarrel has injured you almost as deeply as us i pray god that you and that dear girl there may so look into each others hearts and trust each others purposes that you may be able to set right the ill which your predecessor did if so the family of lovel for centuries to come may be able to bless your names then with slow steps she left the room  lady anna had spoken one word and that was all it certainly was not for her now to speak she sat leaning on the table with her eyes fixed upon the ground not daring to look at the man who had been brought to her as her future husband a single glance she had taken as he entered the room and she had seen at once that he was fair and handsome that he still had that sweet winsome boyishness of face which makes a girl feel that she need not fear a manthat the man has something of her own weakness and need not be treated as one who is wise grand or heroic and she saw too in one glance how different he was from daniel thwaite the man to whom she had absolutely given herselfand she understood at the moment something of the charm of luxurious softness and aristocratic luxury daniel thwaite was swarthy hardhanded blackbeardedwith a noble fire in his eyes but with an innate coarseness about his mouth which betokened roughness as well as strength had it been otherwise with her than it was she might she thought have found it easy enough to love this young earl as it was there was nothing for her to do but to wait and answer him as best she might  lady anna he said  my lord  will it not be well that we should be friends  ohfriendsyes my lord  i will tell you all and everythingthat is about myself i was brought up to believe that you and your mother were justimpostors  my lord we are not impostors  noi believe it i am sure you are not mistakes have been made but it has not been of my doing as a boy what could i believe but what i was told i know now that you are and always have been as you have called yourself if nothing else comes of it i will at any rate say so much the estate which your father left is no doubt yours if i could hinder it there should be no more law  thank you my lord  your mother says that she has suffered much i am sure she has suffered i trust that all that is over now i have come here today more to say that on my own behalf than anything else a shadow of a shade of disappointment the slightest semblance of a cloud passed across her heart as she heard this but it was well she could not have married him even if he had wished it and now as it seemed that difficulty was over her mother and those lawyers had been mistaken and it was well that he should tell her so at once  it is very good of you my lord  i would not have you think of me that i could come to you hoping that you would promise me your love before i had shown you whether i had loved you or not  no my lord she hardly understood him nowwhether he intended to propose himself as a suitor for her hand or not  you lady anna are your fathers heir i am your cousin earl lovel as poor a peer as there is in england they tell me that we should marry because you are rich and i am an earl  so they tell mebut that will not make it right  i would not have it so even if i dared to think that you would agree to it  oh no my lord nor would i  but if you could learn to love me  no my lordno  do not answer me yet my cousin if i swore that i loved youloved you so soon after seeing youand loved you too knowing you to be so wealthy an heiress  ah do not talk of that  wellnot of that but if i said that i loved you you would not believe me  it would not be true my lord  but i know that i shall love you you will let me try you are very lovely and they tell me you are sweethumoured i can believe well that you are sweet and pleasant you will let me try to love you anna  no my lord  must it be so so soon  yes my lord  why that is it because we are strangers to each other that may be curedif not quickly as i would have it cured slowly and by degrees slowly as you can wish if only i may come where you shall be you have said that we may be friends  oh yesfriends i hope  friends at least we are born cousins  yes my lord  cannot you call me by my name cousins you know do so and remember this you will have and can have no nearer cousin than i am i am bound at least to be a brother to you  oh be my brother  thator more than that i would fain be more than that but i will be that at least as i came to you before i saw you i felt that whenever we knew each other i could not be less to you than that if i am your friend i must be your best friendas being though poor the head of your family the lovels should at least love each other and cousins may love even though they should not love enough to be man and wife  i will love you so always  enough to be my wife  enough to be your dear cousinyour loving sister  so it shall beunless it can be more i would not ask you for more now i would not wish you to give more now but think of me and ask yourself whether you can dare to give yourself to me altogether  i cannot dare my lord  you would not call your brother lord my name is frederic but anna dear annaand then he took her unresisting handyou shall not be asked for more now but cousins newfound cousins who love each other and will stand by each other for help and aid against the world may surely kissas would a brother and a sister you will not grudge me a kiss then she put up her cheek innocently and he kissed it gentlyhardly with a lovers kiss i will leave you now he said still holding her hand but tell your mother thusthat she shall no longer be troubled by lawyers at the suit of her cousin frederic she is to me the countess lovel and she shall be treated by me with the honour suited to her rank and so he left the house without seeing the countess again     chapter xi  it is too late   the countess had resolved that she would let their visitor depart without saying a word to him whatever might be the result of the interview she was aware that she could not improve it by asking any question from the young lord or by hearing any account of it from him the ice had been broken and it would now be her object to have her daughter invited down to yoxham as soon as possible if once the earls friends could be brought to be eager for the match on his account as was she on her daughters behalf then probably the thing might be done for herself she expected no invitation no immediate comfort no tender treatment no intimate familiar cousinship she had endured hitherto and would be contented to endure so that triumph might come at last nor did she question her daughter very closely anxious as she was to learn the truth  could she have heard every word that had been spoken she would have been sure of success could daniel thwaite have heard every word he would have been sure that the girl was about to be false to him but the girl herself believed herself to have been true the man had been so soft with her so tender so pleasantso loving with his sweet cousinly offers of affection that she could not turn herself against him he had been to her eyes beautiful noblealmost divine she knew of herself that she could not be his wifethat she was not fit to be his wifebecause she had given her troth to the tailors son when her cousin touched her check with his lips she remembered that she had submitted to be kissed by one with whom her noble relative could hold no fellowship whatever a feeling of degradation came upon her as though by contact with this young man she was suddenly awakened to a sense of what her own rank demanded from her when her mother had spoken to her of what she owed to her family she had thought only of all the friendship that she and her mother had received from her lover and his father but when lord lovel told her what she washow she should ever be regarded by him as a dear cousinhow her mother should be accounted a countess and receive from him the respect due to her rankthen she could understand how unfitting were a union between the lady anna lovel and daniel thwaite the journeyman tailor hitherto daniels face had been noble in her eyesthe face of a man who was manly generous and strong but after looking into the eyes of the young earl seeing how soft was the down upon his lips how ruddy the colour of his cheek how beautiful was his mouth with its pearlwhite teeth how noble the curve of his nostrils after feeling the softness of his hand and catching the sweetness of his breath she came to know what it might have been to be wooed by such a one as he  but not on that account did she meditate falseness it was settled firm as fate the dominion of the tailor over her spirit had lasted in truth for years the sweet perfumed graces of the young nobleman had touched her senses but for a moment had she been falseminded she had not courage to be false but in truth she was not falseminded it was to her as that sunny moment passed across her as to some hardtoiling youth who while roaming listlessly among the houses of the wealthy hears as he lingers on the pavement of a summer night the melodies which float upon the air from the open balconies above him a vague sense of unknown sweetness comes upon him mingled with an irritating feeling of envy that some favoured son of fortune should be able to stand over the shoulders of that singing syren while he can only listen with intrusive ears from the street below and so he lingers and is envious and for a moment curses his fatenot knowing how weary may be the youth who stands how false the girl who sings but he does not dream that his life is to be altered for him because he has chanced to hear the daughter of a duchess warble through a window and so it was with this girl the youth was very sweet to her intensely sweet when he told her that he would be a brother perilously sweet when he bade her not to grudge him one kiss but she knew that she was not as he was that she had lost the right could she ever have had the right to live his life to drink of his cup and to lie on his breast so she passed on as the young man does in the street and consoled herself with the consciousness that strength after all may be preferable to sweetness  and she was an honest girl from her heart and prone to truth with a strong glimmer of common sense in her character of which her mother hitherto had been altogether unaware what right had her mother to think that she could be fit to be this young lords wife having brought her up in the companionship of small traders in cumberland she never blamed her mother she knew well that her mother had done all that was possible on her behalf but for that small trader they would not even have had a roof to shelter them but still there was the fact and she understood it she was as her bringing up had made her and it was too late now to effect a change ah yesit was indeed too late it was all very well that lawyers should look upon her as an instrument as a piece of goods that might now from the accident of her ascertained birth be made of great service to the lovel family let her be the lords wife and everything would be right for everybody it had been very easy to say that but she had a heart of her owna heart to be touched and won and given awayand lost the man who had been so good to them had sought for his reward and had got it and could not now be defrauded had she been dishonest she would not have dared to defraud him had she dared she would not have been so dishonest  did you like him asked the mother not immediately after the interview but when the evening came  oh yeshow should one not like him  how indeed he is the finest noblest youth that ever my eyes rested on and so like the lovels  was my father like that  yes indeed in the shape of his face and the tone of his voice and the movement of his eyes though the sweetness of the countenance was all gone in the devils training to which he had submitted himself and you too are like him though darker and with something of the murrays greater breadth of face but i can remember portraits at lovel grangeevery one of themand all of them were alike there never was a lovel but had that natural grace of appearance you will gaze at those portraits dear oftener even than i have done and you will be happy where i wasohso miserable  i shall never see them mamma  why not  i do not want to see them  you say you like him  yes i like him  and why should you not love him well enough to make him your husband  i am not fit to be his wife  you are fitnone could be fitter none others so fit you are as well born as he and you have the wealth which he wants you must have it if as you tell me he says that he will cease to claim it as his own there can be no question of fitness  money will not make a girl fit mamma  you have been brought up as a ladyand are a lady i swear i do not know what you mean if he thinks you fit and you can like himas you say you dowhat more can be wanted does he not wish it  i do not know he said he did not and theni think he said he did  is that it  no mamma it is not that not that only it is too late  too late how too late anna you must tell me what you mean i insist upon it that you tell me what you mean why is it too late but lady anna was not prepared to tell her meaning she had certainly not intended to say anything to her mother of her solemn promise to daniel thwaite it had been arranged between him and her that nothing was to be said of it till this law business should be all over he had sworn to her that to him it made no difference whether she should be proclaimed to be the lady anna the undoubted owner of thousands a year or anna murray the illegitimate daughter of the late earls mistress a girl without a penny and a nobody in the worlds esteem no doubt they must shape their life very differently in this event or in that how he might demean himself should this fortune be adjudged to the earl as he thought would be the case when he first made the girl promise to be his wife he knew well enough he would do as his father had done before him and he did not doubtwith better result what might be his fate should the wealth of the lovels become the wealth of his intended wife he did not yet quite foreshadow to himself how he should face and fight the world when he came to be accused of having plotted to get all this wealth for himself he did not know he had dreams of distributing the greater part among the lovels and the countess and taking himself and his wife with onethird of it to some new country in which they would not in derision call his wife the lady anna and in which he would be as good a man as any earl but let all that be as it might the girl was to keep her secret till the thing should be settled now in these latter days it had come to be believed by him as by nearly everybody else that the thing was wellnigh settled the solicitorgeneral had thrown up the sponge so said the bystanders and now there was beginning to be a rumour that everything was to be set right by a family marriage the solicitorgeneral would not have thrown up the spongeso said they who knew him bestwithout seeing a reason for doing so serjeant bluestone was still indignant and mr hardy was silent and moody but the world at large were beginning to observe that in this as in all difficult cases the solicitorgeneral tempered the innocence of the dove with the wisdom of the serpent in the meantime lady anna by no means intended to allow the secret to pass her lips whether she ever could tell her mother she doubted but she certainly would not do so an hour too soon why is it too late demanded the countess repeating her question with stern severity of voice  i mean that i have not lived all my life as his wife should live  trash it is trash what has there been in your life to disgrace you we have been poor and we have lived as poor people do live we have not been disgraced  no mamma  i will not hear such nonsense it is a reproach to me  oh mamma do not say that i know how good you have beenhow you have thought of me in every thing pray do not say that i reproach you and she came and knelt at her mothers lap  i will not darling but do not vex me by saying that you are unfit there is nothing else dearest  no mamma she said in a low tone pausing before she told the falsehood  i think it will be arranged that you shall go down to yoxham the people there even are beginning to know that we are right and are willing to acknowledge us the earl whom i cannot but love already for his gracious goodness has himself declared that he will not carry on the suit mr goffe has told me that they are anxious to see you there of course you must goand will go as lady anna lovel mr goffe says that some money can now be allowed from the estate and you shall go as becomes the daughter of earl lovel when visiting among her cousins you will see this young man there if he means to love you and to be true to you he will be much there i do not doubt but that you will continue to like him and remember this annathat even though your name be acknowledgedeven though all the wealth be adjudged to be your owneven though some judge on the bench shall say that i am the widowed countess lovel it may be all undone some dayunless you become this young mans wife that woman in italy may be bolstered up at last if you refuse him but when you are once the wife of young lord lovel no one then can harm us there can be no going back after that this the countess said rather to promote the marriage than from any fear of the consequences which she described daniel thwaite was the enemy that now she dreaded and not the italian woman or the lovel family  lady anna could only say that she would go to yoxham if she were invited there by mrs lovel     chapter xii  have they surrendered   as all the world heard of what was going on so did daniel thwaite hear it among others he was a hardworking conscientious moody man given much to silence among his fellow workmenone to whom life was serious enough not a happy man though he had before him a prospect of prosperity which would make most men happy but he was essentially a tenderhearted affectionate man who could make a sacrifice of himself if he thought it needed for the happiness of one he loved when he heard of this proposed marriage he asked himself many questions as to his duty and as to the welfare of the girl he did love her with all his heart and he believed thoroughly in her affection for himself he had as yet no sufficient reason to doubt that she would be true to himbut he knew well that an earls coronet must be tempting to a girl so circumstanced as was lady anna there were moments in which he thought that it was almost his duty to give her up and bid her go and live among those of her own rank but then he did not believe in rank he utterly disbelieved in it and in his heart of hearts he felt that he would make a better and a fitter husband to this girl than would an earl with all an earls temptation to vice he was ever thinking of some better world to which he might take her which had not been contaminated by empty names and an impudent assumption of hereditary and therefore false dignity as regarded the money it would be hers whether she married him or the earl and if she loved him as she had sworn that she did why should he be false to her or why as yet should he think that she would prefer an empty gilded lordling to the friend who had been her friend as far back as her memory could carry her if she asked to be released then indeed he would release herbut not without explaining to her with such eloquence as he might be able to usewhat it was she proposed to abandon and what to take in place of that which she lost he was a man silent and under selfcontrol but selfconfident also and he did believe himself to be a better man than young earl lovel  in making this resolutionthat he would give her back her troth if she asked for it but not without expressing to her his thoughts as he did sohe ignored the masterfulness of his own character there are men who exercise dominion from the nature of their disposition and who do so from their youth upwards without knowing till advanced life comes upon them that any power of dominion belongs to them men are persuasive and imperious withal who are unconscious that they use burning words to others whose words to them are never even warm so it was with this man when he spoke to himself in his solitude of his purpose of resigning the titled heiress to the arguments the entreaties or the threats of others he would pay no heed the countess might bluster about her rank and he would heed her not at all he cared nothing for the whole tribe of lovels if lady anna asked for release she should be released but not till she had heard his words how scalding these words might be how powerful to prevent the girl from really choosing her own fate he did not know himself  though he lived in the same house with her he seldom saw herunless when he would knock at the door of an evening and say a few words to her mother rather than to her since thomas thwaite had left london for the last time the countess had become almost cold to the young man she would not have been so if she could have helped it but she had begun to fear him and she could not bring herself to be cordial to him either in word or manner he perceived it at once and became himself cold and constrained  once and once only he met lady anna alone after his fathers departure and before her interview with lord lovel then he met her on the stairs of the house while her mother was absent at the lawyers chambers  are you here daniel at this hour she asked going back to the sittingroom whither he followed her  i wanted to see you and i knew that your mother would be out it is not often that i do a thing in secret even though it be to see the girl that i love  no indeed i do not see you often now  does that matter much to you lady anna  lady anna  i have been instructed you know that i am to call you so  not by me daniel  nonot by you not as yet your mothers manners are much altered to me is it not so  how can i tell mine are not  it is no question of manners sweetheart between you and me it has not come to that i hope do you wish for any changeas regards me  oh no  as to my love there can be no change in that if it suits your mother to be disdainful to me i can bear it i always thought that it would come to be so some day  there was but little more said then he asked her no further questionnone at least that it was difficult for her to answerand he soon took his leave he was a passionate rather than a tender lover and having once held her in his arms and kissed her lips and demanded from her a return of his caress he was patient now to wait till he could claim them as his own but two days after the interview between lord lovel and his love he a second time contrived to find her alone  i have come again he said because i knew your mother is out i would not trouble you with secret meetings but that just now i have much to say to you and then you may be gone from hence before i had even heard that you were going  i am always glad to see you daniel  are you my sweetheart is that true  indeed indeed it is  i should be a traitor to doubt youand i do not doubt i will never doubt you if you tell me that you love me  you know i love you  tell me anna or shall i say lady anna  lady annaif you wish to scorn me  then never will i call you so till it shall come to pass that i do wish to scorn you but tell me is it true that earl lovel was with you the other day  he was here the day before yesterday  and why did he come  why  why did he come you know that as far as i have yet heard he is still your mothers enemy and yours and is persecuting you to rob you of your name and of your property did he come as a friend  oh yes certainly as a friend  but he still makes his claim  nohe says that he will make it no longer that he acknowledges mamma as my fathers widow and me as my fathers heir  that is generousif that is all  very generous  and he does this without condition there is nothing to be given to him to pay him for this surrender  there is nothing to give she said in that low sweet melancholy voice which was common to her always when she spoke of herself  you do not mean to deceive me dear i know but there is a something to be given and i am told that he has asked for it or certainly will ask and indeed i do not think that an earl noble but povertystricken would surrender everything without making some counter claim which would lead him by another path to all that he has been seeking anna you know what i mean  yes i know  has he made no such claim  i cannot tell  you cannot tell whether or no he has asked you to be his wife  no i cannot tell do not look at me like that daniel he came here and mamma left us together and he was kind to me oh so kind he said that he would be a cousin to me and a brother  a brother  that was what he said  and he meant nothing more than thatsimply to be your brother  i think he did mean more i think he meant that he would try to love me so that he might be my husband  and what said you to that  i told him that it could not be so  and then  why then again he said that we were cousins that i had no nearer cousin anywhere and that he would be good to me and help me and that the lawsuit should not go on oh daniel he was so good  was that all  he kissed me saying that cousins might kiss  no annacousins such as you and he may not kiss do you hear me  yes i hear you  if you mean to be true to me there must be no more of that do you not know that all this means that he is to win you to be his wife did he not come to you with that object  i think he did daniel  i think so too my dear surrender ill tell you what that surrender means they perceive at last that they have not a shadow of justice or even a shadow of a chance of unjust success in their claim that with all their command of money which is to be spent however out of your property they can do nothing that their false witnesses will not come to aid them that they have not another inch of ground on which to stand their great lawyer sir william patterson dares not show himself in court with a case so false and fraudulent at last your mothers rights and yours are to be owned then they turn themselves about and think in what other way the prize may be won it is not likely that such a prize should be surrendered by a noble lord the young man is made to understand that he cannot have it all without a burden and that he must combine his wealth with you that is it and at once he comes to you asking you to be his wife so that in that way he may lay his hands on the wealth of which he has striven to rob you  daniel i do not think that he is like that  i tell you he is not only like itbut that itself is it not clear as noonday he comes here to talk of love who had never seen you before is it thus that men love  but daniel he did not talk so  i wonder that he was so crafty believing him as i do to be a fool he talked of cousinship and brotherhood and yet gave you to know that he meant you to be his wife was it not so  i think it was so in very truth  of course it was so do brothers marry their sisters were it not for the money which must be yours and which he is kind enough to surrender would he come to you then with his brotherhood and his cousinship and his mock love tell me that my lady can it be real loveto which there has been no forerunning acquaintance  i think not indeed  and must it not be lust of wealth that may come by hearsay well enough it is a love which requires no great foreknowledge to burn with real strength he is a gay looking lad no doubt  i do not know as to gay but he is beautiful  like enough my girl with soft hands and curled hair and a sweet smell and a bright colour and a false heart i have never seen the lad but for the false heart i can answer  i do not think that he is false  not false and yet he comes to you asking you to be his wife just at that nick of time in which he finds that youthe right ownerare to have the fortune of which he has vainly endeavoured to defraud you is it not so  he cannot be wrong to wish to keep up the glory of the family  the glory of the familyyes the fame of the late lord who lived as though he were a fiend let loose from hell to devastate mankind the glory of the family and how will he maintain it at racecourses in bettingclubs among loose women with luscious wines never doing one stroke of work for man or god consuming and never producing either idle altogether or working the work of the devil that will be the glory of the family anna lovel you shall give him his choice then he took her hand in his ask him whether he will have that empty or take all the wealth of the lovels you have my leave  and if he took the empty hand what should i do she asked  my brave girl no though the chance be but one in a thousand against me i would not run the risk but i am putting it to yourself to your reason to judge of his motives can it be that his mind in this matter is not sordid and dishonest as to you the choice is open to you  no daniel it is open no longer  the choice is open to you if you will tell me that your heart is so set upon being the bride of a lord that truth and honesty and love and all decent feeling from woman to man can be thrown to the wind to make way for such an ambitioni will say not a word against it you are free  have i asked for freedom  no indeed had you done so i should have made all this much shorter  then why do you harass me by saying it  because it is my duty can i know that he comes here seeking you for his wife can i hear it said on all sides that this family feud is to be settled by a happy family marriage can i find that you yourself are willing to love him as a cousin or a brotherwithout finding myself compelled to speak there are two men seeking you as their wife one can make you a countess the other simply an honest mans wife and so far as that can be low lower than that title of your own which they will not allow you to put before your name if i am still your choice give me your hand of course she gave it him so be it and now i shall fear nothing then she told him that it was intended that she should go to yoxham as a visitor but still he declared that he would fear nothing  early on the next morning he called on mr goffe the attorney with the object of making some inquiry as to the condition of the lawsuit mr goffe did not much love the elder tailor but he specially disliked the younger he was not able to be altogether uncivil to them because he knew all that they had done to succour his client but he avoided them when it was possible and was chary of giving them information on this occasion daniel asked whether it was true that the other side had abandoned their claim  really mr thwaite i cannot say that they have said mr goffe  can you say that they have not  no nor that either  had anything of that kind been decided i suppose you would have known it mr goffe  really sir i cannot say there are questions mr thwaite which a professional gentleman cannot answer even to such friends as you and your father have been when any real settlement is to be made the countess lovel will as a matter of course be informed  she should be informed at once said daniel thwaite sternly and so should they who have been concerned with her in this matter  you i know have heavy claims on the countess  my father has claims which will never vex her whether paid or not paid but it is right that he should know the truth i do not believe that the countess herself knows though she has been led to think that the claim has been surrendered  mr goffe was very sorry but really he had nothing further to tell     chapter xiii  new friends   the introduction to yoxham followed quickly upon the earls visit to wyndham street there was a great consultation at the rectory before a decision could be made as to the manner in which the invitation should be given the earl thought that it should be sent to the mother the rector combated this view very strongly still hoping that though he might be driven to call the girl lady anna he might postpone the necessity of acknowledging the countessship of the mother till the marriage should have been definitely acknowledged mrs lovel thought that if the girl were lady anna then the mother must be the countess lovel and that it would be as well to be hung for a sheep as a lamb but the wisdom of aunt julia sided with her brother though she did not share her brothers feelings of animosity to the two women it is understood that the girl is to be invited and not the mother said miss lovel and as it is quite possible that the thing should failin which case the lawsuit might possibly go onthe less we acknowledge the better the earl declared that the lawsuit couldnt go onthat he would not carry it on my dear frederic you are not the only person concerned the lady in italy who still calls herself countess lovel may renew the suit on her own behalf as soon as you have abandoned it should she succeed you would have to make what best compromise you could with her respecting the property that is the way i understand it this exposition of the case by miss lovel was so clear that it carried the day and accordingly a letter was written by mrs lovel addressed to lady anna lovel asking her to come and spend a few days at yoxham she could bring her maid with her or not as she liked but she could have the service of mrs lovels ladys maid if she chose to come unattended the letter sounded cold when it was read but the writer signed herself yours affectionately jane lovel it was addressed to the lady anna lovel to the care of messrs goffe and goffe solicitors raymonds buildings grays inn  lady anna was allowed to read it first but she read it in the presence of her mother to whom she handed it at once as a matter of course a black frown came across the countesss brow and a look of displeasure almost of anger rested on her countenance is it wrong mamma asked the girl  it is a part of the wholebut my dear it shall not signify conquerors cannot be conquerors all at once nor can the vanquished be expected to submit themselves with a grace but it will come and though they should ignore me utterly that will be as nothing i have not clung to this for years past to win their loves  i will not go mamma if they are unkind to you  you must go my dear it is only that they are weak enough to think that they can acknowledge you and yet continue to deny to me my rights but it matters nothing of course you shall goand you shall go as the daughter of the countess lovel  that mention of the ladysmaid had been unfortunate mrs lovel had simply desired to make it easy for the young lady to come without a servant to wait upon her and had treated her husbands faraway cousin as elder ladies often do treat those who are younger when the question of the maid may become a difficulty but the countess who would hardly herself have thought of it now declared that her girl should go attended as her rank demanded lady anna therefore under her mothers dictation wrote the following reply      wyndham street 3rd august 183     dear mrs lovel     i shall be happy to accept your kind invitation to yoxham    but can hardly do so before the 10th on that day i will    leave london for york inside the mailcoach perhaps you    can be kind enough to have me met where the coach stops    as you are so good as to say you can take her in i will    bring my own maid     yours affectionately     anna lovel   but mamma i dont want a maid said the girl who had never been waited on in her life and who had more often than not made her mothers bed and her own till they had come up to london  nevertheless you shall take one you will have to make other changes besides that and the sooner that you begin to make them the easier they will be to you  then at once the countess made a pilgrimage to mr goffe in search of funds wherewith to equip her girl properly for her new associations she was to go as lady anna lovel to stay with mrs lovel and miss lovel and the little lovels and she was to go as one who was to be the chosen bride of earl lovel of course she must be duly caparisoned mr goffe made difficultiesas lawyers always dobut the needful money was at last forthcoming representations had been made in high legal quartersto the custodians for the moment of the property which was to go to the established heir of the late earl they had been made conjointly by goffe and goffe and norton and flick and the money was forthcoming mr goffe suggested that a great deal could not be wanted all at once for the young ladys dress the countess smiled as she answered you hardly know mr goffe the straits to which we have been reduced if i tell you that this dress which i have on is the only one in which i can fitly appear even in your chambers perhaps you will think that i demean myself mr goffe was touched and signed a sufficient cheque they were going to succeed and then everything would be easy even if they did not succeed he could get it passed in the accounts and if not thatwell he had run greater risks than this for clients whose causes were of much less interest than this of the countess and her daughter  the countess had mentioned her own gown and had spoken strict truth in what she had said of itbut not a shilling of mr goffes money went to the establishment of a wardrobe for herself that her daughter should go down to yoxham rectory in a manner befitting the daughter of earl lovel was at this moment her chief object things were purchased by which the poor girl unaccustomed to such finery was astounded and almost stupefied two needlewomen were taken in at the lodgings in wyndham street parcels from swan and edgarsmarshall and snellgrove were not then or at least had not loomed to the grandeur of an entire block of housesaddressed to lady anna lovel were frequent at the door somewhat to the disgust of the shopmen who did not like to send goods to lady anna lovel in wyndham street but ready money was paid and the parcels came home lady anna poor girl was dismayed much by the parcels but she was at her wits end when the ladysmaid camea young lady herself so sweetly attired that lady anna would have envied her in the old cumberland days i shall not know what to say to her mamma said lady anna  it will all come in two days if you will only be equal to the occasion said the countess who in providing her child with this expensive adjunct had made some calculation that the more her daughter was made to feel the luxuries of aristocratic life the less prone would she be to adapt herself to the roughnesses of daniel thwaite the tailor  the countess put her daughter into the mailcoach and gave her much parting advice hold up your head when you are with them that is all that you have to do among them all your blood will be the best this theory of blood was one of which lady anna had never been able even to realise the meaning and remember this toothat you are in truth the most wealthy it is they that should honour you of course you will be courteous and gentle with themit is your nature but do not for a moment allow yourself to be conscious that you are their inferior lady annawho could think but little of her birthto whom it had been throughout her life a thing plaguesome rather than profitablecould remember only what she had been in cumberland and her binding obligation to the tailors son she could remember but that and the unutterable sweetness of the young man who had once appeared before herto whom she knew that she must be inferior hold up your head among them and claim your own always said the countess  the rectory carriage was waiting for her at the inn yard in york and in it was miss lovel when the hour had come it was thought better that the wise woman of the family should go than any other for the ladies of yoxham were quite as anxious as to the lady anna as was she in respect of them what sort of a girl was this that they were to welcome among them as the lady annawho had lived all her life with tailors and with a mother of whom up to quite a late date they had thought all manner of evil the young lord had reported well of her saying that she was not only beautiful but feminine of soft modest manners and in all respects like a lady the earl however was but a young man likely to be taken by mere beauty and it might be that the girl had been clever enough to hoodwink him so much evil had been believed that a report stating that all was good could not be accepted at once as true miss lovel would be sure to find out even in the space of an hours drive and miss lovel went to meet her she did not leave the carriage but sent the footman to help lady anna lovel from the coach my dear said miss lovel i am very glad to see you oh you have brought a maid we didnt think you would there is a seat behind which she can occupy  mamma thought it best i hope it is not wrong mrs lovel  i ought to have introduced myself i am miss lovel and the rector of yoxham is my brother it does not signify about the maid in the least we can do very well with her i suppose she has been with you a long time  no indeedshe only came the day before yesterday and so miss lovel learned the whole story of the ladysmaid  lady anna said very little but miss lovel explained a good many things during the journey the young lord was not at yoxham he was with a friend in scotland but would be home about the 20th the two boys were at home for the holidays but would go back to school in a fortnight minnie lovel the daughter had a governess the rectory for a parsonage was a tolerably large house and convenient it had been lord lovels early home but at present he was not much there he thinks it right to go to lovel grange during a part of the autumn i suppose you have seen lovel grange  never  oh indeed but you lived near itdid you not  no not nearabout fifteen miles i think i was born there but have never been there since i was a baby  ohyou were born there of course you know that it is lord lovels seat now i do not know that he likes it though the scenery is magnificent but a landlord has to live at least for some period of the year upon his property you saw my nephew  yes he came to us once  i hope you liked him we think him very nice but then he is almost the same as a son here do you care about visiting the poor  i have never tried said lady anna  oh dear  we have been so poor ourselveswe were just one of them then miss lovel perceived that she had made a mistake but she was generous enough to recognize the unaffected simplicity of the girl and almost began to think well of her  i hope you will come round the parish with us we shall be very glad yoxham is a large parish with scattered hamlets and there is plenty to do the manufactories are creeping up to us and we have already a large mill at yoxham lock my brother has to keep two curates now here we are my dear and i hope we shall be able to make you happy  mrs lovel did not like the maid and mr lovel did not like it at all and yet we heard when we were up in town that they literally had not anything to live on said the parson i hope that after all we may not be making fools of ourselves but there was no help for it and the maid was of course taken in  the children had been instructed to call their cousin lady annaunless they heard their mother drop the title and then they were to drop it also they were not so young but what they had all heard the indiscreet vigour with which their father had ridiculed the claim to the title and had been something at a loss to know whence the change had come perhaps they are as they call themselves the rector had said and if so heaven forbid that we should not give them their due after this the three young ones discussing the matter among themselves had made up their minds that lady anna was no cousin of theirsbut a humbug when however they saw her their hearts relented and the girl became soft and the boys became civil papa said minnie lovel on the second day i hope she is our cousin  i hope so too my dear  i think she is she looks as if she ought to be because she is so pretty  being pretty my dear is not enough you should love people because they are good  but i would not like all the good people to be my cousinswould you papa old widow grimes is a very good old woman but i dont want to have her for a cousin  my dear you are talking about what you dont understand  but minnie did in truth understand the matter better than her father before three or four days had passed she knew that their guest was lovablewhether cousin or no cousin and she knew also that the newcomer was of such nature and breeding as made her fit to be a cousin all the family had as yet called her lady anna but minnie thought that the time had come in which she might break through the law i think i should like to call you just anna if you will let me she said they two were in the guests bedroom and minnie was leaning against her new friends shoulder  oh i do so wish you would i do so hate to be called lady  but you are lady annaarnt you  and you are miss mary lovel but you wouldnt like everybody in the house to call you so and then there has been so much said about it all my life that it makes me quite unhappy i do so wish your mamma wouldnt call me lady anna whereupon minnie very demurely explained that she could not answer for her mamma but that she would always call her friend annawhen papa wasnt by  but minnie was better than her promise mamma she said the next day do you know that she hates to be called lady anna  what makes you think so  i am sure of it she told me so everybody has always been talking about it ever since she was born and she says she is so sick of it  but my dear people must be called by their names if it is her proper name she ought not to hate it i can understand that people should hate an assumed name  i am miss mary lovel but i should not at all like it if everybody called me miss mary the servants call me miss mary but if papa and aunt julia did so i should think they were scolding me  but lady anna is not papas daughter  she is his cousin isnt she his cousin mamma i dont think people ought to call their cousins lady anna i have promised that i wont cousin frederic said that she was his cousin what will he call her  i cannot tell my dear we shall all know her better by that time mrs lovel however followed her daughters lead and from that time the poor girl was anna to all of themexcept to the rector he listened and thought that he would try it but his heart failed him he would have preferred that she should be an impostor were that still possible he would so much have preferred that she should not exist at all he did not care for her beauty he did not feel the charm of her simplicity it was one of the hardships of the world that he should be forced to have her there in his rectory the lovel wealth was indispensable to the true heir of the lovels and on behalf of his nephew and his family he had been induced to consent but he could not love the interloper he still dreamed of coming surprises that would set the matter right in a manner that would be much preferable to a marriage the girl might be innocentas his wife and sister told him but he was sure that the mother was an intriguing woman it would be such a pity that they should have entertained the girl ifafter allthe woman should at last be but a pseudocountess as others had ceased to call her lady anna he could not continue to do so but he managed to live on with her without calling her by any name  in the meantime cousin anna went about among the poor with minnie and aunt julia and won golden opinions she was soft feminine almost humblebut still with a dash of humour in her when she was sufficiently at her ease with them to be happy there was very much in the life which she thoroughly enjoyed the green fields and the air which was so pleasant to her after the close heat of the narrow london streets and the bright parsonage garden and the pleasant services of the country churchand doubtless also the luxuries of a rich wellordered household those calculations of her mother had not been made without a true basis the softness the niceness the ease the grace of the people around her won upon her day by day and hour by hour the pleasant idleness of the drawingroom with its books and music and unstrained chatter of family voices grew upon her as so many new charms to come down with bright ribbons and clean unruffled muslin to breakfast with nothing to do which need ruffle them unbecomingly and then to dress for dinner with silk and gauds before ten days were over had made life beautiful to her she seemed to live among roses and perfumes there was no stern hardness in the life as there had of necessity been in that which she had ever lived with her mother the caresses of minnie lovel soothed and warmed her heartand every now and again when the eyes of aunt julia were not upon her she was tempted to romp with the boys oh that they had really been her brothers  but in the midst of all there was ever present to her the prospect of some coming wretchedness the life which she was leading could not be her life that earl was comingthat young apolloand he would again ask her to be his wife she knew that she could not be his wife she was there as she understood well that she might give all this wealth that was to be hers to the lovel family and when she refused to give herselfas the only way in which that wealth could be conveyedthey would turn her out from their pleasant home then she must go back to the other life and be the wife of daniel thwaite and soft things must be at an end with her     chapter xiv  the earl arrives   at the end of a fortnight the boys had gone back to school and lord lovel was to reach the rectory in time for dinner that evening there was a little stir throughout the rectory as an earl is an earl though he be in his uncles house and rank will sway even aunts and cousins the parson at present was a much richer man than the peerbut the peer was at the head of all the lovels and then it was expected that his poverty would quickly be made to disappear all that lovel money which had been invested in bank shares indian railways russian funds devon consols and coal mines was to become hisif not in one way then in another the earl was to be a topping man and the rectory cook was ordered to do her best the big bedroom had been made ready and the parson looked at his 99 port and his 16 margaux in those days men drank port and champagne at country houses was not yet a necessity to give the rector of yoxham his due it must be said of him that he would have done his very best for the head of his family had there been no large fortune within the young lords grasp the lovels had ever been true to the lovels with the exception of that late wretched earlthe lady annas father  but if the rector and his wife were alive to the importance of the expected arrival what must have been the state of lady anna they had met but once before and during that meeting they had been alone together there had grown up she knew not how during those few minutes a heavenly sweetness between them he had talked to her with a voice that had been to her ears as the voice of a godit had been so sweet and full of music he had caressed herbut with a caress so gentle and pure that it had been to her void of all taint of evil it had perplexed her for a momentbut had left no sense of wrong behind it he had told her that he loved herthat he would love her dearly but had not scared her in so telling her though she knew she could never give him back such love as that of which he spoke to her there had been a charm in it of which she delighted to dreamfancying that she could remember it for ever as a green island in her life but could so best remember it if she were assured that she should never see him more but now she was to see him again and the charm must be renewedor else the dream dispelled for ever alas it must be the latter she knew that the charm must be dispelled  but there was a doubt on her own mind whether it would not be dispelled without any effort on her part it would vanish at once if he were to greet her as the lovels had greeted her on her first coming she could partly understand that the manner of their meeting in london had thrust upon him a necessity for flattering tenderness with which he might well dispense when he met her among his family had he really loved herhad he meant to love herhe would hardly have been absent so long after her coming she had been glad that he had been absentso she assured herselfbecause there could never be any love between them daniel thwaite had told her that the brotherly love which had been offered was false lovemust be falsewas no love at all do brothers marry sisters and had not this man already told her that he wished to make her his wife and then there must never be another kiss daniel thwaite had told her that and he was not only her lover but her master also this was the rule by which she would certainly hold she would be true to daniel thwaite and yet she looked for the lords coming as one looks for the rising of the sun of an early morningwatching for that which shall make all the day beautiful  and he came the rector and his wife and aunt julia and minnie all went out into the hall to meet him and anna was left alone in the library where they were wont to congregate before dinner it was already past seven and every one was dressed a quarter of an hour was to be allowed to the lord and he was to be hurried up at once to his bedroom she would not see him till he came down ready and all hurried to lead his aunt to the diningroom she heard the scuffle in the hall there were kissesand a big kiss from minnie to her muchprized cousin fred and a loud welcome from the fullmouthed rector and where is annathe lord asked they were the first words he spoke and she heard them ah so plainly it was the same voicesweet genial and manly sweet to her beyond all sweetness that she could conceive  you shall see her when you come down from dressing said mrs lovelin a low voice but still audible to the solitary girl  i will see her before i go up to dress said the lord walking through them and in through the open door to the library so here you are i am so glad to see you i had sworn to go into scotland before the time was fixed for your comingbefore i had met youand i could not escape have you thought ill of me because i have not been here to welcome you sooner  nomy lord  there are horrible penalties for anybody who calls me lord in this houseare there not aunt jane but i see my uncle wants his dinner  ill take you upstairs fred said minnie who was still holding her cousins hand  i am coming i will only say that i would sooner see you here than in any house in england  then he went and during the few minutes that he spent in dressing little or nothing was spoke in the library the parson in his heart was not pleased by the enthusiasm with which the young man greeted this new cousin and yet why should he not be enthusiastic if it was intended that they should be man and wife  now lady anna said the rector as he offered her his arm to lead her out to dinner it was but a mild corrective to the warmth of his nephew the lord lingered a moment with his aunt in the library  have you not got beyond that with her yet he asked  your uncle is more old fashioned than you are fred things did not go so quick when he was young  in the evening he came and lounged on a doubleseated ottoman behind her and she soon found herself answering a string of questions had she been happy at yoxham did she like the place what had she been doing then you know mrs grimes already she laughed as she said that she did know mrs grimes the lion of yoxham is mrs grimes she is supposed to have all the misfortunes and all the virtues to which humanity is subject and how do you and minnie get on minnie is my prime minister the boys i suppose teased you out of your life  i did like them so much i never knew a boy till i saw them lord lovel  they take care to make themselves known at any rate but they are nice goodhumoured ladstaking after their mother dont tell their father i said so do you think it pretty about here  beautifully pretty  just about yoxhambecause there is so much wood but this is not the beautiful part of yorkshire you know i wonder whether we could make an expedition to wharfedale and bolton abbey you would say that the wharfe was pretty well try and plan it we should have to sleep out one night but that would make it all the jollier there isnt a better inn in england than the devonshire armsand i dont think a pleasanter spot aunt janecouldnt we go for one night to bolton abbey  it is very far frederic  thirty miles or sothat ought to be nothing in yorkshire well manage it we could get posthorses from york and the carriage would take us all my uncle you must know is very chary about the carriage horses thinking that the corn of idlenesswhich is destructive to young men and womenis very good for cattle but well manage it and you shall jump over the stryd then he told her the story how the youth was drownedand how the monks moaned and he got away to other legends to the white doe of rylston and landseers picture of the abbey in olden times she had heard nothing before of these thingsor indeed of such things and the hearing them was very sweet to her the parson who was still displeased went to sleep minnie had been sent to bed and aunt julia and aunt jane every now and again put in a word it was resolved before the evening was over that the visit should be made to bolton abbey of course their nephew ought to have opportunities of making love to the girl he was doomed to marry good night dearest he said when she went to bed she was sure that the last word had been so spoken and that no ear but her own had heard it she could not tell him that such word should not be spoken and yet she felt that the word would be almost as offensive as the kiss to daniel thwaite she must contrive some means of telling him that she could not would not must not be his dearest  she had now received two letters from her mother since she had been at yoxham and in each of them there were laid down for her plain instructions as to her conduct it was now the middle of august and it was incumbent upon her to allow matters so to arrange themselves that the marriage might be declared to be a settled thing when the case should come on in november mr goffe and mr flick had met each other and everything was now understood by the two parties of lawyers if the earl and lady anna were then engaged with the mutual consent of all interestedand so engaged that a day could be fixed for the weddingthen when the case was opened in court would the solicitorgeneral declare that it was the intention of lord lovel to make no further opposition to the claims of the countess and her daughter and it would only remain for serjeant bluestone to put in the necessary proofs of the cumberland marriage and of the baptism of lady anna the solicitorgeneral would at the same time state to the court that an alliance had been arranged between these distant cousins and that in that way everything would be settled butand in this clause of her instructions the countess was most urgentthis could not be done unless the marriage were positively settled mr flick had been very urgent in pointing out to mr goffe that in truth their evidence was very strong to prove that when the earl married the now socalled countess his first wife was still living though they gave no credit to the woman who now called herself the countess but in either casewhether the italian countess were now alive or now deadthe daughter would be illegitimate and the second marriage void if their surmise on this head should prove to be well founded but the italian party could of itself do nothing and the proposed marriage would set everything right but the evidence must be brought into court and further sifted unless the marriage were a settled thing by november all this the countess explained at great length in her letters calling upon her daughter to save herself her mother and the family  lady anna answered the first epistleor rather wrote another in return to itbut she said nothing of her noble lover except that lord lovel had not as yet come to yoxham she confined herself to simple details of her daily life and a prayer that her dear mother might be happy the second letter from the countess was severe in its toneasking why no promise had been made no assurance givenno allusion made to the only subject that could now be of interest she implored her child to tell her that she was disposed to listen to the earls suit this letter was in her pocket when the earl arrived and she took it out and read it again after the earl had whispered in her ear that word so painfully sweet  she proposed to answer it before breakfast on the following morning at yoxham rectory they breakfasted at ten and she was always up at least before eight she determined as she laid herself down that she would think of it all night it might be best she believed to tell her mother the whole truththat she had already promised everything to daniel thwaite and that she could not go back from her word then she began to build castles in the aircastles which she declared to herself must ever be in the airof which lord lovel and not daniel thwaite was the hero owner and master she assured herself that she was not picturing to herself any prospect of a really possible life but was simply dreaming of an impossible elysium how many people would she make happy were she able to let that young phoebus know in one halfuttered wordor with a single silent glancethat she would in truth be his dearest it could not be so she was well aware of that but surely she might dream of it all the cares of that careful careworn mother would then be at an end how delightful would it be to her to welcome that sorrowful one to her own bright home and to give joy where joy had never yet been known how all the lawyers would praise her and tell her that she had saved a noble family from ruin she already began to have feelings about the family to which she had been a stranger before she had come among the lovels and if it really would make him happy this phoebus how glorious would that be how fit he was to be made happy daniel had said that he was sordid false fraudulent and a foolbut daniel did not could not understand the nature of the lovels and then she herselfhow would it be with her she had given her heart to daniel thwaite and she had but one heart to give had it not been for that it would have been very sweet to love that young curled darling there were two sorts of life and now she had had an insight into each daniel had told her that this soft luxurious life was thoroughly bad he could not have known when saying so how much was done for their poor neighbours by such as even these lovels it could not be wrong to be soft and peaceful and pretty to enjoy sweet smells to sit softly and eat off delicately painted china platesas long as no one was defrauded and many were comforted daniel thwaite she believed never went to church here at yoxham there were always morning prayers and they went to church twice every sunday she had found it very pleasant to go to church and to be led along in the easy path of selfindulgent piety on which they all walked at yoxham the church seats at yoxham were broad with soft cushions and the hassocks were well stuffed surely daniel thwaite did not know everything as she thus built her castles in the aircastles so impossible to be inhabitedshe fell asleep before she had resolved what letter she should write  but in the morning she did write her letter it must be writtenand when the family were about the house she would be too disturbed for so great an effort it ran as follows      yoxham friday     dearest mamma     i am much obliged for your letter which i got the    day before yesterday lord lovel came here yesterday    or perhaps i might have answered it then everybody    here seems to worship him almost and he is so good to    everybody we are all to go on a visit to bolton abbey    and sleep at an inn somewhere and i am sure i shall like    it very much for they say it is most beautiful if you    look at the map it is nearly in a straight line between    here and kendal but only much nearer to york the day is    not fixed yet but i believe it will be very soon     i shall be so glad if the lawsuit can be got over for    your sake dearest mamma i wish they could let you have    your title and your share of the money and let lord lovel    have the rest because he is head of the family that    would be fairest and i cant see why it should not be so    your share would be quite enough for you and me i cant    say anything about what you speak of he has said nothing    and im sure i hope he wont i dont think i could do it    and i dont think the lawyers ought to want me to i think    it is very wrong of them to say so we are strangers and    i feel almost sure that i could never be what he would    want i dont think people ought to marry for money     dearest mamma pray do not be angry with me if you are    you will kill me i am very happy here and nobody has    said anything about my going away couldnt you ask    serjeant bluestone whether something couldnt be done to    divide the money so that there might be no more law i am    sure he could if he liked with mr goffe and the other    men     dearest mamma i am    your most affectionate daughter     anna lovel   when the moment came and the pen was in her hand she had not the courage to mention the name of daniel thwaite she knew that the fearful story must be told but at this moment she comforted herselfor tried to comfort herselfby remembering that daniel himself had enjoined that their engagement must yet for a while be kept secret     chapter xv  wharfedale   the visit to wharfedale was fixed for monday and tuesday and on the monday morning they started after an early breakfast the party consisted of aunt jane aunt julia lady anna minnie and mr cross one of the rectors curates the rector would not accompany them excusing himself to the others generally on the ground that he could not be absent from his parish on those two days to his wife and sister he explained that he was not able as yet to take pleasure in such a party as this with lady anna there was no knowing he said what might happen it was evident that he did not mean to open his heart to lady anna at any rate till the marriage should be settled  an open carriage which would take them all was orderedwith four post horses and two antiquated postboys with white hats and blue jackets and yellow breeches minnie and the curate sat on the box and there was a servant in the rumble rooms at the inn had been ordered and everything was done in proper lordly manner the sun shone brightly above their heads and anna having as yet received no further letter from her mother was determined to be happy four horses took them to bolton bridge and then having eaten lunch and ordered dinner they started for their ramble in the woods  the first thing to be seen at bolton abbey is of course the abbey the abbey itself as a ruina ruin not so ruinous but that a part of it is used for a modern churchis very well but the glory of bolton abbey is in the river which runs round it and in the wooded banks which overhang it no more luxuriant pasture no richer foliage no brighter water no more picturesque arrangement of the freaks of nature aided by the art and taste of man is to be found perhaps in england lady anna who had been used to wilder scenery in her native county was delighted nothing had ever been so beautiful as the abbeynothing so lovely as the running wharfe might they not climb up among those woods on the opposite bank lord lovel declared that of course they would climb up among the woodsit was for that purpose they had come that was the way to the strydover which he was determined that lady anna should be made to jump  but the river below the abbey is to be traversed by steppingstones which to the female uninitiated foot appear to be full of danger the wharfe here is no insignificant brook to be overcome by a long stride and a jump there is a causeway of perhaps forty stones across it each some eighteen inches distant from the other which flat and excellent though they be are perilous from their number mrs lovel who knew the place of old had begun by declaring that no consideration should induce her to cross the water aunt julia had proposed that they should go along the other bank on the abbey side of the river and thence cross by the bridge half a mile up but the earl was resolved that he would take his cousin over the steppingstones and minnie and the curate were equally determined minnie indeed had crossed the river and was back again while the matter was still being discussed aunt julia who was stronglimbed as well as strongminded at last assented the curate having promised all necessary aid mrs lovel seated herself at a distance to see the exploit and then lord lovel started with lady anna turning at every stone to give a hand to his cousin  oh they are very dreadful said lady anna when about a dozen had been passed  the black water was flowing fast fast beneath her feet the stones became smaller and smaller to her imagination and the apertures between them broader and broader  dont look at the water dear said the lord but come on quick  i cant come on quick i shall never get over oh frederic that morning she had promised that she would call him frederic even daniel could not think it wrong that she should call her cousin by his christian name its no good i cant do that oneits crooked maynt i go back again  you cant go back dear it is only up to your knees if you do go in but take my hand thereall the others are straightyou must come on or aunt julia will catch us after two or three times youll hop over like a milkmaid there are only halfadozen more here we are isnt that pretty  i thought i never should have got over i wouldnt go back for anything but it is lovely and i am so much obliged to you for bringing me here we can go back another way  oh yesbut now well get up the bank give me your hand then he took her along the narrow twisting steep paths to the top of the wooded bank and they were soon beyond the reach of aunt julia minnie and the curate  it was very pleasant very lovely and very joyous but there was still present to her mind some great fear the man was there with her as an acknowledged lovera lover acknowledged to be so by all but herself but she could not lawfully have any lover but him who was now slaving at his trade in london she must tell this gallant lord that he must not be her lover and as they went along she was always meditating how she might best tell him when the moment for telling him should come but on that morning during the entire walk he said no word to her which seemed quite to justify the telling he called her by sweet petting namesanna my girl pretty coz and such like he would hold her hand twice longer than he would have held that of either aunt in helping her over this or that little difficultyand would help her when no help was needed he talked to her of small things as though he and she must needs have kindred interests he spoke to her of his uncle as though near as his uncle was the connection were not nigh so close as that between him and her she understood it with a half understandingfeeling that in all this he was in truth making love to her and yet telling herself that he said no more than cousinship might warrant but the autumn colours were bright and the river rippled and the light breeze came down from the mountains and the last of the wild flowers were still sweet in the woods after a while she was able to forget her difficulties to cease to think of daniel and to find in her cousin not a lover but simply the pleasantest friend that fortune had ever sent her  and so they came all alonefor aunt julia though both limbs and mind were strong had not been able to keep up with themall alone to the stryd the stryd is a narrow gully or passage which the waters have cut for themselves in the rocks perhaps five or six feet broad where the river passes but narrowed at the top by an overhanging mass which in old days withstood the wearing of the stream till the softer stone below was cut away and then was left bridging over a part of the chasm below there goes a story that a mountain chieftains son hunting the stag across the valley when the floods were out in leaping the stream from rock to rock failed to make good his footing was carried down by the rushing waters and dashed to pieces among the rocks lord lovel told her the tale as they sat looking at the now innocent brook and then bade her follow him as he leaped from edge to edge  i couldnt do itindeed i couldnt said the shivering girl  it is barely a step said the earl jumping over and back again going from this side you couldnt miss to do it if you tried  im sure i should tumble in it makes me sick to look at you while you are leaping  youd jump over twice the distance on dry ground  then let me jump on dry ground  ive set my heart upon it do you think id ask you if i wasnt sure  you want to make another legend of me  i want to leave aunt julia behind which we shall certainly do  oh but i cant afford to drown myself just that you may run away from aunt julia you can run by yourself and i will wait for aunt julia  that is not exactly my plan be a brave girl now and stand up and do as i bid you  then she stood up on the edge of the rock holding tight by his arm how pleasant it was to be thus frightened with such a protector near her to insure her safety and yet the chasm yawned and the water ran rapid and was very black but if he asked her to make the spring of course she must make it what would she not have done at his bidding  i can almost touch you you see he said as he stood opposite with his arm out ready to catch her hand  oh frederic i dont think i can  you can very well if you will only jump  it is ever so many yards  it is three feet ill back aunt julia to do it for a promise of ten shillings to the infirmary  ill give the ten shillings if youll only let me off  i wont let you offso you might as well come at once  then she stood and shuddered for a moment looking with beseeching eyes up into his face of course she meant to jump of course she would have been disappointed had aunt julia come and interrupted her jumping yesshe would jump into his arms she knew that he would catch her at that moment her memory of daniel thwaite had become faint as the last shaded glimmer of twilight she shut her eyes for half a moment then opened them looked into his face and made her spring as she did so she struck her foot against a rising ledge of the rock and though she covered more than the distance in her leap she stumbled as she came to the ground and fell into his arms she had sprained her ankle in her effort to recover herself  are you hurt he asked holding her close to his side  noi think notonly a little that is i was so awkward  i shall never forgive myself if you are hurt  there is nothing to forgive ill sit down for a moment it was my own fault because i was so stupidand it does not in the least signify i know what it is now ive sprained my ankle  there is nothing so painful as that  it hurts a little but it will go off it wasnt the jump but i twisted my foot somehow if you look so unhappy ill get up and jump back again  i am unhappy dearest  oh but you mustnt the prohibition might be taken as applying to the epithet of endearment and thereby her conscience be satisfied then he bent over her looking anxiously into her face as she winced with the pain and he took her hand and kissed it oh no she said gently struggling to withdraw the hand which he held here is aunt julia you had better just move not that she would have cared a straw for the eyes of aunt julia had it not been that the image of daniel thwaite again rose strong before her mind then aunt julia and the curate and minnie were standing on the rock within a few paces of them but on the other side of the stream  is there anything the matter asked miss lovel  she has sprained her ankle in jumping over the stryd and she cannot walk perhaps mr cross would not mind going back to the inn and getting a carriage the road is only a quarter of a mile above us and we could carry her up  how could you be so foolish frederic as to let her jump it said the aunt  dont mind about my folly now the thing is to get a carriage for anna the curate immediately hurried back jumping over the stryd as the nearest way to the inn and minnie also sprung across the stream so that she might sit down beside her cousin and offer consolation aunt julia was left alone and after a while was forced to walk back by herself to the bridge  is she much hurt asked minnie  i am afraid she is hurt said the lord  dear dear minnie it does not signify a bit said anna lavishing on her younger cousin the caresses which fate forbade her to give to the elder i know i could walk home in a few minutes i am better now it is one of those things which go away almost immediately ill try and stand frederic if youll let me then she raised herself leaning upon him and declared that she was nearly welland then was reseated still leaning on him  shall we attempt to get her up to the road minnie or wait till mr cross comes to help us lady anna declared that she did not want any helpcertainly not mr crosss help and that she could do very well just with minnies arm they waited there sitting on the rocks for half an hour saying but little to each other throwing into the stream the dry bits of stick which the last flood had left upon the stones and each thinking how pleasant it was to sit there and dream listening to the running waters then lady anna hobbled up to the carriage road helped by a stronger arm than that of her cousin minnie  of course there was some concern and dismay at the inn embrocations were used and doctors were talked of and heads were shaken and a couch in the sittingroom was prepared so that the poor injured one might eat her dinner without being driven to the solitude of her own bedroom     chapter xvi  for ever   on the next morning the poor injured one was quite wellbut she was still held to be subject to piteous concern the two aunts shook their heads when she said that she would walk down to the steppingstones that morning before starting for yoxham but she was quite sure that the sprain was gone and the distance was not above half a mile they were not to start till two oclock would minnie come down with her and ramble about among the ruins  minnie come out on the lawn said the lord dont you come with me and annayou can go where you like about the place by yourself  why maynt i come  never mind but do as youre bid  i know you are going to make love to cousin anna  you are an impertinent little imp  i am so glad frederic because i do like her i was sure she was a real cousin dont you think she is veryvery nice  pretty well  is that all  you go away and dont teaseor else ill never bring you to the stryd again so it happened that lord lovel and lady anna went across the meadow together down to the river and sauntered along the margin till they came to the steppingstones he passed over and she followed him almost without a word her heart was so full that she did not think now of the water running at her feet it had hardly seemed to her to make any difficulty as to the passage she must follow him whither he would lead her but her mind misgave herthat they would not return sweet loving friends as they went out we wont climb said he because it might try your ankle too much but we will go in here by the meadow i always think this is one of the prettiest views there is he said throwing himself upon the grass  it is all prettiest it is like fairy land does the duke let people come here always  yes i fancy so  he must be very goodnatured do you know the duke  i never saw him in my life  a duke sounds so awful to me  youll get used to them some day wont you sit down then she glided down to the ground at a little distance from him and he at once shifted his place so as to be almost close to her your foot is quite well  quite well  i thought for a few minutes that there was going to be some dreadful accident and i was so mad with myself for having made you jump it if you had broken your leg how would you have borne it  like other people i suppose  would you have been angry with me  i hope not i am sure not you were doing the best you could to give me pleasure i dont think i should have been angry at all i dont think we are ever angry with the people we really like  do you really like me  yesi like you  is that all  is not that enough  she answered the question as she might have answered it had it been allowed to her as to any girl that was free to toy with his love knowing that she meant to accept it it was easier so than in any other way but her heart within her was sad and could she have stopped his further speech by any word rough and somewhat rude she would have done so in truth she did not know how to answer him roughly he deserved from her that all her words should be soft and sweet and pleasant she believed him to be good and generous and kind and loving the hard things which daniel thwaite had said of him had all vanished from her mind to her thinking it was no sin in him that he should want her wealthhe the earl to whom by right the wealth of the lovels should belong the sin was rather hersin that she kept it from him and then if she could receive all that he was willing to give his heart his name his house and home and sweet belongings of natural gifts and personal advantages how much more would she take than what she gave she could not speak to him roughly thoughalasthe time had come in which she must speak to him truly it was not fitting that a girl should have two lovers  no dearnot enough he said  it can hardly be accounted a fault in him that at this time he felt sure of her love she had been so soft in her ways with him so gracious yielding and pretty in her manners so manifestly pleased by his company so prone to lean upon him that it could hardly be that he should think otherwise she had told him when he spoke to her more plainly up in london than he had yet done since they had been together in the country that she could never never be his wife but what else could a girl say at a first meeting with a proposed lover would he have wished that she should at once have given herself up without one maidenly scruple one word of feminine recusancy if loves course be made to run too smooth it loses all its poetry and half its sweetness but now they knew each otherat least he thought they did the scruple might now be put away the feminine recusancy had done its work for himselfhe felt that he loved her in very truth she was not harsh or loudvulgar or given to coarse manners as might have been expected and as he had been warned by his friends that he would find her that she was very beautiful all her enemies had acknowledgedand he was quite assured that her enemies had been right she was the lady anna lovel and he felt that he could make her his own without one shade of regret to mar his triumph of the tailors sonthough he had been warned of him toohe made no account whatever that had been a slander which only endeared the girl to him the morea slander against lady anna lovel which had been an insult to his family among all the ladies he knew daughters of peers and highbred commoners there were nonethere was not one less likely so to disgrace herself than lady anna lovel his sweet cousin  do not think me too hurried dear if i speak to you again so soon of that of which i spoke once before he had turned himself round upon his arm so as to be very close to herso that he would look full into her face and if chance favoured him could take her hand he paused as though for an answer but she did not speak to him a word it is not long yet since we first met  oh nonot long  and i know not what your feelings are but in very truth i can say that i love you dearly had nothing else come in the way to bring us together i am sure that i should have loved you she poor child believed him as though he were speaking to her the sweetest gospel and he too believed himself he was easy of heart perhaps but not deceitful anxious enough for his position in the world but not meanly covetous had she been distasteful to him as a woman he would have refused to make himself rich by the means that had been suggested to him as it was he desired her as much as her money and had she given herself to him then would never have rememberedwould never have known that the match had been sordid do you believe me he asked  oh yes  and shall it be so  her face had been turned away but now she slowly moved her neck so that she could look at him should she be false to all her vows and try whether happiness might not be gained in that way the manner of doing it passed through her mind in that moment she would write to daniel and remind him of his promise to set her free if she so willed it she would never see him again she would tell him that she had striven to see things as he would have taught her and had failed she would abuse herself and ask for his pardonbut having thus judged for herself she would never go back from such judgment it might be doneif only she could persuade herself that it were good to do it but as she thought of it there came upon her a prick of conscience so sharp that she could not welcome the devil by leaving it unheeded how could she be foresworn to one who had been so absolutely goodwhose all had been spent for her and for her motherwhose whole life had been one long struggle of friendship on her behalfwho had been the only playfellow of her youth the only man she had ever ventured to kissthe man whom she truly loved he had warned her against these gauds which were captivating her spirit and now in the moment of her peril she would remember his warnings  shall it be so lord lovel asked again just stretching out his hand so that he could touch the fold of her garment  it cannot be so she said  cannot be  it cannot be so lord lovel  it cannot nowor do you mean the word to be for ever  for ever she replied  i know that i have been hurried and sudden he saidpurposely passing by her last assurance and i do feel that you have a right to resent the seeming assurance of such haste but in our case dearest the interests of so many are concerned the doubts and fears the wellbeing and even the future conduct of all our friends are so bound up by the result that i had hoped you would have pardoned that which would otherwise have been unpardonable oh heavenshad it not been for daniel thwaite how full of grace how becoming how laden with flattering courtesy would have been every word that he had uttered to her but he continued if it really be that you cannot love me  oh lord lovel pray ask of me no further question  i am bound to ask and to knowfor all our sakes  then she rose quickly to her feet and with altered gait and changed countenance stood over him i am engaged she said to be marriedto mr daniel thwaite she had told it all and felt that she had told her own disgrace he rose also but stood mute before her this was the very thing of which they had all warned him but as to which he had been so sure that it was not so she saw it all in his eyes reading much more there than he could read in hers she was degraded in his estimation and felt that evil worse almost than the loss of his love for the last three weeks she had been a real lovel among the lovels that was all over now let this lawsuit go as it might let them give to her all the money and make the title which she hated ever so sure she never again could be the equal friend of her gentle relative earl lovel minnie would never again spring into her arms swearing that she would do as she pleased with her own cousin she might be lady anna but never anna again to the two ladies at the rectory the perfume of his rank had been just scented to be dashed away from her for ever it is a secret at present she said or i should have told you sooner if it is right that you should repeat it of course you must  oh anna  it is true  oh anna for your sake as well as mine this makes me wretched indeed  as for the money lord lovel if it be mine to give you shall have it  you think then it is that which i have wanted  it is that which the family wants and i can understand that it should be wanted as for myselffor mamma and meyou can hardly understand how it has been with us when we were young you despise mr thwaitebecause he is a tailor  i am sure he is not fit to be the husband of lady anna lovel  when lady anna lovel had no other friend in the world he sheltered her and gave her a house to live in and spent his earnings in her defence and would not yield when all those who might have been her friends strove to wrong her where would mamma have beenand ihad there been no mr thwaite to comfort us he was our only friendhe and his father they were all we had in my childhood i had never a kind word from another childbut only from him would it have been right that he should have asked for anything and that i should have refused it  he should not have asked for this said lord lovel hoarsely  why not he as well as you he is as much a man if i could believe in your love after two days lord lovel could i not trust his after twenty years of friendship  you knew that he was beneath you  he was not beneath me he was above me we were poorwhile he and his father had money which we took he could give while we received he was strong while we were weakand was strong to comfort us and then lord lovel what knew i of rank living under his fathers wing they told me i was the lady anna and the children scouted me my mother was a countess so she swore and i at least believed her but if ever rank and title were a profitless burden they were to her do you think that i had learned then to love my rank  you have learned better now  i have learnedbut whether better i may doubt there are lessons which are quickly learned and there are they who say that such are the devils lessons i have not been strong enough not to learn but i must forget again lord lovel and you must forget also he hardly knew how to speak to her nowwhether it would be fit for him even to wish to persuade her to be his after she had told him that she had given her troth to a tailor his uneasy thoughts prompted him with ideas which dismayed him could he take to his heart one who had been pressed close in so vile a grasp could he accept a heart that had once been promised to a tailors workman would not all the world know and say that he had done it solely for the moneyeven should he succeed in doing it and yet to fail in this enterpriseto abandon allto give up so enticing a road to wealth then he remembered what he had saidhow he had pledged himself to abandon the lawsuithow convinced he had been that this girl was heiress to the lovel wealth who now told him that she had engaged herself to marry a tailor  there was nothing more that either of them could say to the other at the moment and they went back in silence to the inn     chapter xvii  the journey home   in absolute silence lord lovel and lady anna walked back to the inn he had been dumbfounderednearly so by her first abrupt statement and then altogether by the arguments with which she had defended herself she had nothing further to say she had indeed said all and had marvelled at her own eloquence while she was speaking nor was there absent from her a certain pride in that she had done the thing that was right and had dared to defend herself she was full of regretsalmost of remorse but nevertheless she was proud he knew it all now and one of her great difficulties had been overcome  and she was fully resolved that as she had dared to tell him and to face his anger his reproaches his scorn she would not falter before the scorn and the reproaches or the anger of the other lovelsof any of the lovels of yoxham her mothers reproaches would be dreadful to her her mothers anger would wellnigh kill her her mothers scorn would scorch her very soul but sufficient for the day was the evil thereof at the present moment she could be strong with the strength she had assumed so she walked in at the sittingroom window with a bold front and the earl followed her the two aunts were there and it was plain to them both that something was astray between the lovers they had said among themselves that lady anna would accept the offer the moment that it was in form made to her to their eyes the manner of their guest had been the manner of a girl eager to be wooed but they had both imagined that their delicately nurtured and fastidious nephew might too probably be offended by some solecism in conduct some falling away from feminine grace such as might too readily be shown by one whose early life had been subjected to rough associates even now it occurred to each of them that it had been so the earl seated himself in a chair and took up a book which they had brought with them lady anna stood at the open window looking across at the broad field and the river bank beyond but neither of them spoke a word there had certainly been some quarrel then aunt julia in the cause of wisdom asked a question  where is minnie did not minnie go with you  no said the earl she went in some other direction at my bidding mr cross is with her i suppose it was evident from the tone of his voice that the displeasure of the head of all the lovels was very great  we start soon i suppose said lady anna  after lunch my dear it is hardly one yet  i will go up all the same and see about my things  shall i help you my dear asked mrs lovel  oh no i would sooner do it alone then she hurried into her room and burst into a flood of tears as soon as the door was closed behind her  frederic what ails her asked aunt julia  if anything ails her she must tell you herself said the lord  something is amiss you cannot wonder that we should be anxious knowing that we know how great is the importance of all this  i cannot help your anxiety just at present aunt julia but you should always remember that there will be slips between the cup and the lip  then there has been a slip i knew it would be so i always said so and so did my brother  i wish you would all remember that about such an affair as this the less said the better so saying the lord walked out through the window and sauntered down to the river side  its all over said aunt julia  i dont see why we should suppose that at present said aunt jane  its all over i knew it as soon as i saw her face when she came in she has said something or done something and its all off it will be a matter of over twenty thousand pounds a year  hell be sure to marry somebody with money said aunt jane what with his title and his being so handsome he is certain to do well you know  nothing like that will come in his way i heard mr flick say that it was equal to half a million of money and then it would have been at once if he goes up to london and about just as he is hell be head over ears in debt before anybody knows what he is doing i wonder what it is he likes pretty girls and theres no denying that shes handsome  perhaps she wouldnt have him  thats impossible jane she came down here on purpose to have him she went out with him this morning to be made love to they were together three times longer yesterday and he came home as sweet as sugar to her i wonder whether she can have wanted to make some condition about the money  what condition  that she and her mother should have it in their own keeping  she doesnt seem to be that sort of a young woman said aunt jane  theres no knowing what that mr goffe serjeant bluestone and her mother may have put her up to frederic wouldnt stand that kind of thing for a minute and he would be quite right better anything than that a man shouldnt be his own master i think youd better go up to her jane shell be more comfortable with you than with me then aunt jane obedient as usual went up to her young cousins bedroom  in the meantime the young lord was standing on the rivers brink thinking what he would do he had in truth very much of which to think and points of most vital importance as to which he must resolve what should be his action must this announcement which he had heard from his cousin dissolve for ever the prospect of his marriage with her or was it open to him still as a nobleman a gentleman and a man of honour to make use of all those influences which he might command with the view of getting rid of that impediment of a previous engagement being very ignorant of the world at large and altogether ignorant of this man in particular he did not doubt that the tailor might be bought off then he was sure that all who would have access to lady anna would help him in such a cause and that her own mother would be the most forward to do so the girl would hardly hold to such a purpose if all the worldall her own world were against her she certainly would be beaten from it if a bribe sufficient were offered to the tailor that this must be done for the sake of the lovel family so that lady anna lovel might not be known to have married a tailor was beyond a doubt but it was not so clear to him that he could take to himself as his countess her who with her own lips had told him that she intended to be the bride of a working artisan as he thought of this as his imagination went to work on all the abominable circumstances of such a betrothal he threw from his hand into the stream with all the vehemence of passion a little twig which he held it was too too frightful too disgusting and then so absolutely unexpected so unlike her personal demeanour so contrary to the look of her eyes to the tone of her voice to every motion of her body she had been sweet and gentle and gracious till he had almost come to think that her natural feminine gifts of ladyship were more even than her wealth of better savour than her rank were equal even to her beauty which he had sworn to himself during the past night to be unsurpassed and this sweet one had told himthis one so soft and graciousnot that she was doomed by some hard fate to undergo the degrading thraldom but that she herself had willingly given herself to a working tailor from love and gratitude and free selection it was a marvel to him that a thing so delicate should have so little sense of her own delicacy he did not think that he could condescend to take the tailors place  but if notif he would not take it or if as might still be possible the tailors place could not be made vacant for himwhat then he had pledged his belief in the justice of his cousins claim and had told her that believing his own claim to be unjust in no case would he prosecute it was he now bound by that assurancebound to it even to the making of the tailors fortune or might he absent himself from any further action in the matter leaving it entirely in the hands of the lawyers might it not be best for her happiness that he should do so he had been told that even though he should not succeed there might arise almost interminable delay the tailor would want his money before he married and thus she might be rescued from her degradation till she should be old enough to understand it and yet how could he claim that of which he had said now a score of times that he knew that it was not his own could he cease to call this girl by the name which all his people had acknowledged as her own because she had refused to be his wife and declare his conviction that she was baseborn only because she had preferred to his own the addresses of a lowborn man reeking with the sweat of a tailors board no he could not do that let her marry but the sweeper of a crossing and he must still call her lady annaif he called her anything  something must be done however he had been told by the lawyers how the matter might be made to right itself if he and the young lady could at once agree to be man and wife but he had not been told what would follow should she decline to accept his offer mr flick and the solicitorgeneral must know how to shape their course before november came roundand would no doubt want all the time to shape it that he could give them what was he to say to mr flick and to the solicitorgeneral was he at liberty to tell to them the secret which the girl had told to him that he was at liberty to say that she had rejected his offer must be a matter of course but might he go beyond that and tell them the whole story it would be most expedient for many reasons that they should know it on her behalf even it might be most salutarywith that view of liberating her from the grasp of her humiliating lover but she had told it him against her own interests at her own peril to her own infinite sorrowin order that she might thus allay hopes in which he would otherwise have persevered he knew enough of the little schemes and byways of love of the generosity and selfsacrifice of lovers to feel that he was bound to confidence she had told him that if needs were he might repeat her talebut she had told him at the same time that her tale was a secret he could not go with her secret to a lawyers chambers and there divulge in the course of business that which had been extracted from her by the necessity to which she had submitted of setting him free he could write to mr flickif that at last was his resolvethat a marriage was altogether out of the question but he could not tell him why it was so  he wandered slowly on along the river having decided only on thisonly on this as a certaintythat he must tell her secret neither to the lawyers nor to his own people then as he walked a little hand touched his behind and when he turned minnie lovel took him by the arm why are you all alone fred  i am meditating how wicked the world isand girls in particular  where is cousin anna  up at the house i suppose  is she wicked  dont you know that everybody is wicked because eve ate the apple  adam ate it too  who bade him  the devil said the child whispering  but he spoke by a womans mouth why dont you go in and get ready to go  so i will tell me one thing fred may i be a bridesmaid when you are married  i dont think you can  i have set my heart upon it why not  because youll be married first  thats nonsense fred and you know its nonsense isnt cousin anna to be your wife  look here my darling im awfully fond of you and think you the prettiest little girl in the world but if you ask impertinent questions ill never speak to you again do you understand she looked up into his face and did understand that he was in earnest and leaving him walked slowly across the meadow back to the house alone tell them not to wait lunch for me he hollowed after herand she told her aunt julia that cousin frederic was very sulky down by the river and that they were not to wait for him  when mrs lovel went upstairs into lady annas room not a word was said about the occurrence of the morning the elder lady was afraid to ask a question and the younger was fully determined to tell nothing even had a question been asked her lord lovel might say what he pleased her secret was with him and he could tell it if he chose she had given him permission to do so of which no doubt he would avail himself but on her own account she would say nothing and when questioned she would merely admit the fact she would neither defend her engagement nor would she submit to have it censured if they pleased she would return to her mother in london at any shortest possible notice  the party lunched almost in silence and when the horses were ready lord lovel came in to help them into the carriage when he had placed the three ladies he desired minnie to take the fourth seat saying that he would sit with mr cross on the box minnie looked at his face but there was still the frown there and she obeyed him without any remonstrance during the whole of the long journey home there was hardly a word spoken lady anna knew that she was in disgrace and was ignorant how much of her story had been told to the two elder ladies she sat almost motionless looking out upon the fields and accepting her position as one that was no longer thought worthy of notice of course she must go back to london she could not continue to live at yoxham neither spoken to nor speaking minnie went to sleep and minnies mother and aunt now and then addressed a few words to each other anna felt sure that to the latest day of her existence she would remember that journey on their arrival at the rectory door mr cross helped the ladies out of the carriage while the lord affected to make himself busy with the shawls and luggage then he vanished and was seen no more till he appeared at dinner  what sort of a trip have you had asked the rector addressing himself to the three ladies indifferently  for a moment nobody answered him and then aunt julia spoke it was very pretty as it always is at bolton in summer we were told that the duke has not been there this year at all the inn was comfortable and i think that the young people enjoyed themselves yesterday very much the subject was too important too solemn too great to allow of even a word to be said about it without proper consideration  did frederic like it  i think he did yesterday said mrs lovel i think we were all a little tired coming home today  anna sprained her ankle jumping over the stryd said minnie  not seriously i hope  oh dear nonothing at all to signify it was the only word which anna spoke till it was suggested that she should go up to her room the girl obeyed as a child might have done and went upstairs followed by mrs lovel my dear she said we cannot go on like this what is the matter  you must ask lord lovel  have you quarrelled with him  i have not quarrelled mrs lovel if he has quarrelled with me i cannot help it  you know what we have all wished  it can never be so  have you said so to frederic  i have  have you given him any reason anna  i have she said after a pause  what reason dear  she thought for a moment before she replied i was obliged to tell him the reason mrs lovel but i dont think that i need tell anybody else of course i must tell mamma  does your mamma know it  not yet  and is it a reason that must last for ever  yesfor ever but i do not know why everybody is to be angry with me other girls may do as they please if you are angry with me i had better go back to london at once  i do not know that anybody has been angry with you we may be disappointed without being angry that was all that was said and then lady anna was left to dress for dinner at dinner lord lovel had so far composed himself as to be able to speak to his cousin and an effort at courtesy was made by them allexcept by the rector but the evening passed away in a manner very different from any that had gone before it     chapter xviii  too heavy for secrets   during that night the young lord was still thinking of his future conductof what duty and honour demanded of him and of the manner in which he might best make duty and honour consort with his interests in all the emergencies of his short life he had hitherto had some one to advise himsome elder friend whose counsel he might take even though he would seem to make little use of it when it was offered to him he had always somewhat disdained aunt julia but nevertheless aunt julia had been very useful to him in latter days since the late earls death when there came upon him as the first of his troubles the necessity of setting aside that madmans will mr flick had been his chief counsellor and yet in all his communications with mr flick he had assumed to be his own guide and master now it seemed that he must in truth guide himself but he knew not how to do it of one thing he felt certain he must get away from yoxham and hurry up to london  it behoved him to keep his cousins secret but would he not be keeping it with a sanctity sufficiently strict if he imparted it to one sworn frienda friend who should be bound not to divulge it further without his consent if so the solicitorgeneral should be his friend an intimacy had grown up between the great lawyer and his noble client not social in its nature but still sufficiently close as lord lovel thought to admit of such confidence he had begun to be aware that without assistance of this nature he would not know how to guide himself undoubtedly the wealth of the presumed heiress had become dearer to himhad become at least more important to himsince he had learned that it must probably be lost sir william patterson was a gentleman as well as a lawyerone who had not simply risen to legal rank by diligence and intellect but a gentleman born and bred who had been at a public school and had lived all his days with people of the right sort sir william was his legal adviser and he would commit lady annas secret to the keeping of sir william  there was a coach which started in those days from york at noon reaching london early on the following day he would go up by this coach and would thus avoid the necessity of much further association with his family before he had decided what should be his conduct but he must see his cousin before he went he therefore sent a note to her before she had left her room on the following morning      dear anna     i purpose starting for london in an hour or so and wish    to say one word to you before i go will you meet me at    nine in the drawingroom do not mention my going to my    uncle or aunts as it will be better that i should tell    them myself     yours l   at ten minutes before nine lady anna was in the drawingroom waiting for him and at ten minutes past nine he joined her  i beg your pardon for keeping you waiting she gave him her hand and said that it did not signify in the least she was always early i find that i must go up to london at once he said to this she made no answer though he seemed to expect some reply in the first place i could not remain here in comfort after what you told me yesterday  i shall be sorry to drive you away it is your home and as i must go soon had i not better go at once  nothat is i think not i shall go at any rate i have told none of them what you told me yesterday  i am glad of that lord lovel  it is for you to tell itif it must be told  i did tell your aunt janethat you and i never can be asyou said you wished  i did wish it most heartily you did not tell itall  nonot all  you astounded me so that i could hardly speak to you as i should have spoken i did not mean to be uncourteous  i did not think you uncourteous lord lovel i am sure you would not be uncourteous to me  but you astounded me it is not that i think much of myself or of my rank as belonging to me i know that i have but little to be proud of i am very poorand not clever like some young men who have not large fortunes but who can become statesmen and all that but i do think much of my order i think much of being a gentlemanand much of ladies being ladies do you understand me  oh yesi understand you  if you are lady anna lovel  i am lady anna lovel  i believe you are with all my heart you speak like it and look like it you are fit for any position everything is in your favour i do believe it but if so  well lord lovelif so  surely you would not choose tototo degrade your rank that is the truth if i be your cousin and the head of your family i have a right to speak as such what you told me would be degradation  she thought a moment and then she replied to himit would be no disgrace  he too found himself compelled to think before he could speak again do you think that you could like your associates if you were to be married to mr thwaite  i do not know who they would be he would be my companion and i like him i love him dearly there you need not tell me lord lovel i know it all he is not like youand i when i had become his wife should not be like your aunt jane i should never see people of that sort any more i suppose we should not live here in england at allso that i should escape the scorn of all my cousins i know what i am doing and why i am doing itand i do not think you ought to tempt me  she knew at least that she was open to temptation he could perceive that and was thankful for it i do not wish to tempt you but i would save you from unhappiness if i could such a marriage would be unnatural i have not seen mr thwaite  then my lord you have not seen a most excellent man who next to my mother is my best friend  but he cannot be a gentleman  i do not knowbut i do know that i can be his wife is that all lord lovel  not quite all i fear that this weary lawsuit will come back upon us in some shape i cannot say whether i have the power to stop it if i would i must in part be guided by others  i cannot do anything if i could i would not even ask for the money for myself  no lady anna you and i cannot decide it i must again see my lawyer i do not mean the attorneybut sir william patterson the solicitorgeneral may i tell him what you told me yesterday  i cannot hinder you  but you can give me your permission if he will promise me that it shall go no fartherthen may i tell him i shall hardly know what to do unless he knows all that i know  everybody will know soon  nobody shall know from mebut only he will you say that i may tell him  oh yes  i am much indebted to you even for that i cannot tell you now how much i hoped when i got up yesterday morning at bolton bridge that i should have to be indebted to you for making me the happiest man in england you must forgive me if i say that i still hope at heart that this infatuation may be made to cease and now goodbye lady anna  goodbye lord lovel  she at once went to her room and sent down her maid to say that she would not appear at prayers or at breakfast she would not see him again before he went how probable it was that her eyes had rested on his form for the last time how beautiful he was how full of grace how like a god how pleasant she had found it to be near him how full of ineffable sweetness had been everything that he had touched all things of which he had spoken to her he had almost overcome her as though she had eaten of the lotus and she knew not whether the charm was of god or devil but she did know that she had struggled against itbecause of her word and because she owed a debt which falsehood and ingratitude would ill repay lord lovel had called her lady anna now ah yes how good he was when it became significant to her that he should recognise her rank he did so at once he had only dropped the title when having been recognised it had become a stumblingblock to her now he was gone from her and if it was possible she would cease even to dream of him  i suppose frederic that the marriage is not to be the rector said to him as he got into the dogcart at the rectory door  i cannot tell i do not know i think not but uncle would you oblige me by not speaking of it just at present you will know all very soon  the rector stood on the gravel watching the dogcart as it disappeared with his hands in the pockets of his clerical trousers and with heavy signs of displeasure on his face it was very well to be uncle to an earl and out of his wealth to do what he could to assist and if possible to dispel his noble nephews poverty but surely something was due to him it was not for his pleasure that this girlwhom he was forced to call lady anna though he could never believe her to be so whom his wife and sister called cousin anna though he still thought that she was not and could not be cousin to anybodyit was not for anything that he could get that he was entertaining her as an honoured guest at his rectory and now his nephew was gone and the girl was left behind and he was not to be told whether there was to be a marriage or not i cannot tell i do not know i think not and then he was curtly requested to ask no more questions what was he to do with the girl while the young earl and the lawyers were still pondering the question of her legitimacy the girl whether a lady anna and a cousinor a mere nobody who was trying to rob the familywas to be left on his hands whyoh why had he allowed himself to be talked out of his own opinion why had he ever permitted her to be invited to his rectory ah how the title stuck in his throat as he asked her to take the customary glass of wine with him at dinnertime that evening  on reaching london towards the end of august lord lovel found that the solicitorgeneral was out of town sir william had gone down to somersetshire with the intention of saying some comforting words to his constituents mr flick knew nothing of his movements but his clerk was found and his clerk did not expect him back in london till october but in answer to lord lovels letter sir william undertook to come up for one day sir william was a man who quite recognised the importance of the case he had in hand  engaged to the tailoris she he said not however with any look of surprise  but sir williamyou will not repeat this even to mr flick or to mr hardy i have promised lady anna that it shall not go beyond you  if she sticks to her bargain it cannot be kept secret very longnor would she wish it its just what we might have expected you know  you wouldnt say so if you knew her  hm im older than you lord lovel you see she had nobody else near her a girl must cotton to somebody and who was there we ought not to be angry with her  but it shocks me so  well yes as far as i can learn his father and he have stood by them very closelyand did so too when there seemed to be but little hope but they might be paid for all they did at a less rate than that if she sticks to him nobody can beat him out of it what i mean is that it was all fair game he ran his chance and did it in a manly fashion the earl did not quite understand sir william who seemed to take almost a favourable view of these monstrous betrothals what i mean is that nobody can touch him or find fault with him he has not carried her away and got up a marriage before she was of age he hasnt kept her from going out among her friends he hasntwronged her i suppose  i think he has wronged her frightfully  ahwell we mean different things i am obliged to look at it as the world will look at it  think of the disgrace of such a marriageto a tailor  whose father had advanced her mother some five or six thousand pounds to help her to win back her position thats about the truth of it we must look at it all round you know  you think then that nothing should be done  i think that everything should be done that can be done we have the mother on our side very probably we may have old thwaite on our side from what you say it is quite possible that at this very moment the girl herself may be on our side let her remain at yoxham as long as you can get her to stay and let everything be done to flatter and amuse her go down again yourself and play the lover as well as i do not doubt you know how to do it it was clear then that the great legal pundit did not think that an earl should be ashamed to carry on his suit to a lady who had confessed her attachment to a journeyman tailor it will be a trouble to us all of course because we must change our plan when the case comes on in november  but you still think that she is the heiress  so strongly that i feel all but sure of it we shouldnt in truth have had a leg to stand on and we couldnt fight it i may as well tell you at once my lord that we couldnt do it with any chance of success and what should we have gained had we done so nothing unless we could prove that the real wife were dead we should have been fighting for that italian woman whom i most thoroughly believe to be an impostor  then there is nothing to be done  very little in that way but if the young lady be determined to marry the tailor i think we should simply give notice that we withdraw our opposition to the english ladies and state that we had so informed the woman who asserts her own claim and calls herself a countess in sicily and we should let the italian woman know that we had done so in such case for aught anybody can say here she might come forward with her own case she would find men here who would take it up on speculation readily enough there would be a variety of complications and no doubt very great delay in such an event we should question very closely the nature of the property as for aught i have seen as yet a portion of it might revert to you as real estate it is very variousand it is not always easy to declare at once what is real and what personal hitherto you have appeared as contesting the right of the english widow to her rank and not necessarily as a claimant of the estate the italian widow if a widow would be the heir and not your lordship for that among other reasons the marriage would be most expedient if the italian countess were to succeed in proving that the earl had a wife living when he married miss murraywhich i feel sure he had notthen we should come forward again with our endeavours to show that that first wife had died sinceas the earl himself undoubtedly declared more than once it would be a long time before the tailor got his money with his wife the feeling of the court would be against him  could we buy the tailor sir william  the solicitorgeneral nursed his leg before he answered  mr flick could answer that question better than i can do in fact mr flick should know it all the matter is too heavy for secrets lord lovel     chapter xix  lady anna returns to london   after the earl was gone lady anna had but a bad time of it at yoxham she herself could not so far regain her composure as to live on as though no disruption had taken place she knew that she was in disgrace and the feeling was dreadful to her the two ladies were civil and tried to make the house pleasant but they were not cordial as they had been hitherto for one happy halcyon weekfor a day or two before the earl had come and for those bright days during which he had been with themshe had found herself to be really admitted into the inner circle as one of the family mrs lovel had been altogether gracious with her minnie had been her darling little friend aunt julia had been so far won as to be quite alive to the necessity of winning the rector himself had never quite given wayhad never been so sure of his footing as to feel himself safe in abandoning all power of receding but the effect of this had been to put the rector himself rather than his guest into the back ground the servants had believed in her and even mrs grimes had spoken in her praiseexpressing an opinion that she was almost good enough for the young earl all yoxham had known that the two young people were to be married and all yoxham had been satisfied but now everything was wrong the earl had fled and all yoxham knew that everything was wrong it was impossible that her position should be as it had been  there were consultations behind her back as to what should be done of whichthough she heard no word of themshe was aware she went out daily in the carriage with mrs lovel but aunt julia did not go with them aunt julia on these occasions remained at home discussing the momentous affair with her brother what should be done there was a great dinnerparty specially convened to do honour to the earls return and not among them a single guest who had not heard that there was to be a marriage the guests came to see not only the earl but the earls bride when they arrived the earl had flown mrs lovel expressed her deep sorrow that business of great importance had made it necessary that the earl should go to london lady anna was of course introduced to the strangers but it was evident to the merest tyro in such matters that she was not introduced as would have been a bride expectant they had heard how charming she was how all the lovels had accepted her how deeply was the earl in love and lo she sat in the house silent and almost unregarded of course the story of the lawsuit with such variations as rumour might give it was known to them all a twelvemonth agonay at a period less remote than thatthe two female claimants in cumberland had always been spoken of in those parts as wretched wicked vulgar impostors then came the reaction lady anna was the heiress and lady anna was to be the countess it had flown about the country during the last ten days that there was no one like the lady anna now they came to see her and another reaction had set in she was the lady anna they must suppose all the lovels even the rector so called her mrs lovel introduced her as lady anna lovel and the rectorhating himself as he did soled her out to dinner though there was a baronets wife in the roomthe wife of a baronet who dated back from james i she was the lady anna and therefore the heiressbut it was clear to them all that there was to be no marriage  then poor lord lovel will absolutely not have enough to starve upon said the baronets wife to the baronet as soon as the carriage door had been shut upon them  what were they to do with her the dinner party had taken place on a wednesdaythe day after the earls departure and on the thursday aunt julia wrote to her nephew thus      yoxham rectory 3rd september     my dear frederic     my brother wishes me to write to you and say that we are    all here very uneasy about lady anna we have only heard    from her that the match which was contemplated is not    to take place whether that be so from unwillingness on    her part or yours we have never yet been toldbut both    to your aunt jane and myself she speaks of it as though    the decision were irrevocable what had we better do    of course it is our most anxious desireas it is our    pleasure and our dutyto arrange everything according    to your wishes and welfare nothing can be of so much    importance to any of us in this world as your position in    it if it is your wish that lady anna should remain here    of course she shall remain but if in truth there is no    longer any prospect of a marriage will not her longer    sojourn beneath your uncles roof be a trouble to all of    usand especially to her     your aunt jane thinks that it may be only a lovers    quarrel for myself i feel sure that you would not have    left us as you did had it not been more than that i    think that you owe it to your uncle to write to meor to    him if you like it betterand to give us some clue to    the state of things     i must not conceal from you the fact that my brother has    never felt convinced as you do that lady annas mother    was in truth the countess lovel at your request and in    compliance with the advice of the solicitorgeneral he    has been willing to receive her here and as she has been    here he has given her the rank which she claims he took    her out to dinner yesterday before lady fitzwarrenwhich    will never be forgiven should it turn out ultimately that    the first wife was alive when the earl married annas    mother of course while here she must be treated as lady    anna lovel but my brother does not wish to be forced so    to do if it be intended that any further doubt should be    raised in such case he desires to be free to hold his    former opinion therefore pray write to us and tell us    what you wish to have done i can assure you that we are    at present very uncomfortable     believe me to be    my dear frederic    your most affectionate aunt     julia lovel   the earl received this before his interview with sir william but left it unanswered till after he had seen that gentleman then he wrote as follows      carlton club 5th september 183     my dear aunt julia     will you tell my uncle that i think you had better get    lady anna to stay at the rectory as long as possible ill    let you know all about it very soon best love to aunt    jane     i am    your affectionate nephew     lovel   this very short epistle was most unsatisfactory to the rector but it was felt by them all that nothing could be done with such an injunction before them they could not give the girl a hint that they wished her to go what uncle or what aunt with such a nephew as lord lovel so noble and so poor could turn out an heiress with twenty thousand a year as long as there was the slightest chance of a marriage not a doubt would have rankled in their minds had they been quite sure that she was the heiress but as it was the earl ought to have said more than he did say  i cannot keep myself from feeling sometimes that frederic does take liberties with me the rector said to his sister but he submitted it was a part of the religion of the familyand no little partthat they should cling to their head and chief what would the world have been to them if they could not talk with comfortable ease and grace of their nephew frederic  during this time anna spoke more than once to mrs lovel as to her going i have been a long time here she said and im sure that i am in mr lovels way  not in the least my dear if you are happy pray stay with us  this was before the arrival of the brief epistlewhen they were waiting to know whether they were to dismiss their guest from yoxham or to retain her  as for being happy nobody can be happy i think till all this is settled i will write to mamma and tell her that i had better return to her mamma is all alone  i dont know that i can advise my dear but as far as we are concerned we shall be very glad if you can stay  the brief epistle had not then arrived and they were in truth anxious that she should gobut one cannot tell ones visitor to depart from ones house without a downright rupture not even the rector himself dared to make such rupture without express sanction from the earl  then lady anna feeling that she must ask advice wrote to her mother the countess had answered her last letter with great severitythat letter in which the daughter had declared that people ought not to be asked to marry for money the countess whose whole life had made her stern and unbending said very hard things to her child had told her that she was ungrateful and disobedient unmindful of her family neglectful of her duty and willing to sacrifice the prosperity and happiness of all belonging to her for some girlish feeling of mere romance the countess was sure that her daughter would never forgive herself in after years if she now allowed to pass by this golden opportunity of remedying all the evil that her father had done you are simply asked to do that which every wellbred girl in england would be delighted to do wrote the countess  ah she does not know said lady anna  but there had come upon her now a fear heavier and more awful than that which she entertained for her mother earl lovel knew her secret and earl lovel was to tell it to the solicitorgeneral she hardly doubted that it might as well be told to all the judges on the bench at once would it not be better that she should be married to daniel thwaite out of hand and so be freed from the burden of any secret the young lord had been thoroughly ashamed of her when she told it those aunts at yoxham would hardly speak to her if they knew it that lady before whom she had been made to walk out to dinner would disdain to sit in the same room with her if she knew it it must be knownmust be known to them all but she need not remain there beneath their eyes while they learned it her mother must know it and it would be better that she should tell her mother she would tell her motherand request that she might have permission to return at once to the lodgings in wyndham street so she wrote the following letterin which as the reader will perceive she could not even yet bring herself to tell her secret      yoxham rectory monday     my dear mamma     i want you to let me come home because i think i have    been here long enough lord lovel has gone away and    though you are so very angry it is better i should    tell you that we are not any longer friends dear dear    dearest mamma i am so very unhappy that you should not be    pleased with me i would die tomorrow if i could make you    happy but it is all over now and he would not do it even    if i could say that it should be so he has gone away and    is in london and would tell you so himself if you would    ask him he despises me as i always knew he wouldand    so he has gone away i dont think anything of myself    because i knew it must be so but i am so very unhappy    because you will be unhappy     i dont think they want to have me here any longer and of    course there is no reason why they should they were very    nice to me before all this happened and they never say    anything illnatured to me now but it is very different    and there cannot be any good in remaining you are all    alone and i think you would be glad to see your poor    anna even though you are so angry with her pray let me    come home i could start very well on friday and i think    i will do so unless i hear from you to the contrary i    can take my place by the coach and go away at twelve    oclock from york and be at that place in london on    saturday at eleven i must take my place on thursday i    have plenty of money as i have not spent any since i have    been here of course sarah will come with me she is not    nearly so nice since she knew that lord lovel was to go    away     dear mamma i do love you so much     your most affectionate daughter     anna   it was not wilfully that the poor girl gave her mother no opportunity of answering her before she had taken her place by the coach on thursday morning the place had to be taken and on thursday evening she got her mothers letter by the same post came the earls letter to his aunt desiring that lady anna might if possible be kept at yoxham the places were taken and it was impossible i dont see why you should go said aunt julia who clearly perceived that her nephew had been instigated to pursue the marriage scheme since he had been in town lady anna urged that the money had been paid for two places by the coach my brother could arrange that i do not doubt said aunt julia but the countess now expected her daughter and lady anna stuck to her resolve her mothers letter had not been propitious to the movement if the places were taken of course she must come so said the countess it was not simply that the money should not be lost but that the people at yoxham must not be allowed to think that her daughter was over anxious to stay does your mamma want to have you back asked aunt julia lady anna would not say that her mother wanted her back but simply pleaded again that the places had been taken  when the morning came for her departure the carriage was ordered to take her into york and the question arose as to who should go with her it was incumbent on the rector who held an honorary stall in the cathedral to be with the dean and his brother prebendaries on that day and the use of his own carriage would be convenient to him  i think ill have the gig said the rector  my dear charles pleaded his sister surely that will be foolish she cant hurt you  i dont know that said the rector i think she has hurt me very much already i shouldnt know how to talk to her  you may be sure that frederic means to go on with it said mrs lovel  it would have been better for frederic if he had never seen her said the rector and im sure it would have been better for me  but he consented at last and he himself handed lady anna into the carriage mrs lovel accompanied them but aunt julia made her farewells in the rectory drawingroom she managed to get the girl to herself for a moment or two and thus she spoke to her i need not tell you that for yourself my dear i like you very much  oh thank you miss lovel  i have heartily wished that you might be our frederics wife  it can never be said lady anna  i wont give up all hope i dont pretend to understand what there is amiss between you and frederic but i wont give it up if it is to be so i hope that you and i may be loving friends till i die give me a kiss my dear lady anna whose eyes were suffused with tears threw herself into the arms of the elder lady and embraced her  mrs lovel also kissed her and bade god bless her as she parted from her at the coach door but the rector was less demonstrative i hope you will have a pleasant journey he said taking off his clerical hat  let it go as it may said mrs lovel as she walked into the close with her husband you may take my word shes a good girl  im afraid shes sly said the rector  shes no more sly than i am said mrs lovel who herself was by no means sly     chapter xx  lady annas reception   the countess went into the city to meet her daughter at the saracens head whither the york coach used to run and received her almost in silence oh mamma dear mamma said lady anna i am so glad to be back with you again sarah the ladysmaid was there useless officious and longeared the countess said almost nothing she submitted to be kissed and she asked after the luggage at that time she had heard the whole story about daniel thwaite  the solicitorgeneral had disregarded altogether his clients injunctions as to secrecy he had felt that in a matter of so great importance it behoved him to look to his clients interests rather than his clients instructions this promise of a marriage with the tailors son must be annihilated on behalf of the whole lovel family it was his duty as he thought to see that this should be effected if possibleand as quickly as possible this was his duty not only as a lawyer employed in a particular case but as a man who would be bound to prevent any great evil which he saw looming in the future in his view of the case the marriage of lady anna lovel with a colossal fortune to daniel thwaite the tailor would be a grievous injury to the social world of his countryand it was one of those evils which may probably be intercepted by due and discreet precautions no doubt the tailor wanted money the man was entitled to some considerable reward for all that he had done and all that he had suffered in the cause but sir william could not himself propose the reward he could not chaffer for terms with the tailor he could not be seen in that matter but having heard the secret from the earl he thought that he could get the work done so he sent for mr flick the attorney and told mr flick all that he knew gone and engaged herself to the tailor said mr flick holding up both his hands then sir william took lady annas part after all such an engagement was notas he thoughtunnatural it had been made while she was very young when she knew no other man of her own age in life when she was greatly indebted to this man when she had had no opportunity of measuring a young tailor against a young lord she had done it probably in gratitudeso said sir williamand now clung to it from good faith rather than affection neither was he severe upon the tailor he was a man especially given to make excuses for poor weak erring unlearned mortals ignorant of the lawunless when a witness attempted to be imperviousand now he made excuses for daniel thwaite the man might have done so much worse than he was doing there seemed already to be a noble reliance on himself in his conduct lord lovel thought that there had been no correspondence while the young lady had been at yoxham there might have been but had not been a clandestine marriage other reasons he gave why daniel thwaite should not be regarded as altogether villanous but nevertheless the tailor must not be allowed to carry off the prize the prize was too great for him what must be done sir william condescended to ask mr flick what he thought ought to be done no doubt we should be very much guided by you mr solicitor said mr flick  one thing is i think plain mr flick you must see the countess and tell her or get mr goffe to do so it is clear that she has been kept in the dark between them at present they are all living together in the same house she had better leave the place and go elsewhere they should be kept apart and the girl if necessary should be carried abroad  i take it there is a difficulty about money mr solicitor  there ought to be noneand i will take it upon myself to say that there need be none it is a case in which the court will willingly allow money out of the income of the property the thing is so large that there should be no grudging of money for needful purposes seeing what primâ facie claims these ladies have they are bound to allow them to live decently in accordance with their alleged rank till the case is settled no doubt she is the heiress  you feel quite sure sir william  i dothough as i have said before it is a case of feeling sure and not being sure had that italian woman been really the widow somebody would have brought her case forward more loudly  but if the other italian woman who died was the wife  you would have found it out when you were there somebody from the country would have come to us with evidence knowing how much we could afford to pay for it mind you the matter has been tried before in another shape the old earl was indicted for bigamy and acquitted we are bound to regard that young woman as lady anna lovel and we are bound to regard her and her mother conjointly as coheiresses in different degrees to all the personal property which the old earl left behind him we cant with safety take any other view there will still be difficulties in their wayand very serious difficulties were she to marry this tailor but between you and me he would eventually get the money perhaps mr flick you had better see him you would know how to get at his views without compromising anybody but in the first place let the countess know everything after what has been done you wont have any difficulty in meeting mr goffe  mr flick had no difficulty in seeing mr goffethough he felt that there would be very much difficulty in seeing mr daniel thwaite he did tell mr goffe the story of the wicked tailorby no means making those excuses which the solicitorgeneral had made for the mans presumptuous covetousness i knew the trouble we should have with that man said mr goffe who had always disliked the thwaites then mr flick went on to say that mr goffe had better tell the countessand mr goffe on this point agreed with his adversary two or three days after that but subsequently to the date of the last letter which the mother had written to her daughter lady lovel was told that lady anna was engaged to marry mr daniel thwaite  she had suspected how it might be her heart had for the last month been heavy with the dread of this great calamity she had made her plans with the view of keeping the two apart she had asked her daughter questions founded on this very fearand yet she could not for a while be brought to believe it how did mr goffe know mr goffe had heard it from mr flick who had heard it from sir william patterson to whom the tale had been told by lord lovel and who told lord lovel said the countess flashing up in anger  no doubt lady anna did so said the attorney but in spite of her indignation she could retain her doubts the attorney however was certain there could be no hope but that it was so she still pretended not to believe it though fully intending to take all due precautions in the matter since mr goffe thought that it would be prudent she would remove to other lodgings she would think of that plan of going abroad she would be on her guard she said but she would not admit it to be possible that lady anna lovel the daughter of earl lovel her daughter should have so far disgraced herself  but she did believe it her heart had in truth told her that it was true at the first word the lawyer had spoken to her how blind she must have been not to have known it how grossly stupid not to have understood those asseverations from the girl that the marriage with her cousin was impossible her child had not only deceived her but had possessed cunning enough to maintain her deception it must have been going on for at least the last twelvemonth and she the while had been kept in the dark by the manoeuvres of a simple girl and then she thought of the depth of the degradation which was prepared for her had she passed twenty years of unintermittent combat for thisthat when all had been done when at last success was won when the rank and wealth of her child had been made positively secure before the world when she was about to see the unquestioned coronet of a countess placed upon her childs browall should be destroyed through a passion so mean as this would it not have been better to have died in poverty and obscuritywhile there were yet doubtsbefore any assured disgrace had rested on her but oh to have proved that she was a countess and her child the heiress of an earl in order that the lady anna lovel might become the wife of daniel thwaite the tailor  she made many resolutions but the first was this that she would never smile upon the girl again till this baseness should have been abandoned she loved her girl as only mothers do love more devoted than the pelican she would have given her hearts bloodhad given all her lifenot only to nurture but to aggrandize her child the establishment of her own position her own honour her own name was to her but the incidental result of her daughters emblazonment in the world the child which she had borne to earl lovel and which the father had stigmatised as a bastard should by her means be known as the lady anna the heiress of that fathers wealththe wealthiest the fairest the most noble of englands daughters then there had come the sweet idea that this highborn heiress of the lovels should herself become countess lovel and the mother had risen higher in her delighted pride it had all been for her child had she not loved as a mother and with all a mothers tenderness and for what  she would love still but she would never again be tender till her daughter should have repudiated her baseher monstrous engagement she bound up all her faculties to harshness and a stern resolution her daughter had been deceitful and she would now be ruthless there might be suffering but had not she suffered there might be sorrow but had not she sorrowed there might be a contest but had not she ever been contesting sooner than that the tailor should reap the fruit of her labourslabours which had been commenced when she first gave herself in marriage to that dark dreadful mansooner than that her child should make ignoble the blood which it had cost her so much to ennoble she would do deeds which should make even the wickedness of her husband childs play in the worlds esteem it was in this mood of mind that she went to meet her daughter at the saracens head  she had taken fresh lodgings very suddenlyin keppel street near russell square a long way from wyndham street she had asked mr goffe to recommend her a place and he had sent her to an old lady with whom he himself had lodged in his bachelors days keppel street cannot be called fashionable and russell square is not much affected by the nobility nevertheless the house was superior in all qualifications to that which she was now leaving and the rent was considerably higher but the affairs of the countess in regard to money were in the ascendant and mr goffe did not scruple to take for her a genteel suite of drawingroomstwo rooms with foldingdoors that iswith the bedrooms above firstclass lodginghouse attendance and a garret for the ladysmaid and then it will be quite close to mrs bluestone said mr goffe who knew of that intimacy  the drive in a glass coach home from the coachyard to keppel street was horrible to lady anna not a word was spoken as sarah the ladysmaid sat with them in the carriage once or twice the poor girl tried to get hold of her mothers hand in order that she might entice something of a caress but the countess would admit of no such softness and at last withdrew her hand roughly oh mamma said lady anna unable to suppress her dismay but the countess said never a word sarah the ladysmaid began to think that there must be a second lover is this wyndham street said lady anna when the coach stopped  no my dearthis is not wyndham street i have taken another abode this is where we are to live if you will get out i will follow you and sarah will look to the luggage then the daughter entered the house and met the old woman curtseying to her she at once felt that she had been removed from contact with daniel thwaite and was sure that her mother knew her story that is your room said her mother you had better get your things off are you tired  oh so tired and lady anna burst into tears  what will you have  oh nothing i think i will go to bed mamma why are you unkind to me do tell me anything is better than that you should be unkind  annahave not you been unkind to me  never mammanever i have never meant to be unkind i love you better than all the world i have never been unkind but youoh mamma if you look at me like that i shall die  is it true that you have promised that you would be the wife of mr daniel thwaite  mamma  is it true i will be open with you mr goffe tells me that you have refused lord lovel telling him that you must do so because you were engaged to mr daniel thwaite is that true  yes mammait is true  and you have given your word to that man  i have mamma  and yet you told me that there was no one else when i spoke to you of lord lovel you lied to me the girl sat confounded astounded without power of utterance she had travelled from york to london inside one of those awful vehicles of which we used to be so proud when we talked of our stage coaches she was thoroughly weary and worn out she had not breakfasted that morning and was sick and ill at ease not only in heart but in body also of course it was so her mother knew that it was so but this was no time for fond compassion it would be better far better that she should die than that she should not be compelled to abandon this grovelling abasement then you lied to me repeated the countess still standing over her  oh mamma you mean to kill me  i would sooner die here at your feet this moment and know that you must follow me within an hour than see you married to such a one as that you shall never marry him though i went into court myself and swore that i was that lords mistressthat i knew it when i went to himthat you were born a brat beyond the law that i had lived a life of perjury i would prevent such greater disgrace as this it shall never be i will take you away where he shall never hear of you as to the money it shall go to the winds so that he shall never touch it do you think that it is you that he cares for he has heard of all this wealthand you are but the bait upon his hook to catch it  you do not know him mamma  will you tell me of him that i do not know him impudent slut did i not know him before you were born have i not known him all through will you give me your word of honour that you will never see him again lady anna tried to think but her mind would not act for her everything was turning round and she became giddy and threw herself on the bed answer me anna will you give me your word of honour that you will never see him again  she might still have said yes she felt that enough of speech was left to her for so small an effortand she knew that if she did so the agony of the moment would pass away from her with that one word spoken her mother would be kind to her and would wait upon her would bring her tea and would sit by her bedside and caress her but she too was a lovel and she was moreover the daughter of her who once had been josephine murray  i cannot say that mamma she said because i have promised  her mother dashed from the room and she was left alone upon the bed     chapter xxi  daniel and the lawyer   it has been said that the countess when she sent her daughter down to yoxham laid her plans with the conviction that the associations to which the girl would be subjected among the lovels would fill her heart and mind with a newborn craving for the kind of life which she would find in the rectors familyand she had been right daniel thwaite also had known that it would be so he had been quite alive to the fact that he and his conversation would be abased and that his power both of pleasing and of governing would be lessened by this new contact but had he been able to hinder her going he would not have done so none of those who were now interested in his conduct knew aught of the character of this man sir william patterson had given him credit for some honesty but even he had not perceivedhad had no opportunity of perceivingthe staunch uprightness which was as it were a backbone to the man in all his doings he was ambitious discontented sullen and tyrannical he hated the domination of others but was prone to domineer himself he suspected evil of all above him in rank and the millennium to which he looked forward was to be produced by the gradual extirpation of all social distinctions gentlemen so called were to him as savages which had to be cleared away in order that that perfection might come at last which the course of nature was to produce in obedience to the ordinances of the creator but he was a man who reverenced all lawsand a law if recognised as a law was a law to him whether enforced by a penalty or simply exigent of obedience from his conscience this girl had been thrown in his way and he had first pitied and then loved her from his childhood she had been injured by the fiendish malice of her own fatherand that father had been an earl he had been strong in fighting for the rights of the mothernot because it had been the mothers right to be a countessbut in opposition to the earl at firstindeed throughout all these years of conflict except the last yearthere had been a question not of money but of right the wife was entitled to due supportto what measure of support daniel had never known or inquired but the daughter had been entitled to nothing the earl had he made his will before he was mador more probably had he not destroyed when mad the will which he had before mademight and would have left the girl without a shilling in those days when daniels love was slowly growing when he wandered about with the child among the rocks when the growing girl had first learned to swear to him that he should always be her friend of friends when the love of the boy had first become the passion of the man there had been no thought of money in it money had he not been well aware from his earliest understanding of the need of money for all noble purposes that the earnings of his father which should have made the world to him a world of promise were being lavished in the service of these forlorn women he had never complained they were welcome to it all that young girl was all the world to him and it was right that all should be spent as though she had been a sister as though she had already been his wife there had been no plot then by which he was to become rich on the earls wealth then had come the will and the young earls claims and the general belief of men in all quarters that the young earl was to win everything what was left of the tailors savings was still being spent on behalf of the countess the first fee that ever found its way into the pocket of serjeant bluestone had come from the diminished hoard of old thomas thwaite then the will had been set aside and gradually the cause of the countess had grown to be in the ascendant was he to drop his love to confess himself unworthy and to slink away out of her sight because the girl would become an heiress was he even to conceive so badly of her as to think that she would drop her love because she was an heiress there was no such humility about himnor such absence of selfesteem but as regarded her he told himself at once that she should have the chance of being base and nobleall base and all noble as far as title and social standing could make her soif such were her desire he had come to her and offered her her freedomhad done so indeed with such hot language of indignant protest against the gilded gingerbread of her interested suitor as would have frightened her from the acceptance of his offer had she been minded to accept itbut his words had been hot not from a premeditated purpose to thwart his own seeming liberality but because his nature was hot and his temper imperious this lordling was ready to wed his bridethe girl he had known and succoured throughout their joint livessimply because she was rich and the lordling was a pauper from the bottom of his heart he despised the lordling he had said to himself a score of times that he could be well content to see the lord take the money waste it among thieves and prostitutes and again become a pauper while he had the girl to sit with him at his board and share with him the earnings of his honest labour of course he had spoken out but the girl should be at liberty to do as she pleased  he wrote no line to her before she went or while she was at yoxham nor did he speak a word concerning her during her absence but as he sat at his work or walked to and fro between his home and the shop or lay sleepless in bed all his thoughts were of her twice or thrice a week he would knock at the door of the countesss room and say a word or two as was rendered natural by their long previous intercourse but there had been no real intercourse between them the countess told him nothing of her plans nor did he ever speak to her of his each suspected the other and each was grimly civil once or twice the countess expressed a hope that the money advanced by thomas thwaite might soon be repaid to him with much interest daniel would always treat the subject with a noble indifference his father he said had never felt an hours regret at having parted with his money should it perchance come back to him he would take it no doubt with thanks  then he heard one evening as he returned from his work that the countess was about to remove herself on the morrow to another home the woman of the house who told him did not know where the countess had fixed her future abode he passed on up to his bedroom washed his hands and immediately went down to his fellowlodger after the first ordinary greeting which was cold and almost unkind he at once asked his question they tell me that you go from this tomorrow lady lovel she paused a moment and then bowed her head where is it that you are going to live she paused again and paused long for she had to think what answer she would make him do you object to let me know he asked  mr thwaite i must object  then at that moment there came upon him the memory of all that he and his father had done and not the thought of that which he intended to do this was the gratitude of a countess in that case of course i shall not ask again i had hoped that we were friends  of course we are friends your father has been the best friend i ever had i shall write to your father and let him know i am bound to let your father know all that i do but at present my case is in the hands of my lawyers and they have advised that i should tell no one in london where i live  then good evening lady lovel i beg your pardon for having intruded he left the room without another word throwing off the dust from his feet as he went with violent indignation he and she must now be enemies she had told him that she would separate herself from himand they must be separated could he have expected better things from a declared countess but how would it be with lady anna she also had a title she also would have wealth she might become a countess if she wished it let him only know by one sign from her that she did wish it and he would take himself off at once to the farther side of the globe and live in a world contaminated by no noble lords and titled ladies as it happened the countess might as well have given him the address as the woman at the lodgings informed him on the next morning that the countess had removed herself to no  keppel street  he did not doubt that lady anna was about to return to london that quick removal would not otherwise have been made but what mattered it to him whether she were at yoxham or in keppel street he could do nothing there would come a timebut it had not come as yetwhen he must go to the girl boldly let her be guarded as she might and demand her hand but the demand must be made to herself and herself only when that time came there should be no question of money whether she were the undisturbed owner of hundreds of thousands or a rejected claimant to her fathers name the demand should be made in the same tone and with the same assurance he knew well the whole history of her life she had been twenty years old last may and it was now september when the next spring should come round she would be her own mistress free to take herself from her mothers hands and free to give herself to whom she would he did not say that nothing should be done during those eight months but according to his lights he could not make his demand with full force till she was a woman as free from all legal control as was he as a man  the chances were much against him he knew what were the allurements of luxury there were moments in which he told himself that of course she would fall into the nets that were spread for her but then again there would grow within his bosom a belief in truth and honesty which would buoy him up how grand would be his victory how great the triumph of a human souls nobility if after all these dangers if after all the enticements of wealth and rank the girl should come to him and lying on his bosom should tell him that she had never wavered from him through it all of this at any rate he assured himselfthat he would not go prying with clandestine manoeuvres about that house in keppel street the countess might have told him where she intended to live without increasing her danger  while things were in this state with him he received a letter from messrs norton and flick the attorneys asking him to call on mr flick at their chambers in lincolns inn the solicitorgeneral had suggested to the attorney that he should see the man and mr flick had found himself bound to obey but in truth he hardly knew what to say to daniel thwaite it must be his object of course to buy off the tailor but such arrangements are difficult and require great caution and then mr flick was employed by earl lovel and this man was the friend of the earls opponents in the case mr flick did feel that the solicitorgeneral was moving into great irregularities in this cause the cause itself was no doubt peculiarunlike any other cause with which mr flick had become acquainted in his experience there was no saying at the present moment who had opposed interests and who combined interests in the case but still etiquette is etiquette and mr flick was aware that such a house as that of messrs norton and flick should not be irregular nevertheless he sent for daniel thwaite  after having explained who he was which daniel knew very well without being told mr flick began his work you are aware mr thwaite that the friends on both sides are endeavouring to arrange this question amicably without any further litigation  i am aware that the friends of lord lovel finding that they have no ground to stand on at law are endeavouring to gain their object by other means  no mr thwaite i cannot admit that for a moment that would be altogether an erroneous view of the proceeding  is lady anna lovel the legitimate daughter of the late earl  that is what we do not know that is what nobody knows you are not a lawyer mr thwaite or you would be aware that there is nothing more difficult to decide than questions of legitimacy it has sometimes taken all the courts a century to decide whether a marriage is a marriage or not you have heard of the great macfarlane case to find out who was the macfarlane they had to go back a hundred and twenty years and at last decide on the memory of a man whose grandmother had told him that she had seen a woman wearing a weddingring the case cost over forty thousand pounds and took nineteen years as far as i can see this is more complicated even than that we should in all probability have to depend on the proceedings of the courts in sicily and you and i would never live to see the end of it  you would live on it mr flick which is more than i could do  mr thwaite that i think is a very improper observation but however my object is to explain to you that all these difficulties may be got over by a very proper and natural alliance between earl lovel and the lady who is at present called by courtesy lady anna lovel  by the crowns courtesy mr flick said the tailor who understood the nature of the titles which he hated  we allow the name i grant you at present and are anxious to promote the marriage we are all most anxious to bring to a close this ruinous litigation now i am told that the young lady feels herself hampered by some childish promise that has been madeto you  daniel thwaite had expected no such announcement as this he did not conceive that the girl would tell the story of her engagement and was unprepared at the moment for any reply but he was not a man to remain unready long do you call it childish he said  i do certainly  then what would her engagement be if now made with the earl the engagement with me as an engagement is not yet twelve months old and has been repeated within the last month she is an infant mr flick according to your language and therefore perhaps a child in the eye of the law if lord lovel wishes to marry her why doesnt he do so he is not hindered i suppose by her being a child  any marriage with you you know would in fact be impossible  a marriage with me mr flick would be quite as possible as one with the lord lovel when the lady is of age no clergyman in england dare refuse to marry us if the rules prescribed by law have been obeyed  well well mr thwaite i do not want to argue with you about the law and about possibilities the marriage would not be fitting and you know that it would not be fitting  it would be most unfittingunless the lady wished it as well as i just as much may be said of her marriage with earl lovel to which of us has she given her promise which of us has she known and loved which of us has won her by long friendship and steady regard and which of us mr flick is attracted to the marriage by the lately assured wealth of the young woman i never understood that lord lovel was my rival when lady anna was regarded as the baseborn child of the deceased madman  i suppose mr thwaite you are not indifferent to her money  then you suppose wronglyas lawyers mostly do when they take upon themselves to attribute motives  you are not civil mr thwaite  you did not send for me here sir in order that there should be civilities between us but i will at least be true in regard to lady annas money should it become mine by reason of her marriage with me i will guard it for her sake and for that of the children she may bear with all my power i will assert her right to it as a man should do but my purpose in seeking her hand will neither be strengthened nor weakened by her money i believe that it is hers nayi know that the law will give it to her on her behalf as being betrothed to her i defy lord lovel and all other claimants but her money and her hand are two things apart and i will never be governed as to the one by any regard as to the other perhaps mr flick i have said enoughand so good morning then he went away  the lawyer had never dared to suggest the compromise which had been his object in sending for the man he had not dared to ask the tailor how much ready money he would take down to abandon the lady and thus to relieve them all from that difficulty no doubt he exercised a wise discretion as had he done so daniel thwaite might have become even more uncivil than before     chapter xxii  there is a gulf fixed   do you think that you could be happier as the wife of such a one as daniel thwaite a creature infinitely beneath you separated as you would be from all your kith and kin from all whose blood you share from me and from your family than you would be as the bearer of a proud name the daughter and the wife of an earl lovelthe mother of the earl to come i will not speak now of duty or of fitness or of the happiness of others which must depend upon you it is natural that a girl should look to her own joys in marriage do you think that your joy can consist in calling that man your husband  it was thus that the countess spoke to her daughter who was then lying worn out and ill on her bed in keppel street for three days she had been subject to such addresses as this and during those three days no word of tenderness had been spoken to her the countess had been obdurate in her hardnessstill believing that she might thus break her daughters spirit and force her to abandon her engagement but as yet she had not succeeded the girl had been meek and in all other things submissive she had not defended her conduct she had not attempted to say that she had done well in promising to be the tailors bride she had shown herself willing by her silence to have her engagement regarded as a great calamity as a dreadful evil that had come upon the whole lovel family she had not boldness to speak to her mother as she had spoken on the subject to the earl she threw herself entirely upon her promise and spoke of her coming destiny as though it had been made irrevocable by her own word i have promised him mamma and have sworn that it should be so that was the answer which she now made from her bedthe answer which she had made a dozen times during the last three days  is everybody belonging to you to be ruined because you once spoke a foolish word  mamma it was often spokenvery often and he does not wish that anybody should be ruined he told me that lord lovel might have the money  foolish ungrateful girl it is not for lord lovel that i am pleading to you it is for the name and for your own honour do you not constantly pray to god to keep you in that state of life to which it has pleased him to call youand are you not departing from it wilfully and sinfully by such an act as this but still lady anna continued to say that she was bound by the obligation which was upon her  on the following day the countess was frightened believing that the girl was really ill in truth she was illso that the doctor who visited her declared that she must be treated with great care she was harassed in spiritso the doctor saidand must be taken away so that she might be amused the countess was frightened but still was resolute she not only loved her daughterbut loved no other human being on the face of the earth her daughter was all that she had to bind her to the world around her but she declared to herself again and again that it would be better that her daughter should die than live and be married to the tailor it was a case in which persecution even to the very gate of the grave would be wise and warrantableif by such persecution this odious monstrous marriage might be avoided and she did believe that persecution would avail at last if she were only steady in her resolve the girl would never dare to demand the right to leave her mothers house and walk off to the church to be married to daniel thwaite without the countenance of a single friend the girls strength was not of that nature but were she the countess to yield an inch then this evil might come upon them she had heard that young people can always beat their parents if they be sufficiently obdurate parents are softhearted to their children and are prone to yield and so would she have been softhearted if the interests concerned had been less important if the deviation from duty had been less startling or the union proposed less monstrous and disgraceful but in this case it behoved her to be obdurateeven though it should be to the very gates of the grave i swear to you she said that the day of your marriage to daniel thwaite shall be the day of my death  in her straits she went to serjeant bluestone for advice now the serjeant had hitherto been opposed to all compromise feeling certain that everything might be gained without the sacrifice of a single right he had not a word to say against a marriage between the two cousins but let the cousin who was the heiress be first placed in possession of her rights let her be empowered when she consented to become lady lovel to demand such a settlement of the property as would be made on her behalf if she were the undisputed owner of the property let her marry the lord if she would but not do so in order that she might obtain the partial enjoyment of that which was all her own and then so the serjeant had argued the widowed countess would never be held to have established absolutely her own right to her name should any compromise be known to have been effected people might call her countess lovel but behind her back they would say that she was no countess the serjeant had been very hot about it especially disliking the interference of sir william but now when he heard this new story his heat gave way anything must be done that could be doneeverything must be done to prevent such a termination to the career of the two ladies as would come from a marriage with the tailor  but he was somewhat dismayed when he came to understand the condition of affairs in keppel street how can i not be severe said the countess when he remonstrated with her if i were tender with her she would think that i was yielding is not everything at stakeeverything for which my life has been devoted the serjeant called his wife into council and then suggested that lady anna should spend a week or two in bedford square he assured the countess that she might be quite sure that daniel thwaite should find no entrance within his doors  but if lord lovel would do us the honour to visit us we should be most happy to see him said the serjeant  lady anna was removed to bedford square and there became subject to treatment that was milder but not less persistent mrs bluestone lectured her daily treating her with the utmost respect paying to her rank a deference which was not indeed natural to the good lady but which was assumed so that lady anna might the better comprehend the difference between her own position and that of the tailor the girls were told nothing of the tailorlest the disgrace of so unnatural a partiality might shock their young minds but they were instructed that there was danger and that they were always in speaking to their guest to take it for granted that she was to become countess lovel her maid sarah went with her to the serjeants and was taken into a halfconfidence lady anna was never to be left a moment alone she was to be a prisoner with gilded chainsfor whom a splendid a glorious future was in prospect if only she would accept it  i really think that she likes the lord the best said mrs bluestone to her husband  then why the mischief wont she have him this was in october and that november term was fast approaching in which the cause was set down for trial  i almost think she would if hed come and ask her again of course i have never mentioned the other man but when i speak to her of earl lovel she always answers me as though she were almost in love with him i was inquiring yesterday what sort of a man he was and she said he was quite perfect it is a thousand pities she said that he should not have this money he ought to have it as he is the earl  why doesnt she give it to him  i asked her that but she shook her head and said that it could never be i think that man has made her swear some sort of awful oath and has frightened her  no doubt he has made her swear an oath but we all know how the gods regard the perjuries of lovers said the serjeant we must get the young lord here when he comes back to town  is he handsome asked alice bluestone the younger daughter who had become lady annas special friend in the family of course they were talking of lord lovel  everybody says he is  but what do you say  i dont think it matters much about a man being handsomebut he is beautiful not dark like all the other lovels nor yet what you call fair i dont think that fair men ever look manly  oh no said alice who was contemplating an engagement with a blackhaired young barrister  lord lovel is brownwith blue eyes but it is the shape of his face that is so perfectan oval you know that is not too long but it isnt that makes him look as he does he looks as though everybody in the world ought to do exactly what he tells them  and why dont you dear do exactly what he tells you  ahthat is another question i should do many things if he told me he is the head of our family i think he ought to have all this money and be a rich great man as the earl lovel should be  and yet you wont be his wife  would youif you had promised another man  have you promised another man  yesi have  who is he lady anna  they have not told you then  nonobody has told me i know they all want you to marry lord loveland i know he wants it i know he is quite in love with you  ahi do not think that but if he were it could make no difference if you had once given your word to another man would you go back because a lord asked you  i dont think i would ever give my word without asking mamma  if he had been good to you and you had loved him always and he had been your best friendwhat would you do then  who is he lady anna  do not call me lady anna or i shall not like you i will tell you but you must not say that i told you only i thought everybody knew i told lord lovel and he i think has told all the world it is mr daniel thwaite  mr daniel thwaite said alice who had heard enough of the case to know who the thwaites were he is a tailor  yes said lady anna proudly he is a tailor  surely that cannot be good said alice who having long since felt what it was to be the daughter of a serjeant had made up her mind that she would marry nothing lower than a barrister  it is what you call bad i dare say  i dont think a tailor can be a gentleman  i dont know perhaps i wasnt a lady when i promised him but i did promise you can never know what he and his father did for us i think we should have died only for them you dont know how we livedin a little cottage with hardly any money with nobody to come near us but they everybody else thought that we were vile and wicked it is true but they always were good to us would not you have loved him  i should have loved him in a kind of way  when one takes so much one must give in return what one has to give said lady anna  do you love him still  of course i love him  and you wish to be his wife  sometimes i think i dont it is not that i am ashamed for myself what would it have signified if i had gone away with him straight from cumberland before i had ever seen my cousins supposing that mamma hadnt been the countess  but she is  so they say nowbut if they had said that she was not nobody would have thought it wrong then for me to marry mr thwaite  dont you think it wrong yourself  it would be best for me to say that i would never marry any one at all he would be very angry with me  lord lovel  oh nonot lord lovel daniel would be very angry because he really loves me but it would not be so bad to him as though i became lord lovels wife i will tell you the truth dear i am ashamed to marry mr thwaitenot for myself but because i am lord lovels cousin and mammas daughter and i should be ashamed to marry lord lovel  why dear  because i should be false and ungrateful i should be afraid to stand before him if he looked at me you do not know how he can look he too can command he too is noble they believe it is the money he wants and when they call him a tailor they think that he must be mean he is not mean he is clever and can talk about things better than my cousin he can work hard and give away all that he earns and so could his father they gave all they had to us and have never asked it again i kissed him onceand then he said i had paid all my mothers debt alice bluestone shrank within herself when she was told by this daughter of a countess of such a deed it was horrid to her mind that a tailor should be kissed by a lady anna lovel but she herself had perhaps been as generous to the blackbrowed young barrister and had thought no harm they think i do not understandbut i do they all want this money and then they accuse him and say he does it that he may become rich he would give up all the moneyjust for me how would you feel if it were like that with you  i think that a girl who is a lady should never marry a man who is not a gentleman you know the story of the rich man who could not get to abrahams bosom because there was a gulf fixed that is how it should bejust as there is with royal people as to marrying royalty otherwise everything would get mingled and there would soon be no difference if there are to be differences there should be differences that is the meaning of being a gentlemanor a lady so spoke the young female conservative with wisdom beyond her yearsnor did she speak quite in vain  i believe what i had better do would be to die said lady anna everything would come right then  some day or two after this serjeant bluestone sent a message up to lady anna on his return home from the courts with a request that she would have the great kindness to come down to him in his study the serjeant had treated her with more than all the deference due to her rank since she had been in his house striving to teach her what it was to be the daughter of an earl and probable owner of twenty thousand a year the serjeant to give him his due cared as little as most men for the peerage he vailed his bonnet to no one but a judgeand not always that with much ceremonious observance but now his conduct was a part of his duty to a client whom he was determined to see established in her rights he would have handed her her cup of tea on his knees every morning if by doing so he could have made clear to her eyes how deep would be her degradation were she to marry the tailor the message was now brought to her by mrs bluestone who almost apologized for asking her to trouble herself to walk downstairs to the back parlour my dear lady anna said the serjeant may i ask you to sit down for a moment or two while i speak to you i have just left your mother  how is dear mamma the serjeant assured her that the countess was well in health at this time lady anna had not visited her mother since she had left keppel street and had been told that lady lovel had refused to see her till she had pledged herself never to marry daniel thwaite i do so wish i might go to mamma  with all my heart i wish you could lady anna nothing makes such heartburning sorrow as a family quarrel but what can i say you know what your mother thinks  couldnt you manage that she should let me go there just once  i hope that we can manage itbut i want you to listen to me first lord lovel is back in london she pressed her lips together and fastened one hand firmly on the other if the assurance that was required from her was ever to be exacted it should not be exacted by serjeant bluestone i have seen his lordship today continued the serjeant and he has done me the honour to promise that he will dine here tomorrow  lord lovel  yesyour cousin earl lovel there is no reason i suppose why you should not meet him he has not offended you  oh nobut i have offended him  i think not lady anna he does not speak of you as though there were offence  when we parted he would hardly look at me because i told him you know what i told him  a gentleman is not necessarily offended because a lady does not accept his first offer many gentlemen would be offended if that were soand very many happy marriages would never have a chance of being made at any rate he is coming and i thought that perhaps you would excuse me if i endeavoured to explain how very much may depend on the manner in which you may receive him you must feel that things are not going on quite happily now  i am so unhappy serjeant bluestone  yes indeed it must be so you are likely to be placedi think i may say you certainly will be placedin such a position that the whole prosperity of a noble and ancient family must depend on what you may do with one word you can make once more bright a fair name that has long been beneath a cloud here in england the welfare of the state depends on the conduct of our aristocracy oh serjeant bluestone serjeant bluestone how could you so far belie your opinion as to give expression to a sentiment utterly opposed to your own convictions but what is there that a counsel will not do for a client if they whom fate and fortune have exalted forget what the country has a right to demand from them farewell alas to the glory of old england he had found this kind of thing very effective with twelve men and surely it might prevail with one poor girl it is not for me lady anna to dictate to you the choice of a husband but it has become my duty to point out to you the importance of your own choice and to explain to you if it may be possible that you are not like other young ladies you have in your hands the marring or the making of the whole family of lovel as for that suggestion of a marriage to which you were induced to give ear by feelings of gratitude it would if carried out spread desolation in the bosom of every relative to whom you are bound by the close ties of noble blood he finished his speech and lady anna retired without a word     chapter xxiii  bedford square   the earl without asking any question on the subject had found that the solicitorgeneral thought nothing of that objection which had weighed so heavily on his own mind as to carrying on his suit with a girl who had been wooed successfully by a tailor his own spirit rebelled for a while against such condescension when lady anna had first told him that she had pledged her word to a lover low in the scale of men the thing had seemed to him to be over what struggle might be made to prevent the accomplishment of so base a marriage must be effected for the sake of the family and not on his own special behoof not even for twenty thousand a year not even for lady anna lovel not for all the lovels would he take to his bosom as his bride the girl who had leaned with loving fondness on the shoulders of daniel thwaite but when he found that others did not feel it as he felt it he turned the matter over again in his mindand by degrees relented there had doubtless been much in the whole affair which had placed it outside the pale of things which are subject to the ordinary judgment of men lady annas position in the world had been very singular a debt of gratitude was due by her to the tailor which had seemed to exact from her some great payment as she had said herself she had given the only thing which she had to give now there would be much to give the man doubtless deserved his reward and should have it but that reward must not be the hand of the heiress of the lovels he the earl would once again claim that as his own  he had hurried out of town after seeing sir william but had not returned to yoxham he went again to scotland and wrote no further letter to the rectory after those three lines which the reader has seen then he heard from mr flick that lady anna was staying with the serjeant in bedford square and he returned to london at the lawyers instance it was so expedient that if possible something should be settled before november  the only guests asked to meet the earl at serjeant bluestones were sir william and lady patterson and the blackbrowed young barrister the whole proceeding was very irregularas mr flick who knew what was going on said more than once to his old partner mr norton that the solicitorgeneral should dine with the serjeant might be all very wellthough as school boys say they had never known each other at home before but that they should meet in this way the then two opposing clientsthe two claimants to the vast property as to which a cause was to come on for trial in a few weeksdid bewilder mr flick i suppose the solicitorgeneral sees his way but he may be in a mess yet said mr flick mr norton only scratched his head it was no work of his  sir william who arrived before the earl was introduced for the first time to the young lady lady anna he said for some months past i have heard much of you and now i have great pleasure in meeting you she smiled and strove to look pleased but she had not a word to say to him you know i ought to be your enemy he continued laughing but i hope that is well nigh over i should not like to have to fight so fair a foe then the young lord arrived and the lawyers of course gave way to the lover  lady anna from the moment in which she was told that he was to come had thought of nothing but the manner of their greeting it was not that she was uneasy as to her own fashion of receiving him she could smile and be silent and give him her hand or leave it ungiven as he might demand but in what manner would he accost her she had felt sure that he had despised her from the moment in which she had told him of her engagement of course he had despised her those fine sentiments about ladies and gentlemen and the gulf which had been fixed had occurred to her before she heard them from the mouth of miss alice bluestone she understood as well as did her young friend what was the difference between her cousin the earl and her lover the tailor of course it would be sweet to be able to love such a one as her cousin they all talked to her as though she was simply obstinate and a fool not perceiving as she did herself that the untowardness of her fortune had prescribed this destiny for her good as daniel thwaite might beas she knew that he wasshe felt herself to be degraded in having promised to be his wife the lessons they had taught her had not been in vain and she had been specially degraded in the eyes of him who was to her imagination the brightest of human beings they told her that she might still be his wife if only she would consent to hold out her hand when he should ask for it she did not believe it were it true it could make no differencebut she did not believe it he had scorned her when she told him the tale at bolton abbey he had scorned her when he hurried away from yoxham now he was coming to the serjeants house with the express intention of meeting her again why should he come alas alas she was sure that he would never speak to her again in that bright sunny manner with those dulcet honey words which he had used when first they saw each other in wyndham street  nor was he less uneasy as to this meeting he had not intended to scorn her when he parted from her but he had intended that she should understand that there was an end of his suit he had loved her dearly but there are obstacles to which love must yield had she already married this tailor how would it have been with him then that which had appeared to him to be most fit for him to do had suddenly become altogether unfitand he had told himself at the moment that he must take back his love to himself as best he might he could not sue for that which had once been given to a tailor but now all that was changed and he did intend to sue again she was very beautifulto his thinking the very pink of feminine grace and replete with charmssoft in voice soft in manner with just enough of spirit to give her character what a happy chance it had been what marvellous fortune that he should have been able to love this girl whom it was so necessary that he should marrywhat a happy chance had it not been for this wretched tailor but now in spite of the tailor he would try his fate with her once again he had not intended to scorn her when he left her but he knew that his manner to her must have told her that his suit was over how should he renew it again in the presence of serjeant and mrs bluestone and of sir william and lady patterson  he was first introduced to the wives of the two lawyers while lady anna was sitting silent on the corner of a sofa mrs bluestone foreseeing how it would be had endeavoured with much prudence to establish her young friend at some distance from the other guests in order that the earl might have the power of saying some word but the young barrister had taken this opportunity of making himself agreeable and stood opposite to her talking nothings about the emptiness of london and the glories of the season when it should come lady anna did not hear a word that the young barrister said lady annas ear was straining itself to hear what lord lovel might say and her eye though not quite turned towards him was watching his every motion of course he must speak to her lady anna is on the sofa said mrs bluestone of course he knew that she was there he had seen her dear face the moment that he entered the room he walked up to her and gave her his hand and smiled upon her  she had made up her little speech i hope they are quite well at yoxham she said in that low soft silver voice which he had told himself would so well befit the future countess lovel  oh yesi believe so i am a truant there for i do not answer aunt julias letters as punctually as i ought to do i shall be down there for the hunting i suppose next month then dinner was announced and as it was necessary that the earl should take down mrs bluestone and the serjeant lady annaso that the young barrister absolutely went down to dinner with the wife of the solicitorgeneralthe conversation was brought to an end nor was it possible that they should be made to sit next each other at dinner and then when at last the late evening came and they were all together in the drawingroom other things intervened and the half hour so passed that hardly a word was spoken between them but there was just one word as he went away i shall call and see you he said  i dont think he means it the serjeant said to his wife that evening almost in anger  why not my dear  he did not speak to her  people cant speak at dinnerparties when there is anything particular to say if he didnt mean it he wouldnt have come and if youll all have a little patience shell mean it too i cant forgive her mother for being so hard to her shes one of the sweetest creatures i ever came across  a little patience and here was november coming the earl who had now been dining in his house meeting his own client there must again become the serjeants enemy in november unless this matter were settled the serjeant at present could see no other way of proceeding the earl might no doubt retire from the suit but a jury must then decide whether the italian woman had any just claim and against the claim of the italian woman the earl would again come forward the serjeant as he thought of it was almost sorry that he had asked the earl and the solicitorgeneral to his house  on the very next morningearly in the daythe earl was announced in bedford square the serjeant was of course away at his chambers lady anna was in her room and mrs bluestone was sitting with her daughter i have come to see my cousin said the earl boldly  i am so glad that you have come lord lovel  thank youwell yes i know you will not mind my saying so outright though the papers say that we are enemies we have many things in common between us  i will send her to you my dear we will go into the diningroom you will find lunch ready when you come down lord lovel then she left him and he stood looking for a while at the books that were laid about the table  it seemed to him to be an age but at last the door was opened and his cousin crept into the room when he had parted from her at yoxham he had called her lady anna but he was determined that she should at any rate be again his cousin i could hardly speak to you yesterday he said while he held her hand  nolord lovel  people never can i think at small parties like that dear anna you surprised me so much by what you told me on the banks of the wharfe she did not know how to answer him even a word i know that i was unkind to you  i did not think so my lord  i will tell you just the plain truth even though it may be bitter the truth will be best between us dearest when first i heard what you said i believed that all must be over between you and me  oh yes she said  but i have thought about it since and i will not have it so i have not come to reproach you  you may if you will  i have no right to do so and would not if i had i can understand your feelings of deep gratitude and can respect them  but i love him my lord said lady anna holding her head on high and speaking with much dignity she could hardly herself understand the feeling which induced her so to address him when she was alone thinking of him and of her other lover her heart was inclined to regret in that she had not known her cousin in her early daysas she had known daniel thwaite she could tell herself though she could not tell any other human being that when she had thought that she was giving her heart to the young tailor she had not quite known what it was to have a heart to give the young lord was as a god to her whereas daniel was but a manto whom she owed so deep a debt of gratitude that she must sacrifice herself if needs be on his behalf and yet when the earl spoke to her of her gratitude to this manpraising it and professing that he also understood those very feelings which had governed her conductshe blazed up almost in wrath and swore that she loved the tailor  the earls task was certainly difficult it was his first impulse to rush away again as he had rushed away before to rush away and leave the country and let the lawyers settle it all as they would could it be possible that such a girl as this should love a journeyman tailor and should be proud of her love he turned from her and walked to the door and back again during which time she had almost repented of her audacity  it is right that you should love himas a friend he said  but i have sworn to be his wife  and must you keep your oath as she did not answer him he pressed on with his suit if he loves you i am sure he cannot wish to hurt you and you know that such a marriage as that would be very hurtful can it be right that you should descend from your position to pay a debt of gratitude and that you should do it at the expense of all those who belong to you would you break your mothers heart and mine and bring disgrace upon your family merely because he was good to you  he was good to my mother as well as me  will it not break her heart has she not told you so but perhaps you do not believe it my love  i do not know she said  ah dearest you may believe to my eyes you are the sweetest of all gods creatures perhaps you think i say so only for the moneys sake  no my lord i do not think that  of course much is due to him  he wants nothing but that i should be his wife he has said so and he is never false i can trust him at any rate even though i should betray him but i will not betray him i will go away with him and they shall not hear of me and nobody will remember that i was my fathers daughter  you are doubting even now dear  but i ought not to doubt if i doubt it is because i am weak  then still be weak surely such weakness will be good when it will please all those who must be dearest to you  it will not please him lord lovel  will you do this dearestwill you take one week to consider and then write to me you cannot refuse me that knowing that the happiness and the honour and the welfare of every lovel depends upon your answer  she felt that she could not refuse and she gave him the promise on that day week she would write to him and tell him then to what resolve she should have brought herself he came up close to her meaning to kiss her if she would let him but she stood aloof and merely touched his hand she would obey her betrothedat any rate till she should have made up her mind that she would be untrue to him lord lovel could not press his wish and left the house unmindful of mrs bluestones luncheon     chapter xxiv  the dog in the manger   during all this time daniel thwaite had been living alone working day after day and hour after hour among the men in wigmore street trusted by his employer disliked by those over whom he was set in some sort of authority and befriended by none he had too heavy a weight on his spirits to be light of heart even had his nature been given to lightness how could he even hope that the girl would resist all the temptation that would be thrown in her way all the arguments that would be used to her the natural entreaties that would be showered upon her from all her friends nor did he so think of himself as to believe that his own personal gifts would bind her to him when opposed by those other personal gifts which he knew belonged to the lord measuring himself by his own standard regarding that man to be most manly who could be most useful in the world he did think himself to be infinitely superior to the earl he was the working bee whereas the earl was the drone and he was one who used to the best of his abilities the mental faculties which had been given to him whereas the earlso he believedwas himself hardly conscious of having had mental faculties bestowed upon him the earl was to his thinking as were all earls an excrescence upon society which had been produced by the evil habits and tendencies of mankind a thing to be got rid of before any near approach could be made to that social perfection in the future coming of which he fully believed but though useless the earl was beautiful to the eye though purposeless as regarded any true purpose of speech his voice was of silver and sweet to the ears his hands which could never help him to a morsel of bread were soft to the touch he was sweet with perfumes and idleness and never reeked of the sweat of labour was it possible that such a girl as anna lovel should resist the popinjay backed as he would be by her own instincts and by the prayers of every one of her race and then from time to time another thought would strike him using his judgment as best he might on her behalf ought he to wish that she should do so the idleness of an earl might be bad and equally bad the idleness of a countess to be the busy wife of a busy man to be the mother of many children who should be all taught to be busy on behalf of mankind was to his thinking the highest lot of woman but there was a question with him whether the accidents of her birth and fortune had not removed her from the possibility of such joy as that how would it be with her and him too if in after life she should rebuke him because he had not allowed her to be the wife of a nobleman and how would it be with him if hereafter men said of him that he held her to an oath extracted from her in her childhood because of her wealth he had been able to answer mr flick on that head but he had more difficulty in answering himself  he had written to his father after the countess had left the house in which he lodged and his father had answered him the old man was not much given to the writing of letters about lady lovel and her daughter said he i wont take no more trouble nor shouldnt you she and you is different and must be and that was all he said yeshe and lady anna were different and must remain so of a morning when he went fresh to his work he would resolve that he would send her word that she was entirely free from him and would bid her do according to the nature of the lovels but in the evening as he would wander back slowly all alone tired of his work tired of the black solitude of the life he was leading longing for some softness to break the harsh monotony of his labour he would remember all her prettinesses and would above all remember the pretty oaths with which she had sworn that she anna lovel loved him daniel thwaite with all the womans love which a woman could give he would remember the warm kiss which had seemed to make fresh for hours his dry lips and would try to believe that the bliss of which he had thought so much might still be his own had she abandoned him had she assented to a marriage with the earl he would assuredly have heard of it he also knew well the day fixed for the trial and understood the importance which would be attached to an early marriage should that be possibleor at least to a public declaration of an engagement at any rate she had not as yet been false to him  one day he received at his place of work the following note      dear mr thwaite     i wish to speak to you on most important business    could you call on me tomorrow at eight oclock in the    eveninghere     yours very faithfully and always grateful     j lovel   and then the countess had added her address in keppel streetthe very address which about a month back she had refused to give him of course he went to the countessfully believing that lady anna would also be at the house though believing also that he would not be allowed to see her but at this time lady anna was still staying with mrs bluestone in bedford square  it was no doubt natural that every advantage should be taken of the strong position which lord lovel held when he had extracted a promise from lady anna that she would write to him at the end of a week he told sir william sir william told his wife lady patterson told mrs bluestone and mrs bluestone told the countess they were all now in league against the tailor if they could only get a promise from the girl before the cause came onanything that they could even call a promisethen the thing might be easy united together they would not be afraid of what the italian woman might do and this undertaking to write to lord lovel was almost as good as a promise when a girl once hesitates with a lover she has as good as surrendered to say even that she will think of it is to accept the man then mrs bluestone and the countess putting their heads together determined that an appeal should be made to the tailor had sir william or the serjeant been consulted either would have been probably strong against the measure but the ladies acted on their own judgment and daniel thwaite presented himself in keppel street it is very kind of you to come said the countess  there is no great kindness in that said daniel thinking perhaps of those twenty years of service which had been given by him and by his father  i know you think that i have been ungrateful for all that you have done for me he did think so and was silent but you would hardly wish me to repay you for helping me in my struggle by giving up all for which i have struggled  i have asked for nothing lady lovel  have you not  i have asked you for nothing  but my daughter is all that i have in the world have you asked nothing of her  yes lady lovel i have asked much from her and she has given me all that i have asked but i have asked nothing and now claim nothing as payment for service done if lady anna thinks she is in my debt after such fashion as that i will soon make her free  she does think so mr thwaite  let her tell me so with her own lips  you will not think that i am lying to you  and yet men do lie and women too without remorse when the stakes are high i will believe no one but herself in this let her come down and stand before me and look me in the face and tell me that it is soand i promise you that there shall be no further difficulty i will not even ask to be alone with her i will speak but a dozen words to her and you shall hear them  she is not here mr thwaite she is not living in this house  where is she then  she is staying with friends  with the lovelsin yorkshire  i do not think that good can be done by my telling you where she is  do you mean me to understand that she is engaged to the earl  i tell you thisthat she acknowledges herself to be bound to you but bound to you simply by gratitude it seems that there was a promise  oh yesthere was a promise lady lovel a promise as firmly spoken as when you told the late lord that you would be his wife  i know that there was a promisethough i her mother living with her at the time had no dream of such wickedness there was a promise and by that she feels herself to be in some measure bound  she should do soif words can ever mean anything  i say she doesbut it is only by a feeling of gratitude whatis it probable that she should wish to mate so much below her degree if she were now left to her own choice does it seem natural to you she loves the young earlas why should she not she has been thrown into his company on purpose that she might learn to love himwhen no one knew of this horrid promise which had been exacted from her before she had seen any in the world from whom to choose  she has seen two now him and me and she can choose as she pleases let us both agree to take her at her word and let us both be present when that word is spoken if she goes to him and offers him her hand in my presence i would not take it then though she were a princess in lieu of being lady anna lovel will he treat me as fairly will he be as bold to abide by her choice  you can never marry her mr thwaite  why can i never marry her would not my ring be as binding on her finger as his would not the parsons word make me and her one flesh and one bone as irretrievably as though i were ten times an earl i am a man and she a woman what law of god or of manwhat law of nature can prevent us from being man and wife i say that i can marry herand with her consent i will  never you shall never live to call yourself the husband of my daughter i have striven and sufferedas never woman strove and suffered before to give to my child the name and the rank which belong to her i did not do so that she might throw them away on such a one as you if you will deal honestly by us  i have dealt by you more than honestly  if you will at once free her from this thraldom in which you hold her and allow her to act in accordance with the dictates of her own heart  that she shall do  if you will not hinder us in building up again the honour of the family which was nigh ruined by the iniquities of my husband we will bless you  i want but one blessing lady lovel  and in regard to her money  i do not expect you to believe me countess but her money counts as nothing with me if it becomes hers and she becomes my wife as her husband i will protect it for her but there shall be no dealing between you and me in regard to money  there is money due to your father mr thwaite  if so that can be paid when you come by your own it was not lent for the sake of a reward  and you will not liberate that poor girl from her thraldom  she can liberate herself if she will i have told you what i will do let her tell me to my face what she wishes  that she shall never do mr thwaiteno by heavens it is not necessary that she should have your consent to make such an alliance as her friends think proper for her you have entangled her by a promise foolish on her part and very wicked on yours and you may work us much trouble you may delay the settlement of all this questionperhaps for years and half ruin the estate by prolonged lawsuits you may make it impossible for me to pay your father what i owe him till he and i also shall be no more but you cannot and shall not have access to my daughter  daniel thwaite as he returned home tried to think it all over dispassionately was it as the countess had represented was he acting the part of the dog in the manger robbing others of happiness without the power of achieving his own he loved the girl and was he making her miserable by his love he was almost inclined to think that the countess had spoken truth in this respect   end of vol i   printed by virtue

keppel street the countess received from him a packet containing a short note to herself and the following letter addressed to lady anna the enclosure was open and in the letter addressed to the countess the tailor simply asked her to read and to send on to her daughter that which he had written adding that if she would do so he would promise to abide by any answer which might come to him in lady annas own handwriting daniel thwaite when he made this offer felt that he was giving up everything even though the words might be written by the girl they would be dictated by the girls mother or by those lawyers who were now leagued together to force her into a marriage with the earl but it was right he thoughtand upon the whole best for all partiesthat he should give up everything he could not bring himself to say so to the countess or to any of those lawyers when he was sent for and told that because of the lowliness of his position a marriage between him and the highly born heiress was impossible on such occasions he revolted from the authority of those who endeavoured to extinguish him but when alone he could see at any rate as clearly as they did the difficulties which lay in his way he also knew that there was a great gulf fixed as miss alice bluestone had saidthough he differed from the young lady as to the side of the gulf on which lay heaven and on which heavens opposite the letter to lady anna was as follows      my dearest     this letter if it reaches you at all will be given to you    by your mother who will have read it it is sent to her    open that she may see what i say to you she sent for me    and i went to her this evening and she told me that it    was impossible that i should ever be your husband i was    so bold as to tell her ladyship that there could be no    impossibility when you are of age you can walk out from    your mothers house and marry me as can i you and no one    can hinder us there is nothing in the law either of god    or man that can prevent you from becoming my wifeif it    be your wish to be so but your mother also said that it    was not your wish and she went on to say that were you    not bound to me by ties of gratitude you would willingly    marry your cousin lord lovel then i offered to meet you    in the presence of your motherand in the presence too    of lord loveland to ask you then before all of us to    which of us two your heart was given and i promised that    if in my presence you would stretch out your right hand to    the earl neither you nor your mother should be troubled    further by daniel thwaite but her ladyship swore to me    with an oath that i should never be allowed to see you    again     i therefore write to you and bid you think much of what    i say to you before you answer me you know well that i    love you you do not suspect that i am trying to win you    because you are rich you will remember that i loved you    when no one thought that you would be rich i do love you    in my heart of hearts i think of you in my dreams and    fancy then that all the world has become bright to me    because we are walking together handinhand where none    can come between to separate us but i would not wish you    to be my wife just because you have promised if you do    not love meabove all if you love this other mansay    so and i will have done with it your mother says that    you are bound to me by gratitude i do not wish you to be    my wife unless you are bound to me by love tell me then    how it isbut as you value my happiness and your own    tell me the truth     i will not say that i shall think well of you if you have    been carried away by this young mans nobility i would    have you give me a fair chance ask yourself what has    brought him as a lover to your feet how it came to pass    that i was your lover you cannot but remember but for    you it is your first duty not to marry a man unless you    love him if you go to him because he can make you a    countess you will be vile indeed if you go to him because    you find that he is in truth dearer to you than i am    because you prefer his arm to mine because he has wound    himself into your heart of heartsi shall think your    heart indeed hardly worth the having but according to    your lights you will be doing right in that case you    shall have no further word from me to trouble you     but i desire that i may have an answer to this in your own    handwriting     your own sincere lover     daniel thwaite   in composing and copying and recopying this letter the tailor sat up half the night and then very early in the morning he himself carried it to keppel street thus adding nearly three miles to his usual walk to wigmore street the servant at the lodginghouse was not up and could hardly be made to rise by the modest appeals which daniel made to the bell but at last the delivery was effected and the forlorn lover hurried back to his work  the countess as she sat at breakfast read the letter over and over again and could not bring herself to decide whether it was right that it should be given to her daughter she had not yet seen lady anna since she had sent the poor offender away from the house in anger and had more than once repeated her assurance through mrs bluestone that she would not do so till a promise had been given that the tailor should be repudiated should she make this letter an excuse for going to the house in bedford square and of seeing her child towards whom her very bowels were yearning at this time though she was a countess with the prospect of great wealth her condition was not enviable from morning to night she was alone unless when she would sit for an hour in mr goffes office or on the rarer occasions of a visit to the chambers of serjeant bluestone she had no acquaintances in london whatever she knew that she was unfitted for london society even if it should be open to her she had spent her life in struggling with poverty and powerful enemiesalmost alonetaking comfort in her happiest moments in the strength and goodness of her old friend thomas thwaite she now found that those old days had been happier than these later days her girl had been with her and had beenor had at any rate seemed to betrue to her she had something then to hope something to expect some happiness of glory to which she could look forward but now she was beginning to learnnay had already learned that there was nothing for her to expect her rank was allowed to her she no longer suffered from want of money her cause was about to triumphas the lawyers on both sides had seemed to say but in what respect would the triumph be sweet to her even should her girl become the countess lovel she would not be the less isolated none of the lovels wanted her society she had banished her daughter to bedford square and the only effect of the banishment was that her daughter was less miserable in bedford square than she would have been with her mother in keppel street  she did not dare to act without advice and therefore she took the letter to mr goffe had it not been for a few words towards the end of the letter she would have sent it to her daughter at once but the man had said that her girl would be vile indeed if she married the earl for the sake of becoming a countess and the widow of the late earl did not like to put such doctrine into the hands of lady anna if she delivered the letter of course she would endeavour to dictate the answerbut her girl could be stubborn as her mother and how would it be with them if quite another letter should be written than that which the countess would have dictated  mr goffe read the letter and said that he would like to consider it for a day the letter was left with mr goffe and mr goffe consulted the serjeant the serjeant took the letter home to mrs bluestone and then another consultation was held it found its way to the very house in which the girl was living for whom it was intended but was not at last allowed to reach her hand its a fine manly letter said the serjeant  then the less proper to give it to her said mrs bluestone whose heart was all softness towards lady anna but as hard as a millstone towards the tailor  if she does like this young lord the best why shouldnt she tell the man the truth said the serjeant  of course she likes the young lord the bestas is natural  then in gods name let her say so and put an end to all this trouble  you see my dear it isnt always easy to understand a girls mind in such matters i havent a doubt which she likes best she is not at all the girl to have a vitiated taste about young men but you see this other man came first and had the advantage of being her only friend at the time she has felt very grateful to him and as yet she is only beginning to learn the difference between gratitude and love i dont at all agree with her mother as to being severe with her i cant bear severity to young people who ought to be made happy but i am quite sure that this tailor should be kept away from her altogether she must not see him or his handwriting what would she say to herself if she got that letter if he is generous i can be generous too and if she ever wrote him a letter pledging herself to him all would be over as it is she has promised to write to lord lovel we will hold her to that and then when she has given a sort of a promise to the earl we will take care that the tailor shall know it it will be best for all parties what we have got to do is to save her from this man who has been both her best friend and her worst enemy mrs bluestone was an excellent woman and in this emergency was endeavouring to do her duty at considerable trouble to herself and with no hope of any reward the future countess when she should become a countess would be nothing to her she was a good womanbut she did not care what evil she inflicted on the tailor in her endeavours to befriend the daughter of the countess  the tailors letter unseen and undreamt of by lady anna was sent back through the serjeant and mr goffe to lady lovel with strong advice from mr goffe that lady anna should not be allowed to see it i dont hesitate to tell you lady lovel that i have consulted the serjeant and that we are both of opinion that no intercourse whatever should be permitted between lady anna lovel and mr daniel thwaite the unfortunate letter was therefore sent back to the writer with the following notethe countess lovel presents her compliments to mr daniel thwaite and thinks it best to return the enclosed the countess is of opinion that no intercourse whatever should take place between her daughter and mr daniel thwaite  then daniel swore an oath to himself that the intercourse between them should not thus be made to cease he had acted as he thought not only fairly but very honourably nayhe was by no means sure that that which had been intended for fairness and honour might not have been sheer simplicity he had purposely abstained from any clandestine communication with the girl he lovedeven though she was one to whom he had had access all his life with whom he had been allowed to grow up togetherwho had eaten of his bread and drank of his cup now her new friendsand his own old friend the countesswould keep no measures with him there was to be no intercourse whatever but by the god of heaven there should be intercourse     chapter xxvi  the keswick poet   infinite difficulties were now complicating themselves on the head of poor daniel thwaite the packet which the countess addressed to him did not reach him in london but was forwarded after him down to cumberland whither he had hurried on receipt of news from keswick that his father was like to die the old man had fallen in a fit and when the message was sent it was not thought likely that he would ever see his son again daniel went down to the north as quickly as his means would allow him going by steamer to whitehaven and thence by coach to keswick his entire wages were but thirtyfive shillings a week and on that he could not afford to travel by the mail to keswick but he did reach home in time to see his father alive and to stand by the bedside when the old man died  though there was not time for many words between them and though the apathy of coming death had already clouded the mind of thomas thwaite so that he for the most part disregardedas dying men do disregardthose things which had been fullest of interest to him still something was said about the countess and lady anna just dont mind them any further dan said the father  indeed that will be best said daniel  yes in truth what can they be to the likes o you give me a drop of brandy dan the drop of brandy was more to him now than the countess but though he thought but little of this last word his son thought much of it what could such as the countess and her titled daughter be to him daniel thwaite the broken tailor for in truth his father was dying a broken man there was as much owed by him in keswick as all the remaining property would pay and as for the business it had come to that that the business was not worth preserving  the old tailor died and was buried and all keswick knew that he had left nothing behind him except the debt that was due to him by the countess as to which opinion in the world of keswick varied very much there were those who said that the two thwaites father and son had known very well on which side their bread was buttered and that daniel thwaite would now at his fathers death become the owner of bonds to a vast amount on the lovel property it was generally understood in keswick that the earls claim was to be abandoned that the rights of the countess and her daughter were to be acknowledged and that the earl and his cousin were to become man and wife if so the bonds would be paid and daniel thwaite would become a rich man such was the creed of those who believed in the debt but there were others who did not believe in the existence of any such bonds and who ridiculed the idea of advances of money having been made the old tailor had no doubt relieved the immediate wants of the countess by giving her shelter and food and had wasted his substance in making journeys and neglecting his business but that was supposed to be all for such services on behalf of the father it was not probable that much money would be paid to the son and the less so as it was known in keswick that daniel thwaite had quarrelled with the countess as this latter opinion preponderated daniel did not find that he was treated with any marked respect in his native town  the old man did leave a willa very simple document by which everything that he had was left to his son and there was this paragraph in it i expect that the countess lovel will repay to my son daniel all moneys that i have advanced on her behalf as for bondsor any single bonddaniel could find none there was an account of certain small items due by the countess of long date and there was her ladyships receipt for a sum of £500 which had apparently been lent at the time of the trial for bigamy beyond this he could find no record of any details whatever and it seemed to him that his claim was reduced to something less than £600 nevertheless he had understood from his father that the whole of the old mans savings had been spent on behalf of the two ladies and he believed that some time since he had heard a sum named exceeding £6000 in his difficulty he asked a local attorney and the attorney advised him to throw himself on the generosity of the countess he paid the attorney some small fee and made up his mind at once that he would not take the lawyers advice he would not throw himself on the generosity of the countess  there was then still living in that neighbourhood a great man a poet who had nearly carried to its close a life of great honour and of many afflictions he was one who in these his latter days eschewed all society and cared to see no faces but those of the surviving few whom he had loved in early life and as those few survivors lived far away and as he was but little given to move from home his life was that of a recluse of the inhabitants of the place around him who for the most part had congregated there since he had come among them he saw but little and his neighbours said that he was sullen and melancholic but according to their degrees he had been a friend to thomas thwaite and now in his emergency the son called upon the poet indifferent visitors who might be and often were intruders were but seldom admitted at that modest gate but daniel thwaite was at once shown into the presence of the man of letters they had not seen each other since daniel was a youth and neither would have known the other the poet was hardly yet an old man but he had all the characteristics of age his shoulders were bent and his eyes were deep set in his head and his lips were thin and fast closed but the beautiful oval of his face was still there in spite of the ravages of years of labours and of sorrow and the special brightness of his eye had not yet been dimmed i have been sorry mr thwaite to hear of your fathers death said the poet i knew him well but it was some years since and i valued him as a man of singular probity and spirit then daniel craved permission to tell his storyand he told it all from the beginning to the endhow his father and he had worked for the countess and her girl how their time and then their money had been spent for her how he had learned to love the girl and how as he believed the girl had loved him and he told with absolute truth the whole story as far as he knew it of what had been done in london during the last nine months he exaggerated nothing and did not scruple to speak openly of his own hopes he showed his letter to the countess and her note to him and while doing so hid none of his own feelings did the poet think that there was any reason why in such circumstances a tailor should not marry the daughter of a countess and then he gave as far as he knew it the history of the money that had been advanced and produced a copy of his fathers will and now sir what would you have me do  when you first spoke to the girl of love should you not have spoken to the mother also mr thwaite  would you sir have done so  i will not say thatbut i think that i ought her girl was all that she had  it may be that i was wrong but if the girl loves me now  i would not hurt your feelings for the world mr thwaite  do not spare them sir i did not come to you that soft things might be said to me  i do not think it of your fathers son seeing what is your own degree in life and what is theirs that they are noble and of an old nobility among the few hothouse plants of the nation and that you are one of the peoplea blade of corn out of the open field if i may say soborn to eat your bread in the sweat of your brow can you think that such a marriage would be other than distressing to them  is the hothouse plant stronger or better or of higher use than the ear of corn  have i said that it was my friend i will not say that either is higher in gods sight than the other or better or of a nobler use but they are different and though the differences may verge together without evil when the limits are near i do not believe in graftings so violent as this  you mean sir that one so low as a tailor should not seek to marry so infinitely above himself as with the daughter of an earl  yes mr thwaite that is what i mean though i hope that in coming to me you knew me well enough to be sure that i would not willingly offend you  there is no offencethere can be no offence i am a tailor and am in no sort ashamed of my trade but i did not think sir that you believed in lords so absolutely as that  i believe but in one lord said the poet in him who in his wisdom and for his own purposes made men of different degrees  has it been his doing siror the devils  nay i will not discuss with you a question such as that i will not at any rate discuss it now  i have read sir in your earlier books  do not quote my books to me either early or late you ask me for advice and i give it according to my ability the time may come too mr thwaiteand this he said laughingwhen you also will be less hot in your abhorrence of a nobility than you are now  never  ahtis so that young men always make assurances to themselves of their own present wisdom  you think then that i should give her up entirely  i would leave her to herself and to her motherand to this young lord if he be her lover  but if she loves me oh sir she did love me once if she loves me should i leave her to think as time goes on that i have forgotten her what chance can she have if i do not interfere to let her know that i am true to her  she will have the chance of becoming lady lovel and of loving her husband  then sir you do not believe in vows of love  how am i to answer that said the poet surely i do believe in vows of love i have written much of love and have ever meant to write the truth as i knew it or thought that i knew it but the love of which we poets sing is not the love of the outer world it is more ecstatic but far less serviceable it is the picture of that which exists but grand with imaginary attributes as are the portraits of ladies painted by artists who have thought rather of their art than of their models we tell of a constancy in love which is hardly compatible with the usages of this as yet imperfect world look abroad and see whether girls do not love twice and young men thrice they come together and rub their feathers like birds and fancy that each has found in the other an eternity of weal or woe then come the causes of their parting their fathers perhaps are capulets and montagues but their children god be thanked are not romeos and juliets or money does not serve or distance intervenes or simply a new face has the poor merit of novelty the constancy of which the poets sing is the unreali may almost say the unnecessaryconstancy of a juliet the constancy on which our nature should pride itself is that of an imogen you read shakespeare i hope mr thwaite  i know the plays you quote sir imogen was a kings daughter and married a simple gentleman  i would not say that early vows should mean nothing continued the poet unwilling to take notice of the point made against him i like to hear that a girl has been true to her first kiss but this girl will have the warrant of all the world to justify a second choice and can you think that because your company was pleasant to her here among your native mountains when she knew none but you that she will be indifferent to the charms of such a one as you tell me this lord lovel is she will have regretsremorse even she will sorrow because she knows that you have been good to her but she will yield and her life will be happier with himunless he be a bad man which i do not knowthan it would be with you would there be no regrets think you no remorse when she found that as your wife she had separated herself from all that she had been taught to regard as delightful in this world would she be happy in quarrelling with her mother and her newfound relatives you think little of noble blood and perhaps i think as little of it in matters relating to myself but she is noble and she will think of it as for your money mr thwaite i should make it a matter of mere business with the countess as though there was no question relating to her daughter she probably has an account of the money and doubtless will pay you when she has means at her disposal  daniel left his mentor without another word on his own behalf expressing thanks for the counsel that had been given to him and assuring the poet that he would endeavour to profit by it then he walked away over the very paths on which he had been accustomed to stray with anna lovel and endeavoured to digest the words that he had heard he could not bring himself to see their truth that he should not force the girl to marry him if she loved another better than she loved him simply by the strength of her own obligation to him he could understand but that it was natural that she should transfer to another the affection that she had once bestowed upon him because that other was a lord he would not allow not only his heart but all his intellect rebelled against such a decision a transfer so violent would he thought show that she was incapable of loving and yet this doctrine had come to him from one who as he himself had said had written much of love  but though he argued after this fashion with himself the words of the old poet had had their efficacy whether the fault might be with the girl or with himself or with the untoward circumstances of the case he determined to teach himself that he had lost her he would never love another woman though the earls daughter could not be true to him he the suitor would be true to the earls daughter there might no longer be romeos among the noble capulets and the noble montagueswhom indeed he believed to be dead to faith but the salt of truth had not therefore perished from the world he would get what he could from this wretched wreck of his fathers propertyobtain payment if it might be possible of that poor £500 for which he held the receiptand then go to some distant land in which the wisest of counsellors would not counsel him that he was unfit because of his trade to mate himself with noble blood  when he had proved his fathers will he sent a copy of it up to the countess with the following letter      keswick november 4 183     my lady     i do not know whether your ladyship will yet have heard    of my fathers death he died here on the 24th of last    month he was taken with apoplexy on the 15th and never    recovered from the fit i think you will be sorry for him     i find myself bound to send your ladyship a copy of his    will your ladyship perhaps may have some account of what    money has passed between you and him i have none except a    receipt for £500 given to you by him many years ago there    is also a bill against your ladyship for £71 18s 9d    it may be that no more is due than this but you will    know i shall be happy to hear from your ladyship on the    subject and am     yours respectfully     daniel thwaite   but he still was resolved that before he departed for the far western land he would obtain from anna lovel herself an expression of her determination to renounce him     chapter xxvii  lady annas letter   in the mean time the week had gone round and lady annas letter to the earl had not yet been written an army was arrayed against the girl to induce her to write such a letter as might make it almost impossible for her afterwards to deny that she was engaged to the lord but the army had not as yet succeeded the countess had not seen her daughterhad been persistent in her refusal to let her daughter come to her till she had at any rate repudiated her other suitor but she had written a strongly worded but short letter urging it as a great duty that lady anna lovel was bound to support her family and to defend her rank mrs bluestone from day to day with soft loving words taught the same lesson alice bluestone in their daily conversations spoke of the tailor or rather of this promise to the tailor with a horror which at any rate was not affected the serjeant almost with tears in his eyes implored her to put an end to the lawsuit even the solicitorgeneral sent her tender messagesexpressing his great hope that she might enable them to have this matter adjusted early in november all the details of the case as it now stood had been explained to her over and over again if when the day fixed for the trial should come round it could be said that she and the young earl were engaged to each other the earl would altogether abandon his claimand no further statement would be made the fact of the marriage in cumberland would then be provedthe circumstances of the trial for bigamy would be given in evidenceand all the persons concerned would be together anxious that the demands of the two ladies should be admitted in full it was the opinion of the united lawyers that were this done the rank of the countess would be allowed and that the property left behind him by the old lord would be at once given up to those who would inherit it under the order of things as thus established the countess would receive that to which she would be entitled as widow the daughter would be the heiratlaw to the bulk of the personal property and the earl would merely claim any real estate ifas was very doubtfulany real estate had been left in question in this case the disposition of the property would be just what they would all desire and the question of rank would be settled for ever but if the young lady should not have then agreed to this very pleasant compromise the earl indeed would make no further endeavours to invalidate the cumberland marriage and would retire from the suit but it would then be stated that there was a claimant in sicilyor at least evidence in italy which if sifted might possibly bar the claim of the countess the solicitorgeneral did not hesitate to say that he believed the living woman to be a weak impostor who had been first used by the earl and had then put forward a falsehood to get an income out of the property but he was by no means convinced that the other foreign woman whom the earl had undoubtedly made his first wife might not have been alive when the second marriage was contracted if it were so the countess would be no countess anna lovel would simply be anna murray penniless baseborn and a fit wife for the tailor should the tailor think fit to take her if it be so said lady anna through her tears let it be so and he will take me  it may have been that the army was too strong for its own purposetoo much of an army to gain a victory on that fieldthat a weaker combination of forces would have prevailed when all this array failed no one had a word to say for the tailor no one admitted that he had been a generous friend no feeling was expressed for him it seemed to be taken for granted that he from the beginning had laid his plans for obtaining possession of an enormous income in the event of the countess being proved to be a countess there was no admission that he had done aught for love now in all these matters lady anna was sure of but one thing alone and that was of the tailors truth had they acknowledged that he was good and noble they might perhaps have persuaded heras the poet had almost persuaded her loverthat the fitness of things demanded that they should be separated  but she had promised that she would write the letter by the end of the week and when the end of a fortnight had come she knew that it must be written she had declared over and over again to mrs bluestone that she must go away from bedford square she could not live there always she said she knew that she was in the way of everybody why should she not go back to her own mother does mamma mean to say that i am never to live with her any more mrs bluestone promised that if she would write her letter and tell her cousin that she would try to love him she should go back to her mother at once but i cannot live here always persisted lady anna mrs bluestone would not admit that there was any reason why her visitor should not continue to live in bedford square as long as the arrangement suited lady lovel  various letters were written for her the countess wrote one which was an unqualified acceptance of the earls offer and which was very short alice bluestone wrote one which was full of poetry mrs bluestone wrote a third in which a great many ambiguous words were usedin which there was no definite promise and no poetry but had this letter been sent it would have been almost impossible for the girl afterwards to extricate herself from its obligations the serjeant perhaps had lent a word or two for the letter was undoubtedly very clever in this letter lady anna was made to say that she would always have the greatest pleasure in receiving her cousins visits and that she trusted that she might be able to cooperate with her cousins in bringing the lawsuit to a closethat she certainly would not marry any one without her mothers consent but that she did not find herself able at the present to say more than that it wont stop the solicitorgeneral you know the serjeant had remarked as he read it bother the solicitorgeneral mrs bluestone had answered and had then gone on to show that it would lead to that which would stop the learned gentleman the serjeant had added a word or two and great persuasion was used to induce lady anna to use this epistle  but she would have none of it oh i couldnt mrs bluestonehe would know that i hadnt written all that  you have promised to write and you are bound to keep your promise said mrs bluestone  i believe i am bound to keep all my promises said lady anna thinking of those which she had made to daniel thwaite  but at last she sat down and did write a letter for herself specially premising that no one should see it when she had made her promise she certainly had not intended to write that which should be shown to all the world mrs bluestone had begged that at any rate the countess might see it if mamma will let me go to her of course i will show it her said lady anna at last it was thought best to allow her to write her own letter and to send it unseen after many struggles and with many tears she wrote her letter as follows      bedford square tuesday     my dear cousin     i am sorry that i have been so long in doing what i said    i would do i dont think i ought to have promised for i    find it very difficult to say anything and i think that    it is wrong that i should write at all it is not my fault    that there should be a lawsuit i do not want to take    anything away from anybody or to get anything for myself    i think papa was very wicked when he said that mamma was    not his wife and of course i wish it may all go as she    wishes but i dont think anybody ought to ask me to do    what i feel to be wrong     mr daniel thwaite is not at all such a person as they    say he and his father have been mammas best friends and    i shall never forget that old mr thwaite is dead and i    am very sorry to hear it if you had known them as we did    you would understand what i feel of course he is not your    friend but he is my friend and i dare say that makes me    unfit to be friends with you you are a nobleman and he    is a tradesman but when we knew him first he was quite    as good as we and i believe we owe him a great deal of    money which mamma cant pay him i have heard mamma say    before she was angry with him that she would have been in    the workhouse but for them and that mr daniel thwaite    might now be very well off and not a working tailor at    all as mrs bluestone calls him if they hadnt given all    they had to help us i cannot bear after that to hear them    speak of him as they do     of course i should like to do what mamma wants but how    would you feel if you had promised somebody else i do so    wish that all this might be stopped altogether my dear    mamma will not allow me to see her and though everybody    is very kind i feel that i ought not to be here with mrs    bluestone mamma talked of going abroad somewhere i wish    she would and take me away i should see nobody then and    there would be no trouble but i suppose she hasnt got    enough money this is a very poor letter but i do not    know what else i can say     believe me to be    my dear cousin    yours affectionately     anna lovel   then came in a postscript the one thing that she had to sayi think that i ought to be allowed to see mr daniel thwaite  lord lovel after receiving this letter called in bedford square and saw mrs bluestonebut he did not show the letter his cousin was out with the girls and he did not wait to see her he merely said that he had received a letter which had not given him much comfort but i shall answer it he saidand the reader who has seen the one letter shall see also the other      browns hotel albemarle street    4th november 183     dearest anna     i have received your letter and am obliged to you for it    though there is so little in it to flatter or to satisfy    me i will begin by assuring you that as far as i am    concerned i do not wish to keep you from seeing mr    daniel thwaite i believe in my heart of hearts that if    you were now to see him often you would feel aware that    a union between you and him could not make either of you    happy you do not even say that you think it would do so     you defend him as though i had accused him i grant all    that you say in his favour i do not doubt that his father    behaved to you and to your mother with true friendship    but that will not make him fit to be the husband of anna    lovel you do not even say that you think that he would be    fit i fancy i understand it all and i love you better    for the pride with which you cling to so firm a friend     but dearest it is different when we talk of marriage i    imagine that you hardly dare now to think of becoming his    wife i doubt whether you say even to yourself that you    love him with that kind of love do not suppose me vain    enough to believe that therefore you must love me it is    not that but if you would once tell yourself that he is    unfit to be your husband then you might come to love me    and would not be the less willing to do so because all    your friends wish it it must be something to you that you    should be able to put an end to all this trouble     yours dearest anna    most affectionately     l     i called in bedford square this morning but you were not    at home   but i do dare she said to herself when she had read the letter why should i not dare and i do say to myself that i love him why should i not love him now when i was not ashamed to love him before she was being persecuted and as the step of the wayfarer brings out the sweet scent of the herb which he crushes with his heel so did persecution with her extract from her heart that strength of character which had hitherto been latent had they left her at yoxham and said never a word to her about the tailor had the rector and the two aunts showered soft courtesies on her headthey might have vanquished her but now the spirit of opposition was stronger within her than ever     chapter xxviii  lovel v murray and another   monday the 9th of november was the day set down for the trial of the case which had assumed the name of lovel versus murray and another this denomination had been adopted many months ago when it had been held to be practicable by the lovel party to prove that the lady who was now always called the countess was not entitled to bear the name of lovel but was simply josephine murray and her daughter simply anna murray had there been another wife alive when the mother was married that name and that name only could have been hers whether she had been the victim of the old earls fraudor had herself been a party to it the reader will have understood that as the case went on the opinions of those who acted for the young earl and more especially the opinion of the young earl himself had been changed prompted to do so by various motives they who had undertaken to prove that the countess was no countess had freely accorded to her her title and had themselves entertained her daughter with all due acknowledgment of rank and birth nevertheless the name of the case remained and had become common in peoples mouths the very persons who would always speak of the countess lovel spoke also very familiarly of the coming trial in lovel v murray and now the 9th of november had come round and the case of lovel v murray and another was to be tried the nature of the case was this the two ladies mother and daughter had claimed the personal property of the late lord as his widow and daughter against that claim earl lovel made his claim as heiratlaw alleging that there was no widow and no legitimate child the case had become infinitely complicated by the alleged existence of the first wifein which case she as widow would have inherited but still the case went on as lovel v murraythe lovel so named being the earl and not the alleged italian widow  such being the question presumably at issue it became the duty of the solicitorgeneral to open the pleadings in the ordinary course of proceeding it would have been his task to begin by explaining the state of the family and by assuming that he could prove the former marriage and the existence of the former wife at the time of the latter marriage his evidence would have been subject to crossexamination and then another counterstatement would have been made on behalf of the countess and her witnesses would have been brought forward when all this had been done the judge would have charged the jury and with the jury would have rested the decision this would have taken many days and all the joys and sorrows all the mingled hopes and anxieties of a long trial had been expected bets had been freely made odds being given at first on behalf of lord lovel and afterwards odds on behalf of the countess interest had been made to get places in the court and the clubs had resounded now with this fact and now with that which had just been brought home from sicily as certain then had come suddenly upon the world the tidings that there would absolutely be no trial that the great case of lovel v murray and another was to be set at rest for ever by the marriage of lovel with another and by the acceptance by lovel of murray as his motherinlaw but the quidnuncs would not accept this solution no doubt lord lovel might marry the second party in the defence and it was admitted on all hands that he probably would do sobut that would not stop the case if there were an italian widow living that widow was the heir to the property another lovel would take the place of lord loveland the cause of lovel v murray must still be continued the first marriage could not be annulled simply by the fact that it would suit the young earl that it should be annulled then while this dispute was in progress it was told at all the clubs that there was to be no marriagethat the girl had got herself engaged to a tailor and that the tailors mastery over her was so strong that she did not dare to shake him off dreadful things were told about the tailor and poor lady anna there had been a secret marriage there was going to be a childthe latter fact was known as a certain fact to a great many men at the clubsthe tailor had made everything safe in twenty different ways he was powerful over the girl equally by love by fear and by written bond the countess had repelled her daughter from her house by turning her out into the street by night and had threatened both murder and suicide half the fortune had been offered to the tailor in vain the romance of the story had increased greatly during the last few days preceding the trialbut it was admitted by all that the trial as a trial would be nothing there would probably be simply an adjournment  it would be hard to say how the story of the tailor leaked out and became at last public and notorious it had been agreed among all the lawyers that it should be kept secretbut it may perhaps have been from some one attached to them that it was first told abroad no doubt all norton and flick knew it and all goffe and goffe mr mainsail and his clerk mr hardy and his clerk serjeant bluestone and his clerk all knew it but they had all promised secrecy the clerk of the solicitorgeneral was of course beyond suspicion the two miss bluestones had known the story but they had solemnly undertaken to be silent as the grave mrs bluestone was a lady with most intimately confidential friendsbut she was sworn to secrecy it might have come from sarah the ladysmaid whom the countess had unfortunately attached to her daughter when the first gleam of prosperity had come upon them  among the last who heard the story of the tailorthe last of any who professed the slightest interest in the events of the lovel familywere the lovels of yoxham the earl had told them nothing in answer to his aunts letters and then in answer to a very urgent appeal from his uncle the young nobleman had sent only the most curt and most ambiguous replies when there was really something to tell he would tell everything but at present he could only say that he hoped that everything would be well that had been the extent of the information given by the earl to his relations and the rector had waxed wrathful nor was his wrath lessened or the sorrow of the two aunts mitigated when the truth reached them by the mouth of that very lady fitzwarren who had been made to walk out of the room afteranna murray as lady fitzwarren persisted in calling the young person after she had heard the story of the tailor she told the story at yoxham parsonage to the two aunts and brought with her a printed paragraph from a newspaper to prove the truth of it as it is necessary that we should now hurry into the court to hear what the solicitorgeneral had to say about the case we cannot stop to sympathize with the grief of the lovels at yoxham we may however pause for a moment to tell the burden of the poor rectors song for that evening i knew how it would be from the beginning i told you so i was sure of it but nobody would believe me  the court of queens bench at westminster was crowded on the 9th of november the case was to be heard before the lord chief justice and it was known that at any rate sir william patterson would have something to tell if nothing else came of it the telling of that story would be worth the hearing all the preliminaries of the trial went on as though every one believed that it was to be carried through to the bitter endas though evidence were to be adduced and rebutted and further contradicted by other evidence which would again be rebutted with that pleasing animosity between rival lawyers which is so gratifying to the outside world and apparently to themselves also the jurors were sworn ina special juryand long was the time taken and many the threats made by the chief justice before twelve gentlemen would consent to go into the box crowds were round the doors of the court of which every individual man would have paid largely for standingroom to hear the trial but when they were wanted for use men would not come forward to accept a seat with all that honour which belongs to a special juryman and yet it was supposed that at last there would be no question to submit to a jury  about noon the solicitor began his statement he was full of smiles and nods and pleasant talk gestures indicative of a man who had a piece of work before him in which he could take delight it is always satisfactory to see the assurance of a cock crowing in his own farmyard and to admire his easy familiarity with things that are awful to a stranger bird if you o reader or i were bound to stand up in that court dressed in wig and gown and to tell a story that would take six hours in the telling the one or the other of us knowing it to be his special duty so to tell it that judge and counsellors and jury should all catch clearly every point that was to be madehow ill would that story be told how would those points escape the memory of the teller and never come near the intellect of the hearers and how would the knowledge that it would be so confuse your tongue or mineand make exquisitely miserable that moment of rising before the audience but our solicitorgeneral rose to his legs a happy man with all that grace of motion that easy slowness that unassumed confidence which belongs to the ordinary doings of our familiar life surely he must have known that he looked well in his wig and gown as with low voice and bent neck with only halfsuppressed laughter he whispered into the ears of the gentleman who sat next to him some pleasant joke that had just occurred to him he could do that though the eyes of all the court were upon him so great was the man and then he began with a sweet low voice almost modest in its tones for a few moments it might have been thought that some young woman was addressing the court so gentle so dulcet were the tones  my lord it is my intention on this occasion to do that which an advocate can seldom doto make a clean breast of it to tell the court and the jury all that i know of this case all that i think of it and all that i believeand in short to state a case as much in the interest of my opponents as of my clients the story with which i must occupy the time of the court i fear for the whole remainder of the day with reference to the lovel family is replete with marvels and romance i shall tell you of great crimes and of singular virtues of sorrows that have been endured and conquered and of hopes that have been nearly realised but the noble client on whose behalf i am here called upon to address you is not in any manner the hero of this story his heroism will be shown to consist in thisunless i mar the story in telling itthat he is only anxious to establish the truth whether that truth be for him or against him we have now to deal with an ancient and noble family of which my client the present earl lovel is at this time the head and chief on the question now before us depends the possession of immense wealth should this trial be carried to its natural conclusion it will be for you to decide whether this wealth belongs to him as the heiratlaw of the late earl or whether there was left some nearer heir when that earl died whose rightful claim would bar that of my client but there is more to be tried than thisand on that more depends the right of two ladies to bear the name of lovel such right or the absence of such right would in this country of itself be sufficient to justify nay to render absolutely necessary some trial before a jury in any case of wellfounded doubt our titles of honour bear so high a value among us are so justly regarded as the outward emblem of splendour and noble conduct are recognised so universally as passports to all society that we are naturally prone to watch their assumption with a caution most exact and scrupulous when the demand for such honour is made on behalf of a man it generally includes the claim to some parliamentary privilege the right to which has to be decided not by a jury but by the body to which that privilege belongs the claim to a peerage must be tried before the house of lordsif made by a woman as by a man because the son of the heiress would be a peer of parliament in the case with which we are now concerned no such right is in question the lady who claims to be the countess lovel and her daughter who claims to be lady anna lovel make no demand which renders necessary other decision than that of a jury it is as though any female commoner in the land claimed to have been the wife of an alleged husband but not the less is the claim made to a great and a noble name and as a grave doubt has been thrown upon the justice of the demand made by these ladies it has become the duty of my client as the head of the lovels as being himself without any doubt the earl lovel of the day to investigate the claim made and to see that no false pretenders are allowed to wear the highly prized honours of his family independently of the great property which is at stake the nature of which it will be my duty to explain to you the question at issue whether the elder lady be or be not countess lovel and whether the younger lady be or be not lady anna lovel has demanded the investigation which could not adequately have been made without this judicial array i will now state frankly to you our belief that these two ladies are fully entitled to the names which they claim to bear and i will add to that statement a stronger assurance of my own personal conviction and that of my client that they themselves are fully assured of the truth and justice of their demand i think it right also to let you know that since these inquiries were first commenced since the day for this trial was fixed the younger of these ladies has been residing with the uncle of my client under the same roof with my client as an honoured and most welcome guest and there in the face of the whole country has received that appellation of nobility from all the assembled members of my clients family to dispute which i apparently now stand before you on that clients behalf the rector of yoxham who was in court shook his head vehemently when the statement was made that lady anna had been his welcome guest but nobody was then regarding the rector of yoxham and he shook his head in vain  you will at once ask why if this be so should the trial be continued as all is thus conceded you will say that these two ladies claim whom in your indictment you have misnamed murray why not in gods name give them their privileges and the wealth which should appertain to them and release them from the persecution of judicial proceedings in the first place i must answer that neither my belief nor that of my friends who are acting with me nor even that of my noble client himself is sufficient to justify us in abstaining from seeking a decision which shall be final as against further claimants if the young earl should die then would there be another earl and that other earl might also say with grounds as just as those on which we have acted that the lady whom i shall henceforward call the countess lovel is no countess we think that she isbut it will be for you to decide whether she is or is not after hearing the evidence which will no doubt be adduced of her marriageand any evidence to the contrary which other parties may bring before you we shall adduce no evidence to the contrary nor do i think it probable that we shall ask a single question to shake that with which my learned friend opposite is no doubt prepared in fact there is no reason why my learned friend and i should not sit together having our briefs and our evidence in common and then as the singular facts of this story become clear to youas i trust that i may be able to make them clearyou will learn that there are other interests at stake beyond those of my client and of the two ladies who appear here as his opponents two statements have been made tending to invalidate the rights of countess lovelboth having originated with one who appears to have been the basest and blackest human being with whose iniquities my experience as a lawyer has made me conversant i speak of the late earl it was asserted by him almost from the date of his marriage with the lady who is now his widowfalsely stated as i myself do not doubtthat when he married her he had a former wife living but it is i understand capable of absolute proof that he also stated that this former wife died soon after that second marriagewhich in such event would have been but a mock marriage were such the truthshould you come to the belief that the late earl spoke truth in so sayingthe whole property at issue would become the undisputed possession of my client the late earl died intestate the will which he did leave having been already set aside by my client as having been made when the earl was mad the real wife according to this story would be dead the second wife according to this story would be no wifeand no widow the daughter according to this story would be no daughter in the eye of the lawwould at any rate be no heiress the earl would be the undisputed heir to the personal property as he is to the real property and to the title but we disbelieve this story utterlywe intend to offer no evidence to show that the first wifefor there was such a wifewas living when the second marriage was contracted we have no such evidence and believe that none such can be found then that recreant nobleman in whose breast there was no touch of nobility in whose heart was no spark of mercy made a second statementto this effectthat his first wife had not died at all his reason for this it is hardly for us to seek he may have done so as affording a reason why he should not go through a second marriage ceremony with the lady whom he had so ill used but that he did make this statement is certainand it is also certain that he allowed an income to a certain woman as though to a wife that he allowed her to be called the countess though he was then living with another italian woman and it is also certain that this woman is still livingor at least that she was living some week or two ago we believe her to have been an elder sister of her who was the first wife and whose death occurred before the second marriage should it be proved that this living woman was the legitimate wife of the late earl not only would the right be barred of those two english ladies to whom all our sympathies are now given but no portion of the property in dispute would go either to them or to my client i am told that before his lordship the chief justice shall have left the case in your hands an application will be made to the court on behalf of that living lady i do not know how that may be but i am so informed if such application be madeif there be any attempt to prove that she should inherit as widowthen will my client again contest the case we believe that the countess lovel the english countess is the widow and that lady anna lovel is lady anna lovel and is the heiress against them we will not struggle as was our bounden duty we have sent not once only but twice and thrice to italy and to sicily in search of evidence which if true would prove that the english countess was no countess we have failed and have no evidence which we think it right to ask a jury to believe we think that a mass of falsehood has been heaped together among various persons in a remote part of a foreign country with the view of obtaining money all of which was grounded on the previous falsehoods of the late earl we will not use these falsehoods with the object of disputing a right in the justice of which we have ourselves the strongest confidence we withdraw from any such attempt  but as yet i have only given you the preliminaries of my story he had in truth told his story he had at least told all of it that it will import that the reader should hear he indeedunfortunate onewill have heard the most of that story twice or thrice before but the audience in the court of queens bench still listened with breathless attention while under this new head of his story he told every detail again with much greater length than he had done in the prelude which has been here given he stated the facts of the cumberland marriage apologizing to his learned friend the serjeant for taking as he said the very words out of his learned friends mouth he expatiated with an eloquence that was as vehement as it was touching on the demoniacal schemes of that wicked earl to whom during the whole of his fiendish life women had been a prey he repudiated with a scorn that was almost terrible in its wrath the idea that josephine murray had gone to the earls house with the name of wife knowing that she was in fact but a mistress she herself was in court thickly veiled under the care of one of the goffes having been summoned there as a necessary witness and could not control her emotion as she listened to the words of warm eulogy with which the adverse counsel told the history of her life it seemed to her then that justice was at last being done to her then the solicitorgeneral reverted again to the two italian womenthe sicilian sisters as he called themand at much length gave his reasons for discrediting the evidence which he himself had sought that he might use it with the object of establishing the claim of his client and lastly he described the nature of the possessions which had been amassed by the late earl who black with covetousness as he was with every other sin had so manipulated his property that almost the whole of it had become personal and was thus inheritable by a female heiress he knew he said that he was somewhat irregular in alluding to factsor to fiction if any one should call it fictionwhich he did not intend to prove or to attempt to prove but there was something he said beyond the common in the aspect which this case had taken something in itself so irregular that he thought he might perhaps be held to be excused in what he had done for the sake of the whole lovel family for the sake of these two most interesting ladies who have been subjected during a long period of years to most undeserved calamities we are anxious to establish the truth i have told you what we believe to be the truth and as that in no single detail militates against the case as it will be put forward by my learned friends opposite we have no evidence to offer we are content to accept the marriage of the widowed countess as a marriage in every respect legal and binding so saying the solicitorgeneral sat down  it was then past five oclock and the court as a matter of course was adjourned but it was adjourned by consent to the wednesday instead of to the following day in order that there might be due consideration given to the nature of the proceedings that must follow as the thing stood at present it seemed that there need be no further plea of lovel v murray and another it had been granted that murray was not murray but lovel yet it was thought that something further would be done  it had all been very pretty but yet there had been a feeling of disappointment throughout the audience not a word had been said as to that part of the whole case which was supposed to be the most romantic not a word had been said about the tailor     chapter xxix  daniel thwaite alone   there were two persons in the court who heard the statement of the solicitorgeneral with equal interestand perhaps with equal disapprobationwhose motives and ideas on the subject were exactly opposite these two were the rev mr lovel the uncle of the plaintiff and daniel thwaite the tailor whose whole life had been passed in furthering the cause of the defendants the parson from the moment in which he had heard that the young lady whom he had entertained in his house had engaged herself to marry the tailor had reverted to his old suspicionssuspicions which indeed he had never altogether laid aside it had been very grievous to him to prefer a doubtful lady anna to a most indubitable lady fitzwarren he liked the oldestablished thingsthings which had always been unsuspected which were not only respectable but firmrooted for twenty years he had been certain that the countess was a false countess and he too had lamented with deep inward lamentation over the loss of the wealth which ought to have gone to support the family earldom it was monstrous to him that the property of one earl lovel should not appertain to the next earl he would on the moment have had the laws with reference to the succession of personal property altered with retrospective action so that so great an iniquity should be impossible when the case against the socalled countess was as it were abandoned by the solicitorgeneral and the great interests at stake thrown up he would have put the conduct of the matter into other hands then had come upon him the bitterness of having to entertain in his own house the now almost undisputedthough by him still suspectedheiress on behalf of his nephew of a nephew who did not treat him well and now the heiress had shown what she really was by declaring her intention of marrying a tailor when that became known he did hope that the solicitorgeneral would change his purpose and fight the cause  the ladies of the family the two aunts had affected to disbelieve the paragraph which lady fitzwarren had shown them with so much triumph the rector had declared that it was just the kind of thing that he had expected aunt julia speaking freely had said that it was just the kind of thing which she knowing the girl could not believe then the rector had come up to town to hear the trial and on the day preceding it had asked his nephew as to the truth of the rumour which had reached him it is true said the young lord knitting his brow but it had better not be talked about  why not talked about all the world knows it it has been in the newspapers  any one wishing to oblige me will not mention it said the earl this was too bad it could not be possiblefor the honour of all the lovels it could not surely be possiblethat lord lovel was still seeking the hand of a young woman who had confessed that she was engaged to marry a journeyman tailor and yet to him the uncleto him who had not long since been in loco parentis to the lordthe lord would vouchsafe no further reply than that above given the rector almost made himself believe that great as might be the sorrow caused by such disruption it would become his duty to quarrel with the head of his family  he listened with most attentive ears to every word spoken by the solicitorgeneral and quarrelled with almost every word would not any one have imagined that this advocate had been paid to plead the cause not of the earl but of the countess as regarded the interests of the earl everything was surrendered appeal was made for the sympathies of all the courtand through the newspapers for the sympathies of all englandnot on behalf of the earl who was being defrauded of his rights but on behalf of the young woman who had disgraced the name which she pretended to call her ownand whose only refuge from that disgrace must be in the fact that to that name she had no righteous claim even when this apostate barrister came to a recapitulation of the property at stake and explained the cause of its being vested not in land as is now the case with the bulk of the possessions of noble lordsbut in shares and funds and ventures of commercial speculation here and there after the fashion of tradesmenhe said not a word to stir up in the minds of the jury a feeling of the injury which had been done to the present earl only that i am told that he has a wife of his own i should think that he meant to marry one of the women himself said the indignant rector in the letter which he wrote to his sister julia  and the tailor was as indignant as the rector he was summoned as a witness and was therefore bound to attendat the loss of his days work when he reached the court which he did long before the judge had taken his seat he found it to be almost impossible to effect an entrance he gave his name to some officer about the place but learned that his name was altogether unknown he showed his subpoena and was told that he must wait till he was called where must i wait asked the angry radical anywhere said the man in authority but you cant force your way in here then he remembered that no one had as yet paid so dearly for this struggle no one had suffered so much no one had been so instrumental in bringing the truth to light as he and this was the way in which he was treated had there been any justice in those concerned a seat would have been provided for him in the court even though his attendance had not been required there were hundreds there brought thither by simple curiosity to whom priority of entrance into the court had been accorded by favour because they were wealthy or because they were men of rank or because they had friends high in office all his wealth had been expended in this case it was he who had been the most constant friend of this countess but for him and his father there might probably have been no question of a trial at this day and yet he was allowed to beg for admittance and to be shoved out of court because he had no friends the court is a public court and is open to the public he said as he thrust his shoulders forward with a resolution that he would effect an entrance then he was taken in hand by two constables and pushed back through the doorwayto the great detriment of the applewoman who sat there in those days  but by pluck and resolution he succeeded in making good some inch of standing room within the court before the solicitorgeneral began his statement and he was able to hear every word that was said that statement was not more pleasing to him than to the rector of yoxham his first quarrel was with the assertion that titles of nobility are in england the outward emblem of noble conduct no words that might have been uttered could have been more directly antagonistic to his feelings and political creed it had been the accident of his life that he should have been concerned with ladies who were noble by marriage and birth and that it had become a duty to him to help to claim on their behalf empty names which were in themselves odious to him it had been the womans right to be acknowledged as the wife of the man who had disowned her and the girls right to be known as his legitimate daughter therefore had he been concerned but he had declared to himself from his first crude conception of an opinion on the subject that it would be hard to touch pitch and not be defiled the lords of whom he heard were or were believed by him to be bloated with luxury were both rich and idle were gamblers debauchers of other mens wives deniers of all rights of citizenship drones who were positively authorised to eat the honey collected by the working bees with his halfknowledge his illgotten and illdigested information with his reading which had all been on one side he had been unable as yet to catch a glimpse of the fact that from the ranks of the nobility are taken the greater proportion of the hardworking servants of the state his eyes saw merely the power the privileges the titles the ribbons and the moneyand he hated a lord when therefore the solicitorgeneral spoke of the recognised virtue of titles in england the tailor uttered words of scorn to his stranger neighbour and yet this man calls himself a liberal and voted for the reform bill he said in course he did replied the stranger that was the way of his party there isnt an honest man among them all said the tailor to himself this was at the beginning of the speech and he listened on through five long hours not losing a word of the argument not missing a single point made in favour of the countess and her daughter it became clear to him at any rate that the daughter would inherit the money when the solicitorgeneral came to speak of the nature of the evidence collected in italy daniel thwaite was unconsciously carried away into a firm conviction that all those concerned in the matter in italy were swindlers the girl was no doubt the heiress the feeling of all the court was with heras he could well perceive but in all that speech not one single word was said of the friend who had been true to the girl and to her mother through all their struggles and adversity the name of thomas thwaite was not once mentioned it might have been expedient for them to ignore him daniel the son but surely had there been any honour among them any feeling of common honesty towards folk so low in the scale of humanity as tailors some word would have been spoken to tell of the friendship of the old man who had gone to his grave almost a pauper because of his truth and constancy but nothere was not a word  and he listened with anxious ears to learn whether anything would be said as to that proposed alliancehe had always heard it called an alliance with a grim smilebetween the two noble cousins heaven and earth had been moved to promote the alliance but the solicitorgeneral said not a word on the subjectany more than he did of that other disreputable social arrangement which would have been no more than a marriage all the audience might suppose from anything that was said there that the young lady was fancy free and had never yet dreamed of a husband nevertheless there was hardly one there who had not heard something of the story of the earls suitand something also of the tailors success  when the court broke up daniel thwaite had reached standingroom which brought him near to the seat that was occupied by serjeant bluestone he lingered as long as he could and saw all the barristers concerned standing with their heads together laughing chatting and well pleased as though the day had been for them a day of pleasure i fancy the speculation is too bad for any one to take it up he heard the serjeant say among whose various gifts was not that of being able to moderate his voice i dare say not said daniel to himself as he left the court and yet we took it up when the risk was greater and when there was nothing to be gained he had as yet received no explicit answer to the note which he had written to the countess when he sent her the copy of his fathers will he had indeed received a notice from mr goffe that the matter would receive immediate attention and that the countess hoped to be able to settle the claim in a very short time but that he thought was not such a letter as should have been sent to him on an occasion so full of interest to him but they were all hard and unjust and bad the countess was bad because she was a countessthe lawyers because they were lawyersthe whole lovel family because they were lovels at this moment poor daniel thwaite was very bitter against all mankind he would he thought go at once to the western world of which he was always dreaming if he could only get that sum of £500 which was manifestly due to him  but as he wandered away after the court was up getting some wretched solitary meal at a cheap eatinghouse on his road he endeavoured to fix his thoughts on the question of the girls affection to himself taking all that had been said in that courtly lawyers speech this morning as the groundwork of his present judgment what should he judge to be her condition at the moment he had heard on all sides that it was intended that she should marry the young earl and it had been said in his hearing that such would be declared before the judge no such declaration had been made not a word had been uttered to signify that such an alliance was contemplated efforts had been made with him to induce him to withdraw his claim to the girls hand the countess had urged him and the lawyers had urged him most assuredly they would not have done sowould have in no wise troubled themselves with him at allhad they been able to prevail with lady anna and why had they not so prevailed the girl doubtless had been subjected to every temptation she was kept secure from his interference hitherto he had not even made an effort to see her since she had left the house in which he himself lived she had nothing to fear from him she had been sojourning among those lovels who would doubtless have made the way to deceit and luxury easy for her he could not doubt but that she had been solicited to enter into this alliance could he be justified in flattering himself that she had hitherto resisted temptation because in her heart of hearts she was true to her first love he was true he was conscious of his own constancy he was sure of himself that he was bound to her by his love and not by the hope of any worldly advantage and why should he think that she was weaker vainer less noble than himself had he not evidence to show him that she was strong enough to resist a temptation to which he had never been subjected he had read of women who were above the gilt and glitter of the world when he was disposed to think that she would be false no terms of reproach seemed to him too severe to heap upon her name and yet when he found that he had no ground on which to accuse her even in his own thoughts of treachery to himself he could hardly bring himself to think it possible that she should not be treacherous she had sworn to him as he had sworn to her and was he not bound to believe her oath  then he remembered what the poet had said to him the poet had advised him to desist altogether and had told him that it would certainly be best for the girl that he should do so the poet had not based his advice on the ground that the girl would prove false but that it would be good for the girl to be allowed to be falsegood for the girl that she should be encouraged to be false in order that she might become an earls wife but he thought that it would be bad for any woman to be an earls wife and so thinking how could he abandon his love in order that he might hand her over to a fashion of life which he himself despised the poet must be wrong he would cling to his love till he should know that his love was false to him should he ever learn that then his love should be troubled with him no further  but something must be done even on her behalf if she were true to him something must be done was it not pusillanimous in him to make no attempt to see his love and to tell her that he at any rate was true to her these people who were now his enemies the lawyers and the lovels with the countess at the head of them had used him like a dog had repudiated him without remorse had not a word even to say of the services which his father had rendered was he bound by honour or duty to stand on any terms with them could there be anything due to them from him did it not behove him as a man to find his way into the girls presence and to assist her with his courage he did not fear them what cause had he to fear them in all that had been between them his actions to them had been kind and good whereas they were treating him with the basest ingratitude  but how should he see lady anna as he thought of all this he wandered up from westminster where he had eaten his dinner to russell square and into keppel street hesitating whether he would at once knock at the door and ask to see lady anna lovel lady anna was still staying with mrs bluestone but daniel thwaite had not believed the countess when she told him that her daughter was not living with her he doubted however and did not knock at the door     chapter xxx  justice is to be done   it must not be thought that the countess was unmoved when she received daniel thwaites letter from keswick enclosing the copy of his fathers will she was all alone and she sat long in her solitude thinking of the friend who was gone and who had been always true to her she herself would have done for old thomas thwaite any service which a woman could render to a man so strongly did she feel all that the man had done for her as she had once said no menial office performed by her on behalf of the old tailor would have been degrading to her she had eaten his bread and she never for a moment forgot the obligation the slow tears stood in her eyes as she thought of the long long hours which she had passed in his company while almost desponding herself she had received courage from his persistency and her feeling for the son would have been the same had not the future position of her daughter and the standing of the house of lovel been at stake it was not in her nature to be ungrateful but neither was it in her nature to postpone the whole object of her existence to her gratitude even though she should appear to the world as a monster of ingratitude she must treat the surviving thwaite as her bitterest enemy as long as he maintained his pretensions to her daughters hand she could have no friendly communication with him she herself would hold no communication with him at all if she might possibly avoid it lest she should be drawn into some renewed relation of friendship with him he was her enemyher enemy in such fierce degree that she was always plotting the means of ridding herself altogether of his presence and influence to her thinking the man had turned upon her most treacherously and was using for his own purposes and his own aggrandizement that familiarity with her affairs which he had acquired by reason of his fathers generosity she believed but little in his love but whether he loved the girl or merely sought her money was all one to her her whole life had been passed in an effort to prove her daughter to be a lady of rank and she would rather sacrifice her life in the basest manner than live to see all her efforts annulled by a low marriage love indeed and romance what was the love of one individual what was the romance of a childish girl to the honour and wellbeing of an ancient and noble family it was her ambition to see her girl become the countess lovel and no feeling of gratitude should stand in her way she would rather slay that lowborn artisan with her own hand than know that he had the right to claim her as his motherinlaw nevertheless the slow tears crept down her cheeks as she thought of former days and of the little parlour behind the tailors shop at keswick in which the two children had been wont to play  but the money must be paid or at least the debt must be acknowledged as soon as she had somewhat recovered herself she opened the old desk which had for years been the receptacle of all her papers and taking out sundry scribbled documents went to work at a sum in addition it cannot be said of her that she was a good accountant but she had been so far careful as to have kept entries of all the monies she had received from thomas thwaite she had once carried in her head a correct idea of the entire sum she owed him but now she set down the items with dates and made the account fair on a sheet of note paper so much money she certainly did owe to daniel thwaite and so much she would certainly pay if ever the means of paying it should be hers then she went off with her account to mr goffe  mr goffe did not think that the matter pressed the payment of large sums which have been long due never is pressing in the eyes of lawyers men are always supposed to have a hundred pounds in their waistcoat pockets but arrangements have to be made for the settling of thousands you had better let me write him a line and tell him that it shall be looked to as soon as the question as to the property is decided said mr goffe but this did not suit the views of the countess she spoke out very openly as to all she owed to the father and as to her eternal enmity to the son it behoved her to pay the debt if only that she might be able to treat the man altogether as an enemy she had understood that even pending the trial a portion of the income would be allowed by the courts for her use and for the expenses of the trial it was assented that this money should be paid could steps be taken by which it might be settled at once mr goffe taking the memorandum said that he would see what could be done and then wrote his short note to daniel thwaite when he had computed the interest which must undoubtedly be paid on the borrowed money he found that a sum of about £9000 was due to the tailor nine thousand pounds said one mr goffe to another that will be better to him than marrying the daughter of an earl could daniel have heard the words he would have taken the lawyer by the throat and have endeavoured to teach him what love is  then the trial came on before the day fixed had come round but only just before it mr goffe showed the account to serjeant bluestone god bless my soul said the serjeant there should be some vouchers for such an amount as that mr goffe declared that there were no vouchers except for a very trifling part of it but still thought that the amount should be allowed the countess was quite willing to make oath if need be that the money had been supplied to her then the further consideration of the question was for the moment postponed and the trial came on  on the tuesday which had been left a vacant day as regarded the trial there was a meetinglike all other proceedings in this cause very irregular in its natureat the chambers of the solicitorgeneral at which serjeant bluestone attended with messrs hardy mainsail flick and goffe and at this meeting among other matters of business mention was made of the debt due by the countess to daniel thwaite of this debt the solicitorgeneral had not as yet heardthough he had heard of the devoted friendship of the old tailor that support had been afforded to some extentthat for a period the shelter of old thwaites roof had been lent to the countessthat the man had been generous and trusting he did know he had learned of course that thence had sprung that early familiarity which had enabled the younger thwaite to make his engagement with lady anna that something should be paid when the ladies came by their own he was aware but the ladies were not his clients and into the circumstances he had not inquired now he was astounded and almost scandalized by the amount of the debt  do you mean to say that he advanced £9000 in hard cash said the solicitorgeneral  that includes interest at five per cent sir william and also a small sum for bills paid by thomas thwaite on her behalf she has had in actual cash about £7000  and where has it gone  a good deal of it through my hands said mr goffe boldly during two or three years she had no income at all and during the last twenty years she has been at law for her rights he advanced all the money when that trial for bigamy took place  god bless my soul said mr serjeant bluestone  did he leave a will asked the solicitorgeneral  oh yes a will which has been proved and of which i have a copy there was nothing else to leave but this debt and that is left to the son  it should certainly be paid without delay said mr hardy mr mainsail questioned whether they could get the money mr goffe doubted whether it could be had before the whole affair was settled mr flick was sure that on due representation the amount would be advanced at once the income of the property was already accumulating in the hands of the court and there was an anxiety that all just demandsdemands which might be considered to be justly made on the family propertyshould be paid without delay i think there would hardly be a question said mr hardy  seven thousand pounds advanced by these two small tradesmen to the countess lovel said the solicitorgeneral and that done at a time when no relation of her own or of her husband would lend her a penny i wish i had known that when i went into court yesterday  it would hardly have done any good said the serjeant  it would have enabled one at any rate to give credit where credit is due and this son is the man who claims to be affianced to the lady anna  the same man sir william said mr goffe  one is almost inclined to think that he deserves her  i cant agree with you there at all said the serjeant angrily  one at any rate is not astonished that the young lady should think so continued the solicitorgeneral upon my word i dont know how we are to expect that she should throw her early lover overboard after such evidence of devotion  the marriage would be too incongruous said mr hardy  quite horrible said the serjeant  it distresses one to think of it said mr goffe  it would be much better that she should not be lady anna at all if she is to do that said mr mainsail  very much better said mr flick shaking his head and remembering that he was employed by lord lovel and not by the countessa fact of which it seemed to him that the solicitorgeneral altogether forgot the importance  gentlemen you have no romance among you said sir william have not generosity and valour always prevailed over wealth and rank with ladies in story  i do not remember any valorous tailors who have succeeded with ladies of high degree said mr hardy  did not the lady of the strachy marry the yeoman of the wardrobe asked the solicitorgeneral  i dont know that we care much about romance here said the serjeant the marriage would be so abominable that it is not to be thought of  the tailor should at any rate get his money said the solicitorgeneral and i will undertake to say that if the case be as represented by mr goffe  it certainly is said the attorney  then there will be no difficulty in raising the funds for paying it if he is not to have his wife at any rate let him have his money i think mr flick that intimation should be made to him that earl lovel will join the countess in immediate application to the court for means to settle his claim circumstanced as we are at present there can be no doubt that such application will have the desired result it should of course be intimated that serjeant bluestone and myself are both of opinion that the money should be allowed for the purpose  as the immediate result of this conversation daniel thwaite received on the following morning letters both from mr goffe and mr flick the former intimated to him that a sum of nine thousand odd pounds was held to be due to him by the countess and that immediate steps would be taken for its payment that from mr flick which was much shorter than the letter from his brother attorney merely stated that as a very large sum of money appeared to be due by the countess lovel to the estate of the late thomas thwaite for sums advanced to the countess during the last twenty years the present earl lovel had been advised to join the countess in application to the courts that the amount due might be paid out of the income of the property left by the late earl and that that application would be made immediately mr goffe in his letter went on to make certain suggestions and to give much advice as this very large debt of which no proof was extant was freely admitted by the countess and as steps were being at once taken to ensure payment of the whole sum named to daniel thwaite as his fathers heir it was hoped that daniel thwaite would at once abandon his preposterous claim to the hand of lady anna lovel then mr goffe put forward in glowing colours the iniquity of which daniel thwaite would be guilty should he continue his fruitless endeavours to postpone the reestablishment of a noble family which was thus showing its united benevolence by paying to him the money which it owed him     chapter xxxi  the verdict   on the wednesday the court reassembled in all its judicial glory there was the same crowd the same lord chief justice the same jury and the same array of friendly lawyers there had been a rumour that a third retinue of lawyers would appear on behalf of what was now generally called the italian interest and certain words which had fallen from the solicitorgeneral on monday had assured the world at large that the italian interest would be represented it was known that the italian case had been confided to a firm of enterprising solicitors named mowbray and mopus perhaps more feared than respected which was supposed to do a great amount of speculative business but no one from the house of messrs mowbray and mopus was in court on the wednesday morning and no energetic barrister was ever enriched by a fee from them on behalf of the italian widow the speculation had been found to be too deep the expenditure which would be required in advance too great and the prospect of remuneration too remote even for mowbray and mopus it appeared afterwards that application had been made by those gentlemen for an assurance that expenses incurred on behalf of the italian countess should be paid out of the estate but this had been refused no guarantee to this effect could be given at any rate till it should be seen whether the italian lady had any show of justice on her side it was now the general belief that if there was any truth at all in the italian claim it rested on the survivorship at the time of the cumberland marriage of a wife who had long since died as the proof of this would have given no penny to any one in italywould simply have shown that the earl was the heirmessrs mowbray and mopus retired and there was an end for ever and a day of the italian interest  though there was the same throng in the court as on the monday there did not seem to be the same hubbub on the opening of the days proceedings the barristers were less busy with their papers the attorneys sat quite at their ease and the chief justice with an assistant judge who was his benchfellow appeared for some minutes to be quite passive then the solicitorgeneral arose and said that with permission he would occupy the court for only a few minutes he had stated on monday his belief that an application would be made to the court on behalf of other interests than those which had been represented when the court first met it appeared that he had been wrong in that surmise of course he had no knowledge on the subject but it did not appear that any learned gentleman was prepared to address the court for any third party as he on behalf of his client had receded from the case his lordship would probably say what in his lordships opinion should now be the proceeding of the court the earl lovel abandoned his plea and perhaps the court would in those circumstances decide that its jurisdiction in the matter was over then the lord chief justice with his assistant judge retired for a while and all the assembled crowd appeared to be at liberty to discuss the matter just as everybody pleased  it was undoubtedly the opinion of the bar at large and at that moment of the world in general that the solicitorgeneral had done badly for his client the sum of money which was at stake was they said too large to be played with as the advocate of the earl sir william ought to have kept himself aloof from the countess and her daughter in lieu of regarding his client he had taken upon himself to set things right in general according to his idea of right no doubt he was a clever man and knew how to address a jury but he was always thinking of himself and bolstering up something of his own instead of thinking of his case and bolstering up his client and this conception of his character in general and of his practice in this particular became the stronger as it was gradually believed that the living italian countess was certainly an impostor there would have been little good in fighting against the english countess on her behalfbut if they could only have proved that the other italian woman who was now dead had been the real countess when the cumberland marriage was made then what a grand thing it would have been for the lovel family of those who held this opinion the rector of yoxham was the strongest and the most envenomed against the solicitorgeneral during the whole of that tuesday he went about declaring that the interests of the lovel family had been sacrificed by their own counsel and late in the afternoon he managed to get hold of mr hardy could nothing be done mr hardy was of opinion that nothing could be done now but in the course of the evening he did at the rectors instance manage to see sir william and to ask the question could nothing be done  nothing more than we propose to do  then the case is over said mr hardy i am assured that no one will stir on behalf of that italian lady  if any one did stir it would only be loss of time and money my dear hardy i understand as well as any one what people are saying and i know what must be the feeling of many of the lovels but i can only do my duty by my client to the best of my judgment in the first place you must remember that he has himself acknowledged the countess  by our advice said mr hardy  you mean by mine exactly sobut with such conviction on his own part that he positively refuses to be a party to any suit which shall be based on the assumption that she is not countess lovel let an advocate be ever so obdurate he can hardly carry on a case in opposition to his clients instructions we are acting for lord lovel and not for the lovel family and i feel assured of this that were we to attempt to set up the plea that that other woman was alive when the marriage took place in cumberland you yourself would be ashamed of the evidence which it would become your duty to endeavour to foist upon the jury we should certainly be beaten and in the ultimate settlement of the property we should have to do with enemies instead of friends the man was tried for bigamy and acquitted would any jury get over that unless you had evidence to offer to them that was plain as a pikestaff and absolutely incontrovertible  do you still think the girl will marry the earl  no i do not she seems to have a will of her own and that will is bent the other way but i do think that a settlement may be made of the property which shall be very much in the earls favour when on the following morning the solicitorgeneral made his second speech which did not occupy above a quarter of an hour it became manifest that he did not intend to alter his course of proceeding and while the judges were absent it was said by everybody in the court that the countess and lady anna had gained their suit  i consider it to be a most disgraceful course of proceeding on the part of sir william patterson said the rector to a middleaged legal functionary who was managing clerk to norton and flick  we all think sir that there was more fight in it said the legal functionary  there was plenty of fight in it i dont believe that any jury in england would willingly have taken such an amount of property from the head of the lovel family for the last twenty yearsever since i first heard of the pretended english marriageeverybody has known that she was no more a countess than i am i cant understand it upon my word i cant i have not had much to do with law but ive always been brought up to think that an english barrister would be true to his client i believe a case can be tried again if it can be shown that the lawyers have mismanaged it the unfortunate rector when he made this suggestion no doubt forgot that the client in this case was in full agreement with the wicked advocate  the judges were absent for about half an hour and on their return the chief justice declared that his learned brotherthe serjeant namelyhad better proceed with the case on behalf of his clients he went on to explain that as the right to the property in dispute and indeed the immediate possession of that property would be ruled by the decision of the jury it was imperative that they should hear what the learned counsel for the socalled countess and her daughter had to say and what evidence they had to offer as to the validity of her marriage it was not to be supposed that he intended to throw any doubt on that marriage but such would be the safer course no doubt in the ordinary course of succession a widow and a daughter would inherit and divide among them in certain fixed proportions the personal property of a deceased but intestate husband and father without the intervention of any jury to declare their rights but in this case suspicion had been thrown and adverse statements had been made and as his learned brother was as a matter of course provided with evidence to prove that which the plaintiff had come into the court with the professed intention of disproving the case had better go on then he wrapped his robes around him and threw himself back in the attitude of a listener serjeant bluestone already on his legs declared himself prepared and willing to proceed no doubt the course as now directed was the proper course to be pursued the solicitorgeneral rising gracefully and bowing to the court gave his consent with complaisant patronage your lordship no doubt is right his words were whispered and very probably not heard but the smile as coming from a solicitorgeneralfrom such a solicitorgeneral as sir william pattersonwas sufficient to put any judge at his ease  then serjeant bluestone made his statement and the case was proceeded with after the fashion of such trials it will not concern us to follow the further proceedings of the court with any close attention the solicitorgeneral went away to some other business and much of the interest seemed to drop the marriage in cumberland was proved the trial for bigamy with the acquittal of the earl was proved the two opposed statements of the earl as to the death of the first wife and afterwards as to the fact that she was living were proved serjeant bluestone and mr mainsail were very busy for two days having everything before them mr hardy on behalf of the young lord kept his seat but he said not a wordnot even asking a question of one of serjeant bluestones witnesses twice the foreman of the jury interposed expressing an opinion on behalf of himself and his brethren that the case need not be proceeded with further but the judge ruled that it was for the interest of the countesshe ceased to style her the socalled countessthat her advocates should be allowed to complete their case in the afternoon of the second day they did complete it with great triumph and a fine flourish of forensic oratory as to the cruel persecution which their client had endured the solicitorgeneral came back into court in time to hear the judges charge which was very short the jury were told that they had no alternative but to find a verdict for the defendants it was explained to them that this was a plea to show that a certain marriage which had taken place in cumberland in 181 was no real or valid marriage not only was that plea withdrawn but evidence had been adduced proving that that marriage was valid such a marriage was as a matter of course primâ facie valid let what statements might be made to the contrary by those concerned or not concerned in such case the burden of proof would rest entirely with the makers of such statement no such proof had been here attempted and the marriage must be declared a valid marriage the jury had nothing to do with the disposition of the property and it would be sufficient for them simply to find a verdict for the defendants the jury did as they were bid but going somewhat beyond this declared that they found the two defendants to be properly named the countess lovel and lady anna lovel so ended the case of lovel v murray and another  the countess who had been in the court all day was taken home to keppel street by the serjeant in a glass coach that had been hired to be in waiting for her and now lady lovel said serjeant bluestone as he took his seat opposite to her i can congratulate your ladyship on the full restitution of your rights she only shook her head the battle has been fought and won at last and i will make free to say that i have never seen more admirable persistency than you have shown since first that bad man astounded your ears by his iniquity  it has been all to no purpose she said  to no purpose lady lovel i may as well tell you now that it is expected that his majesty will send to congratulate you on the restitution of your rights  again she shook her head ah serjeant bluestonethat will be but of little service  no further objection can now be made to the surrender of the whole property there are some mining shares as to which there may be a question whether they are real or personal but they amount to but little a third of the remainder which will i imagine exceed  if it were ten times as much serjeant bluestone there would be no comfort in it if it were ten times that it would not at all help to heal my sorrow i have sometimes thought that when one is marked for trouble no ease can come  i dont think more of money than another man began the serjeant  you do not understand  nor yet of titlesthough i feel for them when they are worthily worn the highest respect as he so spoke the serjeant lifted his hat from his brow but upon my word to have won such a case as this justifies triumph  i have won nothingnothingnothing  you mean about lady anna  serjeant bluestone when first i was told that i was not that mans wife i swore to myself that i would die sooner than accept any lower name but when i found that i was a mother then i swore that i would live till my child should bear the name that of right belonged to her  she does bear it now  what name does she propose to bear i would sooner be poor in beggarystill fighting even without means to fight for an empty titlestill suffering still conscious that all around me regarded me as an impostor than conquer only to know that she for whom all this has been done has degraded her name and my own if she does this thing or if she has a mind so low a spirit so mean as to think of doing it would it not be better for all the world that she should be the bastard child of a rich mans kept mistress than the acknowledged daughter of an earl with a countess for her mother and a princely fortune to support her rank if she marries this man i shall heartily wish that lord lovel had won the case i care nothing for myself now i have lost all that the kings message will comfort me not at all if she do this thing i shall only feel the evil we have done in taking the money from the earl i would sooner see her dead at my feet than know that she was that mans wifeay though i had stabbed her with my own hand  the serjeant for the nonce could say nothing more to her she had worked herself into such a passion that she would listen to no words but her own and think of nothing but the wrong that was still being done to her he put her down at the hall door in keppel street saying as he lifted his hat again that mrs bluestone should come and call upon her     chapter xxxii  will you promise   the news of the verdict was communicated the same evening to lady annaas to whose name there could now no longer be any dispute i congratulate you lady anna said the serjeant holding her hand that everything as far as this trial is concerned has gone just as we could wish  we owe it all to you said the girl  not at all my work has been very easy in fact i have some feeling of regret that i have not been placed in a position that would enable me to earn my wages the case was too goodso that a poor aspiring lawyer has not been able to add to his reputation but as far as you are concerned my dear everything has gone as you should wish you are now a very wealthy heiress and the great duty devolves upon you of disposing of your wealth in a fitting manner lady anna understood well what was meant and was silent even when she was alone her success did not make her triumphant she could anticipate that the efforts of all her friends to make her false to her word would be redoubled unless she could see daniel thwaite it would be impossible that she should not be conquered  the serjeant told his wife the promise which he had made on her behalf and she of course undertook to go to keppel street on the following morning you had better bring her here said the serjeant mrs bluestone remarked that that might be sooner said than done shell be glad of an excuse to come answered the serjeant on such an occasion as this of course they must see each other something must be arranged about the property in a month or two when she is of age she will have the undisputed right to do what she pleases with about three hundred thousand pounds it is a most remarkable position for a young girl who has never yet had the command of a penny and who professes that she is engaged to marry a working tailor of course her mother must see her  mrs bluestone did call in keppel street and sat with the countess a long time undergoing a perfect hailstorm of passion for a long time lady lovel declared that she would never see her daughter again till the girl had given a solemn promise that she would not marry daniel thwaite love her of course i love her she is all that i have in the world but of what good is my love to me if she disgraces me she has disgraced me already when she could bring herself to tell her cousin that she was engaged to this man we were already disgraced when she once allowed the man to speak to her in that strain without withering him with her scorn she disgraced us both for what have i done it all if this is to be the end of it but at last she assented and promised that she would come noit would not be necessary to send a carriage for her the habits of her own life need not be at all altered because she was now a countess beyond dispute and also wealthy she would be content to live as she had ever lived it had gone on too long for her to desire personal comfortluxury for herself or even social rank the only pleasure that she had anticipated the only triumph that she desired was to be found in the splendour of her child she would walk to bedford square and then walk back to her lodgings in keppel street she wanted no carriage  early on the following day there was heard the knock at the door which lady anna had been taught to expect the coming visit had been discussed in all its bearings and it had been settled that mrs bluestone should be with the daughter when the mother arrived it was thought that in this way the first severity of the countess would be mitigated and that the chance of some agreement between them might be increased both the serjeant and mrs bluestone now conceived that the young lady had a stronger will of her own than might have been expected from her looks her language and her manners she had not as yet yielded an inch though she would not argue the matter at all when she was told that it was her positive duty to abandon the tailor she would sit quite silent and if silence does give consent she consented to this doctrine mrs bluestone with a diligence which was equalled only by her good humour insisted on the misery which must come upon her young friend should she quarrel with the countess and with all the lovelson the unfitness of the tailor and the impossibility that such a marriage should make a lady happyon the sacred duty which lady annas rank imposed upon her to support her order and on the general blessedness of a wellpreserved and exclusive aristocracy i dont mean to say that nobly born people are a bit better than commoners said mrs bluestone neither i nor my children have a drop of noble blood in our veins it is not that but god almighty has chosen that there should be different ranks to carry out his purposes and we have his word to tell us that we should all do our duties in that state of life to which it has pleased him to call us the excellent lady was somewhat among the clouds in her theology and apt to mingle the different sources of religious instruction from which she was wont to draw lessons for her own and her childrens guidance but she meant to say that the proper state of life for an earls daughter could not include an attachment to a tailor and lady anna took it as it was meant the nobly born young lady did not in heart deny the truth of the lessonbut she had learned another lesson and she did not know how to make the two compatible that other lesson taught her to believe that she ought to be true to her wordthat she specially ought to be true to one who had ever been specially true to her and latterly there had grown upon her a feeling less favourable to the earl than that which he had inspired when she first saw him and which he had increased when they were together at yoxham it is hard to say why the earl had ceased to charm her or by what acts or words he had lowered himself in her eyes he was as handsome as ever as much like a young apollo as gracious in his manner and as gentle in his gait and he had been constant to her perhaps it was that she had expected that one so godlike should have ceased to adore a woman who had degraded herself to the level of a tailor and that so conceiving she had begun to think that his motives might be merely human and perhaps sordid he ought to have abstained and seen her no more after she had owned her own degradation but she said nothing of all this to mrs bluestone she made no answer to the sermons preached to her she certainly said no word tending to make that lady think that the sermons had been of any avail she looks as soft as butter mrs bluestone said that morning to her husband but she is obstinate as a pig all the time  i suppose her father was the same way before her said the serjeant and god knows her mother is obstinate enough  when the countess was shown into the room lady anna was trembling with fear and emotion lady lovel during the last few weeks since her daughter had seen her had changed the nature of her dress hitherto for years past she had worn a brown stuff gown hardly ever varying even the shade of the sombre colourso that her daughter had perhaps never seen her otherwise clad no woman that ever breathed was less subject to personal vanity than had been the socalled countess who lived in the little cottage outside keswick her own dress had been as nothing to her and in the days of her close familiarity with old thomas thwaite she had rebuked her friend when he had besought her to attire herself in silk well go into keswick and get anna a new ribbon she would say and that will be grandeur enough for her and me too in this brown dress she had come up to london and so she had been clothed when her daughter last saw her but now she wore a new full black silk dress which plain as it was befitted her rank and gave an increased authority to her commanding figure lady anna trembled all the more and her heart sank still lower within her because her mother no longer wore the old brown gown when the countess entered the room she took no immediate notice of mrs bluestone but went up to her child and kissed her i am comforted anna in seeing you once again she said  dear dearest mamma  you have heard i suppose that the trial has been decided in your favour  in yours mamma  we have explained it all to her lady lovel as well as we could the serjeant yesterday evening gave us a little history of what occurred it seems to have been quite a triumph  it may become a triumph said the countessa triumph so complete and glorious that i shall desire nothing further in this world it has been my work to win the prize it is for her to wear itif she will do so  i hope you will both live to enjoy it many years said mrs bluestone you will have much to say to each other and i will leave you now we shall have lunch lady lovel at halfpast one and i hope that you will join us  then they were alone together lady anna had not moved from her chair since she had embraced her mother but the countess had stood during the whole time that mrs bluestone had been in the room when the room door was closed they both remained silent for a few moments and then the girl rushed across the room and threw herself on her knees at her mothers feet oh mamma mamma tell me that you love me oh mamma why have you not let me come to you oh mamma we never were parted before  my child never before was wilfully disobedient to me  oh mammatell me that you love me  love you yes i love you you do not doubt that anna how could it be possible that you should doubt it after twenty years of a mothers care you know i love you  i know that i love you mamma and that it kills me to be sent away from you you will take me home with you nowwill you not  home you shall make your own home and i will take you whither you will i will be a servant to minister to every whim all the world shall be a paradise to you you shall have every joy that wealth and love and sweet friends can procure for youif you will obey me in one thing lady anna still crouching upon the ground hid her face in her mothers dress but she was silent it is not much that i ask after a life spent in winning for you all that has now been won i only demand of you that you shall not disgrace yourself  oh mamma i am not disgraced  say that you will marry lord lovel and all that shall be forgotten it shall at any rate be forgiven or remembered only as the folly of a child will you say that you will become lord lovels wife  oh mamma  answer me annawill you say that you will receive lord lovel as your accepted lover get up girl and look me in the face of what use is it to grovel there while your spirit is in rebellion will you do this will you save us all from destruction misery and disgrace will you remember who you arewhat blood you have in your veinswhat name it is that you bear stand up and look me in the face if you dare  lady anna did stand up and did look her mother in the face mamma she said we should understand each other better if we were living together as we ought to do  i will never live with you till you have promised obedience will you at any rate pledge to me your word that you will never become the wife of daniel thwaite then she paused and stood looking at the girl perhaps for a minute lady anna stood before her with her eyes turned upon the ground answer me the question that i have asked you will you promise me that you will never become the wife of daniel thwaite  i have promised him that i would  what is that to me is your duty to him higher than your duty to me can you be bound by any promise to so great a crime as that would be i will ask you the question once more and i will be governed by your answer if you will promise to discard this man you shall return home with me and shall then choose everything for yourself we will go abroad and travel if you wish it and all things shall be prepared to give you pleasure you shall have at once the full enjoyment of all that has been won for you and as for your cousinyou shall not for a while be troubled even by his name it is the dear wish of my heart that you should be the wife of earl lovelbut i have one wish dearer even than thatone to which that shall be altogether postponed if you will save yourself and me and all your family from the terrible disgrace with which you have threatened usi will not again mention your cousins name to you till it shall please you to hear it anna you knelt to me just now shall i kneel to you  no mamma noi should die  then my love give me the promise that i have asked  mamma he has been so good to us  and we will be good to himgood to him in his degree of what avail to me will have been his goodness if he is to rob me of the very treasure which his goodness helped to save is he to have all because he gave some aid is he to take from me my hearts blood because he bound up my arm when it was bruised because he helped me some steps on earth is he to imprison me afterwards in hell good no he is not good in wishing so to destroy us he is bad greedy covetous selfseeking a very dog and by the living god he shall die like a dog unless you will free me from his fangs you have not answered me will you tell me that you will discard him as a suitor for your hand if you will say so he shall receive tenfold reward for hisgoodness answer me annai claim an answer from you  mamma  speak if you have anything to say and remember the commandment honour thy but she broke down when she too remembered it and bore in mind that the precept would have called upon her daughter to honour the memory of the deceased earl but if you cannot do it for love you will never do it for duty  mamma i am sure of one thing  of what are you sure  that i ought to be allowed to see him before i give him up  you shall never be allowed to see him  listen to me mamma for a moment when he asked me tolove him we were equals  i deny it you were never equals  we lived as suchexcept in this that they had money for our wants and we had none to repay them  money can have nothing to do with it  only that we took it and then he was everything to us it seemed as though it would be impossible to refuse anything that he asked it was impossible to me as to being noble i am sure that he was noble you always used to say that nobody else ever was so good as those two did you not say so mamma  if i praise my horse or my dog do i say that they are of the same nature as myself  but he is a man quite as much a man asas any man could be  you mean that you will not do as i bid you  let me see him mamma let me see him but once if i might see him perhaps i might do as you wishabout him i cannot say anything more unless i may see him  the countess still stormed and still threatened but she could not move her daughter she also found that the child had inherited particles of the nature of her parents but it was necessary that some arrangement should be made as to the future life both of lady anna and of herself she might bury herself where she would in the most desolate corner of the earth but she could not leave lady anna in bedford square in a few months lady anna might choose any residence she pleased for herself and there could be no doubt whose house she would share if she were not still kept in subjection the two parted then in deep griefthe mother almost cursing her child in her anger and lady anna overwhelmed with tears will you not kiss me mamma before you go  no i will never kiss you again till you have shown me that you are my child  but before she left the house the countess was closeted for a while with mrs bluestone and in spite of all that she had said it was agreed between them that it would be better to permit an interview between the girl and daniel thwaite let him say what he will argued mrs bluestone she will not be more headstrong than she is now you will still be able to take her away with you to some foreign country  but he will treat her as though he were her lover said the countess unable to conceal the infinite disgust with which the idea overwhelmed her  what does it matter lady lovel we have got to get a promise from her somehow since she was much with him she has seen people of another sort and she will feel the difference it may be that she wants to ask him to release her at any rate she speaks as though she might be released by what he would say to her unless she thought it might be so herself she would not make a conditional promise i would let them meet  but where  in keppel street  in my presence  no not that but you will of course be in the houseso that she cannot leave it with him let her come to you it will be an excuse for her doing so and then she can remain if she does not give the promise take her abroad and teach her to forget it by degrees so it was arranged and on that evening mrs bluestone told lady anna that she was to be allowed to meet daniel thwaite     chapter xxxiii  daniel thwaite receives his money   there was of course much commotion among all circles of society in london as soon as it was known to have been decided that the countess lovel was the countess lovel and that lady anna was the heiress of the late earl bets were paidand bets no doubt were left unpaidto a great amount men at the clubs talked more about the lovels than they had done even during the month preceding the trial the countess became on a sudden very popular exaggerated stories were told of the romance of her past lifethough it would have been well nigh impossible to exaggerate her sufferings her patience her long endurance and persistency were extolled by all the wealth that would accrue to her and to her daughter was of course doubled had anybody seen her did anybody know her even the murrays began to be proud of her and old lady jemima magtaggart who had been a murray before she married general mag as he was called went at once and called upon the countess in keppel street being the first that did so before the countess had suspected any invasion she was admittedand came away declaring that sorrow must have driven the countess mad the countess no doubt did not receive her distant relative with any gentle courtesy she had sworn to herself often that come what come might she would never cross the threshold of a murray old lord swanage who had married some very distant lovel wrote to her a letter full of very proper feeling it had been he said quite impossible for him to know the truth before the truth had come to light and therefore he made no apology for not having before this made overtures of friendship to his connection he now begged to express his great delight that she who had so well deserved success had been successful and to offer her his hand in friendship should she be inclined to accept it the countess answered him in a strain which certainly showed that she was not mad it was not her policy to quarrel with any lovel and her letter was very courteous she was greatly obliged to him for his kindness and had felt as strongly as he could do that she could have no claim on her husbands relations till she should succeed in establishing her rights she accepted his hand in the spirit in which it had been offered and hoped that his lordship might yet become a friend of her daughter for herselfshe feared that all that she had suffered had made her unfit for much social intercourse her strength she said had been sufficient to carry her thus far but was now failing her  then too there came to her that great glory of which the lawyer had given her a hint she received a letter from the private secretary of his majesty the king telling her that his majesty had heard her story with great interest and now congratulated her heartily on the reestablishment of her rank and position she wrote a very curt note begging that her thanks might be given to his majestyand then she burned the private secretarys letter no congratulations were anything to her till she should see her daughter freed from the debasement of her engagement to the tailor  speculation was rife as to the kind of life which the countess would lead that she would have wealth sufficient to blaze forth in london with all the glories of countessship there was no doubt her own share of the estate was put down as worth at least ten thousand a year for her life and this she would enjoy without deductions and with no other expenditure than that needed for herself her age was ascertained to a day and it was known that she was as yet only fortyfive was it not probable that some happy man might share her wealth with her what an excellent thing it would be for old lundythe marquis of lundywho had run through every shilling of his own property before a week was over the suggestion had been made to old lundy they say she is mad but she cant be mad enough for that said the marquis  the rector hurried home full of indignation but he had a word or two with his nephew before he started what do you mean to do now frederic asked the rector with a very grave demeanour  do i dont know that i shall do anything  you give up the girl then  my dear uncle that is a sort of question that i dont think a man ever likes to be asked  but i suppose i may ask how you intend to live  i trust uncle charles that i shall not at any rate be a burden to my relatives  oh very well very well of course i have nothing more to say i think it right all the same to express my opinion that you have been grossly misused by sir william patterson of course what i say will have no weight with you but that is my opinion  i do not agree with you uncle charles  very well i have nothing more to say it is right that i should let you know that i do not believe that this woman was ever lord lovels wife i never did believe it and i never will believe it all that about marrying the girl has been a take in from beginning to endall planned to induce you to do just what you have done no word in courtesy should ever have been spoken to either of them  i am as sure that she is the countess as i am that i am the earl  very well it costs me nothing but it costs you thirty thousand a year do you mean to come down to yoxham this winter  no  are the horses to be kept there now hitherto the rich rector had kept the poor lords hunters without charging his nephew ought for their expense he was a man so constituted that it would have been a misery to him that the head of his family should not have horses to ride but now he could not but remember all that he had done all that he was doing and the return that was made to him nevertheless he could have bit the tongue out of his mouth for asking the question as soon as the words were spoken  i will have them sold immediately said the earl they shall come up to tattersals before the week is over  i didnt mean that  i am glad that you thought of it uncle charles they shall be taken away at once  they are quite welcome to remain at yoxham  they shall be removedand sold said the earl remember me to my aunts good bye then the rector went down to yoxham an angry and a miserable man  there were very many who still agreed with the rector in thinking that the earls case had been mismanaged there was surely enough of ground for a prolonged fight to have enabled the lovel party to have driven their opponents to a compromise there was a feeling that the solicitorgeneral had been carried away by some romantic idea of abstract right and had acted in direct opposition to all the usages of forensic advocacy as established in england what was it to him whether the countess were or were not a real countess it had been his duty to get what he could for the earl his client there had been much to get and with patience no doubt something might have been got but he had gotten nothing many thought that he had altogether cut his own throat and that he would have to take the first puny judgeship vacant he is a great mana very great man indeed said the attorneygeneral in answer to some one who was abusing sir william there is not one of us can hold a candle to him but then as i have always said he ought to have been a poet  in discussing the solicitorgenerals conduct men thought more of lady anna than her mother the truth about lady anna and her engagement was generally known in a misty hazy halftruthful manner that she was engaged to marry daniel thwaite who was now becoming famous and the cause of a greatly increased business in wigmore street was certain it was certain also that the earl had desired to marry her but as to the condition in which the matter stood at present there was a very divided opinion not a few were positive that a written engagement had been given to the earl that he should have the heiress before the solicitorgeneral had made his speechbut according to these the tailors hold over the young lady was so strong that she now refused to abide by her own compact she was in the tailors hands and the tailor could do what he liked with her it was known that lady anna was in bedford square and not a few walked before the serjeants house in the hopes of seeing her the romance at any rate was not over and possibly there might even yet be a compromise if the earl could get even five thousand a year out of the property it was thought that the solicitorgeneral might hold his own and in due time become at any rate a chief baron  in the mean time daniel thwaite remained in moody silence among the workmen in wigmore street unseen of any of those who rushed there for new liveries in order that they might catch a glimpse of the successful herotill one morning about five days after the trial was over when he received a letter from messrs goffe and goffe messrs goffe and goffe had the pleasure of informing him that an accurate account of all money transactions between countess lovel and his father had been kept by the countessthat the countess on behalf of herself and lady anna lovel acknowledged a debt due to the estate of the late mr thomas thwaite amounting to £9109 3s 4d and that a cheque to that amount should be at once handed to himdaniel thwaite the sonif he would call at the chambers of messrs goffe and goffe with a certified copy of the probate of the will of thomas thwaite the father  nine thousand poundsand that to be paid to him immediatelyon that very day if he chose to call for it the copy of the probate of the will he had in his pocket at that moment but he worked out his days work without going near goffe and goffe and yet he thought much of his money and once when one of his employers spoke to him somewhat roughly he remembered that he was probably a better man than his master what should he now do with himself and his moneyhow bestow himselfhow use it so that he might be of service to the world he would go no doubt to some country in which there were no earls and no countessesbut he could go nowhere till he should know what might be his fate with the earls daughter who at present was his destiny his mind was absolutely divided in one hour he would say to himself that the poet was certainly rightand in the next he was sure that the poet must have been wrong as regarded money nine thousand pounds was as good to him as any sum that could be named he could do with that all that he required that money should do for him could he at this time have had his own way absolutely he would have left all the remainder of the wealth behind him to be shared as they pleased to share it between the earl and the countess and he would have gone at once taking with him the girl whom he loved he would have revelled in the pride of thinking that all of them should say that he had wanted and had won the girl onlyand not the wealth of the lovels that he had taken only what was his own and that his wife would be dependent on him not he on her but this was not possible it was now months since he had heard the girls voice or had received any assurance from her that she was still true to him but in lieu of this he had the assurance that she was in possession of enormous wealth and that she was the recognised cousin of lords and ladies by the dozen  when the evening came he saw one of his employers and told the man that he wished that his place might be filled why was he going did he expect to better himself when was he going was he in earnest daniel told the truth at once as far as the payment of the money was concerned he was to receive on the following day a sum of money which had been due to his father and when that should have been paid him it would not suit him to work longer for weekly wages the tailor grumbled but there was nothing else to be said thwaite might leave them tomorrow if he wished thwaite took him at his word and never returned to the shop in wigmore street after that night  on reaching his lodgings he found another letterfrom serjeant bluestone the countess had so far given way as to accede to the proposition that there should be a meeting between her daughter and the tailor and then there had arisen the question as to the manner in which this meeting should be arranged the countess would not write herself nor would she allow her daughter to do so it was desirable she thought that as few people should know of the meeting as possible and at last most unwillingly the serjeant undertook the task of arranging it he wrote therefore as follows      mr serjeant bluestone presents his compliments to mr    daniel thwaite mr thwaite has no doubt heard of the    result of the trial by which the countess lovel and her    daughter have succeeded in obtaining the recognition of    their rank it is in contemplation with the countess and    lady anna lovel to go abroad but lady anna is desirous    before she goes of seeing the son of the man who was her    mothers staunch friend during many years of suffering    lady anna will be at home at no  keppel street at    eleven oclock on monday 23rd instant if mr thwaite can    make it convenient to call then and there     bedford square    17th november 18     if mr thwaite could call on the serjeant before that    date either early in the morning at his house or on    saturday at his chambers   inner temple it    might perhaps be serviceable   the postscript had not been added without much consideration what would the tailor think of this invitation would he not be disposed to take it as encouragement in his pernicious suit would he not go to keppel street with a determination to insist upon the girls promise the serjeant had thought that it would be best to let the thing take its chance but the serjeants wife and the serjeants daughters and the countess too had all agreed that something if possible should be said to disabuse him of this idea he was to have nine thousand pounds paid to him surely that might be sufficient but if he was greedy and wanted more money more money should be given to him only he must be made to understand that the marriage was out of the question so the serjeant again gave way and proposed the interview daniel sent back his compliments to the serjeant and begged to say he would do as he was bid he would call at the serjeants chambers on the saturday and in keppel street on the following monday at the hours named  on the next morningthe first morning of his freedom from the servitude of wigmore streethe went to messrs goffe and goffe he got up late and breakfasted late in order that he might feel what it was to be an idle man i might now be as idle as the young earl he said to himself but were i to attempt it what should i do with myself how should i make the hours pass by he felt that he was lauding himself as the idea passed through his mind and struggled to quench his own pride and yet said he in his thoughts is it not fit that i should know myself to be better than he is if i have no selfconfidence how can i be bold to persevere the man that works is to him that is idle as light is to darkness  he was admitted at once to mr goffes private room and was received with a smiling welcome and an outstretched hand i am delighted mr thwaite to be able to settle your claim on lady lovel with so little delay i hope you are satisfied with her ladyships statement of the account  much more than satisfied with the amount it appeared to me that i had no legal claim for more than a few hundred pounds  we knew better than that mr thwaite we should have seen that no great injury was done but luckily the countess has been careful and has put down each sum advanced item by item full interest has been allowed at five per cent as is quite proper the countess is an excellent woman of business  no doubt mr goffe i could have wished that she would have condescended to honour me with a linebut that is a matter of feeling  oh mr thwaite there are reasonsyou must know that there are reasons  there may be good reasons or bad reasons  and there may be good judgment in such matters and bad judgment but however you will like to have this money by a cheque no doubt there it is £9109 3s 4d it is not often that we write one cheque for a bigger sum than that mr thwaite shall i cross it on your bankers no bankers with such a sum as that let me recommend you to open an account at once and mr goffe absolutely walked down to fleet street with daniel thwaite the tailor and introduced him at his own bank the business was soon transacted and daniel thwaite went away westward a capitalist with a cheque book in his pocket what was he to do with himself he walked east again before the day was over and made inquiries at various offices as to vessels sailing for boston new york baltimore and quebec or how would it be with him if he should be minded to go east instead of west so he supplied himself also with information as to vessels for sydney and what should he do when he got to the new country he did not mean to be a tailor he was astonished to find how little he had as yet realised in his mind the details of the exodus which he had proposed to himself     chapter xxxiv  i will take your word for nothing   on the saturday daniel was at the serjeants chambers early in the morninglong before the hour at which the serjeant himself was wont to attend no time had in fact been named and the tailor had chosen to suppose that as he had been desired to be early in bedford square so had it also been intended that he should be early in the temple for two hours he walked about the passages and the courts thinking ill of the lawyer for being so late at his business and endeavouring to determine what he would do with himself he had not a friend in the world unless lady anna were a friendhardly an acquaintance and yet remembering what his father had done what he himself had helped to do he thought that he ought to have had many friends those very persons who were now his bitterest enemies the countess and all they who had supported her should have been bound to him by close ties yet he knew that it was impossible that they should not hate him he could understand their feelings with reference to their own rank though to him that rank was contemptible of course he was alone of course he would fail he was almost prepared to acknowledge as much to the serjeant he had heard of a certain vessel that would start in three days for the rising colony called new south wales and he almost wished that he had taken his passage in her  at ten oclock he had been desired to call at eleven and as the clock struck eleven he knocked at the serjeants door serjeant bluestone is not here yet said the clerk who was disposed to be annoyed by the mans pertinacity  he told me to come early in the morning and this is not early  he is not here yet sir  you told me to come at eleven and it is past eleven  it is one minute past and you can sit down and wait for him if you please daniel refused to wait and was again about to depart in his wrath when the serjeant appeared upon the stairs he introduced himself and expressed regret that he should have found his visitor there before him daniel muttering something followed the lawyer into his room and then the door was closed he stood till he was invited to sit and was determined to make himself disagreeable this man was one of his enemieswas one who no doubt thought little of him because he was a tailor who suspected his motives and was anxious to rob him of his bride the serjeant retired for a moment to an inner room while the tailor girded up his loins and prepared himself for battle  mr thwaite said the serjeant as he reentered the room you probably know that i have been counsel for lady lovel and her daughter in the late trial daniel assented by a nod of his head my connection with the countess would naturally have been then closed we have gained our cause and there would be an end of it but as things have turned out it has been otherwise lady anna lovel has been staying with mrs bluestone  in bedford square  yes at my house  i did not know the countess told me she was not in keppel street but refused to inform me where she was staying i should not have interfered with her ladyships plans had she been less secret with me  surely it was unnecessary that she should tell you  quite unnecessarybut hardly unnatural after all that has occurred as the countess is with you only a friend of late date you are probably unaware of the former friendship which existed between us there was a time in which i certainly did not think that lady lovel would ever decline to speak to me about her daughter but all this is nothing to you serjeant bluestone  it is something to me mr thwaite as her friend is there no reason why she should have treated you thus ask your own conscience  my conscience is clear in the matter  i have sent for you here mr thwaite to ask you whether you cannot yourself understand that this which you have proposed to do must make you an enemy to the countess and annul and set aside all that kindness which you have shown her i put it to your own reason do you think it possible that the countess should be otherwise than outraged at the proposition you have made to her  i have made no proposition to her ladyship  have you made none to her daughter  certainly i have i have asked her to be my wife  come mr thwaite do not palter with me  palter with you who dares to say that i palter i have never paltered paltering islying as i take it let the countess be my enemy i have not said that she should not be so she might have answered my letter i think when the old man died in our rank of life we should have done so it may be different with lords and titled ladies let it pass however i did not mean to make any complaint i came here because you sent for me  yesi did send for you said the serjeant wishing with all his heart that he had never been persuaded to take a step which imposed upon him so great a difficulty i did send for you lady anna lovel has expressed a wish to see you before she leaves london  i will wait upon lady anna lovel  i need hardly tell you that her wish has been opposed by her friends  no doubt it was  but she has said with so much earnestness that she cannot consider herself to be absolved from the promise which she made to you when she was a child  she was no child when she made it  it does not signify she cannot be absolved from the promise which i suppose she did make  she certainly made it serjeant bluestone  will you allow me to continue my statement it will not occupy you long she assures her mother that she cannot consider herself to be absolved from that promise without your sanction she has been living in my house for some weeks and i do not myself doubt in the least that were she thus freed an alliance would soon be arranged between her and her cousin  i have heard of thatalliance  it would be in every respect a most satisfactory and happy marriage the young earl has behaved with great consideration and forbearance in abstaining from pushing his claims  in abstaining from asking for that which he did not believe to be his own  you had better hear me to the end mr thwaite all the friends of the two young people desire it the earl himself is warmly attached to his cousin  so am iand have been for many years  we all believe that she loves him  let her say so to me serjeant bluestone and there shall be an end of it all it seems to me that lord lovel and i have different ideas about a woman i would not take the hand of a girl who told me that she loved another man even though she was as dear to me asas lady anna is dear to me now and as for what she might have in her hand it would go for naught with me though i might have to face beggary without her it seems to me that lord lovel is less particular in this matter  i do not see that you and i have anything to do with that replied the serjeant hardly knowing what to say  i have nothing to do with lord lovel certainlynor has he with me as to his cousinit is for her to choose  we thinki am only telling you what we thinkbut we think mr thwaite that the young ladys affections are fixed on her cousin it is natural that they should be so and watching her as closely as we can we believe such to be the case i will be quite on the square with you mr thwaite  with me and with everybody else i hope serjeant bluestone  i hope so said the serjeant laughing but at any rate i will be so with you now we have been unable to get from lady anna any certain replyany assurance of her own wishes she has told her mother that she cannot accept lord lovels addresses till she has seen you the serjeant in this was not quite on the square as lady anna had never said so we believe that she considers it necessary to her conscience to be made free by your permission before she can follow her own inclinations and accede to those of all her friends  she shall have my permission in a momentif she will ask for it  could you not be more generous even than that  how more generous serjeant bluestone  offer it to her unasked you have already said that you would not accept her hand if you did not believe that you had her heart alsoand the sentiment did you honour think of her condition and be generous to her  generous to her you mean generous to lady lovelgenerous to lord lovelgenerous to all the lovels except her it seems to me that all the generosity is to be on one side  by no means we can be generous too  if that be generosity i will be generous i will offer her that permission i will not wait till she asks for it i will beg her to tell me if it be true that she loves this cousin and if she can say that it is true she shall want no permission from me to be free she shall be free  it is not a question you see between yourself and lord lovel it is quite out of the question that she should in any event become your wife even had she power to do it  she has the power  practically she has no such power mr thwaite a young person such as lady anna lovel is and must be under the control of her natural guardian she is so altogether her mother could notand would notconstrain her to any marriage but has quite sufficient power over her to prevent any marriage lady anna has never for a moment supposed that she could become your wife since she learned what were the feelings of her mother and her family the serjeant certainly did not keep his promise of being on the square but your generosity is necessary to enable lady lovel to bring to a happy termination all those sufferings with which her life has been afflicted  i do not owe much to the countess but if it be generous to do as i have said i would doi will be generous i will tell her daughter without any question asked from her that she is free to marry her cousin if she wishes  so far the serjeant though he had not been altogether as truthful as he had promised had been discreet he had said nothing to set the tailor vehemently against the lovel interest and had succeeded in obtaining a useful pledge but in his next attempt he was less wise i think you know mr thwaite that the countess also has been generous  as how  you have received £9000 already i believe  i have received what i presume to be my own if i have had more it shall be refunded  nono by no means taking a liberal view of the matter as the countess was bound to do in honour she was i think right in paying you what she has paid  i want nothing from her in what you call honour i want nothing liberal if the money be not mine in common honesty she shall have it back again i want nothing but my own  i think you are a little high flown mr thwaite  i dare say i may beto the thinking of a lawyer  the countess who is in truth your friendand will always be your friend if you will only be amenable to reasonhas been delighted to think that you are now in possession of a sum of money which will place you above want  the countess is very kind  and i can say more than that she and all her friends are aware how much is due to your fathers son if you will only aid us in our present project if you will enable lady anna to become the wife of her cousin the earl much more shall be done than the mere payment of the debt which was due to you it has been proposed to settle on you for life an annuity of four hundred pounds a year to this the countess earl lovel and lady anna will all agree  has the consent of lady anna been asked demanded the tailor in a voice which was low but which the serjeant felt at the moment to be dangerous  you may take my word that it shall be forthcoming said the serjeant  i will take your word for nothing serjeant bluestone i do not think that among you all you would dare to make such a proposition to lady anna lovel and i wonder that you should dare to make it to me what have you seen in me to lead you to suppose that i would sell myself for a bribe and how can you have been so unwise as to offer it after i have told you that she shall be freeif she chooses to be free but it is all one you deal in subterfuges till you think it impossible that a man should be honest you mine underground till your eyes see nothing in the open daylight you walk crookedly till a straight path is an abomination to you four hundred a year is nothing to me for such a purpose as thiswould have been nothing to me even though no penny had been paid to me of the money which is my own i can easily understand what it is that makes the earl so devoted a lover his devotion began when he had been told that the money was hers and not hisand that in no other way could he get it mine began when no one believed that she would ever have a shilling for her fortunewhen all who bore her name and her mothers ridiculed their claim mine was growing when my father first asked me whether i grudged that he should spend all that he had in their behalf mine came from giving his springs from the desire to get make the four hundred four thousandmake it eight thousand serjeant bluestone and offer it to him i also will agree with him you may succeed good morning serjeant bluestone on monday next i will not be worse than my wordeven though you have offered me a bribe  the serjeant let the tailor go without a word furthernot indeed having a word to say he had been insulted in his own chamberstold that his word was worthless and his honesty questionable but he had been so told that at the moment he had been unable to stop the speaker he had sat and smiled and stroked his chin and looked at the tailor as though he had been endeavouring to comfort himself with the idea that the man addressing him was merely an ignorant halfmad enthusiastic tailor from whom decent conduct could not be expected he was still smiling when daniel thwaite closed the door and he almost laughed as he asked his clerk whether that energetic gentleman had taken himself downstairs oh yes sir he glared at me when i opened the door and rushed down four steps at a time but on the whole the serjeant was contented with the interview it would no doubt have been better had he said nothing of the four hundred a year but in the offering of bribes there is always that danger one can never be sure who will swallow his douceur at an easy gulp so as hardly to betray an effort and who will refuse even to open his lips and then the latter man has the briber so much at advantage when the luscious morsel has been refused it is so easy to be indignant so pleasant to be enthusiastically virtuous the bribe had been refused and so far the serjeant had failedbut the desired promise had been made and the serjeant felt certain that it would be kept he did not doubt but that daniel thwaite would himself offer the girl her freedom but there was something in the man though he was a tailor he had an eye and a voice and it might be that freedom offered as he could offer it would not be accepted  daniel as he went out into the court from the lawyers presence was less satisfied than the lawyer he had told the lawyer that his word was worth nothing and yet he had believed much that the lawyer had said to him the lawyer had told him that the girl loved her cousin and only wanted his permission to be free that she might give her hand and her heart together to the young lord was it not natural that she should wish to do so within each hour almost within each minute he regarded the matter in lights that were perfectly antagonistic to each other it was natural that she should wish to be a countess and that she should love a young lord who was gentle and beautifuland she should have his permission accorded freely but then again it was most unnatural bestial and almost monstrous that a girl should change her love for a man going from one man to another simply because the latter man was gilt with gold and decked with jewels and sweet with perfume from a hairdressers the poet must have been wrong there if love be anything but a dream surely it must adhere to the person and not be liable to change at every offered vantage of name or birth of rank or wealth  but she should have the offer she should certainly have the offer     chapter xxxv  the serjeant and mrs bluestone at home   lady anna was not told till the saturday that she was to meet her lover the tailor on the following monday she was living at this time as it were in chains though the chains were gilded it was possible that she might be off at any moment with daniel thwaiteand now the more possible because he had money at his command if this should occur then would the game which the countess and her friends were playing be altogether lost then would the checkmate have been absolute the reader will have known that such a step had never been contemplated by the man and will also have perceived that it would have been altogether opposed to the girls character but it is hoped that the reader has looked more closely into the mans motives and the girls character than even her mother was able to do the countess had thought that she had known her daughter she had been mistaken and now there was hardly anything of which she could not suspect her girl to be capable lady anna was watched therefore during every minute of the four and twenty hours a policeman was told off to protect the house at night from rope ladders or any other less cumbrous ingenuity the servants were set on guard sarah the ladysmaid followed her mistress almost like a ghost when the poor young lady went to her bedroom mrs bluestone or one of the girls was always with her either indoors or out of doors out of doors indeed she never went without more guards than one a carriage had been hireda luxury with which mrs bluestone had hitherto dispensedand the carriage was always there when lady anna suggested that she should like to leave the house she was warmly invited to go shopping and made to understand that in the way of ordinary shopping she could buy what she pleased but her life was inexpressibly miserable what does mamma mean to do she said to mrs bluestone on the saturday morning  in what way my dear  where does she mean to go she wont live always in keppel street  noi do not think that she will live always in keppel street it depends a good deal upon you i think  i will go wherever she pleases to take me the lawsuit is over now and i dont know why we should stay here i am sure you cant like it  to tell the truth mrs bluestone did not like it at all circumstances had made her a gaoler but by nature she was very ill constituted for that office the harshness of it was detestable to her and then there was no reason whatever why she should sacrifice her domestic comfort for the lovels the thing had grown upon them till the lovels had become an incubus to her personally she liked lady anna but she was unable to treat lady anna as she would treat any other girl that she liked she had told the serjeant more than once that she could not endure it much longer and the serjeant did not like it better than did his wife it was all a labour of love and a most unpleasant labour the countess must take her away the serjeant had said and now the serjeant had been told by the tailor in his own chambers that his word was worth nothing  to tell you the truth lady anna we none of us like itnot because we do not like you but because the whole thing is disagreeable you are creating very great misery my dear because you are obstinate  because i wont marry my cousin  no my dear not because you wont marry your cousin i have never advised you to marry your cousin unless you could love him i dont think girls should ever be told to marry this man or that but it is very proper that they should be told not to marry this man or that you are making everybody about you miserable because you will not give up a most improper engagement made with a man who is in every respect beneath you  i wish i were dead said lady anna  it is very easy to say that my dear but what you ought to wish is to do your duty  i do wish to do my duty mrs bluestone  it cant be dutiful to stand out against your mother in this way you are breaking your mothers heart and if you were to do this thing you would soon find that you had broken your own it is downright obstinacy i dont like to be harsh but as you are here in my charge i am bound to tell you the truth  i wish mamma would let me go away said lady anna bursting into tears  she will let you go at once if you will only make the promise that she asks of you in saying this mrs bluestone was hardly more upon the square than her husband had been for she knew very well at that moment that lady anna was to go to keppel street early on the monday morning and she had quite made up her mind that her guest should not come back to bedford square she had now been moved to the special severity which she had shown by certain annoyances of her own to which she had been subjected by the presence of lady anna in her house she could neither entertain her friends nor go out to be entertained by them and had told the serjeant more than once that a great mistake had been made in having the girl there at all but judgment had operated with her as well as feeling it was necessary that lady anna should be made to understand before she saw the tailor that she could not be happy could not be comfortable could not be other than very wretchedtill she had altogether dismissed her lowborn lover  i did not think you would be so unkind to me sobbed lady anna through her tears  i do not mean to be unkind but you must be told the truth every minute that you spend in thinking of that man is a disgrace to you  then i shall be disgraced all my life said lady anna bursting out of the room  on that day the serjeant dined at his club but came home about nine oclock it had all been planned so that the information might be given in the most solemn manner possible the two girls were sitting up in the drawingroom with the guest who since the conversation in the morning had only seen mrs bluestone during dinner first there was the knock at the door and then after a quarter of an hour which was spent upstairs in perfect silence there came a message would lady anna have the kindness to go to the serjeant in the diningroom in silence she left the room and in silence descended the broad staircase the serjeant and mrs bluestone were sitting on one side of the fireplace the serjeant in his own peculiar armchair and the lady close to the fender while a seat opposite to them had been placed for lady anna the room was gloomy with dark red curtains and dark flock paper on the table there burned two candles and no more the serjeant got up and motioned lady anna to a chair as soon as she had seated herself he began his speech my dear young lady you must be no doubt aware that you are at present causing a great deal of trouble to your best friends  i dont want to cause anybody trouble said lady anna thinking that the serjeant in speaking of her best friends alluded to himself and his wife i only want to go away  i am coming to that directly my dear i cannot suppose that you do not understand the extent of the sorrow that you have inflicted on your parent byby the declaration which you made to lord lovel in regard to mr daniel thwaite there is nothing perhaps in the way of exhortation and scolding which the ordinary daughteror sondislikes so much as to be told of her or his parent my dear fellow your father will be annoyed is taken in good part what will mamma say is seldom received amiss but when young people have their parents thrown at them they feel themselves to be aggrieved and become at once antagonistic lady anna became strongly antagonistic if her mother who had always been to her her own own mamma was going to be her parent there must be an end of all hope of happiness she said nothing but compressed her lips together she would not allow herself to be led an inch any way by a man who talked to her of her parent the very idea of such a marriage as this man had suggested to you under the guise of friendship was dreadful to her it could be no more than an ideabut that you should have entertained it was dreadful she has since asked you again and again to repudiate the idea and hitherto you have refused to obey  i can never know what mamma really wants till i go and live with her again  i am coming to that lady anna the countess has informed mrs bluestone that you had refused to give the desired promise unless you should be allowed to see mr daniel thwaite intimating i presume that his permission would be necessary to free you from your imaginary bond to him  it would be necessary  very well the countess naturally felt an abhorrence at allowing you again to be in the presence of one so much beneath youwho had ventured to address you as he has done it was a most natural feeling but it has occurred to mrs bluestone and myself that as you entertain this idea of an obligation you should be allowed to extricate yourself from it after your own fashion you are to meet mr thwaiteon mondayat eleven oclockin keppel street  and i am not to come back again  when one executes the office of gaoler without fee or reward giving up to ones prisoner ones best bedroom and having a company dinner more or less cooked for ones prisoner every day one does not like to be told too plainly of the anticipated joys of enfranchisement mrs bluestone who had done her best both for the mother and the girl and had done it all from pure motherly sympathy was a little hurt i am sure lady anna we shall not wish you to return she said  oh mrs bluestone you dont understand me i dont think you know how unhappy i am because of mamma  mrs bluestone relented at once if you will only do as your mamma wishes everything will be made happy for you  mr thwaite will be in keppel street at eleven oclock on monday continued the serjeant and an opportunity will then be given you of obtaining from him a release from that unfortunate promise which i believe you once made him i may tell you that he has expressed himself willing to give you that release the debt due to him or rather to his late father has now been paid by the estate and i think you will find that he will make no difficulty after that anything that he may require shall be done to forward his views  am i to take my things she asked  sarah shall pack them up and they shall be sent after you if it be decided that you are to stay with lady lovel they then went to bed  in all this neither the serjeant nor his wife had been on the square neither of them had spoken truly to the girl mrs bluestone had let the countess know that with all her desire to assist her ladyship and her ladyships daughter she could not receive lady anna back in bedford square as for that sending of her things upon certain conditionsit was a simple falsehood the things would certainly be sent and the serjeant without uttering an actual lie had endeavoured to make the girl think that the tailor was in pursuit of moneyand of money only though he must have known that it was not so the serjeant no doubt hated a lieas most of us do hate lies and had a strong conviction that the devil is the father of them but then the lies which he hated and as to the parentage of which he was quite certain were lies told to him who yet ever met a man who did not in his heart of hearts despise an attempt made by others to deceivehimself they whom we have found to be gentler in their judgment towards attempts made in another direction have been more than one or two the object which the serjeant had in view was so good that it seemed to him to warrant some slight deviation from parallelogrammatic squarenessthough he held it as one of his first rules of life that the end cannot justify the means     chapter xxxvi  it is still true   on sunday they all went to church and not a word was said about the tailor alice bluestone was tender and valedictory mrs bluestone was courteous and careful the serjeant was solemn and civil before the day was over lady anna was quite sure that it was not intended that she should come back to bedford square words were said by the two girls and by sarah the waitingmaid which made it certain that the packing up was to be a real packing up no hindrance was offered to her when she busied herself about her own dresses and folded up her stock of gloves and ribbons on monday morning after breakfast mrs bluestone nearly broke down i am sure my dear she said we have liked you very much and if there has been anything uncomfortable it has been from unfortunate circumstances the serjeant bade god bless her when he walked off half an hour before the carriage came to take her and she knew that she was to sit no longer as a guest at the serjeants table she kissed the girls was kissed by mrs bluestone got into the carriage with the maid and in her heart said goodbye to bedford square for ever  it was but three minutes drive from the serjeants house to that in which her mother lived and in that moment of time she was hardly able to realise the fact that within half an hour she would be once more in the presence of daniel thwaite she did not at present at all understand why this thing was to be done when last she had seen her mother the countess had solemnly declared had almost sworn that they two should never see each other again and now the meeting was so close at hand that the man must already be near her she put up her face to the carriage window as though she almost expected to see him on the pavement and how would the meeting be arranged would her mother be present she took it for granted that her mother would be present she certainly anticipated no pleasure from the meetingthough she would be glad very glad to see daniel thwaite once again before she had time to answer herself a question the carriage had stopped and she could see her mother at the drawingroom window she trembled as she went upstairs and hardly could speak when she found herself in her mothers presence if her mother had worn the old brown gown it would have been better but there she was arrayed in black silkin silk that was new and stiff and broad and solemna parent rather than a mother and every inch a countess i am so glad to be with you again mamma  i shall not be less glad to have you with me annaif you will behave yourself with propriety  give me a kiss mamma then the countess bent her head and allowed her daughters lips to touch her cheeks in old daysdays that were not so very oldshe would kiss her child as though such embraces were the only food that nourished her  come upstairs and i will show you your room then the daughter followed the mother in solemn silence you have heard that mr daniel thwaite is coming here to see you at your own request it will not be many minutes before he is here take off your bonnet again lady anna silently did as she was bid it would have been bettervery much betterthat you should have done as you were desired without subjecting me to this indignity but as you have taken into your head an idea that you cannot be absolved from an impossible engagement without his permission i have submitted do not let it be long and let me hear then that all this nonsense is over he has got what he desires as a very large sum of money has been paid to him then there came a knock at the door from sarah who just showed her face to say that mr thwaite was in the room below now go down in ten minutes i shall expect to see you here againor after that i shall come down to you lady anna took her mother by the hand looking up with beseeching eyes into her mothers face go my dear and let this be done as quickly as possible i believe that you have too great a sense of propriety to let him do more than speak to you rememberyou are the daughter of an earl and remember also all that i have done to establish your right for you  mamma i do not know what to do i am afraid  shall i go with you anna  no mammait will be better without you you do not know how good he is  if he will abandon this madness he shall be my friend of friends  oh mamma i am afraid but i had better go then trembling she left the room and slowly descended the stairs she had certainly spoken the truth in saying that she was afraid up to this moment she had not positively made up her mind whether she would or would not yield to the entreaties of her friends she had decided upon nothingleaving in fact the arbitrament of her faith in the hands of the man who had now come to see her throughout all that had been said and done her sympathies had been with him and had become the stronger the more her friends had reviled him she knew that they had spoken evil of him not because he was evilbut with the unholy view of making her believe what was false she had seen through all this and had been aroused by it to a degree of firmness of which her mother had not imagined her to be capable had they confined themselves to the argument of present fitness admitting the truth and honesty of the manand admitting also that his love for her and hers for him had been the natural growth of the familiar friendship of their childhood and youth their chance of moulding her to their purposes would have been better as it was they had never argued with her on the subject without putting forward some statement which she found herself bound to combat she was told continually that she had degraded herself and she could understand that another lady anna might degrade herself most thoroughly by listening to the suit of a tailor but she had not disgraced herself of that she was sure though she could not well explain to them her reasons when they accused her circumstances and her mothers mode of living had thrown her into intimacy with this man for all practical purposes of life he had been her equaland being so had become her dearest friend to take his hand to lean on his arm to ask his assistance to go to him in her troubles to listen to his words and to believe them to think of him as one who might always be trusted had become a second nature to her of course she loved him and now the martyrdom through which she had passed in bedford square had changedunconsciously as regarded her own thoughtsbut still had changed her feelings in regard to her cousin he was not to her now the bright and shining thing the godlike phoebus which he had been in wyndham street and at yoxham in all their lectures to her about her title and grandeur they had succeeded in inculcating an idea of the solemnity of rank but had robbed it in her eyes of all its grace she had only been the more tormented because the fact of her being lady anna lovel had been fully established the feeling in her bosom which was most hostile to the tailors claim upon her was her pity for her mother  she entered the room very gently and found him standing by the table with his hands clasped together sweetheart he said as soon as he saw her calling her by a name which he used to use when they were out in the fields together in cumberland  daniel then he came to her and took her hand if you have anything to say daniel you must be very quick because mamma will come in ten minutes  have you anything to say sweetheart she had much to say if she only knew how to say it but she was silent do you love me anna still she was silent if you have ceased to love me pray tell me soin all honesty but yet she was silent if you are true to meas i am to you with all my heartwill you not tell me so  yes she murmured  he heard her though no other could have done so      a lovers ears will hear the lowest sound     when the suspicious head of theft is stopped   if so said he again taking her hand this story they have told me is untrue  what story daniel but she withdrew her hand quickly as she asked him  nayit is mine it shall be mine if you love me dear i will tell you what story they have said that you love your cousin earl lovel  no said she scornfully i have never said so it is not true  you cannot love us both his eye was fixed upon hers that eye to which in past years she had been accustomed to look for guidance sometimes in joy and sometimes in fear and which she had always obeyed is not that true  oh yesthat is true of course  you have never told him that you loved him  oh never  but you have told me somore than once eh sweetheart  yes  and it was true  she paused a moment and then gave him the same answer yes  and it is still true  she repeated the word a third time yes but she again so spoke that none but a lovers ear could have heard it  if it be so nothing but the hand of god shall separate us you know that they sent for me to come here she nodded her head do you know why in order that i might abandon my claim to your hand i will never give it up but i made them a promise and i will keep it i told them that if you preferred lord lovel to me i would at once make you free of your promisethat i would offer to you such freedom if it would be freedom i do offer it to youor rather anna i would have offered it had you not already answered the question how can i offer it now then he paused and stood regarding her with fixed eyes but therethere take back your word if you will if you think that it is better to be the wife of a lord because he is a lord though you do not love him than to lie upon the breast of the man you do loveyou are free from me now was the moment in which she must obey her mother and satisfy her friends and support her rank and decide that she would be one of the noble ladies of england if such decision were to be made at all she looked up into his face and thought that after all it was handsomer than that of the young earl he stood thus with dilated nostrils and fire in his eyes and his lips just parted and his head erecta very man had she been so minded she would not have dared to take his offer they surely had not known the man when they allowed him to have this interview he repeated his words you are free if you will say sobut you must answer me  i did answer you daniel  my noble girl and now my hearts only treasure i may speak out and tell you what i think it cannot be good that a woman should purchase rank and wealth by giving herself to a man she does not love it must be badmonstrously bad i never believed it when they told it me of you and yet when i did not hear of you or see you for months  it was not my fault  no sweetheartand i tried to find comfort by so saying to myself if she really loves me she will be true i said and yet who was i that i should think that you would suffer so much for me but i will repay youif the truth and service of a life may repay such a debt as that at any rate hear this from mei will never doubt again and as he spoke he was moving towards her thinking to take her in his arms when the door was opened and countess lovel was within the room the tailor was the first to speak lady lovel i have asked your daughter and i find that it is her wish to adhere to the engagement which she made with me in cumberland i need hardly say that it is my wish also  anna is this true  mamma mamma oh mamma  if it be so i will never speak word to you more  you will you will do not look at me like that you will speak to me  you shall never again be child of mine but in saying this she had forgotten herself and now she remembered her proper cue i do not believe a word of it the man has come here and has insulted and frightened you he knowshe must knowthat such a marriage is impossible it can never take place it shall never take place mr thwaite as you are a living man you shall never live to marry my daughter  my lady in this matter of marriage your daughter must no doubt decide for herself even now by all the laws of godand i believe of man tooshe is beyond your control either to give her in marriage or to withhold her in a few months she will be as much her own mistress as you now are yours  sir i am not asking you about my child you are insolent  i came here lady lovel because i was sent for  and now you had better leave us you made a promise which you have broken  by heavens no i made a promise and i have kept it i said that i would offer her freedom and i have done so i told her and i tell her again now that if she will say that she prefers her cousin to me i will retire the countess looked at him and also recognised the strength of his face almost feeling that the man had grown in personal dignity since he had received the money that was due to him she does not prefer the earl she has given her heart to me and i hold itand will hold it look up dear and tell your mother whether what i say be true  it is true said lady anna  then may the blight of hell rest upon you both said the countess rushing to the door but she returned mr thwaite she said i will trouble you at once to leave the house and never more to return to it  i will leave it certainly good bye my own love he attempted again to take the girl by the hand but the countess with violence rushed at them and separated them if you but touch him i will strike you she said to her daughter as for you it is her money that you want if it be necessary you shall have not hers but mine now go  that is a slander lady lovel i want no ones money i want the girl i lovewhose heart i have won and i will have her good morning lady lovel dear dear anna for this time good bye do not let any one make you think that i can ever be untrue to you the girl only looked at him then he left the room and the mother and the daughter were alone together the countess stood erect looking at her child while lady anna standing also kept her eyes fixed upon the ground am i to believe it allas that man says asked the countess  yes mamma  do you mean to say that you have renewed your engagement to that lowborn wretch  mammahe is not a wretch  do you contradict me after all is it come to this  mammayou youcursed me  and you will be cursed do you think that you will do such wickedness as this that you can destroy all that i have done for you that you make yourself the cause of ruin to a whole family and that you will not be punished for it you say that you love me  you know that i love you mamma  and yet you do not scruple to drive me mad  mamma it was you who brought us together  ungrateful child where else could i take you then  but i was thereand of course i loved him i could not cease to love him becausebecause they say that i am a grand lady  listen to me anna you shall never marry him never with my own hands i will kill him firstor you the girl stood looking into her mothers face and trembling do you understand that  you do not mean it mamma  by the god above me i do do you think that i will stop at anything nowafter having done so much do you think that i will live to see my daughter the wife of a foul sweltering tailor no by heavens he tells you that when you are twentyone you will not be subject to my control i warn you to look to it i will not lose my control unless when i see you married to some husband fitting your condition in life for the present you will live in your own room as i will live in mine i will hold no intercourse whatever with you till i have constrained you to obey me     chapter xxxvii  let her die   after the scene which was described in the last chapter there was a very sad time indeed in keppel street the countess had been advised by the serjeant and mrs bluestone to take her daughter immediately abroad in the event of the interview with daniel thwaite being unsatisfactory it was believed by all concerned by the bluestones and the goffes by sir william patterson who had been told of the coming interview and by the countess herself that this would not be the case they had all thought that lady anna would come out from that meeting disengaged and free to marry whom she wouldand they thought also that within a very few weeks of her emancipation she would accept her cousins hand the solicitorgeneral had communicated with the earl who was still in town and the earl again believed that he might win the heiress but should the girl prove obstinatetake her away at oncevery far awayto rome or some such place as that such had been mrs bluestones advice and in those days rome was much more distant than it is now and dont let anybody know where you are going added the serjeantexcept mr goffe the countess had assentedbut when the moment came there were reasons against her sudden departure mr goffe told her that she must wait at any rate for another fortnight the presence of herself and her daughter were necessary in london for the signing of deeds and for the completion of the now merely formal proofs of identity and money was again scarce a great deal of money had been spent lately and unless money was borrowed without security and at a great costto which mr goffe was aversethe sum needed could hardly be provided at once mr goffe recommended that no day earlier than the 20th december should be fixed for their departure  it was now the end of november and it became a question how the intermediate time should be passed the countess was resolved that she would hold no pleasant intercourse at all with her daughter she would not even tell the girl of her purpose of going abroad from hour to hour she assured herself with still increasing obduracy that nothing but severity could avail anything the girl must be cowed and frightened into absolute submissioneven though at the expense of her health even though it was to be effected by the absolute crushing of her spiritsthis must be done though at the cost of her life it must be done this woman had lived for the last twenty years with but one object before her eyesan object sometimes seeming to be near more often distant and not unfrequently altogether beyond her reach but which had so grown upon her imagination as to become the heaven to which her very soul aspired to be and to be known to be among the highly born the socalled noble the titled from old datesto be of those who were purely aristocratic had been all the world to her as a childthe child of wellborn but poor parents she had received the idea in following it out she had thrown all thoughts of love to the wind and had married a reprobate earl then had come her punishmentor as she had conceived it her most unmerited misfortunes for many years of her life her high courage and persistent demeanour had almost atoned for the vice of her youth the love of rank was strong in her bosom as ever but it was fostered for her child rather than for herself through long tedious friendless povertystricken years she had endured all still assuring herself that the day would come when the world should call the sweet plant that grew by her side by its proper name the little children hooted after her daughter calling her girl in derision the lady annawhen lady anna had been more poorly clad and blessed with less of the comforts of home than any of them years would roll by and they should live to know that the lady annathe sport of their infantine crueltywas lady anna indeed and as the girl became a woman the dream was becoming a reality the rank the title the general acknowledgment and the wealth would all be there then came the first great decisive triumph overtures of love and friendship were made from the other side would lady anna consent to become the countess lovel all animosities might be buried and everything be made pleasant prosperous noble and triumphant  it is easy to fill with air a halfinflated bladder it is already so buoyant with its own lightness that it yields itself with ease to receive the generous air the imagination of the woman flew higher than ever it had flown when the proposition came home to her in all its bearings of course it had been in her mind that her daughter should marry wellbut there had been natural fears her child had not been educated had not lived had not been surrounded in her young days as are those girls from whom the curled darlings are wont to choose their wives she would too probably be rough in manner ungentle in speech ungifted in accomplishments as compared with those who from their very cradles are encompassed by the blessings of wealth and high social standing but when she looked at her childs beauty she would hope and then her child was soft sweethumoured winning in all her little ways pretty even in the poor duds which were supplied to her mainly by the generosity of the tailor and so she would hope and sometimes despairand then hope again but she had never hoped for anything so good as this such a marriage would not only put her daughter as high as a lovel ought to be but would make it known in a remarkable manner to all coming ages that she she herself she the despised and slandered onewho had been treated almost as woman had never been treated beforewas in very truth the countess lovel by whose income the family had been restored to its old splendour  and so the longing grew upon her then almost for the first time did she begin to feel that it was necessary for the purposes of her life that the girl whom she loved so thoroughly should be a creature in her hands to be dealt with as she pleased she would have had her daughter accede to the proposed marriage even before she had seen lord lovel and was petulant when her daughter would not be as clay in the sculptors hand but still the girls refusal had been but as the refusal of a girl she should not have been as are other girls she should have known better she should have understood what the peculiarity of her position demanded but it had not been so with her she had not soared as she should have done above the loveladen dreams of common maidens and so the visit to yoxham was permitted then came the great blowstruck as it were by a third hand and that the hand of an attorney the countess lovel learned through mr goffewho had heard the tale from other lawyersthat her daughter lady anna lovel had with her own mouth told her noble lover that she was betrothed to a tailor she felt at the moment that she could have diedcursing her child for this black ingratitude  but there might still be hope the trial was going onor the work which was progressing towards the trial and she was surrounded by those who could advise her doubtless what had happened was a great misfortune but there was room for hoperoom for most assured hope the earl was not disposed to abandon the match though he had of course been greatly annoyednay disgusted and degraded by the girls communication but he had consented to see the matter in the proper light the young tailor had got an influence over the girl when she was a child was doubtless in pursuit of money and must be paid the folly of a child might be forgiven and the earl would persevere no one would know what had occurred and the thing would be forgotten as a freak of childhood the countess had succumbed to the policy of all thisbut she was not deceived by the benevolent falsehood lady anna had been over twenty when she had been receiving lovers vows from this man reeking from his tailors board and her girl her daughter had deceived her that the girl had deceived her saying there was no other lover was much but it was much more and worse and more damnable that there had been thorough deception as to the girls own appreciation of her rank the sympathy tendered through so many years must have been always pretended sympathy with these feelings hot within her bosom she could not bring herself to speak one kindly word to lady anna after the return from yoxham the girl was asked to abandon her odious lover with stern severity it was demanded of her that she should do so with cruel threats she would never quite yield though she had then no strength of purpose sufficient to enable her to declare that she would not yield we know how she was banished to bedford square and transferred from the ruthless persistency of her mother to the less stern but not less fixed manoeuvres of mrs bluestone at that moment of her existence she was herself in doubt in wyndham street and at yoxham she had almost more than doubted the softness of the new elysium had well nigh unnerved her when that young man had caught her from stone to stone as she passed over the ford at bolton she was almost ready to give herself to him but then had come upon her the sense of sickness that faint overdone flavour of sugared sweetness which arises when sweet things become too luscious to the eater she had struggled to be honest and strong and had just not fallen into the pot of treacle  but notwithstanding all this they who saw her and knew the story were still sure that the lord must at last win the day there was not one who believed that such a girl could be true to such a troth as she had made even the solicitorgeneral when he told the tale which the amorous steward had remembered to his own encouragement did not think but what the girl and the girls fortune would fall into the hands of his client human nature demanded that it should be so that it should be as he wished it was so absolutely consonant with all nature as he had known it that he had preferred trusting to this result in his clients behalf to leaving the case in a jurys hands at this moment he was sure he was right in his judgment and indeed he was rightfor no jury could have done anything for his client  it went on till at last the wise men decided that the girl only wanted to be relieved by her old lover that she might take a new lover with his permission the girl was no doubt peculiar but as far as the wise ones could learn from her mannerfor with words she would say nothingthat was her state of mind so the interview was plannedto the infinite disgust of the countess who however believed that it might avail and we know what was the result lady anna who long had doubtedwho had at last almost begun to doubt whether daniel thwaite was true to herhad renewed her pledges strengthened her former promises and was now more firmly betrothed than ever to him whom the countess hated as a very fiend upon earth but there certainly should be no marriage though she pistolled the man at the altar there should be no marriage  and then there came upon her the infinite disgust arising from the necessity of having to tell her sorrows to otherswho could not sympathize with her though their wishes were as hers it was hard upon her that no step could be taken by her in reference to her daughter without the knowledge of mr goffe and serjeant bluestoneand the consequent knowledge of mr flick and the solicitorgeneral it was necessary too that lord lovel should know all his conduct in many things must depend on the reception which might probably be accorded to a renewal of his suit of course he must be told he had already been told that the tailor was to be admitted to see his love in order that she might be absolved by the tailor from her first vow it had not been pleasantbut he had acceded mr flick had taken upon himself to say that he was sure that everything would be made pleasant the earl had frowned and had been very short with mr flick these confidences with lawyers about his lovesuit and his loves tone with her lowborn lover had not been pleasant to lord lovel but he had endured itand now he must be told of the result oh heavenswhat a hell of misery was this girl making for her highborn relatives but the story of the tailors visit to keppel street did not reach the unhappy ones at yoxham till months had passed away  mr goffe was very injudicious in postponing the departure of the two ladiesas the solicitorgeneral told mr flick afterwards very plainly when he heard of what had been done money she might have had any money i would have advanced it you would have advanced it oh certainly said mr flick not however at all relishing the idea of advancing money to his clients adversary i never heard of such folly continued sir william that comes of trusting people who should not be trusted but it was too late then lady anna was lying ill in bed in fever and three doctors doubted whether she would ever get up again would it not be better that she should die said her mother to herself standing over her and looking at her it wouldso thought the mother thenbe better that she should die than get up to become the wife of daniel thwaite but how much better that she should live and become the countess lovel she still loved her child as only a mother can love her only childas only a mother can love who has no hope of joy in the world but what is founded on her child but the other passion had become so strong in her bosom that it almost conquered her mothers yearnings was she to fight for long years that she might be beaten at last when the prize was so near herwhen the cup was almost at her lips were the girl now to be taken to her grave there would be an end at any rate of the fear which now most heavily oppressed her but the three doctors were called in one after another and lady anna was tended as though her life was as precious as that of any other daughter  these new tidings caused new perturbation among the lawyers they say that clerke and holland have given her over said mr flick to sir william  i am sorry to hear it said mr solicitor but girls do live sometimes in spite of the doctors  yes very true sir william very true but if it should go in that way it might not perhaps be amiss for our client  god forbid that he should prosper by his cousins death mr flick but the countess would be the heir  the countess is devoted to the earl we ought to do something sir william i dont think that we could claim above eight or ten thousand pounds at most as real property he put his money everywhere did that old man there are shares in iron mines in the alleghanies worth ever so much  they are no good to us said the solicitorgeneral alluding to his clients interests  not worth a halfpenny to us though they are paying twenty per cent on the paidup capital he seems to have determined that the real heir should get nothing even if there were no will a wicked old man  very wicked mr flick  a horrible old man but we really ought to do something mr solicitor if the girl wont marry him there should be some compromise after all that we have done  how can the girl marry any one mr flickif shes going to die  a few days after this sir william called in keppel street and saw the countess not with any idea of promoting a compromisefor the doing which this would not have been the time nor would he have been the fitting mediumbut in order that he might ask after lady annas health the whole matter was in truth now going very much against the earl money had been allowed to the countess and her daughter and in truth all the money was now their own to do with it as they listed though there might be some delay before each was put into absolute possession of her own proportion but no money had been allowed or could be allowed to the earl and that the fact was so was now becoming known to all men hitherto credit had at any rate been easy with the young lord when the old earl died and when the will was set aside it was thought that he would be the heir when the lawsuit first came up it was believed everywhere that some generous compromise would be the worst that could befall him after that the marriage had been almost a certainty and then it was known that he had something of his own so that tradesmen need not fear that their bills would be paid it can hardly be said that he had been extravagant but a lord must live and an earl can hardly live and maintain a house in the country on a thousand a year even though he has an uncle to keep his hunters for him some prudent men in london were already beginning to ask for their money and the young earl was in trouble as mr flick had said it was quite time that something should be done sir william still depended on the panacea of a marriage if only the girl would live the marriage might be delayed but if the cards were played prudently might still make everything comfortable such girls do not marry tailors and will always prefer lords to tradesmen  i hope that you do not think that my calling is intrusive he said the countess dressed all in black with that funereal frown upon her brow which she always now wore with deepsunk eyes and care legible in every feature of her handsome face received him with a courtesy that was as full of woe as it was graceful she was very glad to make his acquaintance there was no intrusion he would forgive her she thought if he perceived that circumstances had almost overwhelmed her with sorrow i have come to ask after your daughter said he  she has been very ill sir william  is she better now  i hardly know i cannot say they seemed to think this morning that the fever was less violent  then she will recover lady lovel  they do not say so but indeed i did not ask them it is all in gods hands i sometimes think that it would be better that she should die and there be an end of it  this was the first time that these two had been in each others company and the lawyer could not altogether repress the feeling of horror with which he heard the mother speak in such a way of her only child oh lady lovel do not say that  but i do say it why should i not say it to you who know all of what good will her life be to herself or to any one else if she pollute herself and her family by this marriage it would be better that she should be deadmuch better that she should be dead she is all that i have sir william it is for her sake that i have been struggling from the first moment in which i knew that i was to be a mother the whole care of my life has been to prove her to be her fathers daughter in the eye of the law i doubt whether you can know what it is to pursue one object and only one through your whole life with neverending solicitudeand to do it all on behalf of another if you did you would understand my feeling now it would be better for her that she should die than become the wife of such a one as daniel thwaite  lady lovel not only as a mother but as a christian you should get the better of that feeling  of course i should no doubt every clergyman in england would tell me the same thing it is easy to say all that sir wait till you are tried wait till all your ambition is to be betrayed every hope rolled in the dust till all the honours you have won are to be soiled and degraded till you are made a mark for general scorn and public pityand then tell me how you love the child by whom such evils are brought upon you  i trust that i may never be so tried lady lovel  i hope not but think of all that before you preach to me but i do love her and it is because i love her that i would fain see her removed from the reproaches which her own madness will bring upon her let her dieif it be gods will i can follow her without one wish for a prolonged life then will a noble family be again established and her sorrowful tale will be told among the lovels with a tear and without a curse     chapter xxxviii  lady annas bedside   all december went by and the neighbours in the houses round spent each his merry christmas and the snow and frost of january passed over them and february had come and nearly gone before the doctors dared to say that lady anna lovels life was not still in danger during this long period the world had known all about her illnessas it did know or pretended to know the whole history of her life the world had been informed that she was dying and had upon the whole been really very sorry for her she had interested the world and the world had heard much of her youth and beautyof the romance too of her story of her fidelity to the tailor and of her persecutions during these months of her illness the world was disposed to think that the tailor was a fine fellow and that he ought to be taken by the hand he had money now and it was thought that it would be a good thing to bring him into some club there was a very strong feeling at the beaufort that if he were properly proposed and seconded he would be electednot because he was going to marry an heiress but because he was losing the heiress whom he was to have married if the girl died then lord lovel himself might bring him forward at the beaufort of all this daniel himself knew nothing but he heard as all the world heard that lady anna was on her deathbed  when the news first reached himafter a fashion that seemed to him to be hardly worthy of credithe called at the house in keppel street and asked the question yes lady anna was very ill but as it happened sarah the ladysmaid opened the door and sarah remembered the tailor she had seen him when he was admitted to her young mistress and knew enough of the story to be aware that he should be snubbed her first answer was given before she had bethought herself then she snubbed him and told no one but the countess of his visit after that daniel went to one of the doctors and waited at his door with patience till he could be seen the unhappy man told his story plainly he was daniel thwaite late a tailor the man from keswick to whom lady anna lovel was engaged in charity and loving kindness would the doctor tell him of the state of his beloved one the doctor took him by the hand and asked him in and did tell him his beloved one was then on the very point of death whereupon daniel wrote to the countess in humble strains himself taking the letter and waiting without in the street for any answer that might be vouchsafed if it was as he was told that his beloved was dying might he be allowed to stand once at her bedside and kiss her hand in about an hour an answer was brought to him at the area gate it consisted of his own letter opened and returned to him without a word he went away too sad to curse but he declared to himself that such cruelty in a womans bosom could exist only in the bosom of a countess  but as others heard early in february that lady anna was like to recover so did daniel thwaite indeed his authority was better than that which reached the clubs for the doctor still stood his friend could the doctor take a message from him to lady annabut one word nothe doctor could take no message that he would not do but he did not object to give to the lover a bulletin of the health of his sweetheart in this way daniel knew sooner than most others when the change took place in the condition of his beloved one  lady anna would be of age in may and the plan of her betrothed was as follows he would do nothing till that time and then he would call upon her to allow their banns to be published in bloomsbury church after the manner of the church of england he himself had taken lodgings in great russell street thinking that his object might be aided by living in the same parish if as was probable he would not be allowed to approach lady anna either in person or by letter then he would have recourse to the law and would allege that the young lady was unduly kept a prisoner in custody he was told that such complaint would be as idle wind coming from himthat no allegation of that kind could obtain any redress unless it came from the young lady herself but he flattered himself that he could so make it that the young lady would at any rate obtain thereby the privilege of speaking for herself let some one ask her what were her wishes and he would be prepared to abide by her expression of them  in the meantime lord lovel also had been anxiousbut his anxiety had been met in a very different fashion for many days the countess saw him daily so that there grew up between them a close intimacy when it was believed that the girl would diebelieved with that sad assurance which made those who were concerned speak of her death almost as a certainty the countess sitting alone with the young earl had told him that all would be his if the girl left them he had muttered something as to there being no reason for that who else should have it said the countess where should it go your people lovel have not understood me it is for the family that i have been fighting fighting fightingand never ceasing though you have been my adversaryit has been all for the lovels if she goesit shall be yours at once there is no one knows how little i care for wealth myself then the girl had become better and the countess again began her plots and her plans and her strategy she would take the girl abroad in may in april if it might be possible they would gonot to rome then but to the south of france and as the weather became too warm for them on to switzerland and the tyrol would he lord lovel follow them would he follow them and be constant in his suit even though the frantic girl should still talk of her tailor lover if he would do so as far as money was concerned all should be in common with them for what was the money wanted but that the lovels might be great and noble and splendid he said that he would do so he also loved the girlthought at least during the tenderness created by her illness that he loved her with all his heart he sat hour after hour with the countess in keppel streetsometimes seeing the girl as she lay unconscious or feigning that she was so till at last he was daily at her bedside you had better not talk to him anna her mother would say but of course he is anxious to see you then the earl would kiss her hand and in her mothers presence she had not the courageperhaps she had not the strengthto withdraw it in these days the countess was not cruelly stern as she had been bedside nursing hardly admits of such cruelty of manner but she never spoke to her child with little tender endearing words never embraced herbut was to her a careful nurse rather than a loving mother  then by degrees the girl got better and was able to talk mamma she said one day wont you sit by me  no my dear you should not be encouraged to talk  sit by me and let me hold your hand for a moment the countess gave way and sat by her daughter allowing her hand to remain pressed beneath the bedclothesbut she rose abruptly remembering her grievance remembering that it would be better that her child should die should die brokenhearted by unrelenting cruelty than be encouraged to think it possible that she should do as she desired so she rose abruptly and left the bedside without a word  mamma said lady anna will lord lovel be here today  i suppose he will be here  will you let me speak to him for a minute  surely you may speak to him  i am strong now mamma and i think that i shall be well again some day i have so often wished that i might die  you had better not talk about it my dear  but i should like to speak to him mamma without you  what to sayanna  i hardly knowbut i should like to speak to him i have something to say about money  cannot i say it  no mamma i must say it myselfif you will let me the countess looked at her girl with suspicion but she gave the permission demanded of course it would be right that this lover should see his love the countess was almost minded to require from lady anna an assurance that no allusion should be made to daniel thwaite but the mans name had not been mentioned between them since the beginning of the illness and she was loth to mention it now nor would it have been possible to prevent for long such an interview as that now proposed  he shall come in if he pleases said the countess but i hope you will remember who you are and to whom you are speaking  i will remember both mamma said lady anna the countess looked down on her daughters face and could not help thinking that her child was different from what she had been there had been almost defiance in the words spoken though they had been spoken with the voice of an invalid  at three oclock that afternoon according to his custom lord lovel came and was at once told that he was to be spoken to by his cousin she says it is about money said the countess  about money  yesand if she confines herself to that do as she bids you if she is ever to be your wife it will be all right and if notthen it will be better in your hands than in hers in three months time she can do as she pleases with it all he was then taken into lady annas room here is your cousin said the countess you must not talk long or i shall interrupt you if you wish to speak to him about the propertyas the head of your familythat will be very right but confine yourself to that for the present then the countess left them and closed the door  it is not only about money lord lovel  you might call me frederic now said he tenderly  nonot now if i am ever well again and we are then friends i will do so they tell me that there is ever so much moneyhundreds of thousands of pounds i forget how much  do not trouble yourself about that  but i do trouble myself very much about itand i know that it ought to be yours there is one thing i want to tell you which you must believe if i am ever any mans wife i shall be the wife of daniel thwaite that dark frown came upon his face which she had seen once before pray believe that it is so she continued mamma does not believe itwill not believe it but it is so i love him with all my heart i think of him every minute it is very very cruel that i may not hear from him or send one word to tell him how i am there my hand is on the bible and i swear to you that if i am ever the wife of any man i will be his wife  he looked down at her and saw that she was wan and thin and weak and he did not dare to preach to her the old family sermon as to his rank and station but anna why do you tell me this now he said  that you may believe it and not trouble yourself with me any more you must believe it when i tell you so in this manner i may perhaps never live to rise from my bed if i get well i shall send to him or go i will not be hindered he is true to me and i will be true to him you may tell mamma if you think proper she would not believe me but perhaps she may believe you but lord lovel it is not fit that he should have all this money he does not want it and he would not take it till i am married i may do what i please with itand it shall be yours  that cannot be  yes it can i know that i can make it yours if i please they tell me thatthat you are not rich as lord lovel should be because all this has been taken from you that was the reason why you came to me  by heaven anna i love you most truly  it could not have been so when you had not seen me will you take a message from me to daniel thwaite  he thought awhile before he answered it no i cannot do that  then i must find another messenger mr goffe will do it perhaps he shall tell me how much he wants to keep and the rest shall be yours that is all if you tell mamma ask her not to be hard to me he stood over her and took her hand but knew not how to speak a word to her he attempted to kiss her hand but she raised herself on her elbow and shook her head and drew it from him it belongs to daniel thwaite she said then he left her and did not speak another word  what has she said asked the countess with an attempt at smiling  i do not know that i should tell you  surely lovel you are bound to tell me  she has offered me all her propertyor most of it  she is right said the countess  but she has sworn to me on the bible that she will never be my wife  tushit means nothing  ah yesit means much it means all she never loved menot for an instant that other man has been before me and she is too firm to be moved  did she say so  he was silent for a moment and then replied yes she did say so  then let her die said the countess  lady lovel  let her die it will be better oh god that i should be brought to this and what will you do my lord do you mean to say that you will abandon her  i cannot ask her to be my wife again  whatbecause she has said this in her sicknesswhen she is half deliriouswhile she is dreaming of the words that man spoke to her have you no more strength than that are you so poor a creature  i think i have been a poor creature to ask her a second time at all  no not so your duty and mine are the sameas should be hers we must forget ourselves while we save the family do not i bear all have not i borne everythingcontumely solitude ill words poverty and now this girls unkindness but even yet i will not give it up take the propertyas it is offered  i could not touch it  if not for you then for your children take it all so that we may be the stronger but do not abandon us now if you are a man  he would not stay to hear her further exhortations but hurried away from the house full of doubt and unhappiness     chapter xxxix  lady annas offer   early in march lady anna was convalescent but had not yet left the house in keppel streetand the confusion and dismay of the countess were greater than ever lady anna had declared that she would not leave england for the present she was reminded that at any rate till the 10th of may she was subject to her mothers control but by this time her mothers harshness to her had produced some corresponding hardness in her yes mammabut i will not go abroad things must be settled and i am not well enough to go yet the countess asserted that everything could be arranged abroad that papers could be sent after them that mr goffe could come out to them and with much show of authority persisted she would do anything by which she might be able to remove lady anna from the influence of daniel thwaite at the time at which the girl would cease to be subject to her but in truth the girl had ceased to be subject to her no mamma i will not go if you will ask serjeant bluestone or sir william patterson i am sure they will say that i ought not to be made to go there were some terrible scenes in which the mother was driven almost to desperation lady anna repeated to the countess all that she had said to lord loveland swore to her mother with the bible in hand that if ever she became the wife of any man she would be the wife of daniel thwaite then the countess with great violence knocked the book out of her daughters grasp and it was thrown to the other side of the room if this is to go on said the countess one of us must die  mamma i have done nothing to make you so unkind to me you have not spoken one word of kindness to me since i came from yoxham  if this goes on i shall never speak a word of kindness to you again said the mother  but in the midst of all this there was one point on which they were agreedon which they came sufficiently near together for action though there was still a wide difference between them some large proportion of the property at stake was to be made over to lord lovel on the day that gave the girl the legal power of transferring her own possessions the countess began by presuming that the whole of lady annas wealth was to be so transferrednot from any lack of reverence for the great amount which was in question but feeling that for all good purposes it would be safer in the hands of the earl than in those of her own child if it could be arranged that the tailor could get nothing with his bride then it might still be possible that the tailor might refuse the match at any rate a quarrel might be fostered and the evil might be staved off but to this lady anna would not assent if she might act in this business in concert with mr thwaite she would be able she thought to do better by her cousin than she proposed but as she was not allowed to learn what were mr thwaites wishes she would halve her property with her cousin as much as this she was willing to doand was determined to do acting on her own judgment more she would not dounless she could see mr thwaite as it stood her proposition was one which would if carried out bestow something like £10000 a year upon the earl then mr goffe was sent for and lady anna was allowed to communicate her suggestion to the lawyer that should require a great deal of thought said mr goffe with solemnity lady anna declared that she had been thinking of it all the time she had been ill but it should not be done in a hurry said mr goffe then lady anna remarked that in the meantime her cousin the earl the head of her family would have nothing to support his title mr goffe took his leave promising to consult his partner and to see mr flick  mr goffe did consult his partner and did see mr flick and then serjeant bluestone was asked his adviceand the solicitorgeneral the serjeant had become somewhat tired of the lovels and did not care to give any strong advice either in one direction or in the other the young lady he said might of course do what she liked with her own when it was her own but he thought that she should not be hurried he pointed it out as a fact that the earl had not the slightest claim upon any portion of the estatenot more than he would have had if this money had come to lady anna from her mothers instead of from her fathers relatives he was still of opinion that the two cousins might ultimately become man and wife if matters were left tranquil and the girl were taken abroad for a year or two lady anna however would be of age in a few weeks and must of course do as she liked with her own  but they all felt that everything would at last be ruled by what the solicitorgeneral might say the solicitorgeneral was going out of town for a week or ten dayshaving the management of a great case at the spring assizes he would think over lady annas proposition and say what he had to say when he returned lord lovel however had been his client and he had said from first to last that more was to be done for his client by amicable arrangement than by hostile opposition if the earl could get £10000 a year by amicable arrangement the solicitorgeneral would be shown to have been right in the eyes of all men and it was probableas both mr goffe and mr flick feltthat he would not repudiate a settlement of the family affairs by which he would be proved to have been a discreet counsellor  in the meantime it behoved lord lovel himself to have an opinion mr flick of course had told him of the offerwhich had in truth been made directly to himself by his cousin at this time his affairs were not in a happy condition a young earl handsome and well esteemed may generally marry an heiressif not one heiress then another though he be himself a poor man his rank and position will stand in lieu of wealth and so would it have been with this young earlwho was very handsome and excellently well esteemedhad it not been that all the world knew that it was his especial business to marry one especial heiress he could hardly go about looking for other honey having as he had one particular hive devoted by public opinion to himself after a year or two he might have looked elsewherebut what was he to do in the meantime he was well nigh penniless and in debt so he wrote a letter to his uncle the parson  it may be remembered that when the uncle and nephew last parted in london there was not much love between them from that day to this they had not seen each other nor had there been any communication between them the horses had been taken away and sold the rector had spoken to the ladies of his household more than once with great bitterness of the young mans ingratitude and they more than once had spoken to the rector with a womans piteous tenderness of the young lords poverty but it was all sorrow and distress for in truth the rector could not be happy while he was on bad terms with the head of his family then the young lord wrote as though there had been nothing amiss between them it had in truth all passed away from his mind this very liberal offer had been made to him it amounted to wealth in lieu of povertyto what would be comfortable wealth even for an earl ten thousand a year was offered to him by his cousin might he accept it the rector took the letter in good part and begged his nephew to come at once to yoxham whereupon the nephew went to yoxham  what does sir william say asked the rector who in spite of his disapproval of all that sir william had done felt that the solicitorgeneral was the man whose influence in the matter would really prevail  he has said nothing as yet he is out of town  ten thousand a year who was it made the offer  she made it herself  lady anna  yeslady anna it is a noble offer  yes indeed but then if she has no right to any of it what does it amount to  but she has a right to all of itshe and her mother between them  i shall never believe it fredericnever and not the less so because they now want to bind you to them by such a compromise as this  i think you look at it in a wrong light uncle charles  wellwell i will say nothing more about it i dont see why you shouldnt take iti dont indeed it ought all to have been yours everybody says that youll have to buy land and it wont give you nearly so much then i hope youll buy land all the same and i do hope it will be properly settled when you marry as to marrying you will be able to do much better than what you used to think of  we wont talk about that uncle charles said the earl  as far as the rectors opinion went it was clear that the offer might be accepted but yet it was felt that very much must depend on what the solicitorgeneral might say then miss lovel gave her opinion on the matter which did not altogether agree with that of her brother she believed in lady anna whereas the rector professed that he did not the rector and lady fitzwarren were perhaps the only two persons who after all that had been said and done still maintained that the countess was an impostor and that lady anna would only be anna murray if everybody had his due miss lovel was quite as anxious on behalf of the earl as was her brother but she clung to the hope of a marriage i still think it might all come right if you would only wait said aunt julia  its all very well talking of waiting but how am i to live  you could live here frederic there is nothing my brother would like so much i thought he would break his heart when the horses were taken away it would only be for a year  what would come of it  at the end of the year she would be your wife  never said the earl  young men are so impatient  never under any circumstances would i ask her again you may make your mind up to that as sure as you stand there she will marry daniel thwaite if she lives another twelvemonth  you really think so frederic  i am sure of it after what she said to me it would be impossible i should doubt it  and she will be lady anna thwaite oh dear how horrible i wish she had died when she was illi do indeed a journeyman tailor but something will prevent it i really think that providence will interfere to prevent it but in reference to the money she gave in her adhesion if the great lawyer said that it might be takenthen it should be taken at the end of a week the earl hurried back to london to see the great lawyer     chapter xl  no disgrace at all   before the solicitorgeneral returned to town things had come to a worse pass than ever lady lovel had ordered her daughter to be ready to start to paris by a certain hour on a certain daygiving her three days for preparationand lady anna had refused to go whereupon the countess had caused her own things to be packed up and those of her daughter sarah was now altogether in the confidence of the countess so that lady anna had not even dominion over her own clothes the things were stowed away and all the arrangements were made for the journey but lady anna refused to go and when the hour came could not be induced to get into the carriage the lodgings had been paid for to the day and given up so that the poor old woman in keppel street was beside herself then the countess of necessity postponed her journey for twentyfour hours telling her daughter that on the next day she would procure the assistance of magistrates and force the rebel to obedience  hardly a word had been spoken between the mother and daughter during those three days there had been messages sent backwards and forwards and once or twice the countess had violently entered lady annas bedroom demanding submission lady anna was always on the bed when her mother entered and there lying would shake her head and then with sobs accuse the countess of unkindness lady lovel had become furious in her wrath hardly knowing what she herself did or said always asserting her own authority declaring her own power and exclaiming against the wicked ingratitude of her child this she did till the young waitingwoman was so frightened that she was almost determined to leave the house abruptly though keenly alive to the profit and glory of serving a violent and rich countess and the old lady who let the lodgings was intensely anxious to be rid of her lodgers though her money was scrupulously paid and no questions asked as to extra charges lady anna was silent and sullen when left to herself she spent her time at her writingdesk of which she had managed to keep the key what meals she took were brought up to her bedroom so that a household more uncomfortable could hardly be gathered under a roof  on the day fixed for that departure which did not take place the countess wrote to mr goffe for assistanceand lady anna by the aid of the mistress of the house wrote to serjeant bluestone the letter to mr goffe was the first step taken towards obtaining that assistance from civil authorities to which the countess thought herself to be entitled in order that her legal dominion over her daughter might be enforced lady anna wrote to the serjeant simply begging that he would come to see her putting her letter open into the hands of the landlady she implored him to come at onceand as it happened he called in keppel street that night whereas mr goffes visit was not made till the next morning he asked for the countess and was shown into the drawingroom the whole truth was soon made clear to him for the countess attempted to conceal nothing her child was rebelling against authority and she was sure that the serjeant would assist her in putting down and conquering such pernicious obstinacy but she found at once that the serjeant would not help her but lady anna will be herself of age in a day or two he said  not for nearly two months said the countess indignantly  my dear lady lovel under such circumstances you can hardly put constraint upon her  why not she is of age or she is not till she be of age she is bound to obey me  trueshe is bound to obey you after a fashion and so indeed she would be had she been of age a month since but such obligations here in england go for very little unless they are supported by reason  the law is the law  yesbut the law would be all in her favour before you could get it to assist youeven if you could get its assistance in her peculiar position it is rational that she should choose to wait till she be able to act for herself very great interests will be at her disposal and she will of course wish to be near those who can advise her  i am her only guardian i can advise her the serjeant shook his head you will not help me then  i fear i cannot help you lady lovel  not though you know the reasons which induce me to take her away from england before she slips entirely out of my hands and ruins all our hopes but still the serjeant shook his head every one is leagued against me said the countess throwing up her hands in despair  then the serjeant asked permission to visit lady anna but was told that he could not be allowed to do so she was in bed and there was nothing to make it necessary that she should receive a visit from a gentleman in her bedroom i am an old man said the serjeant and have endeavoured to be a true and honest friend to the young lady i think lady lovel that you will do wrong to refuse my request i tell you fairly that i shall be bound to interfere on her behalf she has applied to me as her friend and i feel myself constrained to attend to her application  she has applied to you  yes lady lovel there is her letter  she has deceived me again said the countess tearing the letter into atoms but the serjeant so far frightened her that she was induced to promise that mrs bluestone should see lady anna on the following morningstipulating however that mrs bluestone should see herself before she went upstairs  on the following morning mr goffe came early but mr goffe could give his client very little comfort he was however less uncomfortable than the serjeant had been he was of opinion that lady anna certainly ought to go abroad in obedience to her mothers instructions and was willing to go to her and tell her so with what solemnity of legal authority he might be able to assume but he could not say that anything could be done absolutely to enforce obedience mr goffe suggested that perhaps a few gentle words might be successful gentle words said the countess who had become quite unable to restrain herself the harshest words are only too gentle for her if i had known what she was mr goffe i would never have stirred in this business they might have called me what they would and it would have been better when mr goffe came downstairs he had not a word to say more as to the efficacy of gentleness he simply remarked that he did not think the young lady could be induced to go and suggested that everybody had better wait till the solicitorgeneral returned to town  then mrs bluestone came almost on the heels of the attorneypoor mrs bluestone who now felt that it was a dreadful grievance both to her and to her husband that they had had anything to do with the lovel family she was very formal in her mannerand to tell the truth for her rather frightened the serjeant had asked her to call and see lady anna lovel might she be permitted to do so then the countess burst forth with a long story of all her wrongswith the history of her whole life not beginning with her marriagebut working back to it from the intense misery and equally intense ambition of the present hour she told it all how everybody had been against herhow she had been all alone at the dreary grange in westmorelandhow she had been betrayed by her husband and turned out to poverty and scornhow she had borne it all for the sake of the one child who was by gods laws and mans the heiress to her fathers name how she had perseveredintermingling it all with a certain worship of high honours and hereditary position with which mrs bluestone was able in some degree to sympathise she was clever and words came to her freely it was almost impossible that any hearer should refuse to sympathise with herany hearer who knew that her words were true and all that she told was true the things which she narrated had been donethe wrongs had been enduredand the end of it all which she feared was imminent and the hearer thought as did the speaker as to the baseness of this marriage with the tailorthought as did the speaker of the excellence of the marriage with the lord but still there was something in the womans eyesomething in the tone of her voice something in the very motion of her hands as she told her story which made mrs bluestone feel that lady anna should not be left under her mothers control it would be very well that the lovel family should be supported and that lady anna should be kept within the pale of her own rank but there might be things worse than lady annas defectionand worse even than the very downfall of the lovels  after sitting for nearly two hours with the countess mrs bluestone was taken upstairs mrs bluestone has come to see you said the countess not entering the room and retreating again immediately as she closed the door  this is very kind of you mrs bluestone said lady anna who was sitting crouching in her dressinggown over the fire but i thought that perhaps the serjeant would come the lady taken off her guard immediately said that the serjeant had been there on the preceding evening and mamma would not let me see him but you will help me  in this interview as in that below a long history was told to the visitor and was told with an eloquent energy which she certainly had not expected they talk to me of ladies said lady anna i was not a lady i knew nothing of ladies and their doings i was a poor girl friendless but for my mother sometimes almost without shoes to my feet often ragged solitary knowing nothing of ladies then there came one lad who played with meand it was mamma who brought us together he was good to me when all others were bad he played with me and gave me things and taught meand loved me then when he asked me to love him again and to love him always was i to think that i could notbecause i was a lady you despise him because he is a tailor a tailor was good to me when no one else was good how could i despise him because he was a tailor i did not despise him but i loved him with all my heart  but when you came to know who you were lady anna  yesyes i came to know who i was and they brought my cousin to me and told me to love him and bade me be a lady indeed i felt it too for a time i thought it would be pleasant to be a countess and to go among great people and he was pleasant and i thought that i could love him too and do as they bade me but when i thought of it muchwhen i thought of it alonei hated myself in my heart of hearts i loved him who had always been my friend and when lord lovel came to me at bolton and said that i must give my answer theni told him all the truth i am glad i told him the truth he should not have come again after that if daniel is so poor a creature because he is a tailormust not i be poor who love him and what must he be when he comes to me again after that  when mrs bluestone descended from the room she was quite sure that the girl would become lady anna thwaite and told the countess that such was her opinion by the god above me said the countess rising from her chairby the god above me she never shall but after that the countess gave up her project of forcing her daughter to go abroad the old lady of the house was told that the rooms would still be required for some weeks to comeperhaps for months and having had a conference on the subject with mrs bluestone did not refuse her consent  at last sir william returned to town and was besieged on all sides as though in his hands lay the power of deciding what should become of all the lovel family mr goffe was as confidential with him as mr flick and even serjeant bluestone condescended to appeal to him the young earl was closeted with him on the day of his return and he had found on his desk the following note from the countess  the countess lovel presents her compliments to the solicitorgeneral the countess is very anxious to leave england with her daughter but has hitherto been prevented by her childs obstinacy sir william patterson is so well aware of all the circumstances that he no doubt can give the countess advice as to the manner in which she should proceed to enforce the obedience of her daughter the countess lovel would feel herself unwarranted in thus trespassing on the solicitorgeneral were it not that it is her chief anxiety to do everything for the good of earl lovel and the family  look at that my lord said the solicitorgeneral showing the earl the letter i can do nothing for her  what does she want to have done  she wants to carry her daughter away beyond the reach of mr thwaite i am not a bit surprised but she cant do it the days are gone by when a mother could lock her daughter up or carry her awayat any rate in this country  it is very sad  it might have been much worse why should she not marry mr thwaite let them make the settlement as they propose and then let the young lady have her way she will have her waywhether her mother lets her or no  it will be a disgrace to the family sir william  no disgrace at all how many peers daughters marry commoners in england it is not with us as it is with some german countries in which noble blood is separated as by a barrier from blood that is not noble the man i am told is clever and honest he will have great means at his command and i do not see why he should not make as good a gentleman as the best of us at any rate she must not be persecuted  sir william answered the countesss letter as a matter of course but there was no comfort in his answer the solicitorgeneral presents his compliments to the countess lovel with all the will in the world to be of service he fears that he can do no good by interfering between the countess and lady anna lovel if however he may venture to give advice he would suggest to the countess that as lady anna will be of age in a short time no attempt should now be made to exercise a control which must cease when that time shall arrive they are all joined against me said the countess when she read the letterevery one of them but still it shall never be i will not live to see it  then there was a meeting between mr flick and sir william mr flick must inform the ladies that nothing could be done till lady anna was of agethat not even could any instructions be taken from her before that time as to what should subsequently be done if when that time came she should still be of a mind to share with her cousin the property she could then instruct mr goffe to make out the necessary deeds  all this was communicated by letter to the countess but mr goffe especially requested that the letter might be shown to lady anna and that he might receive a reply intimating that lady anna understood its purport if necessary he would call upon lady anna in keppel street after some delay and much consideration the countess sent the attorneys letter to her daughter and lady anna herself wrote a reply she perfectly understood the purport of mr goffes letter and would thank mr goffe to call upon her on the 10th of may when the matter might she hoped be settled     chapter xli  nearer and nearer   so they went on living in utter misery till the month of may had come round and lady anna was at last pronounced to be convalescent  late one night long after midnight the countess crept into her daughters room and sat down by the bedside lady anna was asleep and the countess sat there and watched at this time the girl had passed her birthday and was of age mr goffe had been closeted with her and with her mother for two mornings running sir william patterson had also been with them and instructions had been given as to the property upon which action was to be at once taken of that proportion of the estate which fell to lady anna one entire moiety was to be made over to the earl while this was being arranged no word was said as to daniel thwaite or as to the marriage with the lord the settlement was made as though it were a thing of itself and they all had been much surprisedthe mother the solicitorgeneral and the attorneyat the determination of purpose and full comprehension of the whole affair which lady anna displayed when it came to the absolute doing of the matterthe abandonment of all this moneythe countess became uneasy and discontented she also had wished that lord lovel should have the propertybut her wish had been founded on a certain object to be attained which object was now farther from her than ever but the property in question was not hers but her daughters and she made no loud objection to the proceeding the instructions were given and the deeds were to be forthcoming some time before the end of the month  it was on the night of the 11th of may that the countess sat at her childs bedside she had brought up a taper with her and there she sat watching the sleeping girl thoughts wondrously at variance with each other and feelings thoroughly antagonistic ran through her brain and heart this was her only childthe one thing that there was for her to lovethe only tie to the world that she possessed but for her girl it would be good that she should be dead and if her girl should do this thing which would make her life a burden to herhow good it would be for her to die she did not fear to die and she feared nothing after deathbut with a cowards dread she did fear the torment of her failure if this girl should become the wife of daniel thwaite in such case most certainly would she never see the girl againand life then would be all a blank to her but she understood that though she should separate herself from the world altogether men would know of her failure and would know that she was devouring her own heart in the depth of her misery if the girl would but have done as her mother had proposed would have followed after her kind and taken herself to those pleasant paths which had been opened for her with what a fond caressing worship with what infinite kisses and blessings would she the mother have tended the young countess and assisted in making the world bright for the highborn bride but a tailor foh what a degraded creature was her child to cling to so base a love  she did however acknowledge to herself that the girls clinging was of a kind she had no power to lessen the ivy to its standard tree is not more loyal than was her daughter to this wretched man but the girl might dieor the tailor might dieor she the miserable mother might die and so this misery might be at an end nothing but death could end it thoughts and dreams of other violence had crossed her brainof carrying the girl away of secluding her of frightening her from day to day into some childish halfidiotic submission but for that the tame obedience of the girl would have been necessaryor that external assistance which she had sought in vain to obtain among the lawyers such hopes were now gone and nothing remained but death  why had not the girl gone when she was so like to go why had she not died when it had seemed to be gods pleasure to take her a little indifference some slight absence of careful tending any chance accident would have made that natural which was nowwhich was now so desirable and yet beyond reach yesso desirable for whose sake could it be wished that a life so degraded should be prolonged but there could be no such escape with her eyes fixed on vacancy revolving it in her mind she thought that she could kill herselfbut she knew that she could not kill her child  but should she destroy herself there would be no vengeance in that could she be alone far out at sea in some small skiff with that lowborn tailor and then pull out the plug and let him know what he had done to her as they both went down together beneath the water that would be such a cure of the evil as would now best suit her wishes but there was no such sea and no such boat death however might still be within her grasp  then she laid her hand on the girls shoulder and lady anna awoke oh mammais that you  it is i my child  mamma mamma is anything the matter oh mamma kiss me then the countess stooped down and kissed the girl passionately dear mammadearest mamma  anna will you do one thing for me if i never speak to you of lord lovel again will you forget daniel thwaite she paused but lady anna had no answer ready will you not say as much as that for me say that you will forget him till i am gone  gone mamma you are not going  till i am dead i shall not live long anna say at least that you will not see him or mention his name for twelve months surely anna you will do as much as that for a mother who has done so much for you but lady anna would make no promise she turned her face to the pillow and was dumb answer me my child i may at least demand an answer  i will answer you tomorrow mamma then the countess fell on her knees at the bedside and uttered a long incoherent prayer addressed partly to the god of heaven and partly to the poor girl who was lying there in bed supplicating with mad passionate eagerness that this evil thing might be turned away from her then she seized the girl in her embrace and nearly smothered her with kisses my own my darling my beauty my all save your mother from worse than death if you canif you can  had such tenderness come sooner it might have had deeper effect as it was though the daughter was affected and harassedthough she was left panting with sobs and drowned in tearsshe could not but remember the treatment she had suffered from her mother during the last six months had the request for a years delay come sooner it would have been granted but now it was made after all measures of cruelty had failed ten times during the night did she say that she would yieldand ten times again did she tell herself that were she to yield now she would be a slave all her life she had resolvedwhether right or wrongstill with a strong mind and a great purpose that she would not be turned from her way and when she arose in the morning she was resolved again she went into her mothers room and at once declared her purpose mamma it cannot be i am his and i must not forget him or be ashamed of his nameno not for a day  then go from me thou ungrateful one hard of heart unnatural child base cruel and polluted go from me if it be possible for ever  then did they live for some days separated for a second time each taking her meals in her own room and mrs richards the owner of the lodgings went again to mrs bluestone declaring that she was afraid of what might happen and that she must pray to be relieved from the presence of the ladies mrs bluestone had to explain that the lodgings had been taken for the quarter and that a mother and daughter could not be put out into the street merely because they lived on bad terms with each other the old woman as was natural increased her billsbut that had no effect  on the 15th of may lady anna wrote a note to daniel thwaite and sent a copy of it to her mother before she had posted it it was in two lines      dear daniel     pray come and see me here if you get this soon enough    pray come on tuesday about one     yours affectionately     anna   tell mamma said she to sarah that i intend to go out and put that in the post today the letter was addressed to wyndham street now the countess knew that daniel thwaite had left wyndham street  tell her said the countess tell her but of what use to tell her anything let the door be closed upon her she shall never return to me any more the message was given to lady anna as she went forthbut she posted the letter and then called in bedford square mrs bluestone returned with her to keppel street but as the door was opened by mrs richards and as no difficulty was made as to lady annas entrance mrs bluestone returned home without asking to see the countess  this happened on a saturday but when tuesday came daniel thwaite did not come to keppel street the note was delivered in course of post at his old abode and was redirected from wyndham street late on monday eveninghaving no doubt given cause there for much curiosity and inspection late on the tuesday it did reach daniel thwaites residence in great russell street but he was then out wandering about the streets as was his wont telling himself of all the horrors of an idle life and thinking what steps he should take next as to the gaining of his bride he had known to a day when she was of age and had determined that he would allow her one month from thence before he would call upon her to say what should be their mutual fate she had reached that age but a few days and now she had written to him herself  on returning home he received the girls letter and when the early morning had comethe wednesday morning the day after that fixed by lady annahe made up his mind as to his course of action he breakfasted at eight knowing how useless it would be to stir early and then called in keppel street leaving word with mrs richards herself that he would be there again at one oclock to see lady anna you can tell lady anna that i only got her note last night very late then he went off to the hotel in albemarle street at which he knew that lord lovel was living it was something after nine when he reached the house and the earl was not yet out of his bedroom daniel however sent up his name and the earl begged that he would go into the sittingroom and wait tell mr thwaite that i will not keep him above a quarter of an hour then the tailor was shown into the room where the breakfast things were laid and there he waited  within the last few weeks very much had been said to the earl about daniel thwaite by many people and especially by the solicitorgeneral you may be sure that she will become his wife sir william had said and i would advise you to accept him as her husband she is not a girl such as we at first conceived her to be she is firm of purpose and very honest obstinate if you will andif you willobstinate to a bad end but she is generous and let her marry whom she will you cannot cast her out you will owe everything to her high sense of honourand i am much mistaken if you will not owe much to him accept them both and make the best of them in five years hell be in parliament as likely as not in ten years hell be sir daniel thwaiteif he cares for it and in fifteen years lady anna will be supposed by everybody to have made a very happy marriage lord lovel was at this time inclined to be submissive in everything to his great adviser and was now ready to take mr daniel thwaite by the hand  he did take him by the hand as he entered the sittingroom radiant from his bath clad in a short brightcoloured dressinggown such as young men then wore o mornings with embroidered slippers on his feet and a smile on his face i have heard much of you mr thwaite he said and am glad to meet you at last pray sit down i hope you have not breakfasted  poor daniel was hardly equal to the occasion the young lord had been to him always an enemyan enemy because the lord had been the adversary of the countess and her daughter an enemy because the lord was an earl and idle an enemy because the lord was his rival though he now was nearly sure that this last ground of enmity was at an end and though he had come to the earl for certain purposes of his own he could not bring himself to feel that there should be good fellowship between them he took the hand that was offered to him but took it awkwardly and sat down as he was bidden thank your lordship but i breakfasted long since if it will suit you i will walk about and call again  not at all i can eat and you can talk to me take a cup of tea at any rate the earl rang for another teacup and began to butter his toast  i believe your lordship knows that i have long been engaged to marry your lordships cousinlady anna lovel  indeed i have been told so  by herself  wellyes by herself  i have been allowed to see her but once during the last eight or nine months  that has not been my fault mr thwaite  i want you to understand my lord that it is not for her money that i have sought her  i have not accused you surely  but i have been accused i am going to see her nowif i can get admittance to her i shall press her to fix a day for our marriage and if she will do so i shall leave no stone unturned to accomplish it she has a right to do with herself as she pleases and no consideration shall stop me but her wishes  i shall not interfere  i am glad of that my lord  but i will not answer for her mother you cannot be surprised mr thwaite that lady lovel should be averse to such a marriage  she was not averse to my fathers company nor to mine a few years sinceno nor twelve months since but i say nothing about that let her be averse we cannot help it i have come to you to say that i hope something may be done about the money before she becomes my wife people say that you should have it  who says so  i cannot say whoperhaps everybody should every shilling of it be yours i should marry her as willingly tomorrow they have given me what is my own and that is enough for me for what is now hers and perhaps should be yours i will not interfere with it when she is my wife i will guard for her and for those who may come after her what belongs to her then but as to what may be done before that i care nothing  on hearing this the earl told him the whole story of the arrangement which was then in progresshow the property would in fact be divided into three parts of which the countess would have one he one and lady anna one there will be enough for us all said the earl  and much more than enough for me said daniel as he got up to take his leave and now i am going to keppel street  you have all my good wishes said the earl the two men again shook handsagain the lord was radiant and good humouredand again the tailor was ashamed and almost sullen he knew that the young nobleman had behaved well to him and it was a disappointment to him that any nobleman should behave well  nevertheless as he walked away slowly towards keppel streetfor the time still hung on his handshe began to feel that the great prize of prizes was coming nearer within his grasp     chapter xlii  daniel thwaite comes to keppel street   even the bluestones were now convinced that lady anna lovel must be allowed to marry the keswick tailor and that it would be expedient that no further impediment should be thrown in her way mrs bluestone had been told while walking to keppel street with the young lady of the purport of the letter and of the invitation given to daniel thwaite the serjeant at once declared that the girl must have her own wayand the solicitorgeneral who also heard of it expressed himself very strongly it was absurd to oppose her she was her own mistress she had shown herself competent to manage her own affairs the countess must be made to understand that she had better yield at once with what best grace she could then it was that he made that prophecy to the earl as to the future success of the fortunate tailor and then too he wrote at great length to the countess urging many reasons why her daughter should be allowed to receive mr daniel thwaite your ladyship has succeeded in very much wrote the solicitorgeneral and even in respect of this marriage you will have the satisfaction of feeling that the man is in every way respectable and wellbehaved i hear that he is an educated man with culture much higher than is generally found in the state of life which he has till lately filled and that he is a man of high feeling and noble purpose the manner in which he has been persistent in his attachment to your daughter is in itself evidence of this and i think that your ladyship is bound to remember that the sphere of life in which he has hitherto been a labourer would not have been so humble in its nature had not the means which should have started him in the world been applied to support and succour your own cause i am well aware of your feelings of warm gratitude to the father but i think you should bear in mind on the sons behalf that he has been what he has been because his father was so staunch a friend to your ladyship there was very much more of it all expressing the opinion of sir william that the countess should at once open her doors to daniel thwaite  the reader need hardly be told that this was wormwood to the countess it did not in the least touch her heart and had but little effect on her purpose gratitudeyes but if the whole result of the exertion for which the receiver is bound to be grateful is to be neutralised by the greed of the conferrer of the favourif all is to be taken that has been given and much more alsowhat ground will there be left for gratitude if i save a mans purse from a thief and then demand for my work twice what that purse contained the man had better have been left with the robbers but she was told not only that she ought to accept the tailor as a soninlaw but also that she could not help herself they should see whether she could not help herself they should be made to acknowledge that she at any rate was in earnest in her endeavours to preserve pure and unspotted the honour of the family  but what should she do that she should put on a gala dress and a smiling face and be carried off to church with a troop of lawyers and their wives to see her daughter become the bride of a low journeyman was of course out of the question by no act by no word by no sign would she give aught of a mothers authority to nuptials so disgraceful should her daughter become lady anna thwaite they two mother and daughter would never see each other again of so much at any rate she was sure but could she be sure of nothing beyond that she could at any rate make an effort  then there came upon her a mad ideaan idea which was itself evidence of insanityof the glory which would be hers if by any means she could prevent the marriage there would be a halo round her name were she to perish in such a cause let the destruction come upon her in what form it might she sat for hours meditatingand at every pause in her thoughts she assured herself that she could still make an effort  she received sir williams letter late on the tuesdayand during that night she did not lie down or once fall asleep the man as she knew had been told to come at one on that day and she had been prepared but he did not come and she then thought that the letter which had been addressed to his late residence had failed to reach him during the night she wrote a very long answer to sir william pleading her own cause expatiating on her own feelings and palliating any desperate deed which she might be tempted to perform but when the letter had been copied and folded and duly sealed with the lovel arms she locked it in her desk and did not send it on its way even on the following morning when the morning came shortly after eight oclock mrs richards brought up the message which daniel had left at the door be we to let him in my lady said mrs richards with supplicating hands upraised her sympathies were all with lady anna but she feared the countess and did not dare in such a matter to act without the mothers sanction the countess begged the woman to come to her in an hour for further instructions and at the time named mrs richards full of the importance of her work divided between terror and pleasurable excitement again toddled upstairs be we to let him in my lady god he knows its hard upon the likes of me who for the last three months doesnt know whether im on my head or heels the countess very quietly requested that when mr thwaite should call he might be shown into the parlour  i will see mr thwaite myself mrs richards but it will be better that my daughter should not be disturbed by any intimation of his coming  then there was a consultation below stairs as to what should be done there had been many such consultations but they had all ended in favour of the countess mrs richards from fear and the ladysmaid from favour were disposed to assist the elder lady poor lady anna throughout had been forced to fight her battles with no friend near her now she had many friendsmany who were anxious to support her even the bluestones who had been so hard upon her while she was along with thembut they who were now her friends were never near her to assist her with a word  so it came to pass that when daniel thwaite called at the house exactly at one oclock lady anna was not expecting him on the previous day at that hour she had sat waiting with anxious ears for the knock at the door which might announce his coming but she had waited in vain from one to twoeven till seven in the evening she had waited but he had not come and she had feared that some scheme had been used against her the people at the post office had been bribedor the women in wyndham street had been false but she would not be hindered she would go out alone and find himif he were to be found in london  when he did come she was not thinking of his coming he was shown into the diningroom and within a minute afterwards the countess entered with stately step she was well dressed even to the adjustment of her hair and she was a woman so changed that he would hardly have known her as that dear and valued friend whose slightest word used to be a law to his fatherbut who in those days never seemed to waste a thought upon her attire she had been out that morning walking through the streets and the blood had mounted to her cheeks he acknowledged to himself that she looked like a noble and highborn dame there was a fire in her eye and a look of scorn about her mouth and nostrils which had even for him a certain fascinationodious to him as were the pretensions of the socalled great she was the first to speak you have called to see my daughter she said  yes lady loveli have  you cannot see her  i came at her request  i know you did but you cannot see her you can be hardly so ignorant of the ways of the world mr thwaite as to suppose that a young lady can receive what visitors she pleases without the sanction of her guardians  lady anna lovel has no guardian my lady she is of age and is at present her own guardian  i am her mother and shall exercise the authority of a mother over her you cannot see her you had better go  i shall not be stopped in this way lady lovel  do you mean that you will force your way up to her to do so you will have to trample over meand there are constables in the street you cannot see her you had better go  is she a prisoner  that is between her and me and is no affair of yours you are intruding here mr thwaite and cannot possibly gain anything by your intrusion then she strode out in the passage and motioned him to the front door mr thwaite i will beg you to leave this house which for the present is mine if you have any proper feeling you will not stay after i have told you that you are not welcome  but lady anna though she had not expected the coming of her lover had heard the sound of voices and then became aware that the man was below as her mother was speaking she rushed downstairs and threw herself into her lovers arms it shall never be so in my presence said the countess trying to drag the girl from his embrace by the shoulders  annamy own anna said daniel in an ecstacy of bliss it was not only that his sweetheart was his own but that her spirit was so high  daniel she said still struggling in his arms  by this time they were all in the parlour whither the countess had been satisfied to retreat to escape the eyes of the women who clustered at the top of the kitchen stairs daniel thwaite said the countess if you do not leave this the blood which will be shed shall rest on your head and so saying she drew nigh to the window and pulled down the blind she then crossed over and did the same to the other blind and having done so took her place close to a heavy upright desk which stood between the fireplace and the window when the two ladies first came to the house they had occupied only the first and second floorsbut since the success of their cause the whole had been taken including the parlour in which this scene was being acted and the countess spent many hours daily sitting at the heavy desk in this dark gloomy chamber  whose blood shall be shed said lady anna turning to her mother  it is the raving of madness said daniel  whether it be madness or not you shall find sir that it is true take your hands from her would you disgrace the child in the presence of her mother  there is no disgrace mamma he is my own and i am his why should you try to part us  but now they were parted he was not a man to linger much over the sweetness of a caress when sterner work was in his hands to be done lady lovel he said you must see that this opposition is fruitless ask your cousin lord lovel and he will tell you that it is so  i care nothing for my cousin if he be false i am true though all the world be false still will i be true i do not ask her to marry her cousin i simply demand that she shall relinquish one who is infinitely beneath herwho is unfit to tie her very shoestring  he is my equal in all things said lady anna and he shall be my lord and husband  i know of no inequalities such as those you speak of lady lovel said the tailor the excellence of your daughters merits i admit and am almost disposed to claim some goodness for myself finding that one so good can love me but lady lovel i do not wish to remain here now you are disturbed  i am disturbed and you had better go  i will go at once if you will let me name some early day on which i may be allowed to meet lady annaalone and i tell her here that if she be not permitted so to see me it will be her duty to leave her mothers house and come to me there is my address dear then he handed to her a paper on which he had written the name of the street and number at which he was now living you are free to come and go as you list and if you will send to me there i will find you here or elsewhere as you may command me it is but a short five minutes walk beyond the house at which you were staying in bedford square  the countess stood silent for a moment or two looking at them during which neither the girl spoke nor her lover you will not even allow her six months to think of it said the countess i will allow her six years if she says that she requires time to think of it  i do not want an hournot a minute said lady anna  the mother flashed round upon her daughter poor vain degraded wretch she said  she is a true woman honest to the hearts core said the lover  you shall come tomorrow said the countess do you hear me annahe shall come tomorrow there shall be an end of this in some way and i am brokenhearted my life is over for me and i may as well lay me down and die i hope god in his mercy may never send upon another womanupon another wife or another mothertrouble such as that with which i have been afflicted but i tell you this anna that what evil a husband can doeven let him be evilminded as was your fatheris nothingnothingnothing to the cruelty of a cruel child go now mr thwaite if you please if you will return at the same hour tomorrow she shall speak with youalone and then she must do as she pleases  anna i will come again tomorrow said the tailor but lady anna did not answer him she did not speak but stayed looking at him till he was gone  tomorrow shall end it all i can stand this no longer i have prayed to youa mother to her daughter i have prayed to you for mercy and you will show me none i have knelt to you  mamma  i will kneel again if it may avail and the countess did kneel will you not spare me  get up mamma get up what am i doingwhat have i done that you should speak to me like this  i ask you from my very soullest i commit some terrible crime i have sworn that i would not see this marriageand i will not see it  if he will consent i will delay it said the girl trembling  must i beg to him then must i kneel to him must i ask him to save me from the wrath to come no my child i will not do that if it must come let it come when you were a little thing at my knees the gentlest babe that ever mother kissed i did not think that you would live to be so hard to me you have your mothers brow my child but you have your fathers heart  i will ask him to delay it said anna  noif it be to come to that i will have no dealings with you what that hehe who has come between me and all my peace he who with his pretended friendship has robbed me of my all that he is to be asked to grant me a few weeks delay before this pollution comes upon meduring which the whole world will know that lady anna lovel is to be the tailors wife leave me when he comes tomorrow you shall be sent forbut i will see him first leave me now i would be alone  lady anna made an attempt to take her mothers hand but the countess repulsed her rudely oh mamma  we must be bitter enemies or loving friends my child as it is we are bitter enemies yes the bitterest leave me now there is no room for further words between us then lady anna slunk up to her own room     chapter xliii  daniel thwaite comes again   the countess lovel had prepared herself on that morning for the doing of a deed but her heart had failed her how she might have carried herself through it had not her daughter came down to themhow far she might have been able to persevere cannot be said now but it was certain that she had so far relented that even while the hated man was there in her presence she determined that she would once again submit herself to make entreaties to her child once again to speak of all that she had endured and to pray at least for delay if nothing else could be accorded to her if her girl would but promise to remain with her for six months then they might go abroadand the chances afforded them by time and distance would be before her in that case she would lavish such love upon the girl so many indulgences such sweets of wealth and ease such store of caresses and soft luxury that surely the young heart might thus be turned to the things which were fit for rank and high blood and splendid possessions it could not be but that her own childthe child who a few months since had been as gentle with her and as obedient as an infantshould give way to her as far as that she tried it and her daughter had referred her prayeror had said that she would refer itto the decision of her hated lover and the mother had at once lost all command of her temper she had become fiercenay ferocious and had lacked the guile and the selfcommand necessary to carry out her purpose had she persevered lady anna must have granted her the small boon that she then asked but she had given way to her wrath and had declared that her daughter was her bitterest enemy as she seated herself at the old desk where lady anna left her she swore within her own bosom that the deed must be done  even at the moment when she was resolving that she would kneel once more at her daughters knees she prepared herself for the work that she must do should the daughter still be as hard as stone to her come again at one tomorrow she said to the tailor and the tailor said that he would come  when she was alone she seated herself on her accustomed chair and opened the old desk with a key that had now become familiar to her hand it was a huge piece of furnituresuch as is never made in these days but is found among every congregation of old household goodswith numberless drawers clustering below with a vast body full of receptacles for bills wills deeds and wastepaper and a tower of shelves above ascending almost to the ceiling in the centre of the centre body was a square compartment but this had been left unlocked so that its contents might be ready to her hand now she opened it and took from it a pistol and looking warily over her shoulder to see that the door was closed and cautiously up at the windows lest some eye might be spying her action even through the thick blinds she took the weapon in her hand and held it up so that she might feel if possible how it would be with her when she should attempt the deed she looked very narrowly at the lock of which the trigger was already back at its place so that no exertion of arrangement might be necessary for her at the fatal moment never as yet had she fired a pistolnever before had she held such a weapon in her handbut she thought that she could do it when her passion ran high  then for the twentieth time she asked herself whether it would not be easier to turn it against her own bosomagainst her own brain so that all might be over at once ah yesso much easier but how then would it be with this man who had driven her by his subtle courage and persistent audacity to utter destruction could he and she be made to go down together in that boat which her fancy had built for them then indeed it might be well that she should seek her own death but were she now to destroy herselfherself and only herselfthen would her enemy be left to enjoy his rich prize a prize only the richer because she would have disappeared from the world and of her if such had been her last deed men would only say that the mad countess had gone on in her madness with looks of sad solemnity but heartfelt satisfaction all the lovels and that wretched tailor and her own daughter would bestow some mock grief on her funeral and there would be an end for ever of josephine countess loveland no one would remember her or her deeds or her sufferings when she wandered out from the house on that morning after hearing that daniel thwaite would be there at one and had walked nearly into the mid city so that she might not be watched and had bought her pistol and powder and bullets and had then with patience gone to work and taught herself how to prepare the weapon for use she certainly had not intended simply to make the triumph of her enemy more easy  and yet she knew well what was the penalty of murder and she knew also that there could be no chance of escape very often had she turned it in her mind whether she could not destroy the man so that the hand of the destroyer might be hidden but it could not be so she could not dog him in the streets she could not get at him in his meals to poison him she could not creep to his bedside and strangle him in the silent watches of the night and this womans heart even while from day to day she was meditating murderwhile she was telling herself that it would be a worthy deed to cut off from life one whose life was a bar to her own successeven then revolted from the shrinking stealthy step from the low cowardice of the hidden murderer to look him in the face and then to slay himwhen no escape for herself would be possible that would have in it something that was almost noble something at any rate boldsomething that would not shame her they would hang her for such a deed let them do so it was not hanging that she feared but the tongues of those who should speak of her when she was gone they should not speak of her as one who had utterly failed they should tell of a woman who cruelly misused throughout her life maligned scorned and tortured robbed of her own neglected by her kindred deserted and damned by her husband had still struggled through it all till she had proved herself to be that which it was her right to call herselfof a woman who though thwarted in her ambition by her own child and cheated of her triumph at the very moment of her success had dared rather to face an ignominious death than see all her efforts frustrated by the maudlin fancy of a girl yes she would face it all let them do what they would with her she hardly knew what might be the mode of death adjudged to a countess who had murdered let them kill her as they would they would kill a countessand the whole world would know her story  that day and night were very dreadful to her she never asked a question about her daughter they had brought her food to her in that lonely parlour and she hardly heeded them as they laid the things before her and then removed them again and again did she unlock the old desk and see that the weapon was ready to her hand then she opened that letter to sir william patterson and added a postscript to it what i have since done will explain everything that was all she added and on the following morning about noon she put the letter on the mantelshelf late at night she took herself to bed and was surprised to find that she slept the key of the old desk was under her pillow and she placed her hand on it the moment that she awoke on leaving her own room she stood for a moment at her daughters door it might be if she killed the man that she would never see her child again at that moment she was tempted to rush into her daughters room to throw herself upon her daughters bed and once again to beg for mercy and grace she listened and she knew that her daughter slept then she went silently down to the dark room and the old desk of what use would it be to abase herself her daughter was the only thing that she could love but her daughters heart was filled with the image of that lowborn artisan  is lady anna up she asked the maid about ten oclock  yes my lady she is breakfasting now  tell her that whenwhen mr thwaite comes i will send for her as soon as i wish to see her  i think lady anna understands that already my lady  tell her what i say  yes my lady i will my lady then the countess spoke no further word till punctually at one oclock daniel thwaite was shown into the room you keep your time mr thwaite she said  working men should always do that lady lovel he replied as though anxious to irritate her by reminding her how humble was the man who could aspire to be the soninlaw of a countess  all men should do so i presume i also am punctual well sirhave you anything else to say  much to sayto your daughter lady lovel  i do not know that you will ever see my daughter again  do you mean to say that she has been taken away from this the countess was silent but moved away from the spot on which she stood to receive him towards the old desk which stood openwith the door of the centre space just ajar if it be so you have deceived me most grossly lady lovel but it can avail you nothing for i know that she will be true to me do you tell me that she has been removed  i have told you no such thing  bid her come thenas you promised me  i have a word to say to you first what if she should refuse to come  i do not believe that she will refuse you yourself heard what she said yesterday all earth and all heaven should not make me doubt her and certainly not your word lady lovel you know how it is and you know how it must be  yesi do i do i do she was facing him with her back to the window and she put forth her left hand upon the open desk and thrust it forward as though to open the square door which stood ajarbut he did not notice her hand he had his eye fixed upon her and suspected only deceitnot violence yes i know how it must be she said while her fingers approached nearer to the little door  then let her come to me  will nothing turn you from it  nothing will turn me from it  then suddenly she withdrew her hand and confronted him more closely mine has been a hard life mr thwaiteno life could have been harder but i have always had something before me for which to long and for which to hopesomething which i might reach if justice should at length prevail  you have got money and rank  they are nothingnothing in all those many years the thing that i have looked for has been the splendour and glory of another and the satisfaction i might feel in having bestowed upon her all that she owned do you think that i will stand by after such a struggle and see you rob me of it allyouyou who were one of the tools which came to my hand to work with from what you know of me do you think that my spirit could stoop so low answer me if you have ever thought of that let the eagles alone and do not force yourself into our nest you will find if you do that you will be rent to pieces  this is nothing lady lovel i came hereat your bidding to see your daughter let me see her  you will not go  certainly i will not go  she looked at him as she slowly receded to her former standingground but he never for a moment suspected the nature of her purpose he began to think that some actual insanity had befallen her and was doubtful how he should act but no fear of personal violence affected him he was merely questioning with himself whether it would not be well for him to walk upstairs into the upper room and seek lady anna there as he stood watching the motion of her eyes  you had better go said she as she again put her left hand on the flat board of the open desk  you trifle with me lady lovel he answered as you will not allow lady anna to come to me here i will go to her elsewhere i do not doubt but that i shall find her in the house then he turned to the door intending to leave the room he had been very near to her while they were talking so that he had some paces to traverse before he could put his hand upon the lockbut in doing so his back was turned on her in one respect it was better for her purpose that it should be so she could open the door of the compartment and put her hand upon the pistol without having his eye upon her but as it seemed to her at the moment the chance of bringing her purpose to its intended conclusion was less than it would have been had she been able to fire at his face she had let the moment go bythe first momentwhen he was close to her and now there would be half the room between them but she was very quick she seized the pistol and transferring it to her right hand she rushed after him and when the door was already half open she pulled the trigger in the agony of that moment she heard no sound though she saw the flash she saw him shrink and pass the door which he left unclosed and then she heard a scuffle in the passage as though he had fallen against the wall she had provided herself especially with a second barrelbut that was now absolutely useless to her there was no power left to her wherewith to follow him and complete the work which she had begun she did not think that she had killed him though she was sure that he was struck she did not believe that she had accomplished anything of her wishesbut had she held in her hand a sixbarrelled revolver as of the present day she could have done no more with it she was overwhelmed with so great a tremor at her own violence that she was almost incapable of moving she stood glaring at the door listening for what should come and the moments seemed to be hours but she heard no sound whatever a minute passed away perhaps and the man did not move she looked around as if seeking some way of escapeas though were it possible she would get to the street through the window there was no mode of escape unless she would pass out through the door to the man who as she knew must still be there then she heard him move she heard him risefrom what posture she knew not and step towards the stairs she was still standing with the pistol in her hand but was almost unconscious that she held it at last her eye glanced upon it and she was aware that she was still armed should she rush after him and try what she could do with that other bullet the thought crossed her mind but she knew that she could do nothing had all the lovels depended upon it she could not have drawn that other trigger she took the pistol put it back into its former hidingplace mechanically locked the little door and then seated herself in her chair     chapter xliv  the attempt and not the deed confounds us   the tailors hand was on the lock of the door when he first saw the flash of the fire and then felt that he was wounded though his back was turned to the woman he distinctly saw the flash but he never could remember that he had heard the report he knew nothing of the nature of the injury he had received and was hardly aware of the place in which he had been struck when he half closed the door behind him and then staggered against the opposite wall for a moment he was sick almost to fainting but yet he did not believe that he had been grievously hurt he was however disabled weak and almost incapable of any action he seated himself on the lowest stair and began to think the woman had intended to murder him she had lured him there with the premeditated intention of destroying him and this was the mother of his bridethe woman whom he intended to call his motherinlaw he was not dead nor did he believe that he was like to die but had she killed himwhat must have been the fate of the murderess as it was would it not be necessary that she should be handed over to the law and dealt with for the offence he did not know that they might not even hang her for the attempt  he said afterwards that he thought that he sat there for a quarter of an hour three minutes however had not passed before mrs richards ascending from the kitchen found him upon the stairs what is it mr thwaite said she  is anything the matter he asked with a faint smile  the place is full of smoke she said and there is a smell of gunpowder  there is no harm done at any rate he answered  i thought i heard a something go off said sarah who was behind mrs richards  did you said he i heard nothing but there certainly is a smoke and he still smiled  what are you sitting there for mr thwaite asked mrs richards  you aint no business to sit there mr thwaite said sarah  youve been and done something to the countess said mrs richards  the countess is all right im going upstairs to see lady annathats all but ive hurt myself a little im bad in my left shoulder and i sat down just to get a rest as he spoke he was still smiling  then the woman looked at him and saw that he was very pale at that instant he was in great pain though he felt that as the sense of intense sickness was leaving him he would be able to go upstairs and say a word or two to his sweetheart should he find her you aint just as you ought to be mr thwaite said mrs richards he was very haggard and perspiration was on his brow and she thought that he had been drinking  i am well enough said he risingonly that i am much troubled by a hurt in my arm at any rate i will go upstairs then he mounted slowly leaving the two women standing in the passage  mrs richards gently opened the parlour door and entered the room which was still reeking with smoke and the smell of the powder and there she found the countess seated at the old desk but with her body and face turned round towards the door is anything the matter my lady asked the woman  where has he gone  mr thwaite has just stepped upstairsthis moment he was very queer like my lady  is he hurt  we think hes been drinking my lady said sarah  he says that his shoulder is ever so bad said mrs richards  then for the first time it occurred to the countess that perhaps the deed which she had donethe attempt in which she had failedmight never be known instinctively she had hidden the pistol and had locked the little door and concealed the key within her bosom as soon as she was alone then she thought that she would open the window but she had been afraid to move and she had sat there waiting while she heard the sound of voices in the passage ohhis shoulder said she nohe has not been drinking he never drinks he has been very violent but he never drinks wellwhy do you wait  there is such a smell of something said mrs richards  yesyou had better open the windows there was an accident thank youthat will do  and is he to be alonewith lady anna upstairs asked the maid  he is to be alone with her how can i help it if she chooses to be a scullion she must follow her bent i have done all i could why do you wait i tell you that he is to be with her go away and leave me then they went and left her wondering much but guessing nothing of the truth she watched them till they had closed the door and then instantly opened the other window wide it was now may but the weather was still cold there had been rain the night before and it had been showery all the morning she had come in from her walk damp and chilled and there was a fire in the grate but she cared nothing for the weather looking round the room she saw a morsel of wadding near the floor and she instantly burned it she longed to look at the pistol but she did not dare to take it from its hidingplace lest she should be discovered in the act every energy of her mind was now strained to the effort of avoiding detection should he choose to tell what had been done then indeed all would be over but had he not resolved to be silent he would hardly have borne the agony of the wound and gone upstairs without speaking of it she almost forgot now the misery of the last year in the intensity of her desire to escape the disgrace of punishment a sudden nervousness a desire to do something by which she might help to preserve herself seized upon her but there was nothing which she could do she could not follow him lest he should accuse her to her face it would be vain for her to leave the house till he should have gone should she do so she knew that she would not dare return to it so she sat thinking dreaming plotting crushed by an agony of fear looking anxiously at the door listening for every footfall within the house and she watched too for the wellknown click of the area gate dreading lest any one should go out to seek the intervention of the constables  in the meantime daniel thwaite had gone upstairs and had knocked at the drawingroom door it was instantly opened by lady anna herself i heard you comewhat a time you have been herei thought that i should never see you as she spoke she stood close to him that he might embrace her but the pain of his wound affected his whole body and he felt that he could hardly raise even his right arm he was aware now that the bullet had entered his back somewhere on his left shoulder oh danielare you ill she said looking at him  yes deari am illnot very ill did you hear nothing  no  nor yet see anything  no  i will tell you all another timeonly do not ask me now she had seated herself beside him and wound her arm round his back as though to support him you must not touch me dearest  you have been hurt  yesi have been hurt i am in pain though i do not think that it signifies i had better go to a surgeon and then you shall hear from me  tell me danielwhat is it daniel  i will tell youbut not now you shall know all but i should do harm were i to say it now say not a word to any one sweetheartunless your mother ask you  what shall i tell her  that i am hurtbut not seriously hurtand that the less said the sooner mended tell her also that i shall expect no further interruption to my letters when i write to youor to my visits when i can come god bless you dearestone kiss and now i will go  you will send for me if you are ill daniel  if i am really ill i will send for you so saying he left her went downstairs with great difficulty opened for himself the front door and departed  lady anna though she had been told nothing of what had happened except that her lover was hurt at once surmised something of what had been done daniel thwaite had suffered some hurt from her mothers wrath she sat for a while thinking what it might have been she had seen no sign of blood could it be that her mother had struck him in her anger with some chance weapon that had come to hand that there had been violence she was sureand sure also that her mother had been in fault when daniel had been some few minutes gone she went down that she might deliver his message at the foot of the stairs and near the door of the parlour she met mrs richards i suppose the young man has gone my lady asked the woman  mr thwaite has gone  and i make so bold my lady as to say that he ought not to come here there has been a doing of some kind but i dont know what he says as how hes been hurt and im sure i dont know how he should be hurt hereunless he brought it with him i never had nothing of the kind here before long as ive been here of course your title and that is all right my lady but the young man isnt fitthats the truth of it my belief is hed been a drinking and i wont have it in my house  lady anna passed by her without a word and went into her mothers room the countess was still seated in her chair and neither rose nor spoke when her daughter entered mamma mr thwaite is hurt  wellwhat of it is it much that ails him  he is in pain what has been done mamma the countess looked at her striving to learn from the girls face and manner what had been told and what concealed did youstrike him  has he said that i struck him  no mammabut something has been done that should not have been done i know it he has sent you a message mamma  what was it asked the countess in a hoarse voice  that he was hurt but not seriously  ohhe said that  i fear he is hurt seriously  but he said that he was not  yesand that the less said the sooner mended  did he say that too  that was his message  the countess gave a long sigh then sobbed and at last broke out into hysteric tears it was evident to her now that the man was sparing herwas endeavouring to spare her he had told no one as yet the least said the soonest mended oh yesif he would say never a word to any one of what had occurred between them that day that would be best for her but how could he not tell when some doctor should ask him how he had come by that wound surely he would tell then it could not be possible that such a deed should have been done there in that little room and that no one should know it and why should he not tellhe who was her enemy had she caught him at advantage would she not have smote him hip and thigh and then she reflected what it would be to owe perhaps her life to the mercy of daniel thwaiteto the mercy of her enemy of him who knewif no one else should knowthat she had attempted to murder him it would be better for her should she be spared to do so to go away to some distant land where she might hide her head for ever  may i go to him mamma to see him lady anna asked the countess full of her own thoughts sat silent answering not a word i know where he lives mamma and i fear that he is much hurt  he will notdie muttered the countess  god forbid that he should diebut i will go to him then she returned upstairs without a word of opposition from her mother put on her bonnet and sallied forth no one stopped her or said a word to her now and she seemed to herself to be as free as air she walked up to the corner of gower street and turned down into bedford square passing the house of the serjeant then she asked her way into great russell street which she found to be hardly more than a stones throw from the serjeants door and soon found the number at which her lover lived nomr thwaite was not at home yesshe might wait for himbut he had no room but his bedroom then she became very bold i am engaged to be his wife she said are you the lady anna asked the woman who had heard the story then she was received with great distinction and invited to sit down in a parlour on the groundfloor there she sat for three hours motionless alonewaitingwaitingwaiting when it was quite dark at about six oclock daniel thwaite entered the room with his left arm bound up my girl he said with so much joy in his tone that she could not but rejoice to hear him so you have found me out and have come to me  yes i have come tell me what it is i know that you are hurt  i have been hurt certainly the doctor wanted me to go into a hospital but i trust that i may escape that but i must take care of myself i had to come back here in a coach because the man told me not to walk  how was it daniel oh daniel you will tell me everything  then she sat beside him as he lay upon the couch and listened to him while he told her the whole story he hid nothing from her but as he went on he made her understand that it was his intention to conceal the whole deed to say nothing of it so that the perpetrator should escape punishment if it might be possible she listened in awestruck silence as she heard the tale of her mothers guilt and he with wonderful skill with hearty love for the girl and in true mercy to her feelings palliated the crime of the wouldbe murderess she was beside herself with grief and emotion he said and has hardly surprised me by what she has done had i thought of it i should almost have expected it  she may do it again daniel  i think not she will be cowed now and quieter she did not interfere when you told her that you were coming to me it will be a lesson to her and so it may be good for us then he bade her to tell her mother that he as far as he was concerned would hold his peace if she would forget all past injuries so would he if she would hold out her hand to him he would take it if she could not bring herself to thiscould not bring herself as yetthen let her go apart no notice should be taken of what she had done but she must not again stand between us he said  nothing shall stand between us said lady anna  then he told her laughing as he did so how hard it had been for him to keep the story of his wound secret from the doctor who had already extracted the ball and who was to visit him on the morrow the practitioner to whom he had gone knowing nothing of gunshot wounds had taken him to a firstclass surgeon and the surgeon had of course asked as to the cause of the wound daniel had said that it was an accident as to which he could not explain the cause you mean you will not tell said the surgeon exactly so i will not tell it is my secret that i did not do it myself you may judge from the spot in which i was shot to this the surgeon assented and though he pressed the question and said something as to the necessity for an investigation he could get no satisfaction however he had learned daniels name and address he was to call on the morrow and would then perhaps succeed in learning something of the mystery in the meantime my darling i must go to bed for it seems as though every bone in my body was sore i have brought an old woman with me who is to look after me  then she left him promising that she would come on the morrow and would nurse him unless they lock me up i will be here she said daniel thwaite thought that in the present circumstances no further attempt would be made to constrain her actions     chapter xlv  the lawyers agree   when a month had passed by a great many people knew how mr daniel thwaite had come by the wound in his back but nobody knew it officially there is a wide difference in the qualities of knowledge regarding such matters in affairs of public interest we often know or fancy that we know down to every exact detail how a thing has been donewho have given the bribes and who have taken themwho has told the lie and who has pretended to believe itwho has peculated and how the public purse has sufferedwho was in love with such a ones wife and how the matter was detected then smothered up and condoned but there is no official knowledge and nothing can be done the tailor and the earl the countess and her daughter had become public property since the great trial had been commenced and many eyes were on them before a week had gone by it was known in every club and in every great drawingroom that the tailor had been shot in the shoulderand it was almost known that the pistol had been fired by the hands of the countess the very eminent surgeon into whose hands daniel had luckily fallen did not press his questions very far when his patient told him that it would be for the welfare of many people that nothing further should be asked on the matter an accident has occurred said daniel as to which i do not intend to say anything further i can assure you that no injury has been done beyond that which i suffer the eminent surgeon no doubt spoke of the matter among his friends but he always declared that he had no certain knowledge as to the hand which fired the pistol  the women in keppel street of course talked there had certainly been a smoke and a smell of gunpowder mrs richards had heard nothing sarah thought that she had heard a noise they both were sure that daniel thwaite had been much the worse for drinka statement which led to considerable confusion no pistol was ever seenthough the weapon remained in the old desk for some days and was at last conveyed out of the house when the countess left it with all her belongings she had been afraid to hide it more stealthily or even throw it away lest her doing so should be discovered had the law interferedhad any searchwarrant been grantedthe pistol would of course have been found as it was no one asked the countess a question on the subject the lawyers who had been her friends and had endeavoured to guide her through her difficulties became afraid of her and kept aloof from her they had all gone over to the opinion that lady anna should be allowed to marry the tailor and had on that account become her enemies she was completely isolated and was now spoken of mysteriouslyas a woman who had suffered much and was nearly mad with grief as a violent determined dangerous being who was interesting as a subject for conversation but one not at all desirable as an acquaintance during the whole of this month the countess remained in keppel street and was hardly ever seen by any but the inmates of that house  lady anna had returned home all alone on the evening of the day on which the deed had been done after leaving her lover in the hands of the old nurse with whose services he had been furnished the rain was still falling as she came through russell square the distance was indeed short but she was wet and cold and draggled when she returned and the criminality of the deed which her mother had committed had come fully home to her mind during the short journey the door was opened to her by mrs richards and she at once asked for the countess lady anna where have you been asked mrs richards who was learning to take upon herself during these troubles something of the privilege of finding fault but lady anna put her aside without a word and went into the parlour there sat the countess just as she had been leftexcept that a pair of candles stood upon the table and that the teathings had been laid there you are all wet she said where have you been  he has told me all the girl replied without answering the question oh mammahow could you do it  who has driven me to it it has been youyou you wellwhat else  mamma he has forgiven you  forgiven me i will not have his forgiveness  oh mammaif i forgive you will you not be friends with us she stooped over her mother and kissed her and then went on and told what she had to tell she stood and told it all in a low voice so that no ear but that of her mother should hear herhow the ball had hit him how it had been extracted how nothing had been and nothing should be told how daniel would forgive it all and be her friend if she would let him but mamma i hope you will be sorry the countess sat silent moody grim with her eyes fixed on the table she would say nothing and mammai must go to him every dayto do things for him and to help to nurse him of course he will be my husband now still the countess said not a word either of approval or of dissent lady anna sat down for a moment or two hoping that her mother would allow her to eat and drink in the room and that thus they might again begin to live together but not a word was spoken nor a motion made and the silence became awful so that the girl did not dare to keep her seat shall i go mamma she said  yesyou had better go after that they did not see each other again on that evening and during the week or ten days following they lived apart  on the following morning after an early breakfast lady anna went to great russell street and there she remained the greater part of the day the people of the house understood that the couple were to be married as soon as their lodger should be well and had heard much of the magnificence of the marriage they were kind and good and the tailor declared very often that this was the happiest period of his existence of all the good turns ever done to him he said the wound in his back had been the best as his sweetheart sat by his bedside they planned their future life they would still go to the distant land on which his heart was set though it might be only for awhile and she with playfulness declared that she would go there as mrs thwaite i suppose they cant prevent me calling myself mrs thwaite if i please  i am not so sure of that said the tailor evil burs stick fast  it would be vain now to tell of all the sweet lovers words that were spoken between them during those long hoursbut the man believed that no girl had ever been so true to her lover through so many difficulties as lady anna had been to him and she was sure that she had never varied in her wish to become the wife of the man who had first asked her for her love she thought much and she thought often of the young lord but she took the impress of her lovers mind and learned to regard her cousin the earl as an idle pretty popinjay born to eat to drink and to carry sweet perfumes just a butterfly said the tailor  one of the brightest butterflies said the girl  a woman should not be a butterflynot altogether a butterfly he answered but for a man it is surely a contemptible part do you remember the young man who comes to hotspur on the battlefield or him whom the king sent to hamlet about the wager when i saw lord lovel at his breakfast table i thought of them i said to myself that spermaceti was the sovereignest thing on earth for an inward wound and i told myself that he was of very soft society and great showing she smiled though she did not know the words he quoted and assured him that her poor cousin lord lovel would not trouble him much in the days that were to come he will not trouble me at all but as he is your cousin i would fain that he could be a man he had a sort of gown on which would have made a grand frock for you sweetheartonly too smart i fear for my wife she laughed and was pleasedand remembered without a shade either of regret or remorse the manner in which the popinjay had helped her over the steppingstones at bolton abbey  but the tailor though he thus scorned the lord was quite willing that a share of the property should be given up to him unless you did how on earth could he wear such grand gowns as that i can understand that he wants it more than i do and if there are to be earls i suppose they should be rich we do not want it my girl  you will have half daniel she said  as far as that goes i do not want a doit of itnot a pennypiece when they paid me what became my own by my fathers will i was rich enoughrich enough for you and me too my girl if that was all but it is better that it should be divided if he had it all he would buy too many gowns and it may be that with us some good will come of it as far as i can see no good comes of money spent on racecourses and in gorgeous gowns  this went on from day to day throughout a month and every day lady anna took her place with her lover after a while her mother came up into the drawingroom in keppel street and then the two ladies again lived together little or nothing however was said between them as to their future lives the countess was quiet sullenand to a bystander would have appeared to be indifferent she had been utterly vanquished by the awe inspired by her own deed and by the fear which had lasted for some days that she might be dragged to trial for the offence as that dread subsided she was unable to recover her former spirits she spoke no more of what she had done and what she had suffered but seemed to submit to the inevitable she said nothing of any future life that might be in store for her and as far as her daughter could perceive had no plans formed for the coming time at last lady anna found it necessary to speak of her own plans mamma she said mr thwaite wishes that banns should be read in church for our marriage  banns exclaimed the countess  yes mamma he thinks it best the countess made no further observation if the thing was to be it mattered little to her whether they were to be married by banns or by licencewhether her girl should walk down to church like a maidservant or be married with all the pomp and magnificence to which her rank and wealth might entitle her how could there be splendour how even decency in such a marriage as this she at any rate would not be present let them be married in what way they would on the fourth sunday after the shot had been fired the banns were read for the first time in bloomsbury church and the future bride was described as anna lovelcommonly called lady anna lovelspinster neither on that occasion or on either of the two further callings did any one get up in church to declare that impediment existed why daniel thwaite the tailor and lady anna lovel should not be joined together in holy matrimony  in the mean time the lawyers had been at work dividing the property and in the process of doing so it had been necessary that mr goffe should have various interviews with the countess she also as the undisputed widow of the late intestate earl was now a very rich woman with an immense income at her control but no one wanted assistance from her there was her revenue and she was doomed to live apart with it in her solitudewith no fellowcreature to rejoice with her in her triumph with no dependant whom she could make happy with her wealth she was a woman with many faultsbut covetousness was not one of them if she could have given it all to the young earland her daughter with it she would have been a happy woman had she been permitted to dream that it was all so settled that her grandchild would become of all earl lovels the most wealthy and most splendid she would have triumphed indeed but as it was there was no spot in her future career brighter to her than those long years of suffering which she had passed in the hope that some day her child might be successful triumph indeed there was nothing before her but solitude and shame  nevertheless she listened to mr goffe and signed the papers that were put before her when however he spoke to her of what was necessary for the marriageas to the settlement which must mr goffe said be made as to the remaining moiety of her daughters propertyshe answered curtly that she knew nothing of that her daughters affairs were no concern of hers she had indeed worked hard to establish her daughters rights but her daughter was now of age and could do as she pleased with her own she would not even remain in the room while the matter was being discussed lady anna and i have separate interests she said haughtily  lady anna herself simply declared that half of her estate should be made over to her cousin and that the other half should go to her husband but the attorney was not satisfied to take instructions on a matter of such moment from one so young as to all that was to appertain to the earl the matter was settled the solicitorgeneral and serjeant bluestone had acceded to the arrangement and the countess herself had given her assent before she had utterly separated her own interests from those of her daughter in regard to so much mr goffe could go to work in conjunction with mr flick without a scruple but as to that other matter there must be consultations conferences and solemn debate the young lady no doubt might do as she pleased but lawyers can be very powerful sir william was asked for his opinion and suggested that daniel thwaite himself should be invited to attend at mr goffes chambers as soon as his wound would allow him to do so daniel who did not care for his wound so much as he should have done was with mr goffe on the following morning and heard a lengthy explanation from the attorney the solicitorgeneral had been consultedthis mr goffe said feeling that a tailor would not have a word to say against so high an authoritythe solicitorgeneral had been consulted and was of opinion that lady annas interests should be guarded with great care a very large property he might say a splendid estate was concerned mr thwaite of course understood that the family had been averse to this marriagenaturally very averse now however they were prepared to yield  the tailor interrupted the attorney at this period of his speech we dont want anybody to yield mr goffe we are going to do what we please and dont know anything about yielding  mr goffe remarked that all that might be very well but that as so large a property was at stake the friends of the lady according to all usage were bound to interfere a settlement had already been made in regard to the earl  you mean mr goffe that lady anna has given her cousin half her money  the attorney went on to say that mr thwaite might put it in that way if he pleased the deeds had already been executed with regard to the other moiety mr thwaite would no doubt not object to a trustdeed by which it should be arranged that the money should be invested in land the interest to be appropriated to the use of lady anna and the property be settled on the eldest son mr thwaite would of course have the advantage of the income during his wifes life the attorney in explaining all this made an exceedingly good legal exposition and then waited for the tailors assent  are those lady annas instructions  mr goffe replied that the proposal was made in accordance with the advice of the solicitorgeneral  ill have nothing to do with such a settlement said the tailor lady anna has given away half her money and may give away the whole if she pleases she will be the same to me whether she comes fullhanded or empty but when she is my wife her property shall be my propertyand when i die there shall be no such abomination as an eldest son mr goffe was persuasive eloquent indignant and very wise all experience all usage all justice all tradition required that there should be some such settlement as he had suggested but it was in vain i dont want my wife to have anything of her own before marriage said he but she certainly shall have nothing after marriageindependent of me for a man with sound views of domestic power and marital rights always choose a radical in this case there was no staying him the girl was all on his side and mr goffe with infinite grief was obliged to content himself with binding up a certain portion of the property to make an income for the widow should the tailor die before his wife and thus the tailors marriage received the sanction of all the lawyers  a day or two after this daniel thwaite called upon the countess it was now arranged that they should be married early in july and questions had arisen as to the manner of the ceremony who should give away the bride of what nature should the marriage be should there be any festival should there be bridesmaids where should they go when they were married what dresses should be bought after what fashion should they be prepared to live those and questions of a like nature required to be answered and lady anna felt that these matters should not be fixed without some reference to her mother it had been her most heartfelt desire to reconcile the countess to the marriageto obtain at any rate so much recognition as would enable her mother to be present in the church but the countess had altogether refused to speak on the subject and had remained silent gloomy and impenetrable then daniel had himself proposed that he would see her and on a certain morning he called he sent up his name with his compliments and the countess allowed him to be shown into her room lady anna had begged that it might be so and she had yieldedyielded without positive assent as she had now done in all matters relating to this disastrous marriage on that morning however she had spoken a word if mr thwaite chooses to see me i must be alone and she was alone when the tailor was shown into the room up to that day he had worn his arm in a slingand should then have continued to do so but on this visit of peace to her who had attempted to be his murderer he put aside this outward sign of the injury she had inflicted on him he smiled as he entered the room and she rose to receive him she was no longer a young womanand no woman of her age or of any other had gone through rougher usagebut she could not keep the blood out of her cheeks as her eyes met his nor could she summon to her support that hard persistency of outward demeanour with which she had intended to arm herself for the occasion so you have come to see me mr thwaite she said  i have come lady lovel to shake hands with you if it may be so before my marriage with your daughter it is her wish that we should be friendsand mine also so saying he put out his hand and the countess slowly gave him hers i hope the time may come lady lovel when all animosity may be forgotten between you and me and nothing be borne in mind but the old friendship of former years  i do not know that that can be she said  i hope it may be so time cures all thingsand i hope it may be so  there are sorrows mr thwaite which no time can cure you have triumphed and can look forward to the pleasures of success i have been foiled and beaten and broken to pieces with me the last is worse even than the first i do not know that i can ever have another friend your father was my friend  and i would be so also  you have been my enemy all that he did to help meall that others have done since to forward me on my way has been brought to nothingby you my joys have been turned to grief my rank has been made a disgrace my wealth has become like ashes between my teethand it has been your doing they tell me that you will be my daughters husband i know that it must be so but i do not see that you can be my friend  i had hoped to find you softer lady lovel  it is not my nature to be soft all this has not tended to make me soft if my daughter will let me know from time to time that she is alive that is all that i shall require of her as to her future career i cannot interest myself in it as i had hoped to do goodbye mr thwaite you need fear no further interference from me  so the interview was over and not a word had been said about the attempt at murder     chapter xlvi  hard lines   at the time that the murder was attempted lord lovel was in londonand had seen daniel thwaite on that morning but before any confirmed rumour had reached his ears he had left london again on his road to yoxham he knew now that he would be endowed with something like ten thousand a year out of the wealth of the late earl but that he would not have the hand of his fair cousin the late earls daughter perhaps it was as well as it was the girl had never loved him and he could now choose for himselfand need not choose till it should be his pleasure to settle himself as a married man after all his marriage with lady anna would have been a constrained marriagea marriage which he would have accepted as the means of making his fortune the girl certainly had pleased himbut it might be that a girl who preferred a tailor would not have continued to please him at any rate he could not be unhappy with his newlyacquired fortune and he went down to yoxham to receive the congratulation of his friends thinking that it would become him now to make some exertion towards reconciling his uncle and aunt to the coming marriage  have you heard anything about mr thwaite mr flick said to him the day before he started the earl had heard nothing they say that he has been wounded by a pistolball lord lovel stayed some days at a friends house on his road into yorkshire and when he reached the rectory the rector had received news from london mr thwaite the tailor had been murdered and it was surmised that the deed had been done by the countess i trust the papers were signed before you left london said the anxious rector the documents making over the property were all right but the earl would believe nothing of the murder mr thwaite might have been wounded he had heard so much beforebut he was quite sure that it had not been done by the countess on the following day further tidings came mr thwaite was doing well but everybody said that the attempt had been made by lady lovel thus by degrees some idea of the facts as they had occurred was received at the rectory  you dont mean that you want us to have mr thwaite here said the rector holding up his hands upon hearing a proposition made to him by his nephew a day or two later  why not uncle charles  i couldnt do it i really dont think your aunt could bring herself to sit down to table with him  aunt jane  yes your aunt janeor your aunt julia either now a quieter lady than aunt jane or one less likely to turn up her nose at any guest whom her husband should choose to entertain did not exist  may i ask my aunts  what good can it do frederic  hes going to marry our cousin hes not at all such a man as you seem to think  he has been a journeyman tailor all his life  youll find hell make a very good sort of gentleman sir william patterson says that hell be in parliament before long  sir william sir william is always meddling i have never thought much about sir william  come uncle charlesyou should be fair if we had gone on quarrelling and going to law where should i have been now i should never have got a shilling out of the property everybody says so no doubt sir william acted very wisely  i am no lawyer i cant say how it might have been but i may have my doubts if i like i have always understood that lady lovel as you choose to call her was never lord lovels wife for twenty years i have been sure of it and i cant change so quickly as some other people  she is lady lovel now the king and queen would receive her as such if she went to court her daughter is lady anna lovel  it may be so it is possible  if it be not so said the young lord thumping the table where have i got the money from this was an argument that the rector could not answerso he merely shook his head i am bound to acknowledge them after taking her money  but not him you havent had any of his money you neednt acknowledge him  we had better make the best of it uncle charles he is going to marry our cousin and we should stand by her sir william very strongly advises me to be present at the marriage and to offer to give her away  the girl you were going to marry yourself  or else that you should do it that of course would be better  the rector of yoxham groaned when the proposition was made to him what infinite vexation of spirit and degradation had come to him from these spurious lovels during the last twelve months he had been made to have the girl in his house and to give her precedence as lady anna though he did not believe in her he had been constrained to treat her as the desired bride of his august nephew the earltill she had refused the earls hand after he had again repudiated her and her mother because of her base attachment to a lowborn artisan he had been made to reaccept her in spirit because she had been generous to his nephewand now he was asked to stand at the altar and give her away to the tailor and there could come to him neither pleasure nor profit from the concern all that he had endured he had borne simply for the sake of his family and his nephew she is degrading us allas far as she belongs to us said the rector i cant see why i should be asked to give her my countenance in doing it  everybody says that it is very good of her to be true to the man she loved when she was poor and in obscurity sir william says   sir william muttered the rector between his teeth as he turned away in disgust what had been the first word of that minatory speech lord lovel did not clearly hear he had been brought up as a boy by his uncle and had never known his uncle to offend by swearing no one in yoxham would have believed it possible that the parson of the parish should have done so mrs grimes would have given evidence in any court in yorkshire that it was absolutely impossible the archbishop would not have believed it though his archdeacon had himself heard the word all the mans known antecedents since he had been at yoxham were against the probability the entire close at york would have been indignant had such an accusation been made but his nephew in his heart of hearts believed that the rector of yoxham had damned the solicitorgeneral  there was however more cause for malediction and further provocations to wrath in store for the rector the earl had not as yet opened all his budget or let his uncle know the extent of the sacrifice that was to be demanded from him sir william had been very urgent with the young nobleman to accord everything that could be accorded to his cousin it is not of course for me to dictate he had said but as i have been allowed so far to give advice somewhat beyond the scope of my profession perhaps you will let me say that in mere honesty you owe her all that you can give she has shared everything with you and need have given nothing and he my lord had he been so minded might no doubt have hindered her from doing what she has done you owe it to your honour to accept her and her husband with an open hand unless you can treat her with cousinly regard you should not have taken what has been given to you as a cousin she has recognised you to your great advantage as the head of her family and you should certainly recognise her as belonging to it let the marriage be held down at yoxham get your uncle and aunt to ask her down do you give her away and let your uncle marry them if you can put me up for a night in some neighbouring farmhouse i will come and be a spectator it will be for your honour to treat her after that fashion the programme was a large one and the earl felt that there might be some difficulty  but in the teeth of that dubious malediction he persevered and his next attack was upon aunt julia you liked herdid you not  yesi liked her the tone implied great doubt i liked her till i found that she had forgotten herself  but she didnt forget herself she just did what any girl would have done living as she was living she has behaved nobly to me  she has behaved no doubt conscientiously  come aunt julia did you ever know any other woman to give away ten thousand ayear to a fellow simply because he was her cousin we should do something for her why should you not ask her down here again  i dont think my brother would like it  he will if you tell him and we must make a gentleman of him  my dear frederic you can never wash a blackamoor white  let us try dont you oppose it it behoves me for my honour to show her some regard after what she has done for me  aunt julia shook her head and muttered to herself some further remark about negroes the inhabitants of the yoxham rectorywho were well born ladies and gentlemen without a stain who were hitherto free from all base intermarriages and had nothing among their male cousins below soldiers and sailors parsons and lawyers who had successfully opposed an intended marriage between a cousin in the third degree and an attorney because the alliance was below the level of the lovels were peculiarly averse to any intermingling of ranks they were descended from ancient earls and their chief was an earl of the present day there was but one titled young lady now among themand she had only just won her right to be so considered there was but one lady annaand she was going to marry a tailor duty is duty said aunt julia as she hurried away she meant her nephew to understand that duty commanded her to shut her heart against any cousin who could marry a tailor  the lord next attacked aunt jane you wouldnt mind having her here  not if your uncle thought well of it said mrs lovel  ill tell you what my scheme is then he told it all lady anna was to be invited to the rectory the tailor was to be entertained somewhere near on the night preceding his wedding the marriage was to be celebrated by his uncle in yoxham church sir william was to be asked to join them and the whole thing was to be done exactly as though they were all proud of the connection  does your uncle know asked mrs lovel who had been nearly stunned by the proposition  not quite i want you to suggest it only think aunt jane what she has done for us all aunt jane couldnt think that very much had been done for her they were not to be enriched by the cousins money they had never been interested in the matter on their own account they wanted nothing and yet they were to be called upon to have a tailor at their boardbecause lord lovel was the head of their family but the earl was the earl and poor mrs lovel knew how much she owed to his position if you wish it of course ill tell him frederic  i do wish itand ill be so much obliged to you  the next morning the parson had been told all that was required of him and he came down to prayers as black as a thundercloud it had been before suggested to him that he should give the bride away and though he had grievously complained of the request he knew that he must do it should the earl still demand it he had no power to oppose the head of the family but he had never thought then that he would be asked to pollute his own rectory by the presence of that odious tailor while he was shaving that morning very religious ideas had filled his mind what a horrible thing was wickedness all this evil had come upon him and his because the late earl had been so very wicked a man he had sworn to his wife that he would not bear it he had done and was ready to do more almost than any other uncle in england but this he could not endure yet when he was shaving and thinking with religious horror of the iniquities of that iniquitous old lord he knew that he would have to yield i dare say they wouldnt come said aunt julia he wont like to be with us any more than we shall like to have him there was some comfort in that hope and trusting to it the rector had yielded everything before the third day was over  and i may ask sir william said the earl  of course we shall be glad to see sir william patterson if you choose to invite him said the rector still oppressed by gloom sir william patterson is a gentleman no doubt and a man of high standing of course i and your aunt will be pleased to receive him as a lawyer i dont think much of himbut that has nothing to do with it it may be remarked here that though mr lovel lived for a great many years after the transactions which are here recorded he never gave way in reference to the case that had been tried if the lawyers had persevered as they ought to have done it would have been found out that the countess was no countess that the lady anna was no lady anna and that all the money had belonged by right to the earl with that beliefwith that profession of beliefhe went to his grave an old man of eighty  in the meantime he consented that the invitation should be given the countess and her daughter were to be asked to yoxhamthe use of the parish church was to be offered for the ceremony he was to propose to marry them the earl was to give the bride away and daniel thwaite the tailor was to be asked to dine at yoxham rectory on the day before the marriage the letters were to be written from the rectory by aunt julia and the earl was to add what he pleased for himself i suppose this sort of trial is sent to us for our good said the rector to his wife that night in the sanctity of their bedroom     chapter xlvii  things arrange themselves   but the countess never gave way an inch the following was the answer which she returned to the note written to her by aunt julia  the countess lovel presents her compliments to miss lovel the countess disapproves altogether of the marriage which is about to take place between lady anna lovel and mr daniel thwaite and will take no part in the ceremony  by heavensshe is the best lovel of us all said the rector when he read the letter  this reply was received at yoxham three days before any answer came either from lady anna or from the tailor daniel had received his communication from the young lord who had called him dear mr thwaite who had written quite familiarly about the coming nuptials with his cousin annahad bade him come down and join the family like a good fellowand had signed himself yours always most sincerely lovel it almost takes my breath away said the tailor to his sweetheart laughing  they are cousins you know said lady anna and there was a little girl there i loved so much  they cant but despise me you know said the tailor  why should any one despise you  no one shouldunless i be mean and despicable but they doyou may be sure it is only human nature that they should we are made of different fabricthough the stuff was originally the same i dont think i should be at my ease with them i should be half afraid of their gilt and their gingerbread and should be ashamed of myself because i was so i should not know how to drink wine with them and should do a hundred things which would make them think me a beast  i dont see why you shouldnt hold up your head with any man in england said lady anna  and so i oughtbut i shouldnt i should be awed by those whom i feel to be my inferiors i had rather not we had better keep to ourselves dear but the girl begged for some delay it was a matter that required to be considered if it were necessary for her to quarrel with all her cousins for the sake of her husbandwith the bright fainéant young earl with aunts jane and julia with her darling minnie she would do so the husband should be to her in all respects the first and foremost for his sake now that she had resolved that she would be his she would if necessary separate herself from all the world she had withstood the prayers of her mother and she was sure that nothing else could move her but if the cousins were willing to accept her husband why should he not be willing to be accepted pride in him might be as weak as pride in them if they would put out their hands to him why should he refuse to put out his own give me a day daniel to think about it he gave her the day and then that great decider of all things sir william came to him congratulating him bidding him be of good cheer and saying fine things of the lovel family generally our tailor received him courteously having learned to like the man understanding that he had behaved with honesty and wisdom in regard to his client and respecting him as one of the workers of the day but he declared that for the lovel family as a familyhe did not care for them particularly they are poles asunder from me he said  not so replied sir william they were poles asunder if you will but by your good fortune and merit if you will allow me to say so you have travelled from the one pole very far towards the other  i like my own pole a deal the best sir william  i am an older man than you mr thwaite and allow me to assure you that you are wrong  wrong in preferring those who work for their bread to those who eat it in idleness  not thatbut wrong in thinking that there is not hard work done at the one pole as well as the other and wrong also in not having perceived that the best men who come up from age to age are always migrating from that pole which you say you prefer to the antipodean pole to which you are tending yourself i can understand your feeling of contempt for an idle lordling but you should remember that lords have been made lords in nine cases out of ten for good work done by them for the benefit of their country  why should the children of lords be such to the tenth and twentieth generation  come into parliament mr thwaite and if you have views on that subject opposed to hereditary peerages express them there it is a fair subject for argument at present i think that the sense of the country is in favour of an aristocracy of birth but be that as it may do not allow yourself to despise that condition of society which it is the ambition of all men to enter  it is not my ambition  pardon me when you were a workman among workmen did you not wish to be their leader when you were foremost among them did you not wish to be their master if you were a master tradesman would you not wish to lead and guide your brother tradesmen would you not desire wealth in order that you might be assisted by it in your views of ambition if you were an alderman in your borough would you not wish to be the mayor if mayor would you not wish to be its representative in parliament if in parliament would you not wish to be heard there would you not then clothe yourself as those among whom you lived eat as they ate drink as they drank keep their hours fall into their habits and be one of them the theory of equality is very grand  the grandest thing in the world sir william  it is one to which all legislative and all human efforts should and must tend all that is said and all that is done among people that have emancipated themselves from the thraldom of individual aggrandizement serve to diminish in some degree the distance between the high and the low but could you establish absolute equality in england tomorrow as it was to have been established in france some half century ago the inequality of mens minds and character would reestablish an aristocracy within twenty years the energetic the talented the honest and the unselfish will always be moving towards an aristocratic side of society because their virtues will beget esteem and esteem will beget wealthand wealth gives power for good offices  as when one man throws away forty thousand a year on racecourses  when you make much water boil mr thwaite some of it will probably boil over when two men run a race some strength must be wasted in fruitless steps beyond the goal it is the fault of many patriotic men that in their desire to put down the evils which exist they will see only the power that is wasted and have no eyes for the good work done the subject is so large that i should like to discuss it with you when we have more time for the present let me beg of you for your own sake as well as for her who is to be your wife that you will not repudiate civility offered to you by her family it will show a higher manliness in you to go among them and accept among them the position which your wifes wealth and your own acquirements will give you than to stand aloof moodily because they are aristocrats  you can make yourself understood when you speak sir william  i am glad to hear you say so said the lawyer smiling  i cannot and so you have the best of me but you cant make me like a lord or think that a young man ought to wear a silk gown  i quite agree with you that the silk gowns should be kept for their elders and so the conversation was ended  daniel thwaite had not been made to like a lord but the eloquence of the urbane lawyer was not wasted on him thinking of it all as he wandered alone through the streets he began to believe that it would be more manly to do as he was advised than to abstain because the doing of the thing would in itself be disagreeable to him on the following day lady anna was with him as usual for the pretext of his wound still afforded to her the means of paying to him those daily visits which in happier circumstances he would naturally have paid to her would you like to go to yoxham he said she looked wistfully up into his face with her there was a real wish that the poles might be joined together by her future husband she had found as she had thought of it that she could not make herself either happy or contented except by marrying him but it had not been without regret that she had consented to destroy altogether the link which bound her to the noble blood of the lovels she had been made to appreciate the sweet flavour of aristocratic influences and now that the lovels were willing to receive her in spite of her marriage she was more than willing to accept their offered friendship if you really wish it you shall go he said  but you must go also  yesfor one day and i must have a pair of gloves and a black coat  and a blue oneto be married in  alas me must i have a pink silk gown to walk about in early in the morning  you shall if you like and ill make it for you  id sooner see you darning my worsted stockings sweetheart  i can do that too  and i shall have to go to church in a coach and come back in another and all the people will smell sweet and make eyes at me behind my back and wonder among themselves how the tailor will behave himself  the tailor must behave himself properly said lady anna  thats just what he wont doand cant do i know youll be ashamed of me and then we shall both be unhappy  i wont be ashamed of you i will never be ashamed of you i will be ashamed of them if they are not good to you but daniel you shall not go if you do not like it what does it all signify if you are not happy  i will go said he and now ill sit down and write a letter to my lord  two letters were written accepting the invitation as that from the tailor to the lord was short and characteristic it shall be given      my dear lord     i am much obliged to you for your lordships invitation    to yoxham and if accepting it will make me a good fellow    i will accept it i fear however that i can never be a    proper fellow to your lordship not the less do i feel    your courtesy and i am     with all sincerity    your lordships very obedient servant     daniel thwaite   lady annas reply to aunt julia was longer and less sententious but it signified her intention of going down to yoxham a week before the day settled for the marriage which was now the 10th of july she was much obliged she said to the rector for his goodness in promising to marry them and as she had no friends of her own she hoped that minnie lovel would be her bridesmaid there were however sundry other letters before the ceremony was performed and among them was one in which she was asked to bring miss alice bluestone down with herso that she might have one bridesmaid over and beyond those provided by the yoxham aristocracy to this arrangement miss alice bluestone acceded joyfullyin spite of that gulf of which she had spokenand so accompanied but without her ladysmaid lady anna returned to yoxham that she might be there bound in holy matrimony to daniel thwaite the tailor by the hands of her cousin the rev charles lovel     chapter xlviii  the marriage   the marriage was nearly all that a marriage should be when a lady anna is led to the hymeneal altar as the ceremony was transferred from bloomsbury london to yoxham in yorkshire a licence had been procured and the banns of which daniel thwaite thought so much had been called in vain of course there are differences in aristocratic marriages all earls daughters are not married at st georges hanover square nor is it absolutely necessary that a bishop should tie the knot or that the dresses should be described in a newspaper this was essentially a quiet marriagebut it was quiet with a splendid quietude and the obscurity of it was graceful and decorous as soon as the thing was settledwhen it was a matter past doubt that all the lovels were to sanction the marriagethe two aunts went to work heartily another lovel girl hardly more than seen before by any of the family was gathered to the lovel home as a third bridesmaid and for the fourthwho should officiate but the eldest daughter of lady fitzwarren the fitzwarrens were not rich did not go to town annually and the occasions for social brilliancy in the country are few and far between lady fitzwarren did not like to refuse her old friend mrs lovel and then lady anna was lady annaor at any rate would be so as far as the newspapers of the day were concerned miss fitzwarren allowed herself to be attired in white and blue and to officiate in the processionhaving however assured her most intimate friend miss de moleyns that no consideration on earth should induce her to allow herself to be kissed by the tailor  in the week previous to the arrival of daniel thwaite lady anna again ingratiated herself with the ladies at the rectory during the days of her persecution she had been silent and apparently hardbut now she was again gentle yielding and soft i do like her manner all the same said minnie yes my dear its a pity that it should be as it is to be because she is very nice minnie loved her friend but thought it to be a thing of horror that her friend should marry a tailor it was almost as bad as the story of the princess who had to marry a bearworse indeed for minnie did not at all believe that the tailor would ever turn out to be a gentleman whereas she had been sure from the first that the bear would turn into a prince  daniel came to yoxham and saw very little of anybody at the rectory he was taken in at the house of a neighbouring squire where he dined as a matter of course he did call at the rectory and saw his bridebut on that occasion he did not even see the rector the squire took him to the church in the morning dressed in a blue frock coat brown trousers and a grey cravat he was very much ashamed of his own clothes but there was nothing about him to attract attention had not everybody known he was a tailor the rector shook hands with him politely but coldly the ladies were more affectionate and minnie looked up into his face long and anxiously he wasnt very nice she said afterwards but i thought hed be worse than that when the marriage was over he kissed his wife but made no attempt upon the bridesmaids then there was a breakfast at the rectorywhich was a very handsome bridal banquet on such occasions the part of the bride is always easily played it is her duty to look pretty if she can and should she fail in thatas brides usually doher failure is attributed to the natural emotions of the occasion the part of the bridegroom is more difficult he should be manly pleasant composed never flippant able to say a few words when called upon and quietly triumphant this is almost more than mortal can achieve and bridegrooms generally manifest some shortcomings at the awful moment daniel thwaite was not successful he was silent and almost morose when lady fitzwarren congratulated him with highflown words and a smilea smile that was intended to combine something of ridicule with something of civilityhe almost broke down in his attempt to answer her it is very good of you my lady said he then she turned her back and whispered a word to the parson and daniel was sure that she was laughing at him the hero of the day was the solicitorgeneral he made a speech proposing health and prosperity to the newlymarried couple he referred but just referred to the trial expressing the pleasure which all concerned had felt in recognising the rights and rank of the fair and noble bride as soon as the facts of the case had come to their knowledge then he spoke of the truth and longcontinued friendship and devoted constancy of the bridegroom and his father saying that in the long experience of his life he had known nothing more touching or more graceful than the love which in early days had sprung up between the beautiful young girl and her earliest friend he considered it to be among the happinesses of his life that he had been able to make the acquaintance of mr daniel thwaite and he expressed a hope that he might long be allowed to regard that gentleman as his friend there was much applause in giving which the young earl was certainly the loudest the rector could not bring himself to say a word he was striving to do his duty by the head of his family but he could not bring himself to say that the marriage between lady anna lovel and the tailor was a happy event poor daniel was compelled to make some speech in reply to his friend sir william i am bad at speaking said he and i hope i shall be excused i can only say that i am under deep obligation to sir william patterson for what he has done for my wife  the couple went away with a carriage and four horses to york and the marriage was over i hope i have done right said the rector in whispered confidence to lady fitzwarren  i think you have mr lovel im sure you have the circumstances were very difficult but i am sure you have done right she must always be considered as the legitimate child of her father  they say so murmured the rector sadly  just that and as she will always be considered to be the lady anna you were bound to treat her as you have done it was a pity that it was not done earlier so that she might have formed a worthier connection the earl however has not been altogether overlooked and there is some comfort in that i dare say mr thwaite may be a good sort of man though he isnot just what the family could have wished these words were undoubtedly spoken by her ladyship with much pleasure the fitzwarrens were poor and the lovels were all rich even the young earl was now fairly well to do in the worldthanks to the generosity of the newlyfound cousin it was therefore pleasant to lady fitzwarren to allude to the family misfortune which must in some degree alloy the prosperity of her friends mr lovel understood it all and sighed but he felt no anger he was grateful to lady fitzwarren for coming to his house at all on so mournful an occasion  and so we may bid farewell to yoxham the rector was an honest sincere man unselfish true to his instincts genuinely english charitable hospitable a doer of good to those around him in judging of such a character we find the difficulty of drawing the line between political sagacity and political prejudice had he been other than he was he would probably have been less serviceable in his position  the bride and bridegroom went for their honeymoon into devonshire and on their road they passed through london lady anna thwaitefor she had not at least as yet been able to drop her titlewrote to her mother telling her of her arrival and requesting permission to see her on the following day she went alone to keppel street and was admitted dear dear mamma she said throwing herself into the arms of her mother  so it is done said the countess  yesmammawe are married i wrote to you from york  i got your letter but i could not answer it what could i say i wish it had not been sobut it is done you have chosen for yourself and i will not reproach you  do not reproach me now mamma  it would be useless i will bear my sorrows in silence such as they are do not talk to me of him but tell me what is the life that is proposed for you  they were to stay in the south of devonshire for a month and then to sail for the new colony founded at the antipodes as to any permanent mode of life no definite plan had yet been formed they were bound for sydney and when there my husbandas lady anna called him thinking that the word might be less painful to the ears of her mother than the name of the man who had become so odious to herwould do as should seem good to him they would at any rate learn something of the new world that was springing up and he would then be able to judge whether he would best serve the purpose that he had at heart by remaining there or by returning to england and now mamma what will you do  nothing said the countess  but where will you live  if i could only find out my child where i might die i would tell you that  mamma do not talk to me of dying  how should i talk of my future life my dear for what should i live i had but you and you have left me  come with me mamma  no my dear i could not live with him nor he with me it will be better that he and i should never see each other again  but you will not stay here  noi shall not stay here i must use myself to solitude but the solitude of london is unendurable i shall go back to cumberland if i can find a home there the mountains will remind me of the days which sad as they were were less sad than the present i little dreamed then when i had gained everything my loss would be so great as it has been was the earl there  at our marriage oh yes he was there  i shall ask him to do me a kindness perhaps he will let me live at lovel grange  when the meeting was over lady anna returned to her husband overwhelmed with tears she was almost brokenhearted when she asked herself whether she had in truth been cruel to her mother but she knew not how she could have done other than she had done her mother had endeavoured to conquer her by hard usageand had failed but not the less her heart was very sore my dear said the tailor to her hearts will be sore as the world goes yet awhile there must be injustice and sorrow will follow  when they had been gone from london about a month the countess wrote to her cousin the earl and told him her wishes if you desire to live there of course there must be an end of it but if not you might let the old place to me it will not be as if it were gone out of the family i will do what i can for the people around me so that they may learn not to hate the name of lovel  the young lord told her that she should have the use of the house as long as she pleasedfor her lifetime if it suited her to live there so long as for rentof course he could take none after all that had been done for him but the place should be leased to her so that she need not fear to be disturbed when the spring time came after the sailing of the vessel which took the tailor and his wife off to the antipodes lady lovel travelled down with her maid to cumberland leaving london without a friend to whom she could say adieu and at lovel grange she took up her abode amidst the old furniture and the old pictures with everything to remind her of the black tragedy of her youth when her husband had come to her and had told her with a smile upon his lips and scorn in his eye that she was not his wife and that the child which she bore would be a bastard over his wicked word she had at any rate triumphed now she was living there in his house the unquestioned and undoubted countess lovel the mistress of much of his wealth while still were living around her those who had known her when she was banished from her home there too often with illdirected generosity she gave away her money and became loved of the poor around her but in the way of society she saw no human being and rarely went beyond the valley in which stood the lonely house to which she had been brought as a bride  of the further doings of mr daniel thwaite and his wife lady annaof how they travelled and saw many things and how he became perhaps a wiser manthe present writer may he hopes live to tell   printed by virtue and co city road london
