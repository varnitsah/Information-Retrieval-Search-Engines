95325289	the last tournament  by  alfred tennyson dcl  poetlaureate  authors edition  from advance sheets  this poem forms one of the idyls of the king its place is between pelleas and guinevere  by alfred tennyson  poet laureate     dagonet the fool whom gawain in his moods  had made mockknight of arthurs table round  at camelot high above the yellowing woods  danced like a witherd leaf before the hall  and toward him from the hall with harp in hand  and from the crown thereof a carcanet  of ruby swaying to and fro the prize  of tristram in the jousts of yesterday  came tristram saying why skip ye so sir fool     for arthur and sir lancelot riding once  far down beneath a winding wall of rock  heard a child wail a stump of oak halfdead  from roots like some black coil of carven snakes  clutchd at the crag and started thro midair  bearing an eagles nest and thro the tree  rushd ever a rainy wind and thro the wind  pierced ever a childs cry and crag and tree  scaling sir lancelot from the perilous nest  this ruby necklace thrice around her neck  and all unscarrd from beak or talon brought  a maiden babe which arthur pitying took  then gave it to his queen to rear the queen  but coldly acquiescing in her white arms  received and after loved it tenderly  and named it nestling so forgot herself  a moment and her cares till that young life  being smitten in midheaven with mortal cold  past from her and in time the carcanet  vext her with plaintive memories of the child  so she delivering it to arthur said  take thou the jewels of this dead innocence  and make them an thou wilt a tourneyprize     to whom the king peace to thine eagleborne  dead nestling and this honor after death  following thy will but o my queen i muse  why ye not wear on arm or neck or zone  those diamonds that i rescued from the tarn  and lancelot won methought for thee to wear     would rather ye had let them fall she cried  plunge and be lostillfated as they were  a bitterness to meye look amazed  not knowing they were lost as soon as given  slid from my hands when i was leaning out  above the riverthat unhappy child  past in her barge but rosier luck will go  with these rich jewels seeing that they came  not from the skeleton of a brotherslayer  but the sweet body of a maiden babe  perchancewho knowsthe purest of thy knights  may win them for the purest of my maids     she ended and the cry of a great jousts  with trumpetblowings ran on all the ways  from camelot in among the faded fields  to furthest towers and everywhere the knights  armd for a day of glory before the king     but on the hither side of that loud morn  into the hall staggerd his visage ribbd  from ear to ear with dogwhipweals his nose  bridgebroken one eye out and one hand off  and one with shatterd fingers dangling lame  a churl to whom indignantly the king  my churl for whom christ died what evil beast  hath drawn his claws athwart thy face or fiend  man was it who marrd heavens image in thee thus     then sputtering thro the hedge of splinterd teeth  yet strangers to the tongue and with blunt stump  pitchblackend sawing the air said the maimd churl  he took them and he drave them to his tower  some hold he was a tableknight of thine  a hundred goodly onesthe red knight he   lord i was tending swine and the red knight  brake in upon me and drave them to his tower  and when i calld upon thy name as one  that doest right by gentle and by churl  maimd me and mauld and would outright have slain  save that he sware me to a message saying  tell thou the king and all his liars that i  have founded my round table in the north  and whatsoever his own knights have sworn  my knights have sworn the counter to itand say  my tower is full of harlots like his court  but mine are worthier seeing they profess  to be none other than themselvesand say  my knights are all adulterers like his own  but mine are truer seeing they profess  to be none other and say his hour is come  the heathen are upon him his long lance  broken and his excalibur a straw     then arthur turnd to kay the seneschal  take thou my churl and tend him curiously  like a kings heir till all his hurts be whole  the heathenbut that everclimbing wave  hurld back again so often in empty foam  hath lain for years at restand renegades  thieves bandits leavings of confusion whom  the wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere  friends thro your manhood and your fealtynow  make their last head like satan in the north  my younger knights newmade in whom your flower  waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds  move with me toward their quelling which achieved  the loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore  but thou sir lancelot sitting in my place  enchaird tomorrow arbitrate the field  for wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it  only to yield my queen her own again  speak lancelot thou art silent is it well                                           thereto sir lancelot answerd it is well  yet better if the king abide and leave  the leading of his younger knights to me  else for the king has willd it it is well                                            then arthur rose and lancelot followd him  and while they stood without the doors the king  turnd to him saying is it then so well  or mine the blame that oft i seem as he  of whom was written a sound is in his ears  the foot that loiters bidden gothe glance  that only seems halfloyal to command  a manner somewhat falln from reverence  or have i dreamd the bearing of our knights  tells of a manhood ever less and lower  or whence the fear lest this my realm upreard  by noble deeds at one with noble vows  from flat confusion and brute violences  reel back into the beast and be no more                                           he spoke and taking all his younger knights  down the slope city rode and sharply turnd  north by the gate in her high bower the queen  working a tapestry lifted up her head  watchd her lord pass and knew not that she sighd  then ran across her memory the strange rhyme  of bygone merlin where is he who knows  from the great deep to the great deep he goes                                           but when the morning of a tournament  by these in earnest those in mockery calld  the tournament of the dead innocence  brake with a wet wind blowing lancelot  round whose sick head all night like birds of prey  the words of arthur flying shriekd arose  and down a streetway hung with folds of pure  white samite and by fountains running wine  where children sat in white with cups of gold  moved to the lists and there with slow sad steps  ascending filld his doubledragond chair                                           he glanced and saw the stately galleries  dame damsel each thro worship of their queen  whiterobed in honor of the stainless child  and some with scatterd jewels like a bank  of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire  he lookt but once and veild his eyes again                                            the sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream  to ears but halfawaked then one low roll  of autumn thunder and the jousts began  and ever the wind blew and yellowing leaf  and gloom and gleam and shower and shorn plume  went down it sighing weariedly as one  who sits and gazes on a faded fire  when all the goodlier guests are past away  sat their great umpire looking oer the lists  he saw the laws that ruled the tournament  broken but spake not once a knight cast down  before his throne of arbitration cursed  the dead babe and the follies of the king  and once the laces of a helmet crackd  and showd him like a vermin in its hole  modred a narrow face anon he heard  the voice that billowd round the barriers roar  an oceansounding welcome to one knight  but newlyenterd taller than the rest  and armord all in forest green whereon  there tript a hundred tiny silver deer  and wearing but a hollyspray for crest  with everscattering berries and on shield  a spear a harp a bugletristramlate  from overseas in brittany returnd  and marriage with a princess of that realm  isolt the whitesir tristram of the woods  whom lancelot knew had held sometime with pain  his own against him and now yearnd to shake  the burthen off his heart in one full shock  with tristram evn to death his strong hands gript  and dinted the gilt dragons right and left  until he groand for wrathso many of those  that ware their ladies colors on the casque  drew from before sir tristram to the bounds  and there with gibes and nickering mockeries  stood while he mutterd craven chests o shame  what faith have these in whom they sware to love  the glory of our round table is no more                                           so tristram won and lancelot gave the gems  not speaking other word than hast thou won  art thou the purest brother see the hand  wherewith thou takest this is red to whom  tristram half plagued by lancelots languorous mood  made answer ay but wherefore toss me this  like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound  let be thy fair queens fantasy strength of heart  and might of limb but mainly use and skill  are winners in this pastime of our king  my handbelike the lance hath dript upon it  no blood of mine i trow but o chief knight  right arm of arthur in the battlefield  great brother thou nor i have made the world  be happy in thy fair queen as i in mine  and tristram round the gallery made his horse  caracole then bowd his homage bluntly saying  fair damsels each to him who worships each  sole queen of beauty and of love behold  this day my queen of beauty is not here  then most of these were mute some angerd one  murmuring all courtesy is dead and one  the glory of our round table is no more     then fell thick rain plume droopt and mantle clung  and pettish cries awoke and the wan day  went glooming down in wet and weariness  but under her black brows a swarthy dame  laught shrilly crying praise the patient saints  our one white day of innocence hath past  tho somewhat draggled at the skirt so be it  the snowdrop only flowring thro the year  would make the world as blank as wintertide  comelet us comfort their sad eyes our queens  and lancelots at this nights solemnity  with all the kindlier colors of the field                                           so dame and damsel glitterd at the feast  variously gay for he that tells the tale  likend them saying as when an hour of cold  falls on the mountain in midsummer snows  and all the purple slopes of mountain flowers  pass under white till the warm hour returns  with veer of wind and all are flowers again  so dame and damsel cast the simple white  and glowing in all colors the live grass  rosecampion bluebell kingcup poppy glanced  about the revels and with mirth so loud  beyond all use that halfamazed the queen  and wroth at tristram and the lawless jousts  brake up their sports then slowly to her bower  parted and in her bosom pain was lord                                           and little dagonet on the morrow morn  high over all the yellowing autumntide  danced like a witherd leaf before the hall  then tristram saying why skip ye so sir fool  wheeld round on either heel dagonet replied  belike for lack of wiser company  or being fool and seeing too much wit  makes the world rotten why belike i skip  to know myself the wisest knight of all  ay fool said tristram but tis eating dry  to dance without a catch a roundelay  to dance to then he twangled on his harp  and while he twangled little dagonet stood  quiet as any watersodden log  stayd in the wandering warble of a brook  but when the twangling ended skipt again  then being askd why skipt ye not sir fool  made answer i had liefer twenty years  skip to the broken music of my brains  than any broken music ye can make  then tristram waiting for the quip to come  good now what music have i broken fool  and little dagonet skipping arthur the kings  for when thou playest that air with queen isolt  thou makest broken music with thy bride  her daintier namesake down in brittany  and so thou breakest arthurs music too  save for that broken music in thy brains  sir fool said tristram i would break thy head  fool i came late the heathen wars were oer  the life had flown we sware but by the shell  i am but a fool to reason with a fool  come thou art crabbd and sour but lean me down  sir dagonet one of thy long asses ears  and hearken if my music be not true     free lovefree fieldwe love but while we may  the woods are hushd their music is no more  the leaf is dead the yearning past away  new leaf new lifethe days of frost are oer  new life new love to suit the newer day  new loves are sweet as those that went before  free lovefree fieldwe love but while we may     ye might have moved slowmeasure to my tune  not stood stockstill i made it in the woods  and found it ring as true as tested gold     but dagonet with one foot poised in his hand  friend did ye mark that fountain yesterday  made to run winebut this had run itself  all out like a long life to a sour end  and them that round it sat with golden cups  to hand the wine to whomsoever came  the twelve small damosels white as innocence     in honor of poor innocence the babe  who left the gems which innocence the queen  lent to the king and innocence the king  gave for a prizeand one of those white slips  handed her cup and piped the pretty one  drink drink sir fool and thereupon i drank  spatpishthe cup was gold the draught was mud  and tristram was it muddier than thy gibes  is all the laughter gone dead out of thee  not marking how the knighthood mock thee fool  fear god honor the kinghis one true knight  sole follower of the vowsfor here be they  who knew thee swine enow before i came  smuttier than blasted grain but when the king  had made thee fool thy vanity so shot up  it frighted all free fool from out thy heart  which left thee less than fool and less than swine  a naked aughtyet swine i hold thee still  for i have flung thee pearls and find thee swine     and little dagonet mincing with his feet  knight an ye fling those rubies round my neck  in lieu of hers ill hold thou hast some touch  of music since i care not for thy pearls  swine i have wallowd i have washdthe world  is flesh and shadowi have had my day  the dirty nurse experience in her kind  hath fould mean i wallowd then i washd  i have had my day and my philosophies  and thank the lord i am king arthurs fool  swine say ye swine goats asses rams and geese  troopd round a paynim harper once who thrummd  on such a wire as musically as thou  some such fine songbut never a kings fool     and tristram then were swine goats asses geese  the wiser fools seeing thy paynim bard  had such a mastery of his mystery  that he could harp his wife up out of hell     then dagonet turning on the ball of his foot  and whither harpst thou thine down and thyself  down and two more a helpful harper thou  that harpest downward dost thou know the star  we call the harp of arthur up in heaven     and tristram ay sir fool for when our king  was victor wellnigh day by day the knights  glorying in each new glory set his name  high on all hills and in the signs of heaven     and dagonet answerd ay and when the land  was freed and the queen false ye set yourself  to babble about him all to show your wit  and whether he were king by courtesy  or king by rightand so went harping down  the black kings highway got so far and grew  so witty that ye playd at ducks and drakes  with arthurs vows on the great lake of fire  tuwhoo do ye see it do ye see the star  nay fool said tristram not in open day  and dagonet nay nor will i see it and hear  it makes a silent music up in heaven  and i and arthur and the angels hear  and then we skip lo fool he said ye talk  fools treason is the king thy brother fool  then little dagonet clapt his hands and shrilld  ay ay my brother fool the king of fools  conceits himself as god that he can make  figs out of thistles silk from bristles milk  from burning spurge honey from hornetcombs  and men from beastslong live the king of fools     and down the city dagonet danced away  but thro the slowlymellowing avenues  and solitary passes of the wood  rode tristram toward lyonesse and the west  before him fled the face of queen isolt  with rubycircled neck but evermore  past as a rustle or twitter in the wood  made dull his inner keen his outer eye  for all that walkd or crept or perched or flew  anon the face as when a gust hath blown  unruffling waters recollect the shape  of one that in them sees himself returnd  but at the slot or fewmets of a deer  or evn a falln feather vanishd again     so on for all that day from lawn to lawn  thro many a leaguelong bower he rode at length  a lodge of intertwisted beechenboughs  furzecrammd and brackenrooft the which himself  built for a summer day with queen isolt  against a shower dark in the golden grove  appearing sent his fancy back to where  she lived a moon in that low lodge with him  till mark her lord had past the cornish king  with six or seven when tristram was away  and snatchd her thence yet dreading worse than shame  her warrior tristram spake not any word  but bode his hour devising wretchedness     and now that desert lodge to tristram lookt  so sweet that halting in he past and sank  down on a drift of foliage randomblown  but could not rest for musing how to smooth  and sleek his marriage over to the queen  perchance in lone tintagil far from all  the tonguesters of the court she had not heard  but then what folly had sent him overseas  after she left him lonely here a name  was it the name of one in brittany  isolt the daughter of the king isolt  of the white hands they calld her the sweet name  allured him first and then the maid herself  who served him well with those white hands of hers  and loved him well until himself had thought  he loved her also wedded easily  but left her all as easily and returnd  the blackblue irish hair and irish eyes  had drawn him homewhat marvel then he laid  his brows upon the drifted leaf and dreamd     he seemd to pace the strand of brittany  between isolt of britain and his bride  and showd them both the rubychain and both  began to struggle for it till his queen  graspt it so hard that all her hand was red  then cried the breton look her hand is red  these be no rubies this is frozen blood  and melts within her handher hand is hot  with ill desires but this i gave thee look  is all as cool and white as any flower  followd a rush of eagles wings and then  a whimpering of the spirit of the child  because the twain had spoild her carcanet     he dreamd but arthur with a hundred spears  rode far till oer the illimitable reed  and many a glancing plash and sallowy isle  the widewingd sunset of the misty marsh  glared on a huge machicolated tower  that stood with open doors whereout was rolld  a roar of riot as from men secure  amid their marshes ruffians at their ease  among their harlotbrides an evil song  lo there said one of arthurs youth for there  high on a grim dead tree before the tower  a goodly brother of the table round  swung by the neck and on the boughs a shield  showing a shower of blood in a field noir  and therebeside a horn inflamed the knights  at that dishonor done the gilded spur  till each would clash the shield and blow the horn  but arthur waved them back alone he rode  then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn  that sent the face of all the marsh aloft     an ever upwardrushing storm and cloud  of shriek and plume the red knight heard and all  even to tipmost lance and topmost helm  in bloodred armor sallying howld to the king  the teeth of hell flay bare and gnash thee flat  lo art thou not that eunuchhearted king  who fain had clipt free manhood from the world  the womanworshipper yea gods curse and i  slain was the brother of my paramour  by a knight of thine and i that heard her whine  and snivel being eunuchhearted too  sware by the scorpionworm that twists in hell  and stings itself to everlasting death  to hang whatever knight of thine i fought  and tumbled art thou kinglook to thy life  he ended arthur knew the voice the face  wellnigh was helmethidden and the name  went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind  and arthur deignd not use of word or sword  but let the drunkard as he stretchd from horse  to strike him overbalancing his bulk  down from the causeway heavily to the swamp  fall as the crest of some slowarching wave  heard in dead night along that tableshore  drops flat and after the great waters break  whitening for half a league and thin themselves  far over sands marbled with moon and cloud  from less and less to nothing thus he fell  headheavy while the knights who watchd him roard  and shouted and leapt down upon the falln  there trampled out his face from being known  and sank his head in mire and slimed themselves  nor heard the king for their own cries but sprang  thro open doors and swording right and left  men women on their sodden faces hurld  the tables over and the wines and slew  till all the rafters rang with womanyells  and all the pavement streamd with massacre  then yell with yell echoing they fired the tower  which half that autumn night like the live north  redpulsing up thro alioth and alcor  made all above it and a hundred meres  about it as the water moab saw  come round by the east and out beyond them flushd  the long low dune and lazyplunging sea     so all the ways were safe from shore to shore  but in the heart of arthur pain was lord  then out of tristram waking the red dream  fled with a shout and that low lodge returnd  midforest and the wind among the boughs  he whistled his good warhorse left to graze  among the forest greens vaulted upon him  and rode beneath an evershowering leaf  till one lone woman weeping near a cross  stayd him why weep ye lord she said my man  hath left me or is dead whereon he thought  what an she hate me now i would not this  what an she love me still i would not that  i know not what i wouldbut said to her  yet weep not thou lest if thy mate return  he find thy favor changed and love thee not  then pressing day by day thro lyonesse  last in a roky hollow belling heard  the hounds of mark and felt the goodly hounds  yelp at his heart but turning past and gaind  tintagil half in sea and high on land  a crown of towers     down in a casement sat  a low seasunset glorying round her hair  and glossythroated grace isolt the queen  and when she heard the feet of tristram grind  the spiring stone that scaled about her tower  flushd started met him at the doors and there  belted his body with her white embrace  crying aloud not marknot mark my soul  the footstep flutterd me at first not he  catlike thro his own castle steals my mark  but warriorwise thou stridest through his halls  who hates thee as i himevn to the death  my soul i felt my hatred for my mark  quicken within me and knew that thou wert nigh  to whom sir tristram smiling i am here  let be thy mark seeing he is not thine     and drawing somewhat backward she replied  can he be wrongd who is not evn his own  but save for dread of thee had beaten me  scratchd bitten blinded marrd me somehowmark  what rights are his that dare not strike for them  not lift a handnot tho he found me thus  but hearken have ye met him hence he went  today for three days huntingas he said  and so returns belike within an hour  marks way my soulbut eat not thou with him  because he hates thee even more than fears  nor drink and when thou passest any wood  close visor lest an arrow from the bush  should leave me all alone with mark and hell  my god the measure of my hate for mark  is as the measure of my love for thee     so pluckd one way by hate and one by love  draind of her force again she sat and spake  to tristram as he knelt before her saying  o hunter and o blower of the horn  harper and thou hast been a rover too  for ere i mated with my shambling king  ye twain had fallen out about the bride  of onehis name is out of methe prize  if prize she werewhat marvelshe could see  thine friend and ever since my craven seeks  to wreck thee villanously but o sir knight  what dame or damsel have ye kneeled to last     and tristram last to my queen paramount  here now to my queen paramount of love  and loveliness ay lovelier than when first  her light feet fell on our rough lyonesse  sailing from ireland     softly laughd isolt  flatter me not for hath not our great queen  my dole of beauty trebled and he said  her beauty is her beauty and thine thine  and thine is more to mesoft gracious kind  save when thy mark is kindled on thy lips  most gracious but she haughty evn to him  lancelot for i have seen him wan enow  to make one doubt if ever the great queen  have yielded him her love     to whom isolt  ah then false hunter and false harper thou  who brakest thro the scruple of my bond  calling me thy white hind and saying to me  that guinevere had sinned against the highest  and imisyoked with such a want of man  that i could hardly sin against the lowest     he answerd o my soul be comforted  if this be sweet to sin in leadingstrings  if here be comfort and if ours be sin  crownd warrant had we for the crowning sin  that made us happy but how ye greet mefear  and fault and doubtno word of that fond tale  thy deep heartyearnings thy sweet memories  of tristram in that year he was away     and saddening on the sudden spake isolt  i had forgotten all in my strong joy  to see theeyearningsay for hour by hour  here in the neverended afternoon  o sweeter than all memories of thee  deeper than any yearnings after thee  seemd those farrolling westwardsmiling seas  watched from this tower isolt of britain dashd  before isolt of brittany on the strand  would that have chilld her bridekiss wedded her  fought in her fathers battles wounded there  the king was all fulfilld with gratefulness  and she my namesake of the hands that heald  thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress  wellcan i wish her any huger wrong  than having known thee her too hast thou left  to pine and waste in those sweet memories  o were i not my marks by whom all men  are noble i should hate thee more than love     and tristram fondling her light hands replied  grace queen for being loved she loved me well  did i love her the name at least i loved  isolti fought his battles for isolt  the night was dark the true star set isolt  the name was ruler of the darkisolt  care not for her patient and prayerful meek  paleblooded she will yield herself to god  and isolt answerd yea and why not i  mine is the larger need who am not meek  paleblooded prayerful let me tell thee now  here one black mute midsummer night i sat  lonely but musing on thee wondering where  murmuring a light song i had heard thee sing  and once or twice i spake thy name aloud  then flashd a levinbrand and near me stood  in fuming sulphur blue and green a fiend  marks way to steal behind one in the dark  for there was mark he has wedded her he said  not said but hissd it then this crown of towers  so shook to such a roar of all the sky  that here in utter dark i swoond away  and woke again in utter dark and cried  i will flee hence and give myself to god  and thou wert lying in thy new lemans arms     then tristram ever dallying with her hand  may god be with thee sweet when old and gray  and past desire a saying that angerd her  may god be with thee sweet when thou art old  and sweet no more to me i need him now  for when had lancelot utterd aught so gross  evn to the swineherds malkin in the mast  the greater man the greater courtesy  but thou thro ever harrying thy wild beasts  save that to touch a harp tilt with a lance  becomes thee wellart grown wild beast thyself  how darest thou if lover push me even  in fancy from thy side and set me far  in the gray distance half a life away  her to be loved no more unsay it unswear  flatter me rather seeing me so weak  broken with mark and hate and solitude  thy marriage and mine own that i should suck  lies like sweet wines lie to me i believe  will ye not lie not swear as there ye kneel  and solemnly as when ye sware to him  the man of men our kingmy god the power  was once in vows when men believed the king  they lied not then who sware and thro their vows  the king prevailing made his realmi say  swear to me thou wilt love me evn when old  grayhaired and past desire and in despair     then tristram pacing moodily up and down  vows did ye keep the vow ye made to mark  more than i mine lied say ye nay but learnt  the vow that binds too strictly snaps itself  my knighthood taught me thisay being snapt  we run more counter to the soul thereof  than had we never sworn i swear no more  i swore to the great king and am forsworn  for onceevn to the heighti honord him  man is he man at all methought when first  i rode from our rough lyonesse and beheld  that victor of the pagan throned in hall  his hair a sun that rayd from off a brow  like hillsnow high in heaven the steelblue eyes  the golden beard that clothed his lips with light  moreover that weird legend of his birth  with merlins mystic babble about his end  amazed me then his foot was on a stool  shaped as a dragon he seemd to me no man  but michael trampling satan so i sware  being amazed but this went bythe vows  o aythe wholesome madness of an hour  they served their use their time for every knight  believed himself a greater than himself  and every follower eyed him as a god  till he being lifted up beyond himself  did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done  and so the realm was made but then their vows  first mainly thro that sullying of our queen  began to gall the knighthood asking whence  had arthur right to bind them to himself  dropt down from heaven washd up from out the deep  they faild to trace him thro the flesh and blood  of our old kings whence then a doubtful lord  to bind them by inviolable vows  which flesh and blood perforce would violate  for feel this arm of minethe tide within  red with free chase and heatherscented air  pulsing full man can arthur make me pure  as any maiden child lock up my tongue  from uttering freely what i freely hear  bind me to one the great world laughs at it  and worldling of the world am i and know  the ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour  wooes his own end we are not angels here  nor shall be vowsi am woodman of the woods  and hear the garnetheaded yaffingale  mock them my soul we love but while we may  and therefore is my love so large for thee  seeing it is not bounded save by love     here ending he moved toward her and she said  good an i turnd away my love for thee  to some one thrice as courteous as thyself  for courtesy wins woman all as well  as valor maybut he that closes both  is perfect he is lancelottaller indeed  rosier and comelier thoubut say i loved  this knightliest of all knights and cast thee back  thine own small saw we love but while we may  well then what answer     he that while she spake  mindful of what he brought to adorn her with  the jewels had let one finger lightly touch  the warm white apple of her throat replied  press this a little closer sweet until  come i am hungerd and halfangerdmeat  wine wineand i will love thee to the death  and out beyond into the dream to come     so then when both were brought to full accord  she rose and set before him all he willd  and after these had comforted the blood  with meats and wines and satiated their hearts  now talking of their woodland paradise  the deer the dews the fern the founts the lawns  now mocking at the much ungainliness  and craven shifts and long crane legs of mark  then tristram laughing caught the harp and sang     ay ay o aythe winds that bend the brier  a star in heaven a star within the mere  ay ay o aya star was my desire  and one was far apart and one was near  ay ay o aythe winds that bow the grass  and one was water and one star was fire  and one will ever shine and one will pass  ay ay o aythe winds that move the mere     then in the lights last glimmer tristram showd  and swung the ruby carcanet she cried  the collar of some order which our king  hath newly founded all for thee my soul  for thee to yield thee grace beyond thy peers  not so my queen he said but the red fruit  grown on a magic oaktree in midheaven  and won by

questiond it  what art thou and the voice about his feet  sent up an answer sobbing i am thy fool  and i shall never make thee smile again
