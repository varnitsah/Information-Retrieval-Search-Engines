46740596	the frozen deep  by wilkie collins     first scenethe ballroom    chapter 1  the date is between twenty and thirty years ago the place is an english seaport the time is night and the business of the moment isdancing  the mayor and corporation of the town are giving a grand ball in celebration of the departure of an arctic expedition from their port the ships of the expedition are two in numberthe wanderer and the seamew they are to sail in search of the northwest passage on the next day with the morning tide  honor to the mayor and corporation it is a brilliant ball the band is complete the room is spacious the large conservatory opening out of it is pleasantly lighted with chinese lanterns and beautifully decorated with shrubs and flowers all officers of the army and navy who are present wear their uniforms in honor of the occasion among the ladies the display of dresses a subject which the men dont understand is bewilderingand the average of beauty a subject which the men do understand is the highest average attainable in all parts of the room  for the moment the dance which is in progress is a quadrille general admiration selects two of the ladies who are dancing as its favorite objects one is a dark beauty in the prime of womanhoodthe wife of first lieutenant crayford of the wanderer the other is a young girl pale and delicate dressed simply in white with no ornament on her head but her own lovely brown hair this is miss clara burnhaman orphan she is mrs crayfords dearest friend and she is to stay with mrs crayford during the lieutenants absence in the arctic regions she is now dancing with the lieutenant himself for partner and with mrs crayford and captain helding commanding officer of the wanderer for visavisin plain english for opposite couple  the conversation between captain helding and mrs crayford in one of the intervals of the dance turns on miss burnham the captain is greatly interested in clara he admires her beauty but he thinks her mannerfor a young girlstrangely serious and subdued is she in delicate health  mrs crayford shakes her head sighs mysteriously and answers  in very delicate health captain helding  consumptive  not in the least  i am glad to hear that she is a charming creature mrs crayford she interests me indescribably if i was only twenty years youngerperhaps as i am not twenty years younger i had better not finish the sentence is it indiscreet my dear lady to inquire what is the matter with her  it might be indiscreet on the part of a stranger said mrs crayford an old friend like you may make any inquiries i wish i could tell you what is the matter with clara it is a mystery to the doctors themselves some of the mischief is due in my humble opinion to the manner in which she has been brought up  ay ay a bad school i suppose  very bad captain helding but not the sort of school which you have in your mind at this moment claras early years were spent in a lonely old house in the highlands of scotland the ignorant people about her were the people who did the mischief which i have just been speaking of they filled her mind with the superstitions which are still respected as truths in the wild northespecially the superstition called the second sight  god bless me cried the captain you dont mean to say she believes in such stuff as that in these enlightened times too  mrs crayford looked at her partner with a satirical smile  in these enlightened times captain helding we only believe in dancing tables and in messages sent from the other world by spirits who cant spell by comparison with such superstitions as these even the second sight has somethingin the shape of poetryto recommend it surely estimate for yourself she continued seriously the effect of such surroundings as i have described on a delicate sensitive young creaturea girl with a naturally imaginative temperament leading a lonely neglected life is it so very surprising that she should catch the infection of the superstition about her and is it quite incomprehensible that her nervous system should suffer accordingly at a very critical period of her life  not at all mrs crayfordnot at all maam as you put it still it is a little startling to a commonplace man like me to meet a young lady at a ball who believes in the second sight does she really profess to see into the future am i to understand that she positively falls into a trance and sees people in distant countries and foretells events to come that is the second sight is it not  that is the second sight captain and that is really and positively what she does  the young lady who is dancing opposite to us  the young lady who is dancing opposite to us  the captain waited a littleletting the new flood of information which had poured in on him settle itself steadily in his mind this process accomplished the arctic explorer proceeded resolutely on his way to further discoveries  may i ask maam if you have ever seen her in a state of trance with your own eyes he inquired  my sister and i both saw her in the trance little more than a month since mrs crayford replied she had been nervous and irritable all the morning and we took her out into the garden to breathe the fresh air suddenly without any reason for it the color left her face she stood between us insensible to touch insensible to sound motionless as stone and cold as death in a moment the first change we noticed came after a lapse of some minutes her hands began to move slowly as if she was groping in the dark words dropped one by one from her lips in a lost vacant tone as if she was talking in her sleep whether what she said referred to past or future i cannot tell you she spoke of persons in a foreign countryperfect strangers to my sister and to me after a little interval she suddenly became silent a momentary color appeared in her face and left it again her eyes closedher feet failed herand she sank insensible into our arms  sank insensible into your arms repeated the captain absorbing his new information most extraordinary andin this state of healthshe goes out to parties and dances more extraordinary still  you are entirely mistaken said mrs crayford she is only here tonight to please me and she is only dancing to please my husband as a rule she shuns all society the doctor recommends change and amusement for her she wont listen to him except on rare occasions like this she persists in remaining at home  captain helding brightened at the allusion to the doctor something practical might be got out of the doctor scientific man sure to see this very obscure subject under a new light how does it strike the doctor now said the captain viewed simply as a case maam how does it strike the doctor  he will give no positive opinion mrs crayford answered he told me that such cases as claras were by no means unfamiliar to medical practice we know he told me that certain disordered conditions of the brain and the nervous system produce results quite as extraordinary as any that you have describedand there our knowledge ends neither my science nor any mans science can clear up the mystery in this case it is an especially difficult case to deal with because miss burnhams early associations dispose her to attach a superstitious importance to the maladythe hysterical malady as some doctors would call itfrom which she suffers i can give you instructions for preserving her general health and i can recommend you to try some change in her lifeprovided you first relieve her mind of any secret anxieties that may possibly be preying on it  the captain smiled selfapprovingly the doctor had justified his anticipations the doctor had suggested a practical solution of the difficulty  ay ay at last we have hit the nail on the head secret anxieties yes yes plain enough now a disappointment in loveeh mrs crayford  i dont know captain helding i am quite in the dark claras confidence in mein other matters unboundedis in this matter of her supposed anxieties a confidence still withheld in all else we are like sisters i sometimes fear there may indeed be some trouble preying secretly on her mind i sometimes feel a little hurt at her incomprehensible silence  captain helding was ready with his own practical remedy for this difficulty  encouragement is all she wants maam take my word for it this matter rests entirely with you its all in a nutshell encourage her to confide in youand she will confide  i am waiting to encourage her captain until she is left alone with meafter you have all sailed for the arctic seas in the meantime will you consider what i have said to you as intended for your ear only and will you forgive me if i own that the turn the subject has taken does not tempt me to pursue it any further  the captain took the hint he instantly changed the subject choosing on this occasion safe professional topics he spoke of ships that were ordered on foreign service and finding that these as subjects failed to interest mrs crayford he spoke next of ships that were ordered home again this last experiment produced its effectan effect which the captain had not bargained for  do you know he began that the atalanta is expected back from the west coast of africa every day have you any acquaintances among the officers of that ship  as it so happened he put those questions to mrs crayford while they were engaged in one of the figures of the dance which brought them within hearing of the opposite couple at the same momentto the astonishment of her friends and admirersmiss clara burnham threw the quadrille into confusion by making a mistake everybody waited to see her set the mistake right she made no attempt to set it rightshe turned deadly pale and caught her partner by the arm  the heat she said faintly take me awaytake me into the air  lieutenant crayford instantly led her out of the dance and took her into the cool and empty conservatory at the end of the room as a matter of course captain helding and mrs crayford left the quadrille at the same time the captain saw his way to a joke  is this the trance coming on he whispered if it is as commander of the arctic expedition i have a particular request to make will the second sight oblige me by seeing the shortest way to the northwest passage before we leave england  mrs crayford declined to humor the joke if you will excuse my leaving you she said quietly i will try and find out what is the matter with miss burnham  at the entrance to the conservatory mrs crayford encountered her husband the lieutenant was of middle age tall and comely a man with a winning simplicity and gentleness in his manner and an irresistible kindness in his brave blue eyes in one word a man whom everybody lovedincluding his wife  dont be alarmed said the lieutenant the heat has overcome herthats all  mrs crayford shook her head and looked at her husband half satirically half fondly  you dear old innocent she exclaimed that excuse may do for you for my part i dont believe a word of it go and get another partner and leave clara to me  she entered the conservatory and seated herself by claras side    chapter 2   now my dear mrs crayford began what does this mean  nothing  that wont do clara try again  the heat of the room  that wont do either say that you choose to keep your own secrets and i shall understand what you mean  claras sad clear gray eyes looked up for the first time in mrs crayfords face and suddenly became dimmed with tears  if i only dared tell you she murmured i hold so to your good opinion of me lucyand i am so afraid of losing it  mrs crayfords manner changed her eyes rested gravely and anxiously on claras face  you know as well as i do that nothing can shake my affection for you she said do justice my child to your old friend there is nobody here to listen to what we say open your heart clara i see you are in trouble and i want to comfort you  clara began to yield in other words she began to make conditions  will you promise to keep what i tell you a secret from every living creature she began  mrs crayford met that question by putting a question on her side  does every living creature include my husband  your husband more than anybody i love him i revere him he is so noble he is so good if i told him what i am going to tell you he would despise me own it plainly lucy if i am asking too much in asking you to keep a secret from your husband  nonsense child when you are married you will know that the easiest of all secrets to keep is a secret from your husband i give you my promise now begin  clara hesitated painfully  i dont know how to begin she exclaimed with a burst of despair the words wont come to me  then i must help you do you feel ill tonight do you feel as you felt that day when you were with my sister and me in the garden  oh no  you are not ill you are not really affected by the heatand yet you turn as pale as ashes and you are obliged to leave the quadrille there must be some reason for this  there is a reason captain helding  captain helding what in the name of wonder has the captain to do with it  he told you something about the atalanta he said the atalanta was expected back from africa immediately  well and what of that is there anybody in whom you are interested coming home in the ship  somebody whom i am afraid of is coming home in the ship  mrs crayfords magnificent black eyes opened wide in amazement  my dear clara do you really mean what you say  wait a little lucy and you shall judge for yourself we must go backif i am to make you understand meto the year before we knew each otherto the last year of my fathers life did i ever tell you that my father moved southward for the sake of his health to a house in kent that was lent to him by a friend  no my dear i dont remember ever hearing of the house in kent tell me about it  there is nothing to tell except this the new house was near a fine countryseat standing in its own park the owner of the place was a gentleman named wardour he too was one of my fathers kentish friends he had an only son  she paused and played nervously with her fan mrs crayford looked at her attentively claras eyes remained fixed on her fanclara said no more what was the sons name asked mrs crayford quietly  richard  am i right clara in suspecting that mr richard wardour admired you  the question produced its intended effect the question helped clara to go on  i hardly knew at first she said whether he admired me or not he was very strange in his waysheadstrong terribly headstrong and passionate but generous and affectionate in spite of his faults of temper can you understand such a character  such characters exist by thousands i have my faults of temper i begin to like richard already go on  the days went by lucy and the weeks went by we were thrown very much together i began little by little to have some suspicion of the truth  and richard helped to confirm your suspicions of course  no he was notunhappily for mehe was not that sort of man he never spoke of the feeling with which he regarded me it was i who saw it i couldnt help seeing it i did all i could to show that i was willing to be a sister to him and that i could never be anything else he did not understand me or he would not i cant say which  would not is the most likely my dear go on  it might have been as you say there was a strange rough bashfulness about him he confused and puzzled me he never spoke out he seemed to treat me as if our future lives had been provided for while we were children what could i do lucy  do you could have asked your father to end the difficulty for you  impossible you forget what i have just told you my father was suffering at that time under the illness which afterward caused his death he was quite unfit to interfere  was there no one else who could help you  no one  no lady in whom you could confide  i had acquaintances among the ladies in the neighborhood i had no friends  what did you do then  nothing i hesitated i put off coming to an explanation with him unfortunately until it was too late  what do you mean by too late  you shall hear i ought to have told you that richard wardour is in the navy  indeed i am more interested in him than ever well  one spring day richard came to our house to take leave of us before he joined his ship i thought he was gone and i went into the next room it was my own sittingroom and it opened on to the garden  yes  richard must have been watching me he suddenly appeared in the garden without waiting for me to invite him he walked into the room i was a little startled as well as surprised but i managed to hide it i said what is it mr wardour he stepped close up to me he said in his quick rough way clara i am going to the african coast if i live i shall come back promoted and we both know what will happen then he kissed me i was half frightened half angry before i could compose myself to say a word he was out in the garden againhe was gone i ought to have spoken i know it was not honorable not kind toward him you cant reproach me for my want of courage and frankness more bitterly than i reproach myself  my dear child i dont reproach you i only think you might have written to him  i did write  plainly  yes i told him in so many words that he was deceiving himself and that i could never marry him  plain enough in all conscience having said that surely you are not to blame what are you fretting about now  suppose my letter has never reached him  why should you suppose anything of the sort  what i wrote required an answer lucyasked for an answer the answer has never come what is the plain conclusion my letter has never reached him and the atalanta is expected back richard wardour is returning to englandrichard wardour will claim me as his wife you wondered just now if i really meant what i said do you doubt it still  mrs crayford leaned back absently in her chair for the first time since the conversation had begun she let a question pass without making a reply the truth is mrs crayford was thinking  she saw claras position plainly she understood the disturbing effect of it on the mind of a young girl still making all allowances she felt quite at a loss so far to account for claras excessive agitation her quick observing faculty had just detected that claras face showed no signs of relief now that she had unburdened herself of her secret there was something clearly under the surface heresomething of importance that still remained to be discovered a shrewd doubt crossed mrs crayfords mind and inspired the next words which she addressed to her young friend  my dear she said abruptly have you told me all  clara started as if the question terrified her feeling sure that she now had the clew in her hand mrs crayford deliberately repeated her question in another form of words instead of answering clara suddenly looked up at the same moment a faint flush of color appeared in her face for the first time  looking up instinctively on her side mrs crayford became aware of the presence in the conservatory of a young gentleman who was claiming clara as his partner in the coming waltz mrs crayford fell into thinking once more had this young gentleman she asked herself anything to do with the untold end of the story was this the true secret of clara burnhams terror at the impending return of richard wardour mrs crayford decided on putting her doubts to the test  a friend of yours my dear she asked innocently suppose you introduce us to each other  clara confusedly introduced the young gentleman  mr francis aldersley lucy mr aldersley belongs to the arctic expedition  attached to the expedition mrs crayford repeated i am attached to the expedition tooin my way i had better introduce myself mr aldersley as clara seems to have forgotten to do it for me i am mrs crayford my husband is lieutenant crayford of the wanderer do you belong to that ship  i have not the honor mrs crayford i belong to the seamew  mrs crayfords superb eyes looked shrewdly backward and forward between clara and francis aldersley and saw the untold sequel to claras story the young officer was a bright handsome gentlemanlike lad just the person to seriously complicate the difficulty with richard wardour there was no time for making any further inquiries the band had begun the prelude to the waltz and francis aldersley was waiting for his partner with a word of apology to the young man mrs crayford drew clara aside for a moment and spoke to her in a whisper  one word my dear before you return to the ballroom it may sound conceited after the little you have told me but i think i understand your position now better than you do yourself do you want to hear my opinion  i am longing to hear it lucy i want your opinion i want your advice  you shall have both in the plainest and fewest words first my opinion you have no choice but to come to an explanation with mr wardour as soon as he returns second my advice if you wish to make the explanation easy to both sides take care that you make it in the character of a free woman  she laid a strong emphasis on the last three words and looked pointedly at francis aldersley as she pronounced them i wont keep you from your partner any longer clara she resumed and led the way back to the ballroom    chapter 3   the burden on claras mind weighs on it more heavily than ever after what mrs crayford has said to her she is too unhappy to feel the inspiriting influence of the dance after a turn round the room she complains of fatigue mr francis aldersley looks at the conservatory still as invitingly cool and empty as ever leads her back to it and places her on a seat among the shrubs she triesvery feeblyto dismiss him  dont let me keep you from dancing mr aldersley  he seats himself by her side and feasts his eyes on the lovely downcast face that dares not turn toward him he whispers to her  call me frank  she longs to call him frankshe loves him with all her heart but mrs crayfords warning words are still in her mind she never opens her lips her lover moves a little closer and asks another favor men are all alike on these occasions silence invariably encourages them to try again  clara have you forgotten what i said at the concert yesterday may i say it again  no  we sail tomorrow for the arctic seas i may not return for years dont send me away without hope think of the long lonely time in the dark north make it a happy time for me  though he speaks with the fervor of a man he is little more than a lad he is only twenty years old and he is going to risk his young life on the frozen deep clara pities him as she never pitied any human creature before he gently takes her hand she tries to release it  what not even that little favor on the last night  her faithful heart takes his part in spite of her her hand remains in his and feels its soft persuasive pressure she is a lost woman it is only a question of time now  clara do you love me  there is a pause she shrinks from looking at himshe trembles with strange contradictory sensations of pleasure and pain his arm steals round her he repeats his question in a whisper his lips almost touch her little rosy ear as he says it again  do you love me  she closes her eyes faintlyshe hears nothing but those wordsfeels nothing but his arm round herforgets mrs crayfords warningforgets richard wardour himselfturns suddenly with a loving womans desperate disregard of everything but her lovenestles her head on his bosom and answers him in that way at last  he lifts the beautiful drooping headtheir lips meet in their first kissthey are both in heaven it is clara who brings them back to earth again with a startit is clara who says oh what have i doneas usual when it is too late  frank answers the question  you have made me happy my angel now when i come back i come back to make you my wife  she shudders she remembers richard wardour again at those words  mind she says nobody is to know we are engaged till i permit you to mention it remember that  he promises to remember it his arm tries to wind round her once more no she is mistress of herself she can positively dismiss him nowafter she has let him kiss her  go she says i want to see mrs crayford find her say i am here waiting to speak to her go at once frankfor my sake  there is no alternative but to obey her his eyes drink a last draught of her beauty he hurries away on his errandthe happiest man in the room five minutes since she was only his partner in the dance he has spokenand she has pledged herself to be his partner for life    chapter 4   it was not easy to find mrs crayford in the crowd searching here and searching there frank became conscious of a stranger who appeared to be looking for somebody on his side he was a dark heavybrowed stronglybuilt man dressed in a shabby old naval officers uniform his mannerstrikingly resolute and selfcontainedwas unmistakably the manner of a gentleman he wound his way slowly through the crowd stopping to look at every lady whom he passed and then looking away again with a frown little by little he approached the conservatoryentered it after a moments reflectiondetected the glimmer of a white dress in the distance through the shrubs and flowersadvanced to get a nearer view of the ladyand burst into claras presence with a cry of delight  she sprang to her feet she stood before him speechless motionless struck to stone all her life was in her eyesthe eyes which told her she was looking at richard wardour  he was the first to speak  i am sorry i startled you my darling i forgot everything but the happiness of seeing you again we only reached our moorings two hours since i was some time inquiring after you and some time getting my ticket when they told me you were at the ball wish me joy clara i am promoted i have come back to make you my wife  a momentary change passed over the blank terror of her face her color rose faintly her lips moved she abruptly put a question to him  did you get my letter  he started a letter from you i never received it  the momentary animation died out of her face again she drew back from him and dropped into a chair he advanced toward her astonished and alarmed she shrank in the chairshrank as if she was frightened of him  clara you have not even shaken hands with me what does it mean  he paused waiting and watching her she made no reply a flash of the quick temper in him leaped up in his eyes he repeated his last words in louder and sterner tones  what does it mean  she replied this time his tone had hurt herhis tone had roused her sinking courage  it means mr wardour that you have been mistaken from the first  how have i been mistaken  you have been under a wrong impression and you have given me no opportunity of setting you right  in what way have i been wrong  you have been too hasty and too confident about yourself and about me you have entirely misunderstood me i am grieved to distress you but for your sake i must speak plainly i am your friend always mr wardour i can never be your wife  he mechanically repeated the last words he seemed to doubt whether he had heard her aright  you can never be my wife  never  why  there was no answer she was incapable of telling him a falsehood she was ashamed to tell him the truth  he stooped over her and suddenly possessed himself of her hand holding her hand firmly he stooped a little lower searching for the signs which might answer him in her face his own face darkened slowly while he looked he was beginning to suspect her and he acknowledged it in his next words  something has changed you toward me clara somebody has influenced you against me is ityou force me to ask the questionis it some other man  you have no right to ask me that  he went on without noticing what she had said to him  has that other man come between you and me i speak plainly on my side speak plainly on yours  i have spoken i have nothing more to say  there was a pause she saw the warning light which told of the fire within him growing brighter and brighter in his eyes she felt his grasp strengthening on her hand he appealed to her for the last time  reflect he said reflect before it is too late your silence will not serve you if you persist in not answering me i shall take your silence as a confession do you hear me  i hear you  clara burnham i am not to be trifled with clara burnham i insist on the truth are you false to me  she resented that searching question with a womans keen sense of the insult that is implied in doubting her to her face  mr wardour you forget yourself when you call me to account in that way i never encouraged you i never gave you promise or pledge  he passionately interrupted her before she could say more  you have engaged yourself in my absence your words own it your looks own it you have engaged yourself to another man  if i have engaged myself what right have you to complain of it she answered firmly what right have you to control my actions  the next words died away on her lips he suddenly dropped her hand a marked change appeared in the expression of his eyesa change which told her of the terrible passions that she had let loose in him she read dimly read something in his face which made her tremblenot for herself but for frank  little by little the dark color faded out of his face his deep voice dropped suddenly to a low and quiet tone as he spoke the parting words  say no more miss burnhamyou have said enough i am answered i am dismissed he paused and stepping close up to her laid his hand on her arm  the time may come he said when i shall forgive you but the man who has robbed me of you shall rue the day when you and he first met  he turned and left her  a few minutes later mrs crayford entering the conservatory was met by one of the attendants at the ball the man stopped as if he wished to speak to her  what do you want she asked  i beg your pardon maam do you happen to have a smellingbottle about you there is a young lady in the conservatory who is taken faint     between the scenesthe landing stage    chapter 5   the morning of the next daythe morning on which the ships were to sailcame bright and breezy mrs crayford having arranged to follow her husband to the waterside and see the last of him before he embarked entered claras room on her way out of the house anxious to hear how her young friend passed the night to her astonishment she found clara had risen and was dressed like herself to go out  what does this mean my dear after what you suffered last nightafter the shock of seeing that manwhy dont you take my advice and rest in your bed  i cant rest i have not slept all night have you been out yet  no  have you seen or heard anything of richard wardour  what an extraordinary question  answer my question dont trifle with me  compose yourself clara i have neither seen nor heard anything of richard wardour take my word for it he is far enough away by this time  no he is here he is near us all night long the presentiment has pursued mefrank and richard wardour will meet  my dear child what are you thinking of they are total strangers to each other  something will happen to bring them together i feel it i know it they will meetthere will be a mortal quarrel between themand i shall be to blame oh lucy why didnt i take your advice why was i mad enough to let frank know that i loved him are you going to the landingstage i am all readyi must go with you  you must not think of it clara there will be crowding and confusion at the waterside you are not strong enough to bear it waiti wont be long awaywait till i come back  i must and will go with you crowd he will be among the crowd confusion in that confusion he will find his way to frank dont ask me to wait i shall go mad if i wait i shall not know a moments ease until i have seen frank with my own eyes safe in the boat which takes him to his ship you have got your bonnet on what are we stopping here for come or i shall go without you look at the clock we have not a moment to lose  it was useless to contend with her mrs crayford yielded the two women left the house together  the landingstage as mrs crayford had predicted was thronged with spectators not only the relatives and friends of the arctic voyagers but strangers as well had assembled in large numbers to see the ships sail claras eyes wandered affrightedly hither and thither among the strange faces in the crowd searching for the one face that she dreaded to see and not finding it so completely were her nerves unstrung that she started with a cry of alarm on suddenly hearing franks voice behind her  the seamews boats are waiting he said i must go darling how pale you are looking clara are you ill  she never answered she questioned him with wild eyes and trembling lips  has anything happened to you frank anything out of the common  frank laughed at the strange question  anything out of the common he repeated nothing that i know of except sailing for the arctic seas thats out of the common i supposeisnt it  has anybody spoken to you since last night has any stranger followed you in the street  frank turned in blank amazement to mrs crayford  what on earth does she mean  mrs crayfords lively invention supplied her with an answer on the spur of the moment  do you believe in dreams frank of course you dont clara has been dreaming about you and clara is foolish enough to believe in dreams thats allits not worth talking about hark they are calling you say goodby or you will be too late for the boat  frank took claras hand long afterwardin the dark arctic days in the dreary arctic nightshe remembered how coldly and how passively that hand lay in his  courage clara he said gayly a sailors sweetheart must accustom herself to partings the time will soon pass goodby my darling goodby my wife  he kissed the cold hand he looked his lastfor many a long year perhapsat the pale and beautiful face how she loves me he thought how the parting distresses her he still held her hand he would have lingered longer if mrs crayford had not wisely waived all ceremony and pushed him away  the two ladies followed him at a safe distance through the crowd and saw him step into the boat the oars struck the water frank waved his cap to clara in a moment more a vessel at anchor hid the boat from view they had seen the last of him on his way to the frozen deep  no richard wardour in the boat said mrs crayford no richard wardour on the shore let this be a lesson to you my dear never be foolish enough to believe in presentiments again  claras eyes still wandered suspiciously to and fro among the crowd  are you not satisfied yet asked mrs crayford  no clara answered i am not satisfied yet  what still looking for him this is really too absurd here is my husband coming i shall tell him to call a cab and send you home  clara drew back a few steps  i wont be in the way lucy while you are taking leave of your good husband she said i will wait here  wait here what for  for something which i may yet see or for something which i may still hear  richard wardour  richard wardour  mrs crayford turned to her husband without another word claras infatuation was beyond the reach of remonstrance  the boats of the wanderer took the place at the landingstage vacated by the boats of the seamew a burst of cheering among the outer ranks of the crowd announced the arrival of the commander of the expedition on the scene captain helding appeared looking right and left for his first lieutenant finding crayford with his wife the captain made his apologies for interfering with his best grace  give him up to his professional duties for one minute mrs crayford and you shall have him back again for half an hour the arctic expedition is to blame my dear ladynot the captainfor parting man and wife in crayfords place i should have left it to the bachelors to find the northwest passage and have stopped at home with you  excusing himself in those bluntly complimentary terms captain helding drew the lieutenant aside a few steps accidentally taking a direction that led the two officers close to the place at which clara was standing both the captain and the lieutenant were too completely absorbed in their professional business to notice her neither the one nor the other had the faintest suspicion that she could and did hear every word of the talk that passed between them  you received my note this morning the captain began  certainly captain helding or i should have been on board the ship before this  i am going on board myself at once the captain proceeded but i must ask you to keep your boat waiting for half an hour more you will be all the longer with your wife you know i thought of that crayford  i am much obliged to you captain helding i suppose there is some other reason for inverting the customary order of things and keeping the lieutenant on shore after the captain is on board  quite true there is another reason i want you to wait for a volunteer who has just joined us  a volunteer  yes he has his outfit to get in a hurry and he may be half an hour late  its rather a sudden appointment isnt it  no doubt very sudden  andpardon meits rather a long time as we are situated to keep the ships waiting for one man  quite true again but a man who is worth having is worth waiting for this man is worth having this man is worth his weight in gold to such an expedition as ours seasoned to all climates and all fatiguesa strong fellow a brave fellow a clever fellowin short an excellent officer i know him well or i should never have taken him the country gets plenty of work out of my new volunteer crayford he only returned yesterday from foreign service  he only returned yesterday from foreign service and he volunteers this morning to join the arctic expedition you astonish me  i dare say i do you cant be more astonished than i was when he presented himself at my hotel and told me what he wanted why my good fellow you have just got home i said are you weary of your freedom after only a few hours experience of it his answer rather startled me he said i am weary of my life sir i have come home and found a trouble to welcome me which goes near to break my heart if i dont take refuge in absence and hard work i am a lost man will you give me a refuge thats what he said crayford word for word  did you ask him to explain himself further  not i i knew his value and i took the poor devil on the spot without pestering him with any more questions no need to ask him to explain himself the facts speak for themselves in these cases the old story my good friend theres a woman at the bottom of it of course   mrs crayford waiting for the return of her husband as patiently as she could was startled by feeling a hand suddenly laid on her shoulder she looked round and confronted clara her first feeling of surprise changed instantly to alarm clara was trembling from head to foot  what is the matter what has frightened you my dear  lucy i have heard of him  richard wardour again  remember what i told you i have heard every word of the conversation between captain helding and your husband a man came to the captain this morning and volunteered to join the wanderer the captain has taken him the man is richard wardour  you dont mean it are you sure did you hear captain helding mention his name  no  then

to his wife she spoke to him instantly  william you have got a new volunteer who joins the wanderer  what you have been listening to the captain and me  i want to know his name  how in the world did you manage to hear what we said to each other  his name has the captain given you his name  dont excite yourself my dear look you are positively alarming miss burnham the new volunteer is a perfect stranger to us there is his namelast on the ships list  mrs crayford snatched the list out of her husbands hand and read the name  richard wardour     second scenethe hut of the seamew    chapter 6   goodby to england goodby to inhabited and civilized regions of the earth  two years have passed since the voyagers sailed from their native shores the enterprise has failedthe arctic expedition is lost and icelocked in the polar wastes the good ships wanderer and seamew entombed in ice will never ride the buoyant waters more stripped of their lighter timbers both vessels have been used for the construction of huts erected on the nearest land  the largest of the two buildings which now shelter the lost men is occupied by the surviving officers and crew of the seamew on one side of the principal room are the sleeping berths and the fireplace the other side discloses a broad doorway closed by a canvas screen which serves as a means of communication with an inner apartment devoted to the superior officers a hammock is slung to the rough raftered roof of the main room as an extra bed a man completely hidden by his bedclothes is sleeping in the hammock by the fireside there is a second mansupposed to be on the watchfast asleep poor wretch at the present moment behind the sleeper stands an old cask which serves for a table the objects at present on the table are a pestle and mortar and a saucepanful of the dry bones of animalsin plain words the dinner for the day by way of ornament to the dull brown walls icicles appear in the crevices of the timber gleaming at intervals in the red firelight no wind whistles outside the lonely dwellingno cry of bird or beast is heard indoors and outofdoors the awful silence of the polar desert reigns for the moment undisturbed    chapter 7   the first sound that broke the silence came from the inner apartment an officer lifted the canvas screen in the hut of the seamew and entered the main room cold and privation had badly thinned the ranks the commander of the shipcaptain ebsworthwas dangerously ill the first lieutenant was dead an officer of the wanderer filled their places for the time with captain heldings permission the officer so employed waslieutenant crayford  he approached the man at the fireside and awakened him  jump up bateson its your turn to be relieved  the relief appeared rising from a heap of old sails at the back of the hut bateson vanished yawning to his bed lieutenant crayford walked backward and forward briskly trying what exercise would do toward warming his blood  the pestle and mortar on the cask attracted his attention he stopped and looked up at the man in the hammock  i must rouse the cook he said to himself with a smile that fellow little thinks how useful he is in keeping up my spirits the most inveterate croaker and grumbler in the worldand yet according to his own account the only cheerful man in the whole ships company john want john want rouse up there  a head rose slowly out of the bedclothes covered with a red nightcap a melancholy nose rested itself on the edge of the hammock a voice worthy of the nose expressed its opinion of the arctic climate in these words  lord lord heres all my breath on my blanket icicles if you please sir all round my mouth and all over my blanket every time i have snored ive frozen something when a man gets the cold into him to that extent that he ices his own bed it cant last much longer never mind i dont grumble  crayford tapped the saucepan of bones impatiently john want lowered himself to the floorgrumbling all the wayby a rope attached to the rafters at his bed head instead of approaching his superior officer and his saucepan he hobbled shivering to the fireplace and held his chin as close as he possibly could over the fire crayford looked after him  halloo what are you doing there  thawing my beard sir  come here directly and set to work on these bones  john want remained immovably attached to the fireplace holding something else over the fire crayford began to lose his temper  what the devil are you about now  thawing my watch sir its been under my pillow all night and the cold has stopped it cheerful wholesome bracing sort of climate to live in isnt it sir never mind i dont grumble  no we all know that look here are these bones pounded small enough  john want suddenly approached the lieutenant and looked at him with an appearance of the deepest interest  youll excuse me sir he said how very hollow your voice sounds this morning  never mind my voice the bones the bones  yes sirthe bones theyll take a trifle more pounding ill do my best with them sir for your sake  what do you mean  john want shook his head and looked at crayford with a dreary smile  i dont think i shall have the honor of making much more bone soup for you sir do you think yourself youll last long sir i dont saving your presence i think about another week or ten days will do for us all never mind i dont grumble  he poured the bones into the mortar and began to pound themunder protest at the same moment a sailor appeared entering from the inner hut  a message from captain ebsworth sir  well  the captain is worse than ever with his freezing pains sir he wants to see you immediately  i will go at once rouse the doctor  answering in those terms crayford returned to the inner hut followed by the sailor john want shook his head again and smiled more drearily than ever  rouse the doctor he repeated suppose the doctor should be frozen he hadnt a haporth of warmth in him last night and his voice sounded like a whisper in a speakingtrumpet will the bones do now yes the bones will do now into the saucepan with you cried john want suiting the action to the word and flavor the hot water if you can when i remember that i was once an apprentice at a pastrycookswhen i think of the gallons of turtlesoup that this hand has stirred up in a jolly hot kitchenand when i find myself mixing bones and hot water for soup and turning into ice as fast as i can if i wasnt of a cheerful disposition i should feel inclined to grumble john want john want whatever had you done with your natural senses when you made up your mind to go to sea  a new voice hailed the cook speaking from one of the bedplaces in the side of the hut it was the voice of francis aldersley  whos that croaking over the fire  croaking repeated john want with the air of a man who considered himself the object of a gratuitous insult croaking you dont find your own voice at all altered for the worsedo you mr frank i dont give him john proceeded speaking confidentially to himself more than six hours to last hes one of your grumblers  what are you doing there asked frank  im making bone soup sir and wondering why i ever went to sea  well and why did you go to sea  im not certain mr frank sometimes i think it was natural perversity sometimes i think it was false pride at getting over seasickness sometimes i think it was reading robinson crusoe and books warning of me not to go to sea  frank laughed youre an odd fellow what do you mean by false pride at getting over seasickness did you get over seasickness in some new way  john wants dismal face brightened in spite of himself frank had recalled to the cooks memory one of the noteworthy passages in the cooks life  thats it sir he said if ever a man cured seasickness in a new way yet i am that mani got over it mr frank by dint of hard eating i was a passenger on board a packetboat sir when first i saw blue water a nasty lopp of a sea came on at dinnertime and i began to feel queer the moment the soup was put on the table sick says the captain rather sir says i will you try my cure says the captain certainly sir says i is your heart in your mouth yet says the captain not quite sir says i mockturtle soup says the captain and helps me i swallow a couple of spoonfuls and turn as white as a sheet the captain cocks his eye at me go on deck sir says he get rid of the soup and then come back to the cabin i got rid of the soup and came back to the cabin cods headandshoulders says the captain and helps me i cant stand it sir says i you must says the captain because its the cure i crammed down a mouthful and turned paler than ever go on deck says the captain get rid of the cods head and come back to the cabin off i go and back i come boiled leg of mutton and trimmings says the captain and helps me no fat sir says i fats the cure says the captain and makes me eat it leans the cure says the captain and makes me eat it steady says the captain sick says i go on deck says the captain get rid of the boiled leg of mutton and trimmings and come back to the cabin off i go staggeringback i come more dead than alive deviled kidneys says the captain i shut my eyes and got em down cures beginning says the captain muttonchop and pickles i shut my eyes and got them down broiled ham and cayenne pepper says the captain glass of stout and cranberry tart want to go on deck again no sir says i cures done says the captain never you give in to your stomach and your stomach will end in giving in to you  having stated the moral purpose of his story in those unanswerable words john want took himself and his saucepan into the kitchen a moment later crayford returned to the hut and astonished frank aldersley by an unexpected question  have you anything in your berth frank that you set a value on  nothing that i set the smallest value onwhen i am out of it he replied what does your question mean  we are almost as short of fuel as we are of provisions crayford proceeded your berth will make good firing i have directed bateson to be here in ten minutes with his ax  very attentive and considerate on your part said frank what is to become of me if you please when bateson has chopped my bed into firewood  cant you guess  i suppose the cold has stupefied me the riddle is beyond my reading suppose you give me a hint  certainly there will be beds to spare soonthere is to be a change at last in our wretched lives here do you see it now  franks eyes sparkled he sprang out of his berth and waved his fur cap in triumph  see it he exclaimed of course i do the exploring party is to start at last do i go with the expedition  it is not very long since you were in the doctors hands frank said crayford kindly i doubt if you are strong enough yet to make one of the exploring party  strong enough or not returned frank any risk is better than pining and perishing here put me down crayford among those who volunteer to go  volunteers will not be accepted in this case said crayford captain helding and captain ebsworth see serious objections as we are situated to that method of proceeding  do they mean to keep the appointments in their own hands asked frank i for one object to that  wait a little said crayford you were playing backgammon the other day with one of the officers does the board belong to him or to you  it belongs to me i have got it in my locker here what do you want with it  i want the dice and the box for casting lots the captains have arrangedmost wisely as i thinkthat chance shall decide among us who goes with the expedition and who stays behind in the huts the officers and crew of the wanderer will be here in a few minutes to cast the lots neither you nor any one can object to that way of deciding among us officers and men alike take their chance together nobody can grumble  i am quite satisfied said frank but i know of one man among the officers who is sure to make objections  who is the man  you know him well enough too the bear of the expeditions richard wardour  frank frank you have a bad habit of letting your tongue run away with you dont repeat that stupid nickname when you talk of my good friend richard wardour  your good friend crayford your liking for that man amazes me  crayford laid his hand kindly on franks shoulder of all the officers of the seamew crayfords favorite was frank  why should it amaze you he asked what opportunities have you had of judging you and wardour have always belonged to different ships i have never seen you in wardours society for five minutes together how can you form a fair estimate of his character  i take the general estimate of his character frank answered he has got his nickname because he is the most unpopular man in his ship nobody likes himthere must be some reason for that  there is only one reason for it crayford rejoined nobody understands richard wardour i am not talking at random remember i sailed from england with him in the wanderer and i was only transferred to the seamew long after we were locked up in the ice i was richard wardours companion on board ship for months and i learned there to do him justice under all his outward defects i tell you there beats a great and generous heart suspend your opinion my lad until you know my friend as well as i do no more of this now give me the dice and the box  frank opened his locker at the same moment the silence of the snowy waste outside was broken by a shouting of voices hailing the hutseamew ahoy    chapter 8   the sailor on watch opened the outer door there plodding over the ghastly white snow were the officers of the wanderer approaching the hut there scattered under the merciless black sky were the crew with the dogs and the sledges waiting the word which was to start them on their perilous and doubtful journey  captain helding of the wanderer accompanied by his officers entered the hut in high spirits at the prospect of a change behind them lounging in slowly by himself was a dark sullen heavybrowed man he neither spoke nor offered his hand to anybody he was the one person present who seemed to be perfectly indifferent to the fate in store for him this was the man whom his brother officers had nicknamed the bear of the expedition in other wordsrichard wardour  crayford advanced to welcome captain helding frank remembering the friendly reproof which he had just received passed over the other officers of the wanderer and made a special effort to be civil to crayfords friend  goodmorning mr wardour he said we may congratulate each other on the chance of leaving this horrible place  you may think it horrible wardour retorted i like it  like it good heavens why  because there are no women here  frank turned to his brother officers without making any further advances in the direction of richard wardour the bear of the expedition was more unapproachable than ever  in the meantime the hut had become thronged by the ablebodied officers and men of the two ships captain helding standing in the midst of them with crayford by his side proceeded to explain the purpose of the contemplated expedition to the audience which surrounded him  he began in these words  brother officers and men of the wanderer and seamew it is my duty to tell you very briefly the reasons which have decided captain ebsworth and myself on dispatching an exploring party in search of help without recalling all the hardships we have suffered for the last two yearsthe destruction first of one of our ships then of the other the death of some of our bravest and best companions the vain battles we have been fighting with the ice and snow and boundless desolation of these inhospitable regionswithout dwelling on these things it is my duty to remind you that this the last place in which we have taken refuge is far beyond the track of any previous expedition and that consequently our chance of being discovered by any rescuing parties that may be sent to look after us is to say the least of it a chance of the most uncertain kind you all agree with me gentlemen so far  the officers with the exception of wardour who stood apart in sullen silence all agreed so far  the captain went on  it is therefore urgently necessary that we should make another and probably a last effort to extricate ourselves the winter is not far off game is getting scarcer and scarcer our stock of provisions is running low and the sickespecially i am sorry to say the sick in the wanderers hutare increasing in number day by day we must look to our own lives and to the lives of those who are dependent on us and we have no time to lose  the officers echoed the words cheerfully  right right no time to lose  captain helding resumed  the plan proposed is that a detachment of the ablebodied officers and men among us should set forth this very day and make another effort to reach the nearest inhabited settlements from which help and provisions may be dispatched to those who remain here the new direction to be taken and the various precautions to be adopted are all drawn out ready the only question now before us is who is to stop here and who is to undertake the journey  the officers answered the question with one accordvolunteers  the men echoed their officers ay ay volunteers  wardour still preserved his sullen silence crayford noticed him standing apart from the rest and appealed to him personally  do you say nothing he asked  nothing wardour answered go or stay its all one to me  i hope you dont really mean that said crayford  i do  i am sorry to hear it wardour  captain helding answered the general suggestion in favor of volunteering by a question which instantly checked the rising enthusiasm of the meeting  well he said suppose we say volunteers who volunteers to stop in the huts  there was a dead silence the officers and men looked at each other confusedly the captain continued  you see we cant settle it by volunteering you all want to go every man among us who has the use of his limbs naturally wants to go but what is to become of those who have not got the use of their limbs some of us must stay here and take care of the sick  everybody admitted that this was true  so we get back again said the captain to the old questionwho among the ablebodied is to go and who is to stay captain ebsworth says and i say let chance decide it here are dice the numbers run as high as twelvedouble sixes all who throw under six stay all who throw over six go officers of the wanderer and the seamew do you agree to that way of meeting the difficulty  all the officers agreed with the one exception of wardour who still kept silence  men of the wanderer and seamew your officers agree to cast lots do you agree too  the men agreed without a dissentient voice crayford handed the box and the dice to captain helding  you throw first sir under six stay over six go  captain helding cast the dice the top of the cask serving for a table he threw seven  go said crayford i congratulate you sir now for my own chance he cast the dice in his turn three stay ah well well if i can do my duty and be of use to others what does it matter whether i go or stay wardour you are next in the absence of your first lieutenant  wardour prepared to cast without shaking the dice  shake the box man cried crayford give yourself a chance of luck  wardour persisted in letting the dice fall out carelessly just as they lay in the box  not i he muttered to himself ive done with luck saying those words he threw down the empty box and seated himself on the nearest chest without looking to see how the dice had fallen  crayford examined them six he exclaimed there you have a second chance in spite of yourself you are neither under nor overyou throw again  bah growled the bear its not worth the trouble of getting up for somebody else throw for me he suddenly looked at frank you you have got what the women call a lucky face  frank appealed to crayford shall i  yes if he wishes it said crayford  frank cast the dice two he stays wardour i am sorry i have thrown against you  go or stay reiterated wardour its all one to me you will be luckier young one when you cast for yourself  frank cast for himself  eight hurrah i go  what did i tell you said wardour the chance was yours you have thriven on my ill luck  he rose as he spoke to leave the hut crayford stopped him  have you anything particular to do richard  what has anybody to do here  wait a little then i want to speak to you when this business is over  are you going to give me any more good advice  dont look at me in that sour way richard i am going to ask you a question about something which concerns yourself  wardour yielded without a word more he returned to his chest and cynically composed himself to slumber the casting of the lots went on rapidly among the officers and men in another halfhour chance had decided the question of go or stay for all alike the men left the hut the officers entered the inner apartment for a last conference with the bedridden captain of the seamew wardour and crayford were left together alone    chapter 9   crayford touched his friend on the shoulder to rouse him wardour looked up impatiently with a frown  i was just asleep he said why do you wake me  look round you richard we are alone  welland what of that  i wish to speak to you privately and this is my opportunity you have disappointed and surprised me today why did you say it was all one to you whether you went or stayed why are you the only man among us who seems to be perfectly indifferent whether we are rescued or not  can a man always give a reason for what is strange in his manner or his words wardour retorted  he can try said crayford quietlywhen his friend asks him  wardours manner softened  thats true he said i will try do you remember the first night at sea when we sailed from england in the wanderer  as well as if it was yesterday  a calm still night the other went on thoughtfully no clouds no stars nothing in the sky but the broad moon and hardly a ripple to break the path of light she made in the quiet water mine was the middle watch that night you came on deck and found me alone  he stopped crayford took his hand and finished the sentence for him  aloneand in tears  the last i shall ever shed wardour added bitterly  dont say that there are times when a man is to be pitied indeed if he can shed no tears go on richard  wardour proceededstill following the old recollections still preserving his gentler tones  i should have quarreled with any other man who had surprised me at that moment he said there was something i suppose in your voice when you asked my pardon for disturbing me that softened my heart i told you i had met with a disappointment which had broken me for life there was no need to explain further the only hopeless wretchedness in this world is the wretchedness that women cause  and the only unalloyed happiness said crayford the happiness that women bring  that may be your experience of them wardour answered mine is different all the devotion the patience the humility the worship that there is in man i laid at the feet of a woman she accepted the offering as women doaccepted it easily gracefully unfeelinglyaccepted it as a matter of course i left england to win a high place in my profession before i dared to win her i braved danger and faced death i staked my life in the fever swamps of africa to gain the promotion that i only desired for her sakeand gained it i came back to give her all and to ask nothing in return but to rest my weary heart in the sunshine of her smile and her own lipsthe lips i had kissed at partingtold me that another man had robbed me of her i spoke but few words when i heard that confession and left her forever the time may come i told her when i shall forgive you but the man who has robbed me of you shall rue the day when you and he first met dont ask me who he was i have yet to discover him the treachery had been kept secret nobody could tell me where to find him nobody could tell me who he was what did it matter when i had lived out the first agony i could rely on myselfi could be patient and bide my time  your time what time  the time when i and that man shall meet face to face i knew it then i know it nowit was written on my heart then it is written on my heart nowwe two shall meet and know each other with that conviction strong within me i volunteered for this service as i would have volunteered for anything that set work and hardship and danger like ramparts between my misery and me with that conviction strong within me still i tell you it is no matter whether i stay here with the sick or go hence with the strong i shall live till i have met that man there is a day of reckoning appointed between us here in the freezing cold or away in the deadly heat in battle or in shipwreck in the face of starvation under the shadow of pestilencei though hundreds are falling round me i shall live live for the coming of one day live for the meeting with one man  he stopped trembling body and soul under the hold that his own terrible superstition had fastened on him crayford drew back in silent horror wardour noticed the actionhe resented ithe appealed in defense of his one cherished conviction to crayfords own experience of him  look at me he cried look how i have lived and thriven with the heartache gnawing at me at home and the winds of the icy north whistling round me here i am the strongest man among you why i have fought through hardships that have laid the bestseasoned men of all our party on their backs why what have i done that my life should throb as bravely through every vein in my body at this minute and in this deadly place as ever it did in the wholesome breezes of home what am i preserved for i tell you again for the coming of one dayfor the meeting with one man  he paused once more this time crayford spoke  richard he said since we first met i have believed in your better nature against all outward appearance i have believed in you firmly truly as your brother might you are putting that belief to a hard test if your enemy had told me that you had ever talked as you talk now that you had ever looked as you look now i would have turned my back on him as the utterer of a vile calumny against a just a brave an upright man oh my friend my friend if ever i have deserved well of you put away these thoughts from your heart face me again with the stainless look of a man who has trampled under his feet the bloody superstitions of revenge and knows them no more never never let the time come when i cannot offer you my hand as i offer it now to the man i can still admireto the brother i can still love  the heart that no other voice could touch felt that appeal the fierce eyes the hard voice softened under crayfords influence richard wardours head sank on his breast  you are kinder to me than i deserve he said be kinder still and forget what i have been talking about no no more about me i am not worth it well change the subject and never go back to it again lets do something work crayfordthats the true elixir of our life work that stretches the muscles and sets the blood aglowing work that tires the body and rests the mind is there nothing in hand that i can do nothing to cut nothing to carry  the door opened as he put the question batesonappointed to chop franks bedplace into firingappeared punctually with his ax wardour without a word of warning snatched the ax out of the mans hand  what was this wanted for he asked  to cut up mr aldersleys berth there into firing sir  ill do it for you ill have it down in no time he turned to crayford you neednt be afraid about me old friend i am going to do the right thing i am going to tire my body and rest my mind  the evil spirit in him was plainly subduedfor the time at least crayford took his hand in silence and then followed by bateson left him to his work    chapter 10   ax in hand wardour approached franks bedplace  if i could only cut the thoughts out of me he said to himself as i am going to cut the billets out of this wood he attacked the bedplace with the ax like a man who well knew the use of his instrument oh me he thought sadly if i had only been born a carpenter instead of a gentleman a good ax master batesoni wonder where you got it something like a grip my man on this handle poor crayford his words stick in my throat a fine fellow a noble fellow no use thinking no use regretting what is said is said work work work  plank after plank fell out on the floor he laughed over the easy task of destruction aha young aldersley it doesnt take much to demolish your bedplace ill have it down i would have the whole hut down if they would only give me the chance of chopping at it  a long strip of wood fell to his axlong enough to require cutting in two he turned it and stooped over it something caught his eyeletters carved in the wood he looked closer the letters were very faintly and badly cut he could only make out the first three of them and even of those he was not quite certain they looked like c l aif they looked like anything he threw down the strip of wood irritably  dn the fellow whoever he is who cut this why should he carve that name of all the names in the world  he paused consideringthen determined to go on again with his selfimposed labor he was ashamed of his own outburst he looked eagerly for the ax work work nothing for it but work he found the ax and went on again  he cut out another plank  he stopped and looked at it suspiciously  there was carving again on this plank the letters f and a appeared on it  he put down the ax there were vague misgivings in him which he was not able to realize the state of his own mind was fast becoming a puzzle to him  more carving he said to himself thats the way these young idlers employ their long hours f a those must be his initialsfrank aldersley who carved the letters on the other plank frank aldersley too  he turned the piece of wood in his hand nearer to the light and looked lower down it more carving again lower down under the initials f a were two more lettersc b  c b he repeated to himself his sweet hearts initials i suppose of courseat his agehis sweethearts initials  he paused once more a spasm of inner pain showed the shadow of its mysterious passage outwardly on his face  her cipher is c b he said in low broken tones c bclara burnham  he waited with the plank in his hand repeating the name over and over again as if it was a question he was putting to himself  clara burnham clara burnham  he dropped the plank and turned deadly pale in a moment his eyes wandered furtively backward and forward between the strip of wood on the floor and the halfdemolished berth oh god what has come to me now he said to himself in a whisper he snatched up the ax with a strange crysomething between rage and terror he triedfiercely desperately triedto go on with his work no strong as he was he could not use the ax his hands were helpless they trembled incessantly he went to the fire he held his hands over it they still trembled incessantly they infected the rest of him he shuddered all over he knew fear his own thoughts terrified him  crayford he cried out crayford come here and lets go hunting  no friendly voice answered him no friendly face showed itself at the door  an interval passed and there came over him another change he recovered his selfpossession almost as suddenly as he had lost it a smilea horrid deforming unnatural smilespread slowly stealthily devilishly over his face he left the fire he put the ax away softly in a corner he sat down in his old place deliberately selfabandoned to a frenzy of vindictive joy he had found the man there at the end of the worldthere at the last fight of the arctic voyagers against starvation and death he had found the man  the minutes passed  he became conscious on a sudden of a freezing stream of air pouring into the room  he turned and saw crayford opening the door of the hut a man was behind him wardour rose eagerly and looked over crayfords shoulder  was itcould it bethe man who had carved the letters on the plank yes frank aldersley    chapter 11   still at work crayford exclaimed looking at the halfdemolished bedplace give yourself a little rest richard the exploring party is ready to start if you wish to take leave of your brother officers before they go you have no time to lose  he checked himself there looking wardour full in the face  good heavens he cried how pale you are has anything happened  franksearching in his locker for articles of clothing which he might require on the journeylooked round he was startled as crayford had been startled by the sudden change in wardour since they had last seen him  are you ill he asked i hear you have been doing batesons work for him have you hurt yourself  wardour suddenly moved his head so as to hide his face from both crayford and frank he took out his handkerchief and wound it clumsily round his left hand  yes he said i hurt myself with the ax its nothing never mind pain always has a curious effect on me i tell you its nothing dont notice it  he turned his face toward them again as suddenly as he had turned it away he advanced a few steps and addressed himself with an uneasy familiarity to frank  i didnt answer you civilly when you spoke to me some little time since i mean when i first came in here along with the rest of them i apologize shake hands how are you ready for the march  frank met the oddly abrupt advance which had been made to him with perfect good humor  i am glad to be friends with you mr wardour i wish i was as well seasoned to fatigue as you are  wardour burst into a hard joyless unnatural laugh  not strong eh you dont look it the dice had better have sent me away and kept you here i never felt in better condition in my life he paused and added with his eye on frank and with a strong emphasis on the words we men of kent are made of tough material  frank advanced a step on his side with a new interest in richard wardour  you come from kent he said  yes from east kent he waited a little once more and looked hard at frank do you know that part of the country he asked  i ought to know something about east kent frank answered some dear friends of mine once lived there  friends of yours wardour repeated one of the county families i suppose  as he put the question he abruptly looked over his shoulder he was standing between crayford and frank crayford taking no part in the conversation had been watching him and listening to him more and more attentively as that conversation went on within the last moment or two wardour had become instinctively conscious of this he resented crayfords conduct with needless irritability  why are you staring at me he asked  why are you looking unlike yourself crayford answered quietly  wardour made no reply he renewed the conversation with frank  one of the county families he resumed the winterbys of yew grange i dare say  no said frank but friends of the witherbys very likely the burnhams  desperately as he struggled to maintain it wardours selfcontrol failed him he started violently the clumsilywound handkerchief fell off his hand still looking at him attentively crayford picked it up  there is your handkerchief richard he said strange  what is strange  you told us you had hurt yourself with the ax  well  there is no blood on your handkerchief  wardour snatched the handkerchief out of crayfords hand and turning away approached the outer door of the hut no blood on the handkerchief he said to himself there may be a stain or two when crayford sees it again he stopped within a few paces of the door and spoke to crayford you recommended me to take leave of my brother officers before it was too late he said i am going to follow your advice  the door was opened from the outer side as he laid his hand on the lock  one of the quartermasters of the wanderer entered the hut  is captain helding here sir he asked addressing himself to wardour  wardour pointed to crayford  the lieutenant will tell you he said  crayford advanced and questioned the quartermaster what do you want with captain helding he asked  i have a report to make sir there has been an accident on the ice  to one of your men  no sir to one of our officers  wardour on the point of going out paused when the quartermaster made that reply for a moment he considered with himself then he walked slowly back to the part of the room in which frank was standing crayford directing the quartermaster pointed to the arched door way in the side of the hut  i am sorry to hear of the accident he said you will find captain helding in that room  for the second time with singular persistency wardour renewed the conversation with frank  so you knew the burnhams he said what became of clara when her father died  franks face flushed angrily on the instant  clara he repeated what authorizes you to speak of miss burnham in that familiar manner  wardour seized the opportunity of quarreling with him  what right have you to ask he retorted coarsely  franks blood was up he forgot his promise to clara to keep their engagement secrethe forgot everything but the unbridled insolence of wardours language and manner  a right which i insist on your respecting he answered the right of being engaged to marry her  crayfords steady eyes were still on the watch and wardour felt them on him a little more and crayford might openly interfere even wardour recognized for once the necessity of controlling his temper cost him what it might he made his apologies with overstrained politeness to frank  impossible to dispute such a right as yours he said perhaps you will excuse me when you know that i am one of miss burnhams old friends my father and her father were neighbors we have always met like brother and sister  frank generously stopped the apology there  say no more he interposed i was in the wrongi lost my temper pray forgive me  wardour looked at him with a strange reluctant interest while he was speaking wardour asked an extraordinary question when he had done  is she very fond of you  frank burst out laughing  my dear fellow he said come to our wedding and judge for yourself  come to your wedding as he repeated the words wardour stole one glance at frank which frank employed in buckling his knapsack failed to see crayford noticed it and crayfords blood ran cold comparing the words which wardour had spoken to him while they were alone together with the words that had just passed in his presence he could draw but one conclusion the woman whom wardour had loved and lost wasclara burnham the man who had robbed him of her was frank aldersley and wardour had discovered it in the interval since they had last met thank god thought crayford the dice have parted them frank goes with the expedition and wardour stays behind with me  the reflection had barely occurred to himfranks thoughtless invitation to wardour had just passed his lipswhen the canvas screen over the doorway was drawn aside captain helding and the officers who were to leave with the exploring party returned to the main room on their way out seeing crayford captain helding stopped to speak to him  i have a casualty to report said the captain which diminishes our numbers by one my second lieutenant who was to have joined the exploring party has had a fall on the ice judging by what the quartermaster tells me i am afraid the poor fellow has broken his leg  i will supply his place cried a voice at the other end of the hut  everybody looked round the man who had spoken was richard wardour  crayford instantly interferedso vehemently as to astonish all who knew him  no he said not you richard not you  why not wardour asked sternly  why not indeed added captain helding wardour is the very man to be useful on a long march he is in perfect health and he is the best shot among us i was on the point of proposing him myself  crayford failed to show his customary respect for his superior officer he openly disputed the captains conclusion  wardour has no right to volunteer he rejoined it has been settled captain helding that chance shall decide who is to go and who is to stay  and chance has decided it cried wardour do you think we are going to cast the dice again and give an officer of the seamew a chance of replacing an officer of the wanderer there is a vacancy in our party not in yours and we claim the right of filling it as we please i volunteer and my captain backs me whose authority is to keep me here after that  gently wardour said captain helding a man who is in the right can afford to speak with moderation he turned to crayford you must admit yourself he continued that wardour is right this time the missing man belongs to my command and in common justice one of my officers ought to supply his place  it was impossible to dispute the matter further the dullest man present could see that the captains reply was unanswerable in sheer despair crayford took franks arm and led him aside a few steps the last chance left of parting the two men was the chance of appealing to frank  my dear boy he began i want to say one friendly word to you on the subject of your health i have already if you remember expressed my doubts whether you are strong enough to make one of an exploring party i feel those doubts more strongly than ever at this moment will you take the advice of a friend who wishes you well  wardour had followed crayford wardour roughly interposed before frank could reply  let him alone  crayford paid no heed to the interruption he was too earnestly bent on withdrawing frank from the expedition to notice anything that was said or done by the persons about him  dont pray dont risk hardships which you are unfit to bear he went on entreatingly your place can be easily filled change your mind frank stay here with me  again wardour interfered again he called out leave him alone more roughly than ever still deaf and blind to every consideration but one crayford pressed his entreaties on frank  you owned yourself just now that you were not well seasoned to fatigue he persisted you feel you must feel how weak that last illness has left you you know i am sure you know how unfit you are to brave exposure to cold and long marches over the snow  irritated beyond endurance by crayfords obstinacy seeing or thinking he saw signs of yielding in franks face wardour so far forgot himself as to seize crayford by the arm and attempt to drag him away from frank crayford turned and looked at him  richard he said very quietly you are not yourself i pity you drop your hand  wardour relaxed his hold with something of the sullen submission of a wild animal to its keeper the momentary silence which followed gave frank an opportunity of speaking at last  i am gratefully sensible crayford he began of the interest which you take in me  and you will follow my advice crayford interposed eagerly  my mind is made up old friend frank answered firmly and sadly forgive me for disappointing you i am appointed to the expedition with the expedition i go he moved nearer to wardour in his innocence of all suspicion he clapped wardour heartily on the shoulder when i feel the fatigue said poor simple frank you will help me comradewont you come along  wardour snatched his gun out of the hands of the sailor who was carrying it for him his dark face became suddenly irradiated with a terrible joy  come he cried over the snow and over the ice come where no human footsteps have ever trodden and where no human trace is ever left  blindly instinctively crayford made an effort to part them his brother officers standing near pulled him back they looked at each other anxiously the merciless cold striking its victims in various ways had struck in some instances at their reason first everybody loved crayford was he too going on the dark way that others had taken before him they forced him to seat himself on one of the lockers steady old fellow they said kindlysteady crayford yielded writhing inwardly under the sense of his own helplessness what in gods name could he do could he denounce wardour to captain helding on bare suspicionwithout so much as the shadow of a proof to justify what he said the captain would decline to insult one of his officers by even mentioning the monstrous accusation to him the captain would conclude as others had already concluded that crayfords mind was giving way under stress of cold and privation no hopeliterally no hope now but in the numbers of the expedition officers and men they all liked frank as long as they could stir hand or foot they would help him on the waythey would see that no harm came to him  the word of command was given the door was thrown open the hut emptied rapidly over the merciless white snowunder the merciless black skythe exploring party began to move the sick and helpless men whose last hope of rescue centered in their departing messmates cheered faintly some few whose days were numbered sobbed and cried like women franks voice faltered as he turned back at the door to say his last words to the friend who had been a father to him  god bless you crayford  crayford broke away from the officers near him and hurrying forward seized frank by both hands crayford held him as if he would never let him go  god preserve you frank i would give all i have in the world to be with you goodby goodby  frank waved his handdashed away the tears that were gathering in his eyesand hurried out crayford called after him the last the only warning that he could give  while you can stand keep with the main body frank  wardour waiting till the lastwardour following frank through the snowdriftstopped stepped back and answered crayford at the door  while he can stand he keeps with me     third scenethe iceberg    chapter 12   alone alone on the frozen deep  the arctic sun is rising dimly in the dreary sky the beams of the cold northern moon mingling strangely with the dawning light clothe the snowy plains in hues of livid gray an icefield on the far horizon is moving slowly southward in the spectral light nearer a stream of open water rolls its slow black waves past the edges of the ice nearer still following the drift an iceberg rears its crags and pinnacles to the sky here glittering in the moonbeams there looming dim and ghostlike in the ashy light  midway on the long sweep of the lower slope of the iceberg what objects rise and break the desolate monotony of the scene in this awful solitude can signs appear which tell of human life yes the black outline of a boat just shows itself hauled up on the berg in an icecavern behind the boat the last red embers of a dying fire flicker from time to time over the figures of two men one is seated resting his back against the side of the cavern the other lies prostrate with his head on his comrades knee the first of these men is awake and thinking the second reclines with his still white face turned up to the skysleeping or dead days and days since these two have fallen behind on the march of the expedition of relief days and days since these two have been given up by their weary and failing companions as doomed and lost he who sits thinking is richard wardour he who lies sleeping or dead is frank aldersley  the iceberg drifts slowly over the black water through the ashy light minute by minute the dying fire sinks minute by minute the deathly cold creeps nearer and nearer to the lost men  richard wardour rouses himself from his thoughtslooks at the still white face beneath himand places his hand on franks heart it still beats feebly give him his share of the food and fuel still stored in the boat and frank may live through it leave him neglected where he lies and his death is a question of hoursperhaps minutes who knows  richard wardour lifts the sleepers head and rests it against the cavern side he goes to the boat and returns with a billet of wood he stoops to place the wood on the fireand stops frank is dreaming and murmuring in his dream a womans name passes his lips frank is in england againat the ballwhispering to clara the confession of his love  over richard wardours face there passes the shadow of a deadly thought he rises from the fire he takes the wood back to the boat his iron strength is shaken but it still holds out they are drifting nearer and nearer to the open sea he can launch the boat without help he can take the food and the fuel with him the sleeper on the iceberg is the man who has robbed him of clarawho has wrecked the hope and the happiness of his life leave the man in his sleep and let him die  so the tempter whispers richard wardour tries his strength on the boat it moves he has got it under control he stops and looks round beyond him is the open sea beneath him is the man who has robbed him of clara the shadow of the deadly thought grows and darkens over his face he waits with his hands on the boatwaits and thinks  the iceberg drifts slowlyover the black water through the ashy light minute by minute the dying fire sinks minute by minute the deathly cold creeps nearer to the sleeping man and still richard wardour waitswaits and thinks     fourth scenethe garden    chapter 13   the spring has come the air of the april night just lifts the leaves of the sleeping flowers the moon is queen in the cloudless and starless sky the stillness of the midnight hour is abroad over land and over sea  in a villa on the westward shore of the isle of wight the glass doors which lead from the drawingroom to the garden are yet open the shaded lamp yet burns on the table a lady sits by the lamp reading from time to time she looks out into the garden and sees the whiterobed figure of a young girl pacing slowly to and fro in the soft brightness of the moonlight on the lawn sorrow and suspense have set their mark on the lady not rivals only but friends who formerly admired her agree now that she looks worn and aged the more merciful judgment of others remarks with equal truth that her eyes her hair her simple grace and grandeur of movement have lost but little of their olden charms the truth lies as usual between the two extremes in spite of sorrow and suffering mrs crayford is the beautiful mrs crayford still  the delicious silence of the hour is softly disturbed by the voice of the younger lady in the garden  go to the piano lucy it is a night for music play something that is worthy of the night  mrs crayford looks round at the clock on the mantelpiece  my dear clara it is past twelve remember what the doctor told you you ought to have been in bed an hour ago  half an hour lucygive me half an hour more look at the moonlight on the sea is it possible to go to bed on such a night as this play something lucysomething spiritual and divine  earnestly pleading with her friend clara advances toward the window she too has suffered under the wasting influences of suspense her face has lost its youthful freshness no delicate flush of color rises on it when she speaks the soft gray eyes which won franks heart in the bygone time are sadly altered now in repose they have a dimmed and wearied look in action they are wild and restless like eyes suddenly wakened from startling dreams robed in whiteher soft brown hair hanging loosely over her shouldersthere is something weird and ghostlike in the girl as she moves nearer and nearer to the window in the full light of the moonpleading for music that shall be worthy of the mystery and the beauty of the night  will you come in here if i play to you mrs crayford asks it is a risk my love to be out so long in the night air  no no i like it playwhile i am out here looking at the sea it quiets me it comforts me it does me good  she glides back ghostlike over the lawn mrs crayford rises and puts down the volume that she has been reading it is a record of explorations in the arctic seas the time has gone by when the two lonely women could take an interest in subjects not connected with their own anxieties now when hope is fast failing themnow when their last news of the wanderer and the seamew is news that is more than two years oldthey can read of nothing they can think of nothing but dangers and discoveries losses and rescues in the terrible polar seas  unwillingly mrs crayford puts her book aside and opens the pianomozarts air in a with variations lies open on the instrument one after another she plays the lovely melodies so simply so purely beautiful of that unpretending and unrivaled work at the close of the ninth variation claras favorite she pauses and turns toward the garden  shall i stop there she asks  there is no answer has clara wandered away out of hearing of the music that she lovesthe music that harmonizes so subtly with the tender beauty of the night mrs crayford rises and advances to the window  no there is the white figure standing alone on the slope of the lawnthe head turned away from the house the face looking out over the calm sea whose gently rippling waters end in the dim line on the horizon which is the line of the hampshire coast  mrs crayford advances as far as the path before the window and calls to her  clara  again there is no answer the white figure still stands immovably in its place  with signs of distress in her face but with no appearance of alarm mrs crayford returns to the room her own sad experience tells her what has happened she summons the servants and directs them to wait in the drawingroom until she calls to them this done she returns to the garden and approaches the mysterious figure on the lawn  dead to the outer world as if she lay already in her graveinsensible to touch insensible to sound motionless as stone cold as stoneclara stands on the moonlit lawn facing the seaward view mrs crayford waits at her side patiently watching for the change which she knows is to come catalepsy as some call ithysteria as others saythis alone is certain the same interval always passes the same change always appears  it comes now not a change in her eyes they still remain wide open fixed and glassy the first movement is a movement of her hands they rise slowly from her side and waver in the air like the hands of a person groping in the dark another interval and the movement spreads to her lips they part and tremble a few minutes more and words begin to drop one by one from those parted lipswords spoken in a lost vacant tone as if she is talking in her sleep  mrs crayford looks back at the house sad experience makes her suspicious of the servants curiosity sad experience has long since warned her that the servants are not to be trusted within hearing of the wild words which clara speaks in the trance has any one of them ventured into the garden no they are out of hearing at the window waiting for the signal which tells them that their help is needed  turning toward clara once more mrs crayford hears the vacantly uttered words falling faster and faster from her lips  frank frank frank dont drop behinddont trust richard wardour while you can stand keep with the other men frank  the farewell warning of crayford in the solitudes of the frozen deep repeated by clara in the garden of her english home  a moment of silence follows and in that moment the vision has changed she sees him on the iceberg now at the mercy of the bitterest enemy he has on earth she sees him driftingover the black water through the ashy light  wake frank wake and defend yourself richard wardour knows that i love yourichard wardours vengeance will take your life wake frankwake you are drifting to your death a low groan of horror bursts from her sinister and terrible to hear drifting drifting she whispers to herselfdrifting to his death  her glassy eyes suddenly softenthen close a long shudder runs through her a faint flush shows itself on the deadly pallor of her face and fades again her limbs fail her she sinks into mrs crayfords arms  the servants answering the call for help carry her into the house they lay her insensible on her bed after half an hour or more her eyes open againthis time with the light of life in themopen and rest languidly on the friend sitting by the bedside  i have had a dreadful dream she murmurs faintly am i ill lucy i feel so weak  even as she says the words sleep gentle natural sleep takes her suddenly as it takes young children weary with their play though it is all over now though no further watching is required mrs crayford still keeps her place by the bedside too anxious and too wakeful to retire to her own room  on other occasions she is accustomed to dismiss from her mind the words which drop from clara in the trance this time the effort to dismiss them is beyond her power the words haunt her vainly she recalls to memory all that the doctors have said to her in speaking of clara in the state of trance what she vaguely dreads for the lost man whom she loves is mingled in her mind with what she is constantly reading of trials dangers and escapes in the arctic seas the most startling things that she may say or do are all attributable to this cause and may all be explained in this way so the doctors have spoken and thus far mrs crayford has shared their view it is only tonight that the girls words ring in her ear with a strange prophetic sound in them it is only tonight that she asks herself is clara present in the spirit with our loved and lost ones in the lonely north can mortal vision see the dead and living in the solitudes of the frozen deep    chapter 14   the night had passed  far and near the garden view looked its gayest and brightest in the light of the noonday sun the cheering sounds which tell of life and action were audible all round the villa from the garden of the nearest house rose the voices of children at play along the road at the back sounded the roll of wheels as carts and carriages passed at intervals out on the blue sea the distant splash of the paddles the distant thump of the engines told from time to time of the passage of steamers entering or leaving the strait between the island and the mainland in the trees the birds sang gayly among the rustling leaves in the house the womenservants were laughing over some jest or story that cheered them at their work it was a lively and pleasant timea bright enjoyable day  the two ladies were out together resting on a garden seat after a walk round the grounds  they exchanged a few trivial words relating to the beauty of the day and then said no more possessing the same consciousness of what she had seen in the trance which persons in general possess of what they have seen in a dreambelieving in the vision as a supernatural revelationclaras worst forebodings were now to her mind realized as truths her last faint hope of ever seeing frank again was now at an end intimate experience of her told mrs crayford what was passing in claras mind and warned her that the attempt to reason and remonstrate would be little better than a voluntary waste of words and time the disposition which she had herself felt on the previous night to attach a superstitious importance to the words that clara had spoken in the trance had vanished with the return of the morning rest and reflection had quieted her mind and had restored the composing influence of her sober sense sympathizing with clara in all besides she had no sympathy as they sat together in the pleasant sunshine with claras gloomy despair of the future she who could still hope had nothing to say to the sad companion who had done with hope so the quiet minutes succeeded each other and the two friends sat side by side in silence  an hour passed and the gatebell of the villa rang  they both startedthey both knew the ring it was the hour when the postman brought their newspapers from london in past days what hundreds on hundreds of times they had torn off the cover which inclosed the newspaper and looked at the same column with the same weary mingling of hope and despair there todayas it was yesterday as it would be if they lived tomorrowthere was the servant with lucys newspaper and claras newspaper in his hand  would both of them do again today what both had done so often in the days that were gone  no mrs crayford removed the cover from her newspaper as usual clara laid her newspaper aside unopened on the garden seat  in silence mrs crayford looked where she always looked at the column devoted to the latest intelligence from foreign parts the instant her eye fell on the page she started with a loud cry of joy the newspaper fell from her trembling hand she caught clara in her arms oh my darling my darling news of them at last  without answering without the slightest change in look or manner clara took the newspaper from the ground and read the top line in the column printed in capital letters  the arctic expedition  she waited and looked at mrs crayford  can you bear to hear it lucy she asked if i read it aloud  mrs crayford was too agitated to answer in words she signed impatiently to clara to go on  clara read the news which followed the heading in capital letters thus it ran  the following intelligence from st johns newfoundland has reached us for publication the whalingvessel blythewood is reported to have met with the surviving officers and men of the expedition in davis strait many are stated to be dead and some are supposed to be missing the list of the saved as collected by the people of the whaler is not vouched for as being absolutely correct the circumstances having been adverse to investigation the vessel was pressed for time and the members of the expedition all more or less suffering from exhaustion were not in a position to give the necessary assistance to inquiry further particulars may be looked for by the next mail  the list of the survivors followed beginning with the officers in the order of their rank they both read the list together the first name was captain helding the second was lieutenant crayford  there the wifes joy overpowered her after a pause she put her arm around claras waist and spoke to her  oh my love she murmured are you as happy as i am is franks name there too the tears are in my eyes read for mei cant read for myself  the answer came in still sad tones  i have read as far as your husbands name i have no need to read further  mrs crayford dashed the tears from her eyessteadied herselfand looked at the newspaper  on the list of the survivors the search was vain franks name was not among them on a second list headed dead or missing the first two names that appeared were  francis aldersley richard wardour  in speechless distress and dismay mrs crayford looked at clara had she force enough in her feeble health to sustain the shock that had fallen on her yes she bore it with a strange unnatural resignationshe looked she spoke with the sad selfpossession of despair  i was prepared for it she said i saw them in the spirit last night richard wardour has discovered the truth and frank has paid the penalty with his lifeand i i alone am to blame she shuddered and put her hand on her heart we shall not be long parted lucy i shall go to him he will not return to me  those words were spoken with a calm certainty of conviction that was terrible to hear i have no more to say she added after a moment and rose to return to the house mrs crayford caught her by the hand and forced her to take her seat again  dont look at me dont speak to me in that horrible manner she exclaimed clara it is unworthy of a reasonable being it is doubting the mercy of god to say what you have just said look at the newspaper again see they tell you plainly that their information is not to be depended onthey warn you to wait for further particulars the very words at the top of the list show how little they knew of the truth dead or missing on their own showing it is quite as likely that frank is missing as that frank is dead for all you know the next mail may bring a letter from him are you listening to me  yes  can you deny what i say  no  yes no is that the way to answer me when i am so distressed and so anxious about you  i am sorry i spoke as i did lucy we look at some subjects in very different ways i dont dispute dear that yours is the reasonable view  you dont dispute retorted mrs crayford warmly no you do what is worseyou believe in your own opinion you persist in your own conclusionwith the newspaper before you do you or do you not believe the newspaper  i believe in what i saw last night  in what you saw last night you an educated woman a clever woman believing in a vision of your own fancya mere dream i wonder you are not ashamed to acknowledge it  call it a dream if you like lucy i have had other dreams at other timesand i have known them to be fulfilled  yes said mrs crayford for once in a way they may have been fulfilled by chanceand you notice it and remember it and pin your faith on it come clara be honestwhat about the occasions when the chance has been against you and your dreams have not been fulfilled you superstitious people are all alike you conveniently forget when your dreams and your presentiments prove false for my sake dear if not for your own she continued in gentler and tenderer tones try to be more reasonable and more hopeful dont lose your trust in the future and your trust in god god who has saved my husband can save frank while there is doubt there is hope dont embitter my happiness clara try to think as i thinkif it is only to show that you love me  she put her arm round the girls neck and kissed her clara returned the kiss clara answered sadly and submissively  i do love you lucy i will try  having answered in those terms she sighed to herself and said no more it would have been plain only too plain to far less observant eyes than mrs crayfords that no salutary impression had been produced on her she had ceased to defend her own way of thinking she spoke of it no morebut there was the terrible conviction of franks death at wardours hands rooted as firmly as ever in her mind discouraged and distressed mrs crayford left her and walked back toward the house    chapter 15   at the drawingroom window of the villa there appeared a polite little man with bright intelligent eyes and cheerful sociable manners neatly dressed in professional black he stood selfproclaimed a prosperous country doctorsuccessful and popular in a wide circle of patients and friends as mrs crayford approached him he stepped out briskly to meet her on the lawn with both hands extended in courteous and cordial greeting  my dear madam accept my heartfelt congratulations cried the doctor i have seen the good news in the paper and i could hardly feel more rejoiced than i do now if i had the honor of knowing lieutenant crayford personally we mean to celebrate the occasion at home i said to my wife before i came out a bottle of the old madeira at dinner today mindto drink the lieutenants health god bless him and how is our interesting patient the news is not altogether what we could wish so far as she is concerned i felt a little anxious to tell you the truth about the effect of it and i have paid my visit today before my usual time not that i take a gloomy view of the news myself no there is clearly a doubt about the correctness of the information so far as mr aldersley is concernedand that is a point a great point in mr aldersleys favor i give him the benefit of the doubt as the lawyers say does miss burnham give him the benefit of the doubt too i hardly dare hope it i confess  miss burnham has grieved and alarmed me mrs crayford answered i was just thinking of sending for you when we met here  with those introductory words she told the doctor exactly what had happened repeating not only the conversation of that morning between clara and herself but also the words which had fallen from clara in the trance of the past night  the doctor listened attentively little by little its easy smiling composure vanished from his face as mrs crayford went on and left him completely transformed into a grave and thoughtful man  let us go and look at her he said  he seated himself by claras side and carefully studied her face with his hand on her pulse there was no sympathy here between the dreamy mystical temperament of the patient and the downright practical character of the doctor clara secretly disliked her medical attendant she submitted impatiently to the close investigation of which he made her the object he questioned herand she answered irritably advancing a step further the doctor was not easily discouraged he adverted to the news of the expedition and took up the tone of remonstrance which had been already adopted by mrs crayford clara declined to discuss the question she rose with formal politeness and requested permission to return to the house the doctor attempted no further resistance by all means miss burnham he answered resignedlyhaving first cast a look at mrs crayford which said plainly stay here with me clara bowed her acknowledgments in cold silence and left them together the doctors bright eyes followed the girls wasted yet still graceful figure as it slowly receded from view with an expression of grave anxiety which mrs crayford noticed with grave misgiving on her side he said nothing until clara had disappeared under the veranda which ran round the gardenside of the house  i think you told me he began that miss burnham has neither father nor mother living  yes miss burnham is an orphan  has she any near relatives  no you may speak to me as her guardian and her friend are you alarmed about her  i am seriously alarmed it is only two days since i called here last and i see a marked change in her for the worsephysically and morally a change for the worse dont needlessly alarm yourself the case is not i trust entirely beyond the reach of remedy the great hope for us is the hope that mr aldersley may still be living in that event i should feel no misgivings about the future her marriage would make a healthy and a happy woman of her but as things are i own i dread that settled conviction in her mind that mr aldersley is dead and that her own death is soon to follow in her present state of health this idea haunting her as it certainly will night and day will have its influence on her body as well as on her mind unless we can check the mischief her last reserves of strength will give way if you wish for other advice by all means send for it you have my opinion  i am quite satisfied with your opinion mrs crayford replied for gods sake tell me what can we do  we can try a complete change said the doctor we can remove her at once from this place  she will refuse to leave it mrs crayford rejoined i have more than once proposed a change to herand she always says no  the doctor paused for a moment like a man collecting his thoughts  i heard something on my way here he proceeded which suggests to my mind a method of meeting the difficulty that you have just mentioned unless i am entirely mistaken miss burnham will not say no to the change that i have in view for her  what is it asked mrs crayford eagerly  pardon me if i ask you a question on my part before i reply said the doctor are you fortunate enough to possess any interest at the admiralty  certainly my father is in the secretarys office and two of the lords of the admiralty are friends of his  excellent now i can speak out plainly with little fear of disappointing you after what i have said you will agree with me that the only change in miss burnhams life which will be of any use to her is a change that will alter the present tone of her mind on the subject of mr aldersley place her in a position to discovernot by reference to her own distempered fancies and visions but by reference to actual evidence and actual factwhether mr aldersley is or is not a living man and there will be an end of the hysterical delusions which now threaten to fatally undermine her health even taking matters at their worsteven assuming that mr aldersley has died in the arctic seasit will be less injurious to her to discover this positively than to leave her mind to feed on its own morbid superstitions and speculations for weeks and weeks together while the next news from the expedition is on its way to england in one word i want you to be in a position before the week is out to put miss burnhams present conviction to a practical test suppose you could say to her we differ my dear about mr francis aldersley you declare without the shadow of a reason for it that he is certainly dead and worse still that he has died by the act of one of his brother officers i assert on the authority of the newspaper that nothing of the sort has happened and that the chances are all in favor of his being still a living man what do you say to crossing the atlantic and deciding which of us is rightyou or i do you think miss burnham will say no to that mrs crayford if i know anything of human nature she will seize the opportunity as a means of converting you to a belief in the second sight  good heavens doctor do you mean to tell me that we are to go to sea and meet the arctic expedition on its way home  admirably guessed mrs crayford that is exactly what i mean  but how is it to be done  i will tell you immediately i mentioneddidnt ithat i had heard something on my road to this house  yes  well i met an old friend at my own gate who walked with me a part of the way here last night my friend dined with the admiral at portsmouth among the guests there was a member of the ministry who had brought the news about the expedition with him from london this gentleman told the company there was very little doubt that the admiralty would immediately send out a steamvessel to meet the rescued men on the shores of america and bring them home wait a little mrs crayford nobody knows as yet under what rules and regulations the vessel will sail under somewhat similar circumstances privileged people have been received as passengers or rather as guests in her majestys shipsand what has been conceded on former occasions may by bare possibility be conceded now i can say no more if you are not afraid of the voyage for yourself i am not afraid of it nay i am all in favor of it on medical grounds for my patient what do you say will you write to your father and ask him to try what his interest will do with his friends at the admiralty  mrs crayford rose excitedly to her feet  write she exclaimed i will do better than write the journey to london is no great matterand my housekeeper here is to be trusted to take care of clara in my absence i will see my father tonight he shall make good use of his interest at the admiraltyyou may rely on that oh my dear doctor what a prospect it is my husband clara what a discovery you have madewhat a treasure you are how can i thank you  compose yourself my dear madam dont make too sure of success we may consider miss burnhams objections as disposed of beforehand but suppose the lords of the admiralty say no  in that case i shall be in london doctor and i shall go to them myself lords are only men and men are not in the habit of saying no to me  so they parted    in a week from that day her majestys ship amazon sailed for north america certain privileged persons specially interested in the arctic voyagers were permitted to occupy the empty staterooms on board on the list of these favored guests of the ship were the names of two ladiesmrs crayford and miss burnham     fifth scenethe boathouse    chapter 16   once more the open seathe sea whose waters break on the shores of newfoundland an english steamship lies at anchor in the offing the vessel is plainly visible through the open doorway of a large boathouse on the shoreone of the buildings attached to a fishingstation on the coast of the island  the only person in the boathouse at this moment is a man in the dress of a sailor he is seated on a chest with a piece of cord in his hand looking out idly at the sea on the rough carpenters table near him lies a strange object to be left in such a placea womans veil  what is the vessel lying at anchor in the offing  the vessel is the amazondispatched from england to receive the surviving officers and men of the arctic expedition the meeting has been successfully effected on the shores of north america three days since but the homeward voyage has been delayed by a storm which has driven the ship out of her course taking advantage on the third day of the first returning calm the commander of the amazon has anchored off the coast of newfoundland and has sent ashore to increase his supplies of water before he sails for england the weary passengers have landed for a few hours to refresh themselves after the discomforts of the tempest among them are the two ladies the veil left on the table in the boathouse is claras veil  and who is the man sitting on the chest with the cord in his hand looking out idly at the sea the man is the only cheerful person in the ships company in other wordsjohn want  still reposing on the chest our friend who never grumbles is surprised by the sudden appearance of a sailor at the boathouse door  look sharp with your work there john want says the sailor lieutenant crayford is just coming in to look after you  with this warning the messenger disappears again john want rises with a groan turns the chest up on one end and begins to fasten the cord round it the ships cook is not a man to look back on his rescue with the feeling of unmitigated satisfaction which animates his companions in trouble on the contrary he is ungratefully disposed to regret the north pole  if i had only knownthus runs the train of thought in the mind of john wantif i had only known before i was rescued that i was to be brought to this place i believe i should have preferred staying at the north pole i was very happy keeping up everybodys spirits at the north pole taking one thing with another i think i must have been very comfortable at the north poleif i had only known it another man in my place might be inclined to say that this newfoundland boathouse was rather a sloppy slimy draughty fishy sort of a habitation to take shelter in another man might object to perpetual newfoundland fogs perpetual newfoundland codfish and perpetual newfoundland dogs we had some very nice bears at the north pole never mind its all one to mei dont grumble  have you done cording that box  this time the voice is a voice of authoritythe man at the doorway is lieutenant crayford himself john want answers his officer in his own cheerful way  ive done it as well as i can sirbut the damp of this place is beginning to tell upon our very ropes i say nothing about our lungsi only say our ropes  crayford answers sharply he seems to have lost his former relish for the humor of john want  pooh to look at your wry face one would think that our rescue from the arctic regions was a downright misfortune you deserve to be sent back again  i could be just as cheerful as ever sir if i was sent back again i hope im thankful but i dont like to hear the north pole run down in such a fishy place as this it was very clean and snowy at the north poleand its very damp and sandy here do you never miss your bonesoup sir i do it mightnt have been strong but it was very hot and the cold seemed to give it a kind of a meaty flavor as it went down was it you that was acoughing so long last night sir i dont presume to say anything against the air of these latitudes but i should be glad to know it wasnt you that was acoughing so hollow would you be so obliging as just to feel the state of these ropes with the ends of your fingers sir you can dry them afterward on the back of my jacket  you ought to have a stick laid on the back of your jacket take that box down to the boat directly you croaking vagabond you would have grumbled in the garden of eden  the philosopher of the expedition was not a man to be silenced by referring him to the garden of eden paradise itself was not perfect to john want  i hope i could be cheerful anywhere sir said the ships cook but you mark my wordsthere must have been a deal of troublesome work with the flowerbeds in the garden of eden  having entered that unanswerable protest john want shouldered the box and drifted drearily out of the boathouse  left by himself crayford looked at his watch and called to a sailor outside  where are the ladies he asked  mrs crayford is coming this way sir she was just behind you when you came in  is miss burnham with her  no sir miss burnham is down on the beach with the passengers i heard the young lady asking after you sir  asking after me crayford considered with himself as he repeated the words he added in lower and graver tones you had better tell miss burnham you have seen me here  the man made his salute and went out crayford took a turn in the boathouse  rescued from death in the arctic wastes and reunited to a beautiful wife the lieutenant looked nevertheless unaccountably anxious and depressed what could he be thinking of he was thinking of clara  on the first day when the rescued men were received on board the amazon clara had embarrassed and distressed not crayford only but the other officers of the expedition as well by the manner in which she questioned them on the subject of francis aldersley and richard wardour she had shown no signs of dismay or despair when she heard that no news had been received of the two missing men she had even smiled sadly to herself when crayford out of compassionate regard for her declared that he and his comrades had not given up the hope of seeing frank and wardour yet it was only when the lieutenant had expressed himself in those terms and when it was hoped that the painful subject had been dismissedthat clara had startled every one present by announcing that she had something still to say in relation to frank and wardour which had not been said yet though she spoke guardedly her next words revealed suspicions of foul play lurking in her mindexactly reflecting similar suspicions lurking in crayfords mindwhich so distressed the lieutenant and so surprised his comrades as to render them quite incapable of answering her the warnings of the storm which shortly afterward broke over the vessel were then visible in sea and sky crayford made them his excuse for abruptly leaving the cabin in which the conversation had taken place his brother officers profiting by his example pleaded their duties on deck and followed him out  on the next day and the next the tempest still ragedand the passengers were not able to leave their staterooms but now when the weather had moderated and the ship had anchorednow when officers and passengers alike were on shore with leisure time at their disposalclara had opportunities of returning to the subject of the lost men and of asking questions in relation to them which would make it impossible for crayford to plead an excuse for not answering her how was he to meet those questions how could he still keep her in ignorance of the truth  these were the reflections which now troubled crayford and which presented him after his rescue in the strangely inappropriate character of a depressed and anxious man his brother officers as he well knew looked to him to take the chief responsibility if he declined to accept it he would instantly confirm the horrible suspicion in claras mind the emergency must be met but how to meet itat once honorably and mercifullywas more than crayford could tell he was still lost in his own gloomy thoughts when his wife entered the boathouse turning to look at her he saw his own perturbations and anxieties plainly reflected in mrs crayfords face  have you seen anything of clara he asked is she still on the beach  she is following me to this place mrs crayford replied i have been speaking to her this morning she is just as resolute as ever to insist on your telling her of the circumstances under which frank is missing as things are you have no alternative but to answer her  help me to answer her lucy tell me before she comes in how this dreadful suspicion first took possession of her all she could possibly have known when we left england was that the two men were appointed to separate ships what could have led her to suspect that they had come together  she was firmly persuaded william that they would come together when the expedition left england and she had read in books of arctic travel of men left behind by their comrades on the march and of men adrift on icebergs with her mind full of these images and forebodings she saw frank and wardour or dreamed of them in one of her attacks of trance i was by her side i heard what she said at the time she warned frank that wardour had discovered the truth she called out to him while you can stand keep with the other men frank  good god cried crayford i warned him myself almost in those very words the last time i saw him  dont acknowledge it william keep her in ignorance of what you have just told me she will not take it for what it isa startling coincidence and nothing more she will accept it as positive confirmation of the faith the miserable superstitious faith that is in her so long as you dont actually know that frank is dead and that he has died by wardours hand deny what she saysmislead her for her own sakedispute all her conclusions as i dispute them help me to raise her to the better and nobler belief in the mercy of god she stopped and looked round nervously at the doorway hush she whispered do as i have told you clara is here    chapter 17   clara stopped at the doorway looking backward and forward distrustfully between the husband and wife entering the boathouse and approaching crayford she took his arm and led him away a few steps from the place in which mrs crayford was standing  there is no storm now and there are no duties to be done on board the ship she said with the faint sad smile which it wrung crayfords heart to see you are lucys husband and you have an interest in me for lucys sake dont shrink on that account from giving me pain i can bear pain friend and brother will you believe that i have courage enough to hear the worst will you promise not to deceive me about frank  the gentle resignation in her voice the sad pleading in her look shook crayfords selfpossession at the outset he answered her in the worst possible manner he answered evasively  my dear clara he said what have i done that you should suspect me of deceiving you  she looked him searchingly in the face then glanced with renewed distrust at mrs crayford there was a moment of silence before any of the three could speak again they were interrupted by the appearance of one of crayfords brother officers followed by two sailors carrying a hamper between them crayford instantly dropped claras arm and seized the welcome opportunity of speaking of other things  any instructions from the ship steventon he asked approaching the officer  verbal instructions only steventon replied the ship will sail with the floodtide we shall fire a gun to collect the people and send another boat ashore in the meantime here are some refreshments for the passengers the ship is in a state of confusion the ladies will eat their luncheon more comfortably here  hearing this mrs crayford took her opportunity of silencing clara next  come my dear she said let us lay the cloth before the gentlemen come in  clara was too seriously bent on attaining the object which she had in view to be silenced in that way i will help you directly she answeredthen crossed the room and addressed herself to the officer whose name was steventon  can you spare me a few minutes she asked i have something to say to you  i am entirely at your service miss burnham  answering in those words steventon dismissed the two sailors mrs crayford looked anxiously at her husband crayford whispered to her dont be alarmed about steventon i have cautioned him his discretion is to be depended on  clara beckoned to crayford to return to her  i will not keep you long she said i will promise not to distress mr steventon young as i am you shall both find that i am capable of selfcontrol i wont ask you to go back to the story of your past sufferings i only want to be sure that i am right about one thingi mean about what happened at the time when the exploring party was dispatched in search of help as i understand it you cast lots among yourselves who was to go with the party and who was to remain behind frank cast the lot to go she paused shuddering and richard wardour she went on cast the lot to remain behind on your honor as officers and gentlemen is this the truth  on my honor crayford answered it is the truth  on my honor steventon repeated it is the truth  she looked at them carefully considering her next words before she spoke again  you both drew the lot to stay in the huts she said addressing crayford and steventon and you are both here richard wardour drew the lot to stay and richard wardour is not here how does his name come to be with franks on the list of the missing  the question was a dangerous one to answer steventon left it to crayford to reply once again he answered evasively  it doesnt follow my dear he said that the two men were missing together because their names happen to come together on the list  clara instantly drew the inevitable conclusion from that illconsidered reply  frank is missing from the party of relief she said am i to understand that wardour is missing from the huts  both crayford and steventon hesitated mrs crayford cast one indignant look at them and told the necessary lie without a moments hesitation  yes she said wardour is missing from the huts  quickly as she had spoken she had still spoken too late clara had noticed the momentary hesitation on the part of the two officers she turned to steventon  i trust to your honor she said quietly am i right or wrong in believing that mrs crayford is mistaken  she had addressed herself to the right man of the two steventon had no wife present to exercise authority over him steventon put on his honor and fairly forced to say something owned the truth wardour had replaced an officer whom accident had disabled from accompanying the party of relief and wardour and frank were missing together  clara looked at mrs crayford  you hear she said it is you who are mistaken not i what you call accident what i call fate brought richard wardour and frank together as members of the same expedition after all without waiting for a reply she again turned to steventon and surprised him by changing the painful subject of the conversation of her own accord  have you been in the highlands of scotland she asked  i have never been in the highlands the lieutenant replied  have you ever read in books about the highlands of such a thing as the second sight  yes  do you believe in the second sight  steventon politely declined to commit himself to a direct reply  i dont know what i might have done if i had ever been in the highlands he said as it is i have had no opportunities of giving the subject any serious consideration  i wont put your credulity to the test clara proceeded i wont ask you to believe anything more extraordinary than that i had a strange dream in england not very long since my dream showed me what you have just acknowledgedand more than that how did the two missing men come to be parted from their companions were they lost by pure accident or were they deliberately left behind on the march  crayford made a last vain effort to check her inquiries at the point which they had now reached  neither steventon nor i were members of the party of relief he said how are we to answer you  your brother officers who were members of the party must have told you what happened clara rejoined i only ask you and mr steventon to tell me what they told you  mrs crayford interposed again with a practical suggestion this time  the luncheon is not unpacked yet she said come clara this is our business and the time is passing  the luncheon can wait a few minutes longer clara answered bear with my obstinacy she went on laying her hand caressingly on crayfords shoulder tell me how those two came to be separated from the rest you have always been the kindest of friendsdont begin to be cruel to me now  the tone in which she made her entreaty to crayford went straight to the sailors heart he gave up the hopeless struggle he let her see a glimpse of the truth  on the third day out he said franks strength failed him he fell behind the rest from fatigue  surely they waited for him  it was a serious risk to wait for him my child their lives and the lives of the men they had left in the huts depended in that dreadful climate on their pushing on but frank was a favorite they waited half a day to give frank the chance of recovering his strength  there he stopped there the imprudence into which his fondness for clara had led him showed itself plainly and closed his lips  it was too late to take refuge in silence clara was determined on hearing more  she questioned steventon next  did frank go on again after the halfdays rest she asked  he tried to go on  and failed  yes  what did the men do when he failed did they turn cowards did they desert frank  she had purposely used language which might irritate steventon into answering her plainly he was a young manhe fell into the snare that she had set for him  not one among them was a coward miss burnham he replied warmly you are speaking cruelly and unjustly of as brave a set of fellows as ever lived the strongest man among them set the example he volunteered to stay by frank and to bring him on in the track of the exploring party  there steventon stoppedconscious on his side that he had said too much would she ask him who this volunteer was no she went straight on to the most embarrassing question that she had put yetreferring to the volunteer as if steventon had already mentioned his name  what made richard wardour so ready to risk his life for franks sake she said to crayford did he do it out of friendship for frank surely you can tell me that carry your memory back to the days when you were all living in the huts were frank and wardour friends at that time did you never hear any angry words pass between them  there mrs crayford saw her opportunity of giving her husband a timely hint  my dear child she said how can you expect him to remember that there must have been plenty of quarrels among the men all shut up together and all weary of each others company no doubt  plenty of quarrels crayford repeated and every one of them made up again  and every one of them made up again mrs crayford reiterated in her turn there a plainer answer than that you cant wish to have now are you satisfied mr steventon come and lend a hand as you say at sea with the hamperclara wont help me william dont stand there doing nothing this hamper holds a great deal we must have a division of labor your division shall be laying the tablecloth dont handle it in that clumsy way you unfold a tablecloth as if you were unfurling a sail put the knives on the right and the forks on the left and the napkin and the bread between them clara if you are not hungry in this fine air you ought to be come and do your duty come and have some lunch  she looked up as she spoke clara appeared to have yielded at last to the conspiracy to keep her in the dark she had returned slowly to the boathouse doorway and she was standing alone on the threshold looking out approaching her to lead her to the luncheontable mrs crayford could hear that she was speaking softly to herself she was repeating the farewell words which richard wardour had spoken to her at the ball  a time may come when i shall forgive you but the man who has robbed me of you shall rue the day when you and he first met oh frank frank does richard still live with your blood on his conscience and my image in his heart  her lips suddenly closed she started and drew back from the doorway trembling violently mrs crayford looked out at the quiet seaward view  anything there that frightens you my dear she asked i can see nothing except the boats drawn up on the beach  i can see nothing either lucy  and yet you are trembling as if there was something dreadful in the view from this door  there is something dreadful i feel it though i see nothing i feel it nearer and nearer in the empty air darker and darker in the sunny light i dont know what it is take me away no not out on the beach i cant pass the door somewhere else somewhere else  mrs crayford looked round her and noticed a second door at the inner end of the boathouse she spoke to her husband  see where that door leads to william  crayford opened the door it led into a desolate inclosure half garden half yard some nets stretched on poles were hanging up to dry no other objects were visiblenot a living creature appeared in the place it doesnt look very inviting my dear said mrs crayford i am at your service however what do you say  she offered her arm to clara as she spoke clara refused it she took crayfords arm and clung to him  im frightened dreadfully frightened she said to him faintly you keep with mea woman is no protection i want to be with you she looked round again at the boathouse doorway oh she whispered im cold all overim frozen with fear of this place come into the yard come into the yard  leave her to me said crayford to his wife i will call you if she doesnt get better in the open air  he took her out at once and closed the yard door behind them  mr steventon do you understand this asked mrs crayford what can she possibly be frightened of  she put the question still looking mechanically at the door by which her husband and clara had gone out receiving no reply she glanced round at steventon he was standing on the opposite side of the luncheontable with his eyes fixed attentively on the view from the main doorway of the boathouse mrs crayford looked where steventon was looking this time there was something visible she saw the shadow of a human figure projected on the stretch of smooth yellow sand in front of the boathouse  in a moment more the figure appeared a man came slowly into view and stopped on the threshold of the door    chapter 18   the man was a sinister and terrible object to look at his eyes glared like the eyes of a wild animal his head was bare his long gray hair was torn and tangled his miserable garments hung about him in rags he stood in the doorway a speechless figure of misery and want staring at the wellspread table like a hungry dog  steventon spoke to him  who are you  he answered in a hoarse hollow voice  a starving man  he advanced a few steps slowly and painfully as if he were sinking under fatigue  throw me some bones from the table he said give me my share along with the dogs  there was madness as well as hunger in his eyes while he spoke those words steventon placed mrs crayford behind him so that he might be easily able to protect her in case of need and beckoned to two sailors who were passing the door of the boathouse at the time  give the man some bread and meat he said and wait near him  the outcast seized on the bread and meat with lean longnailed hands that looked like claws after his first mouthful of the food he stopped considered vacantly with himself and broke the bread and meat into two portions one portion he put into an old canvas wallet that hung over his shoulder the other he devoured voraciously steventon questioned him  where do you come from  from the sea  wrecked  yes  steventon turned to mrs crayford  there may be some truth in the poor wretchs story he said i heard something of a strange boat having been cast on the beach thirty or forty miles higher up the coast when were you wrecked my man  the starving creature looked up from his food and made an effort to collect his thoughtsto exert his memory it was not to be done he gave up the attempt in despair his language when he spoke was as wild as his looks  i cant tell you he said i cant get the wash of the sea out of my ears i cant get the shining stars all night and the burning sun all day out of my brain when was i wrecked when was i first adrift in the boat when did i get the tiller in my hand and fight against hunger and sleep when did the gnawing in my breast and the burning in my head first begin i have lost all reckoning of it i cant think i cant sleep i cant get the wash of the sea out of my ears what are you baiting me with questions for let me eat  even the sailors pitied him the sailors asked leave of their officer to add a little drink to his meal  weve got a drop of grog with us sir in a bottle may we give it to him  certainly  he took the bottle fiercely as he had taken the food drank a little stopped and considered with himself again he held up the bottle to the light and marking how much liquor it contained carefully drank half of it only this done he put the bottle in his wallet along with the food  are you saving it up for another time said steventon  im saving it up the man answered never mind what for thats my secret  he looked round the boathouse as he made that reply and noticed mrs crayford for the first time  a woman among you he said is she english is she young let me look closer at her  he advanced a few steps toward the table  dont be afraid mrs crayford said steventon  i am not afraid mrs crayford replied he frightened me at firsthe interests me now let him speak to me if he wishes it  he never spoke he stood in dead silence looking long and anxiously at the beautiful englishwoman  well said steventon  he shook his head sadly and drew back again with a heavy sigh  no he said to himself thats not her face no not found yet  mrs crayfords interest was strongly excited she ventured to speak to him  who is it you want to find she asked your wife  he shook his head again  who then what is she like  he answered that question in words his hoarse hollow voice softened little by little into sorrowful and gentle tones  young he said with a fair sad facewith kind tender eyeswith a soft clear voice young and loving and merciful i keep her face in my mind though i can keep nothing else i must wander wander wanderrestless sleepless homelesstill i find her over the ice and over the snow tossing on the sea tramping over the land awake all night awake all day wander wander wander till i find her  he waved his hand with a gesture of farewell and turned wearily to go out  at the same moment crayford opened the yard door  i think you had better come to clara he began and checked himself noticing the stranger who is that  the shipwrecked man hearing another voice in the room looked round slowly over his shoulder struck by his appearance crayford advanced a little nearer to him mrs crayford spoke to her husband as he passed her  its only a poor mad creature william she whisperedshipwrecked and starving  mad crayford repeated approaching nearer and nearer to the man am i in my right senses he suddenly sprang on the outcast and seized him by the throat richard wardour he cried in a voice of fury alivealive to answer for frank  the man struggled crayford held him  where is frank he said you villain where is frank  the man resisted no longer he repeated vacantly  villain and where is frank  as the name escaped his lips clara appeared at the open yard door and hurried into the room  i heard richards name she said i heard franks name what does it mean  at the sound of her voice the outcast renewed the struggle to free himself with a sudden frenzy of strength which crayford was not able to resist he broke away before the sailors could come to their officers assistance halfway down the length of the room he and clara met one another face to face a new light sparkled in the poor wretchs eyes a cry of recognition burst from his lips he flung one hand up wildly in the air found he shouted and rushed out to the beach before any of the men present could stop him  mrs crayford put her arms round clara and held her up she had not made a movement she had not spoken a word the sight of wardours face had petrified her  the minutes passed and there rose a sudden burst of cheering from the sailors on the beach near the spot where the fishermens boats were drawn up every man left his work every man waved his cap in the air the passengers near at hand caught the infection of enthusiasm and joined the crew a moment more and richard wardour appeared again in the doorway carrying a man in his arms he staggered breathless with the effort that he was making to the place where clara stood held up in mrs crayfords arms  saved clara he cried saved for you  he released the man and placed him in claras arms  frank footsore and wearybut livingsaved saved for her  now clara cried mrs crayford which of us is right i who believed in the mercy of god or you who believed in a dream  she never answered she clung to frank in speechless ecstasy she never even looked at the man who had preserved him in the first absorbing joy of seeing frank alive step by step slower and slower richard wardour drew back and left them by themselves  i may rest now he said faintly i may sleep at last the task is done the struggle is over  his last reserves of strength had been given to frank he stoppedhe staggeredhis hands waved feebly in search of support but for one faithful friend he would have fallen crayford caught him crayford laid his old comrade gently on some sails strewn in a corner and pillowed wardours weary head on his own bosom the tears streamed over his face richard dear richard he said rememberand forgive me  richard neither heeded nor heard him his dim eyes still looked across the room at clara and frank  i have made her happy he murmured i may lay down my weary head now on the mother earth that hushes all her children to rest at last sink heart sink sink to rest oh look at them he said to crayford with a burst of grief they have forgotten me already  it was true the interest was all with the two lovers frank was young and handsome and popular officers passengers and sailors they all crowded round frank they all forgot the martyred man who had saved himthe man who was dying in crayfords arms  crayford tried once more to attract his attentionto win his recognition while there was yet time richard speak to me speak to your old friend  he look round he vacantly repeated crayfords last word  friend he said my eyes are dim friendmy mind is dull i have lost all memories but the memory of her dead thoughtsall dead thoughts but that one and yet you look at me kindly why has your face gone down with the wreck of all the rest  he paused his face changed his thoughts drifted back from present to past he looked at crayford vacantly lost in the terrible remembrances that were rising in him as the shadows rise with the coming night  hark ye friend he whispered never let frank know it there was a time when the fiend within me hungered for his life i had my hands on the boat i heard the voice of the tempter speaking to me launch it and leave him to die i waited with my hands on the boat and my eyes on the place where he slept leave him leave him the voice whispered love him the lads voice answered moaning and murmuring in his sleep love him clara for helping me i heard the morning wind come up in the silence over the great deep far and near i heard the groaning of the floating ice floating floating to the clear water and the balmy air and the wicked voice floated away with itaway away away forever love him love him clara for helping me no wind could float that away love him clara  his voice sank into silence his head dropped on crayfords breast frank saw it frank struggled up on his bleeding feet and parted the friendly throng round him frank had not forgotten the man who had saved him  let me go to him he cried i must and will go to him clara come with me  clara and steventon supported him between them he fell on his knees at wardours side he put his hand on wardours bosom  richard  the weary eyes opened again the sinking voice was heard feebly once more  ah poor frank i didnt forget you frank when i came here to beg i remembered you lying down outside in the shadow of the boats i saved you your share of the food and drink too weak to get at it now a little rest frank i shall soon be strong enough to carry you down to the ship  the end was near they all saw it now the men reverently uncovered their heads in the presence of death in an agony of despair frank appealed to the friends round him  get something to strengthen him for gods sake oh men men i should never have been here but for him he has given all his strength to my weakness and now see how strong i am and how weak he is clara i held by his arm all over the ice and snow he kept watch when i was senseless in the open boat his hand dragged me out of the waves when we were wrecked speak to him clara speak to him his voice failed him and his head dropped on wardours breast  she spoke as well as her tears would let her  richard have you forgotten me  he rallied at the sound of that beloved voice he looked up at her as she knelt at his head  forgotten you still looking at her he lifted his hand with an effort and laid it on frank should i have been strong enough to save him if i could have forgotten you he waited a moment and turned his face feebly toward crayford stay he said someone was here and spoke to me a faint light of recognition glimmered in his eyes ah crayford i recollect now dear crayford come nearer my mind clears but my eyes grow dim you will remember me kindly for franks sake poor frank why does he hide his face is he crying nearer clarai want to look my last at you my sister clara kiss me sister kiss me before i die  she stooped and kissed his forehead a faint smile trembled on his lips it passed away and stillness possessed the facethe stillness of death  crayfords voice was heard in the silence  the loss is ours he said the gain is his he has won the greatest of all conqueststhe conquest of himself and he has died in the moment of victory not one of us here but may live to envy his glorious death  the distant report of a gun came from the ship in the offing and signaled the return to england and to home
