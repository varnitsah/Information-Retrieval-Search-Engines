77180234	the devils disciple   bernard shaw     act i  at the most wretched hour between a black night and a wintry morning in the year 1777 mrs dudgeon of new hampshire is sitting up in the kitchen and general dwelling room of her farm house on the outskirts of the town of websterbridge she is not a prepossessing woman no woman looks her best after sitting up all night and mrs dudgeons face even at its best is grimly trenched by the channels into which the barren forms and observances of a dead puritanism can pen a bitter temper and a fierce pride she is an elderly matron who has worked hard and got nothing by it except dominion and detestation in her sordid home and an unquestioned reputation for piety and respectability among her neighbors to whom drink and debauchery are still so much more tempting than religion and rectitude that they conceive goodness simply as selfdenial this conception is easily extended to othersdenial and finally generalized as covering anything disagreeable so mrs dudgeon being exceedingly disagreeable is held to be exceedingly good short of flat felony she enjoys complete license except for amiable weaknesses of any sort and is consequently without knowing it the most licentious woman in the parish on the strength of never having broken the seventh commandment or missed a sunday at the presbyterian church  the year 1777 is the one in which the passions roused of the breaking off of the american colonies from england more by their own weight than their own will boiled up to shooting point the shooting being idealized to the english mind as suppression of rebellion and maintenance of british dominion and to the american as defence of liberty resistance to tyranny and selfsacrifice on the altar of the rights of man into the merits of these idealizations it is not here necessary to inquire suffice it to say without prejudice that they have convinced both americans and english that the most high minded course for them to pursue is to kill as many of one another as possible and that military operations to that end are in full swing morally supported by confident requests from the clergy of both sides for the blessing of god on their arms  under such circumstances many other women besides this disagreeable mrs dudgeon find themselves sitting up all night waiting for news like her too they fall asleep towards morning at the risk of nodding themselves into the kitchen fire mrs dudgeon sleeps with a shawl over her head and her feet on a broad fender of iron laths the step of the domestic altar of the fireplace with its huge hobs and boiler and its hinged arm above the smoky mantelshelf for roasting the plain kitchen table is opposite the fire at her elbow with a candle on it in a tin sconce her chair like all the others in the room is uncushioned and unpainted but as it has a round railed back and a seat conventionally moulded to the sitters curves it is comparatively a chair of state the room has three doors one on the same side as the fireplace near the corner leading to the best bedroom one at the opposite end of the opposite wall leading to the scullery and washhouse and the house door with its latch heavy lock and clumsy wooden bar in the front wall between the window in its middle and the corner next the bedroom door between the door and the window a rack of pegs suggests to the deductive observer that the men of the house are all away as there are no hats or coats on them on the other side of the window the clock hangs on a nail with its white wooden dial black iron weights and brass pendulum between the clock and the corner a big cupboard locked stands on a dwarf dresser full of common crockery  on the side opposite the fireplace between the door and the corner a shamelessly ugly black horsehair sofa stands against the wall an inspection of its stridulous surface shows that mrs dudgeon is not alone a girl of sixteen or seventeen has fallen asleep on it she is a wild timid looking creature with black hair and tanned skin her frock a scanty garment is rent weatherstained berrystained and by no means scrupulously clean it hangs on her with a freedom which taken with her brown legs and bare feet suggests no great stock of underclothing  suddenly there comes a tapping at the door not loud enough to wake the sleepers then knocking which disturbs mrs dudgeon a little finally the latch is tried whereupon she springs up at once  mrs dudgeon threateningly well why dont you open the door she sees that the girl is asleep and immediately raises a clamor of heartfelt vexation well dear dear me now this is shaking her wake up wake up do you hear  the girl sitting up what is it  mrs dudgeon wake up and be ashamed of yourself you unfeeling sinful girl falling asleep like that and your father hardly cold in his grave  the girl half asleep still i didnt mean to i dropped off  mrs dudgeon cutting her short oh yes youve plenty of excuses i daresay dropped off fiercely as the knocking recommences why dont you get up and let your uncle in after me waiting up all night for him she pushes her rudely off the sofa there ill open the door much good you are to wait up go and mend that fire a bit  the girl cowed and wretched goes to the fire and puts a log on mrs dudgeon unbars the door and opens it letting into the stuffy kitchen a little of the freshness and a great deal of the chill of the dawn also her second son christy a fattish stupid fairhaired roundfaced man of about 22 muffled in a plaid shawl and grey overcoat he hurries shivering to the fire leaving mrs dudgeon to shut the door  christy at the fire fff but it is cold seeing the girl and staring lumpishly at her why who are you  the girl shyly essie  mrs dudgeon oh you may well ask to essie go to your room child and lie down since you havent feeling enough to keep you awake your history isnt fit for your own ears to hear  essie i  mrs dudgeon peremptorily dont answer me miss but show your obedience by doing what i tell you essie almost in tears crosses the room to the door near the sofa and dont forget your prayers essie goes out shed have gone to bed last night just as if nothing had happened if id let her  christy phlegmatically well she cant be expected to feel uncle peters death like one of the family  mrs dudgeon what are you talking about child isnt she his daughterthe punishment of his wickedness and shame she assaults her chair by sitting down  christy staring uncle peters daughter  mrs dudgeon why else should she be here dye think ive not had enough trouble and care put upon me bringing up my own girls let alone you and your goodfornothing brother without having your uncles bastards  christy interrupting her with an apprehensive glance at the door by which essie went out sh she may hear you  mrs dudgeon raising her voice let her hear me people who fear god dont fear to give the devils work its right name christy soullessly indifferent to the strife of good and evil stares at the fire warming himself well how long are you going to stare there like a stuck pig what news have you for me  christy taking off his hat and shawl and going to the rack to hang them up the minister is to break the news to you hell be here presently  mrs dudgeon break what news  christy standing on tiptoe from boyish habit to hang his hat up though he is quite tall enough to reach the peg and speaking with callous placidity considering the nature of the announcement fathers dead too  mrs dudgeon stupent your father  christy sulkily coming back to the fire and warming himself again attending much more to the fire than to his mother well its not my fault when we got to nevinstown we found him ill in bed he didnt know us at first the minister sat up with him and sent me away he died in the night  mrs dudgeon bursting into dry angry tears well i do think this is hard on mevery hard on me his brother that was a disgrace to us all his life gets hanged on the public gallows as a rebel and your father instead of staying at home where his duty was with his own family goes after him and dies leaving everything on my shoulders after sending this girl to me to take care of too she plucks her shawl vexedly over her ears its sinful so it is downright sinful  christy with a slow bovine cheerfulness after a pause i think its going to be a fine morning after all  mrs dudgeon railing at him a fine morning and your father newly dead wheres your feelings child  christy obstinately well i didnt mean any harm i suppose a man may make a remark about the weather even if his fathers dead  mrs dudgeon bitterly a nice comfort my children are to me one son a fool and the other a lost sinner thats left his home to live with smugglers and gypsies and villains the scum of the earth  someone knocks  christy without moving thats the minister  mrs dudgeon sharply well arent you going to let mr anderson in  christy goes sheepishly to the door mrs dudgeon buries her face in her hands as it is her duty as a widow to be overcome with grief christy opens the door and admits the minister anthony anderson a shrewd genial ready presbyterian divine of about 50 with something of the authority of his profession in his bearing but it is an altogether secular authority sweetened by a conciliatory sensible manner not at all suggestive of a quite thoroughgoing otherworldliness he is a strong healthy man too with a thick sanguine neck and his keen cheerful mouth cuts into somewhat fleshy corners no doubt an excellent parson but still a man capable of making the most of this world and perhaps a little apologetically conscious of getting on better with it than a sound presbyterian ought  anderson to christy at the door looking at mrs dudgeon whilst he takes off his cloak have you told her  christy she made me he shuts the door yawns and loafs across to the sofa where he sits down and presently drops off to sleep  anderson looks compassionately at mrs dudgeon then he hangs his cloak and hat on the rack mrs dudgeon dries her eyes and looks up at him  anderson sister the lord has laid his hand very heavily upon you  mrs dudgeon with intensely recalcitrant resignation its his will i suppose and i must bow to it but i do think it hard what call had timothy to go to springtown and remind everybody that he belonged to a man that was being hangedand spitefully that deserved it if ever a man did  anderson gently they were brothers mrs dudgeon  mrs dudgeon timothy never acknowledged him as his brother after we were married he had too much respect for me to insult me with such a brother would such a selfish wretch as peter have come thirty miles to see timothy hanged do you think not thirty yards not he however i must bear my cross as best i may least said is soonest mended  anderson very grave coming down to the fire to stand with his back to it your eldest son was present at the execution mrs dudgeon  mrs dudgeon disagreeably surprised richard  anderson nodding yes  mrs dudgeon vindictively let it be a warning to him he may end that way himself the wicked dissolute godless she suddenly stops her voice fails and she asks with evident dread did timothy see him  anderson yes  mrs dudgeon holding her breath well  anderson he only saw him in the crowd they did not speak mrs dudgeon greatly relieved exhales the pent up breath and sits at her ease again your husband was greatly touched and impressed by his brothers awful death mrs dudgeon sneers anderson breaks off to demand with some indignation well wasnt it only natural mrs dudgeon he softened towards his prodigal son in that moment he sent for him to come to see him  mrs dudgeon her alarm renewed sent for richard  anderson yes but richard would not come he sent his father a message but im sorry to say it was a wicked messagean awful message  mrs dudgeon what was it  anderson that he would stand by his wicked uncle and stand against his good parents in this world and the next  mrs dudgeon implacably he will be punished for it he will be punished for itin both worlds  anderson that is not in our hands mrs dudgeon  mrs dudgeon did i say it was mr anderson we are told that the wicked shall be punished why should we do our duty and keep gods law if there is to be no difference made between us and those who follow their own likings and dislikings and make a jest of us and of their makers word  anderson well richards earthly father has been merciful and his heavenly judge is the father of us all  mrs dudgeon forgetting herself richards earthly father was a softheaded  anderson shocked oh  mrs dudgeon with a touch of shame  well i am richards mother if i am against him who has any right to be for him trying to conciliate him wont you sit down mr anderson i should have asked you before but im so troubled  anderson thank you he takes a chair from beside the fireplace and turns it so that he can sit comfortably at the fire when he is seated he adds in the tone of a man who knows that he is opening a difficult subject has christy told you about the new will  mrs dudgeon all her fears returning the new will did timothy she breaks off gasping unable to complete the question  anderson yes in his last hours he changed his mind  mrs dudgeon white with intense rage and you let him rob me  anderson i had no power to prevent him giving what was his to his own son  mrs dudgeon he had nothing of his own his money was the money i brought him as my marriage portion it was for me to deal with my own money and my own son he dare not have done it if i had been with him and well he knew it that was why he stole away like a thief to take advantage of the law to rob me by making a new will behind my back the more shame on you mr andersonyou a minister of the gospelto act as his accomplice in such a crime  anderson rising i will take no offence at what you say in the first bitterness of your grief  mrs dudgeon contemptuously grief  anderson well of your disappointment if you can find it in your heart to think that the better word  mrs dudgeon my heart my heart and since when pray have you begun to hold up our hearts as trustworthy guides for us  anderson rather guiltily ier  mrs dudgeon vehemently dont lie mr anderson we are told that the heart of man is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked my heart belonged not to timothy but to that poor wretched brother of his that has just ended his days with a rope round his neckaye to peter dudgeon you know it old eli hawkins the man to whose pulpit you succeeded though you are not worthy to loose his shoe latchet told it you when he gave over our souls into your charge he warned me and strengthened me against my heart and made me marry a godfearing manas he thought what else but that discipline has made me the woman i am and you you who followed your heart in your marriage you talk to me of what i find in my heart go home to your pretty wife man and leave me to my prayers she turns from him and leans with her elbows on the table brooding over her wrongs and taking no further notice of him  anderson willing enough to escape the lord forbid that i should come between you and the source of all comfort he goes to the rack for his coat and hat  mrs dudgeon without looking at him the lord will know what to forbid and what to allow without your help  anderson and whom to forgive i hopeeli hawkins and myself if we have ever set up our preaching against his law he fastens his cloak and is now ready to go just one wordon necessary business mrs dudgeon there is the reading of the will to be gone through and richard has a right to be present he is in the town but he has the grace to say that he does not want to force himself in here  mrs dudgeon he shall come here does he expect us to leave his fathers house for his convenience let them all come and come quickly and go quickly they shall not make the will an excuse to shirk half their days work i shall be ready never fear  anderson coming back a step or two mrs dudgeon i used to have some little influence with you when did i lose it  mrs dudgeon still without turning to him when you married for love now youre answered  anderson yes i am answered he goes out musing  mrs dudgeon to herself thinking of her husband thief thief she shakes herself angrily out of the chair throws back the shawl from her head and sets to work to prepare the room for the reading of the will beginning by replacing andersons chair against the wall and pushing back her own to the window then she calls in her hard driving wrathful way christy no answer he is fast asleep christy she shakes him roughly get up out of that and be ashamed of yourselfsleeping and your father dead she returns to the table puts the candle on the mantelshelf and takes from the table drawer a red table cloth which she spreads  christy rising reluctantly well do you suppose we are never going to sleep until we are out of mourning  mrs dudgeon i want none of your sulks here help me to set this table they place the table in the middle of the room with christys end towards the fireplace and mrs dudgeons towards the sofa christy drops the table as soon as possible and goes to the fire leaving his mother to make the final adjustments of its position we shall have the minister back here with the lawyer and all the family to read the will before you have done toasting yourself go and wake that girl and then light the stove in the shed you cant have your breakfast here and mind you wash yourself and make yourself fit to receive the company she punctuates these orders by going to the cupboard unlocking it and producing a decanter of wine which has no doubt stood there untouched since the last state occasion in the family and some glasses which she sets on the table also two green ware plates on one of which she puts a barmbrack with a knife beside it on the other she shakes some biscuits out of a tin putting back one or two and counting the rest now mind there are ten biscuits there let there be ten there when i come back after dressing myself and keep your fingers off the raisins in that cake and tell essie the same i suppose i can trust you to bring in the case of stuffed birds without breaking the glass she replaces the tin in the cupboard which she locks pocketing the key carefully  christy lingering at the fire youd better put the inkstand instead for the lawyer  mrs dudgeon thats no answer to make to me sir go and do as youre told christy turns sullenly to obey stop take down that shutter before you go and let the daylight in you cant expect me to do all the heavy work of the house with a great heavy lout like you idling about  christy takes the window bar out of its damps and puts it aside then opens the shutter showing the grey morning mrs dudgeon takes the sconce from the mantelshelf blows out the candle extinguishes the snuff by pinching it with her fingers first licking them for the purpose and replaces the sconce on the shelf  christy looking through the window heres the ministers wife  mrs dudgeon displeased what is she coming here  christy yes  mrs dudgeon what does she want troubling me at this hour before im properly dressed to receive people  christy youd better ask her  mrs dudgeon threateningly youd better keep a civil tongue in your head he goes sulkily towards the door she comes after him plying him with instructions tell that girl to come to me as soon as shes had her breakfast and  tell her to make herself fit to be seen before the people christy goes out and slams the door in her face nice manners that someone knocks at the house door she turns and cries inhospitably come in judith anderson the  ministers wife comes in judith is more than twenty years  younger than her husband though she will never be as young as he in vitality she is pretty and proper and ladylike and has been admired and petted into an opinion of herself sufficiently favorable to give her a selfassurance which serves her instead of strength she has a pretty taste in dress and in her face the pretty lines of a sentimental character formed by dreams even her little selfcomplacency is pretty like a childs vanity rather a pathetic creature to any sympathetic observer who knows how rough a place the world is one feels on the whole that anderson might have chosen worse and that she needing protection could not have chosen better oh its you is it mrs anderson  judith very politelyalmost patronizingly yes can i do anything for you mrs dudgeon can i help to get the place ready before they come to read the will  mrs dudgeon stiffly thank you mrs anderson my house is always ready for anyone to come into  mrs anderson with complacent amiability yes indeed it is perhaps you had rather i did not intrude on you just now  mrs dudgeon oh one more or less will make no difference this morning mrs anderson now that youre here youd better stay if you wouldnt mind shutting the door judith smiles implying how stupid of me and shuts it with an exasperating air of doing something pretty and becoming thats better i must go and tidy myself a bit i suppose you dont mind stopping here to receive anyone that comes until im ready  judith graciously giving her leave oh yes certainly leave them to me mrs dudgeon and take your time she hangs her cloak and bonnet on the rack  mrs dudgeon half sneering i thought that would be more in your way than getting the house ready essie comes back oh here you are severely come here let me see you essie timidly goes to her mrs dudgeon takes her roughly by the arm and pulls her round to inspect the results of her attempt to clean and tidy herselfresults which show little practice and less conviction mm thats what you call doing your hair properly i suppose its easy to see what you are and how you were brought up she throws her arms away and goes on peremptorily now you listen to me and do as youre told you sit down there in the corner by the fire and when the company comes dont dare to speak until youre spoken to essie creeps away to the fireplace your fathers people had better see you and know youre there theyre as much bound to keep you from starvation as i am at any rate they might help but let me have no chattering and making free with them as if you were their equal do you hear  essie yes  mrs dudgeon well then go and do as youre told  essie sits down miserably on the corner of the fender furthest from the door never mind her mrs anderson you know who she is and what she is if she gives you any trouble just tell me and ill settle accounts with her mrs dudgeon goes into the bedroom shutting the door sharply behind her as if even it had to be made to do its duty with a ruthless hand  judith patronizing essie and arranging the cake and wine on the table more becomingly you must not mind if your aunt is strict with you she is a very good woman and desires your good too  essie in listless misery yes  judith annoyed with essie for her failure to be consoled and edified and to appreciate the kindly condescension of the remark you are not going to be sullen i hope essie  essie no  judith thats a good girl she places a couple of chairs at the table with their backs to the window with a pleasant sense of being a more thoughtful housekeeper than mrs dudgeon do you know any of your fathers relatives  essie no they wouldnt have anything to do with him they were too religious father used to talk about dick dudgeon but i never saw him  judith ostentatiously shocked dick dudgeon essie do you wish to be a really respectable and grateful girl and to make a place for yourself here by steady good conduct  essie very halfheartedly yes  judith then you must never mention the name of richard dudgeonnever even think about him he is a bad man  essie what has he done  judith you must not ask questions about him essie you are too young to know what it is to be a bad man but he is a smuggler and he lives with gypsies and he has no love for his mother and his family and he wrestles and plays games on sunday instead of going to church never let him into your presence if you can help it essie and try to keep yourself and all womanhood unspotted by contact with such men  essie yes  judith again displeased i am afraid you say yes and no without thinking very deeply  essie yes at least i mean  judith severely what do you mean  essie almost crying onlymy father was a smuggler and someone knocks  judith they are beginning to come now remember your aunts directions essie and be a good girl christy comes back with the stand of stuffed birds under a glass case and an inkstand which he places on the table good morning mr dudgeon will you open the door please the people have come  christy good morning he opens the house door  the morning is now fairly bright and warm and anderson who is the first to enter has left his cloak at home he is accompanied by lawyer hawkins a brisk middleaged man in brown riding gaiters and yellow breeches looking as much squire as solicitor he and anderson are allowed precedence as representing the learned professions after them comes the family headed by the senior uncle william dudgeon a large shapeless man bottlenosed and evidently no ascetic at table his clothes are not the clothes nor his anxious wife the wife of a prosperous man the junior uncle titus dudgeon is a wiry little terrier of a man with an immense and visibly purseproud wife both free from the cares of the william household  hawkins at once goes briskly to the table and takes the chair nearest the sofa christy having left the inkstand there he puts his hat on the floor beside him and produces the will uncle william comes to the fire and stands on the hearth warming his coat tails leaving mrs william derelict near the door uncle titus who is the ladys man of the family rescues her by giving her his disengaged arm and bringing her to the sofa where he sits down warmly between his own lady and his brothers anderson hangs up his hat and waits for a word with judith  judith she will be here in a moment ask them to wait she taps at the bedroom door receiving an answer from within she opens it and passes through  anderson taking his place at the table at the opposite end to hawkins our poor afflicted sister will be with us in a moment are we all here  christy at the house door which he has just shut all except dick  the callousness with which christy names the reprobate jars on the moral sense of the family uncle william shakes his head slowly and repeatedly mrs titus catches her breath convulsively through her nose her husband speaks  uncle titus well i hope he will have the grace not to come i hope so  the dudgeons all murmur assent except christy who goes to the window and posts himself there looking out hawkins smiles secretively as if he knew something that would change their tune if they knew it anderson is uneasy the love of solemn family councils especially funereal ones is not in his nature judith appears at the bedroom door  judith with gentle impressiveness friends mrs dudgeon she takes the chair from beside the fireplace and places it for mrs dudgeon who comes from the bedroom in black with a clean handkerchief to her eyes all rise except essie mrs titus and mrs william produce equally clean handkerchiefs and weep it is an affecting moment  uncle william would it comfort you sister if we were to offer up a prayer  uncle titus or sing a hymn  anderson rather hastily i have been with our sister this morning already friends in our hearts we ask a blessing  all except essie amen  they all sit down except judith who stands behind mrs dudgeons chair  judith to essie essie did you say amen  essie scaredly no  judith then say it like a good girl  essie amen  uncle william encouragingly thats right thats right we know who you are but we are willing to be kind to you if you are a good girl and deserve it we are all equal before the throne  this republican sentiment does not please the women who are convinced that the throne is precisely the place where their superiority often questioned in this world will be recognized and rewarded  christy at the window heres dick  anderson and hawkins look round sociably essie with a gleam of interest breaking through her misery looks up christy grins and gapes expectantly at the door the rest are petrified with the intensity of their sense of virtue menaced with outrage by the approach of flaunting vice the reprobate appears in the doorway graced beyond his alleged merits by the morning sunlight he is certainly the best looking member of the family but his expression is reckless and sardonic his manner defiant and satirical his dress picturesquely careless only his forehead and mouth betray an extraordinary steadfastness and his eyes are the eyes of a fanatic  richard on the threshold taking off his hat ladies and gentlemen your servant your very humble servant with this comprehensive insult he throws his hat to christy with a suddenness that makes him jump like a negligent wicket keeper and comes into the middle of the room where he turns and deliberately surveys the company how happy you all look how glad to see me he turns towards mrs dudgeons chair and his lip rolls up horribly from his dog tooth as he meets her look of undisguised hatred well mother keeping up appearances as usual thats right thats right judith pointedly moves away from his neighborhood to the other side of the kitchen holding her skirt instinctively as if to save it from contamination uncle titus promptly marks his approval of her action by rising from the sofa and placing a chair for her to sit down upon what uncle william i havent seen you since you gave up drinking poor uncle william shamed would protest but richard claps him heartily on his shoulder adding you have given it up havent you releasing him with a playful push of course you have quite right too you overdid it he turns away from uncle william and makes for the sofa and now where is that upright horsedealer uncle titus uncle titus come forth he comes upon him holding the chair as judith sits down as usual looking after the ladies  uncle titus indignantly be ashamed of yourself sir  richard interrupting him and shaking his hand in spite of him i am i am but i am proud of my uncleproud of all my relatives again surveying them who could look at them and not be proud and joyful uncle titus overborne resumes his seat on the sofa richard turns to the table ah mr anderson still at the good work still shepherding them keep them up to the mark minister keep them up to the mark come with a spring he seats himself on the table and takes up the decanter clink a glass with me pastor for the sake of old times  anderson you know i think mr dudgeon that i do not drink before dinner  richard you will some day pastor uncle william used to drink before breakfast come it will give your sermons unction he smells the wine and makes a wry face but do not begin on my mothers company sherry i stole some when i was six years old and i have been a temperate man ever since he puts the decanter down and changes the subject so i hear you are married pastor and that your wife has a most ungodly allowance of good looks  anderson quietly indicating judith sir you are in the presence of my wife judith rises and stands with stony propriety  richard quickly slipping down from the table with instinctive good manners your servant madam no offence he looks at her earnestly you deserve your reputation but im sorry to see by your expression that youre a good woman  she looks shocked and sits down amid a murmur of indignant sympathy from his relatives anderson sensible enough to know that these demonstrations can only gratify and encourage a man who is deliberately trying to provoke them remains perfectly goodhumored all the same pastor i respect you more than i did before by the way did i hear or did i not that our late lamented uncle peter though unmarried was a father  uncle titus he had only one irregular child sir  richard only one he thinks one a mere trifle i blush for you uncle titus  anderson mr dudgeon you are in the presence of your mother and her grief  richard it touches me profoundly pastor by the way what has become of the irregular child  anderson pointing to essie there sir listening to you  richard shocked into sincerity what why the devil didnt you tell me that before children suffer enough in this house without he hurries remorsefully to essie come little cousin never mind me it was not meant to hurt you she looks up gratefully at him her tearstained face affects him violently and he bursts out in a transport of wrath who has been making her cry who has been illtreating her by god  mrs dudgeon rising and confronting him silence your blasphemous tongue i will hear no more of this leave my house  richard how do you know its your house until the will is read they look at one another for a moment with intense hatred and then she sinks checkmated into her chair richard goes boldly up past anderson to the window where he takes the railed chair in his hand ladies and gentlemen as the eldest son of my late father and the unworthy head of this household i bid you welcome by your leave minister anderson by your leave lawyer hawkins the head of the table for the head of the family he places the chair at the table between the minister and the attorney sits down between them and addresses the assembly with a presidential air we meet on a melancholy occasion a father dead an uncle actually hanged and probably damned he shakes his head deploringly the relatives freeze with horror thats right pull your longest faces his voice suddenly sweetens gravely as his glance lights on essie provided only there is hope in the eyes of the child briskly now then lawyer hawkins business business get on with the will man  titus do not let yourself be ordered or hurried mr hawkins  hawkins very politely and willingly mr dudgeon means no offence i feel sure i will not keep you one second mr dudgeon just while i get my glasses he fumbles for them the dudgeons look at one another with misgiving  richard aha they notice your civility mr hawkins they are prepared for the worst a glass of wine to clear your voice before you begin he pours out one for him and hands it then pours one for himself  hawkins thank you mr dudgeon your good health sir  richard yours sir with the glass half way to his lips he checks himself giving a dubious glance at the wine and adds with quaint intensity will anyone oblige me with a glass of water  essie who has been hanging on his every word and movement rises stealthily and slips out behind mrs dudgeon through the bedroom door returning presently with a jug and going out of the house as quietly as possible  hawkins the will is not exactly in proper legal phraseology  richard no my father died without the consolations of the law  hawkins good again mr dudgeon good again preparing to read are you ready sir  richard ready aye ready for what we are about to receive may the lord make us truly thankful go ahead  hawkins reading this is the last will and testament of me timothy dudgeon

and declare that i am of sound mind and know well what i am doing and that this is my real will according to my own wish and affections  richard glancing at his mother aha  hawkins shaking his head bad phraseology sir wrong phraseology i give and bequeath a hundred pounds to my younger son christopher dudgeon fifty pounds to be paid to him on the day of his marriage to sarah wilkins if she will have him and ten pounds on the birth of each of his children up to the number of five  richard how if she wont have him  christy she will if i have fifty pounds  richard good my brother proceed

brother peters natural child starve or be driven by want to an evil life  richard emphatically striking his fist on the table agreed  mrs dudgeon turning to look malignantly at essie misses her and looks quickly round to see where she has moved to then seeing that she has left the room without leave closes her lips vengefully  hawkins second that he shall be a good friend to my old horse jim again slacking his head he should have written james sir  richard james shall live in clover go on  hawkins and keep my deaf farm laborer prodger feston in his service  richard prodger feston shall get drunk every saturday  hawkins third that he make christy a present on his marriage out of the ornaments in the best room  richard holding up the stuffed birds here you are christy  christy disappointed id rather have the china peacocks  richard you shall have both christy is greatly pleased go on  hawkins fourthly and lastly that he try to live at peace with his mother as far as she will consent to it  richard dubiously hm anything more mr hawkins  hawkins solemnly finally i gave and bequeath my soul into my makers hands humbly asking forgiveness for all my sins and mistakes and hoping that he will so guide my son that it may not be said that i have done wrong in trusting to him rather than to others in the perplexity of my last hour in this strange place  anderson amen  the uncles and aunts amen  richard my mother does not say amen  mrs dudgeon rising unable to give up her property without a struggle mr hawkins is that a proper will remember i have his rightful legal will drawn up by yourself leaving all to me  hawkins this is a very wrongly and irregularly worded will mrs dudgeon though turning politely to richard it contains in my judgment an excellent disposal of his property  anderson interposing before mrs dudgeon can retort that is not what you are asked mr hawkins is it a legal will  hawkins the courts will sustain it against the other  anderson but why if the other is more lawfully worded  hawking because sir the courts will sustain the claim of a manand that man the eldest sonagainst any woman if they can i warned you mrs dudgeon when you got me to draw that other will that it was not a wise will and that though you might make him sign it he would never be easy until he revoked it but you wouldnt take advice and now mr richard is cock of the walk he takes his hat from the floor rises and begins pocketing his papers and spectacles  this is the signal for the breakingup of the party anderson takes his hat from the rack and joins uncle william at the fire uncle titus fetches judith her things from the rack the three on the sofa rise and chat with hawkins mrs dudgeon now an intruder in her own house stands erect crushed by the weight of the law on women accepting it as she has been trained to accept all monstrous calamities as proofs of the greatness of the power that inflicts them and of her own wormlike insignificance for at this time remember mary wollstonecraft is as yet only a girl of eighteen and her vindication of the rights of women is still fourteen years off mrs dudgeon is rescued from her apathy by essie who comes back with the jug full of water she is taking it to richard when mrs dudgeon stops her  mrs dudgeon threatening her where have you been essie appalled tries to answer but cannot how dare you go out by yourself after the orders i gave you  essie he asked for a drink she stops her tongue cleaving to her palate with terror  judith with gentler severity who asked for a drink essie speechless points to richard  richard what i  judith shocked oh essie essie  richard i believe i did he takes a glass and holds it to essie to be filled her hand shakes what afraid of me  essie quickly no i she pours out the water  richard tasting it ah youve been up the street to the market gate spring to get that he takes a draught delicious thank you unfortunately at this moment he chances to catch sight of judiths face which expresses the most prudish disapproval of his evident attraction for essie who is devouring him with her grateful eyes his mocking expression returns instantly he puts down the glass deliberately winds his arm round essies shoulders and brings her into the middle of the company mrs dudgeon being in essies way as they come past the table he says by your leave mother and compels her to make way for them what do they call you bessie  essie essie  richard essie to be sure are you a good girl essie  essie greatly disappointed that he of all people should begin at her in this way yes she looks doubtfully at judith i think so i mean ii hope so  richard essie did you ever hear of a person called the devil  anderson revolted shame on you sir with a mere child  richard by your leave minister i do not interfere with your sermons do not you interrupt mine to essie do you know what they call me essie  essie dick  richard amused patting her on the shoulder yes dick but something else too they call me the devils disciple  essie why do you let them  richard seriously because its true i was brought up in the other service but i knew from the first that the devil was my natural master and captain and friend i saw that he was in the right and that the world cringed to his conqueror only through fear i prayed secretly to him and he comforted me and saved me from having my spirit broken in this house of childrens tears i promised him my soul and swore an oath that i would stand up for him in this world and stand by him in the next solemnly that promise and that oath made a man of me from this day this house is his home and no child shall cry in it this hearth is his altar and no soul shall ever cower over it in the dark evenings and be afraid now turning forcibly on the rest which of you good men will take this child and rescue her from the house of the devil  judith coming to essie and throwing a protecting arm about her i will you should be burnt alive  essie but i dont want to she shrinks back leaving richard and judith face to face  richard to judith actually doesnt want to most virtuous lady  uncle titus have a care richard dudgeon the law  richard turning threateningly on him have a care you in an hour from this there will be no law here but martial law i passed the soldiers within six miles on my way here before noon major swindons gallows for rebels will be up in the market place  anderson calmly what have we to fear from that sir  richard more than you think he hanged the wrong man at springtown he thought uncle peter was respectable because the dudgeons had a good name but his next example will be the best man in the town to whom he can bring home a rebellious word well were all rebels and you know it  all the men except anderson no no no  richard yes you are you havent damned king george up hill and down dale as i have but youve prayed for his defeat and you anthony anderson have conducted the service and sold your family bible to buy a pair of pistols they maynt hang me perhaps because the moral effect of the devils disciple dancing on nothing wouldnt help them but a minister judith dismayed clings to anderson or a lawyer hawkins smiles like a man able to take care of himself or an upright horsedealer uncle titus snarls at him in rags and terror or a reformed drunkard uncle william utterly unnerved moans and wobbles with fear eh would that show that king george meant businessha  anderson perfectly selfpossessed come my dear he is only trying to frighten you there is no danger he takes her out of the house the rest crowd to the door to follow him except essie who remains near richard  richard boisterously derisive now then how many of you will stay with me run up the american flag on the devils house and make a fight for freedom they scramble out christy among them hustling one another in their haste ha ha long live the devil to mrs dudgeon who is following them what mother are you off too  mrs dudgeon deadly pale with her hand on her heart as if she had received a deathblow my curse on you my dying curse she goes out  richard calling after her it will bring me luck ha ha ha  essie anxiously maynt i stay  richard turning to her what have they forgotten to save your soul in their anxiety about their own bodies oh yes you may stay he turns excitedly away again and shakes his fist after them his left fist also clenched hangs down essie seizes it and kisses it her tears falling on it he starts and looks at it tears the devils baptism she falls on her knees sobbing he stoops goodnaturedly to raise her saying oh yes you may cry that way essie if you like    act ii  minister andersons house is in the main street of websterbridge not far from the town hall to the eye of the eighteenth century new englander it is much grander than the plain farmhouse of the dudgeons but it is so plain itself that a modern house agent would let both at about the same rent the chief dwelling room has the same sort of kitchen fireplace with boiler toaster hanging on the bars movable iron griddle socketed to the hob hook above for roasting and broad fender on which stand a kettle and a plate of buttered toast the door between the fireplace and the corner has neither panels fingerplates nor handles it is made of plain boards and fastens with a latch the table is a kitchen table with a treacle colored cover of american cloth chapped at the corners by draping the tea service on it consists of two thick cups and saucers of the plainest ware with milk jug and bowl to match each large enough to contain nearly a quart on a black japanned tray and in the middle of the table a wooden trencher with a big loaf upon it and a square half pound block of butter in a crock the big oak press facing the fire from the opposite side of the room is for use and storage not for ornament and the ministers house coat hangs on a peg from its door showing that he is out for when he is in it is his best coat that hangs there his big riding boots stand beside the press evidently in their usual place and rather proud of themselves in fact the evolution of the ministers kitchen dining room and drawing room into three separate apartments has not yet taken place and so from the point of view of our pampered period he is no better off than the dudgeons  but there is a difference for all that to begin with mrs anderson is a pleasanter person to live with than mrs dudgeon to which mrs dudgeon would at once reply with reason that mrs anderson has no children to look after no poultry pigs nor cattle a steady and sufficient income not directly dependent on harvests and prices at fairs an affectionate husband who is a tower of strength to her in short that life is as easy at the ministers house as it is hard at the farm this is true but to explain a fact is not to alter it and however little credit mrs anderson may deserve for making her home happier she has certainly succeeded in doing it the outward and visible signs of her superior social pretensions are a drugget on the floor a plaster ceiling between the timbers and chairs which though not upholstered are stained and polished the fine arts are represented by a mezzotint portrait of some presbyterian divine a copperplate of raphaels st paul preaching at athens a rococo presentation clock on the mantelshelf flanked by a couple of miniatures a pair of crockery dogs with baskets in their mouths and at the corners two large cowrie shells a pretty feature of the room is the low wide latticed window nearly its whole width with little red curtains running on a rod half way up it to serve as a blind there is no sofa but one of the seats standing near the press has a railed back and is long enough to accommodate two people easily on the whole it is rather the sort of room that the nineteenth century has ended in struggling to get back to under the leadership of mr philip webb and his disciples in domestic architecture though no genteel clergyman would have tolerated it fifty years ago  the evening has closed in and the room is dark except for the cosy firelight and the dim oil lamps seen through the window in the wet street where there is a quiet steady warm windless downpour of rain as the town clock strikes the quarter judith comes in with a couple of candles in earthenware candlesticks and sets them on the table her selfconscious airs of the morning are gone she is anxious and frightened she goes to the window and peers into the street the first thing she sees there is her husband hurrying here through the rain she gives a little gasp of relief not very far removed from a sob and turns to the door anderson comes in wrapped in a very wet cloak  judith running to him oh here you are at last at last she attempts to embrace him  anderson keeping her off take care my love im wet wait till i get my cloak off he places a chair with its back to the fire hangs his cloak on it to dry shakes the rain from his hat and puts it on the fender and at last turns with his hands outstretched to judith now she flies into his arms i am not late am i the town clock struck the quarter as i came in at the front door and the town clock is always fast  judith im sure its slow this evening im so glad youre back  anderson taking her more closely in his arms anxious my dear  judith a little  anderson why youve been crying  judith only a little never mind its all over now a bugle call is heard in the distance she starts in terror and retreats to the long seat listening whats that  anderson following her tenderly to the seat and making her sit down with him only king george my dear hes returning to barracks or having his roll called or getting ready for tea or booting or saddling or something soldiers dont ring the bell or call over the banisters when they want anything they send a boy out with a bugle to disturb the whole town  judith do you think there is really any danger  anderson not the least in the world  judith you say that to comfort me not because you believe it  anderson my dear in this world there is always danger for those who are afraid of it theres a danger that the house will catch fire in the night but we shant sleep any the less soundly for that  judith yes i know what you always say and youre quite right oh quite right i know it buti suppose im not brave thats all my heart shrinks every time i think of the soldiers  anderson never mind that dear bravery is none the worse for costing a little pain  judith yes i suppose so embracing him again oh how brave you are my dear with tears in her eyes well ill be brave too you shant be ashamed of your wife  anderson thats right now you make me happy well well he rises and goes cheerily to the fire to dry his shoes i called on richard dudgeon on my way back but he wasnt in  judith rising in consternation you called on that man  anderson reassuring her oh nothing happened dearie he was out  judith almost in tears as if the visit were a personal humiliation to her but why did you go there  anderson gravely well it is all the talk that major swindon is going to do what he did in springtownmake an example of some notorious rebel as he calls us he pounced on peter dudgeon as the worst character there and it is the general belief that he will pounce on richard as the worst here  judith but richard said  anderson goodhumoredly cutting her short pooh richard said he said what he thought would frighten you and frighten me my dear he said what perhaps god forgive him he would like to believe its a terrible thing to think of what death must mean for a man like that i felt that i must warn him i left a message for him  judith querulously what message  anderson only that i should be glad to see him for a moment on a matter of importance to himself and that if he would look in here when he was passing he would be welcome  judith aghast you asked that man to come here  anderson i did  judith sinking on the seat and clasping her hands i hope he wont come oh i pray that he may not come  anderson why dont you want him to be warned  judith he must know his danger oh tony is it wrong to hate a blasphemer and a villain i do hate him i cant get him out of my mind i know he will bring harm with him he insulted you he insulted me he insulted his mother  anderson quaintly well dear lets forgive him and then it wont matter  judith oh i know its wrong to hate anybody but  anderson going over to her with humorous tenderness come dear youre not so wicked as you think the worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them but to be indifferent to them thats the essence of inhumanity after all my dear if you watch people carefully youll be surprised to find how like hate is to love she starts strangely touchedeven appalled he is amused at her yes im quite in earnest think of how some of our married friends worry one another tax one another are jealous of one another cant bear to let one another out of sight for a day are more like jailers and slaveowners than lovers think of those very same people with their enemies scrupulous lofty selfrespecting determined to be independent of one another careful of how they speak of one anotherpooh havent you often thought that if they only knew it they were better friends to their enemies than to their own husbands and wives come depend on it my dear you are really fonder of richard than you are of me if you only knew it eh  judith oh dont say that dont say that tony even in jest you dont know what a horrible feeling it gives me  anderson laughing well well never mind pet hes a bad man and you hate him as he deserves and youre going to make the tea arent you  judith remorsefully oh yes i forgot ive been keeping you waiting all this time she goes to the fire and puts on the kettle  anderson going to the press and taking his coat off have you stitched up the shoulder of my old coat  judith yes dear she goes to the table and sets about putting the tea into the teapot from the caddy  anderson as he changes his coat for the older one hanging on the press and replaces it by the one he has just taken off did anyone call when i was out  judith no only someone knocks at the door with a start which betrays her intense nervousness she retreats to the further end of the table with the tea caddy and spoon in her hands exclaiming whos that  anderson going to her and patting her encouragingly on the shoulder all right pet all right he wont eat you whoever he is she tries to smile and nearly makes herself cry he goes to the door and opens it richard is there without overcoat or cloak you might have raised the latch and come in mr dudgeon nobody stands on much ceremony with us hospitably come in richard comes in carelessly and stands at the table looking round the room with a slight pucker of his nose at the mezzotinted divine on the wall judith keeps her eyes on the tea caddy is it still raining he shuts the door  richard raining like the very his eye catches judiths as she looks quickly and haughtily upi beg your pardon but showing that his coat is wet you see  anderson take it off sir and let it hang before the fire a while my wife will excuse your shirtsleeves judith put in another spoonful of tea for mr dudgeon  richard eyeing him cynically the magic of property pastor are even you civil to me now that i have succeeded to my fathers estate  judith throws down the spoon indignantly  anderson quite unruffled and helping richard off with his coat i think sir that since you accept my hospitality you cannot have so bad an opinion of it sit down with the coat in his hand he points to the railed seat richard in his shirtsleeves looks at him half quarrelsomely for a moment then with a nod acknowledges that the minister has got the better of him and sits down on the seat anderson pushes his cloak into a heap on the seat of the chair at the fire and hangs richards coat on the back in its place  richard i come sir on your own invitation you left word you had something important to tell me  anderson i have a warning which it is my duty to give you  richard quickly rising you want to preach to me excuse me i prefer a walk in the rain he makes for his coat  anderson stopping him dont be alarmed sir i am no great preacher you are quite safe richard smiles in spite of himself his glance softens he even makes a gesture of excuse anderson seeing that he has tamed him now addresses him earnestly mr dudgeon you are in danger in this town  richard what danger  anderson your uncles danger major swindons gallows  richard it is you who are in danger i warned you  anderson interrupting him goodhumoredly but authoritatively yes yes mr dudgeon but they do not think so in the town and even if i were in danger i have duties here i must not forsake but you are a free man why should you run any risk  richard do you think i should be any great loss minister  anderson i think that a mans life is worth saving whoever it belongs to richard makes him an ironical bow anderson returns the bow humorously come youll have a cup of tea to prevent you catching cold  richard i observe that mrs anderson is not quite so pressing as you are pastor  judith almost stifled with resentment which she has been expecting her husband to share and express for her at every insult of richards you are welcome for my husbands sake she brings the teapot to the fireplace and sets it on the hob  richard i know i am not welcome for my own madam he rises but i think i will not break bread here minister  anderson cheerily give me a good reason for that  richard because there is something in you that i respect and that makes me desire to have you for my enemy  anderson thats well said on those terms sir i will accept your enmity or any mans judith mr dudgeon will stay to tea sit down it will take a few minutes to draw by the fire richard glances at him with a troubled face then sits down with his head bent to hide a convulsive swelling of his throat i was just saying to my wife mr dudgeon that enmity she grasps his hand and looks imploringly at him doing both with an intensity that checks him at once well well i mustnt tell you i see but it was nothing that need leave us worse friendenemies i mean judith is a great enemy of yours  richard if all my enemies were like mrs anderson i should be the best christian in america  anderson gratified patting her hand you hear that judith mr dudgeon knows how to turn a compliment  the latch is lifted from without  judith starting who is that  christy comes in  christy stopping and staring at richard oh are you here  richard yes begone you fool mrs anderson doesnt want the whole family to tea at once  christy coming further in mothers very ill  richard well does she want to see me  christy no  richard i thought not  christy she wants to see the ministerat once  judith to anderson oh not before youve had some tea  anderson i shall enjoy it more when i come back dear he is about to take up his cloak  christy the rains over  anderson dropping the cloak and picking up his hat from the fender where is your mother christy  christy at uncle tituss  anderson have you fetched the doctor  christy no she didnt tell me to  anderson go on there at once ill overtake you on his doorstep christy turns to go wait a moment your brother must be anxious to know the particulars  richard psha not i he doesnt know and i dont care violently be off you oaf christy runs out richard adds a little shamefacedly we shall know soon enough  anderson well perhaps you will let me bring you the news myself judith will you give mr dudgeon his tea and keep him here until i return  judith white and trembling must i  anderson taking her hands and interrupting her to cover her agitation my dear i can depend on you  judith with a piteous effort to be worthy of his trust yes  anderson pressing her hand against his cheek you will not mind two old people like us mr dudgeon going i shall not say good evening you will be here when i come back he goes out  they watch him pass the window and then look at each other dumbly quite disconcerted richard noting the quiver of her lips is the first to pull himself together  richard mrs anderson i am perfectly aware of the nature of your sentiments towards me i shall not intrude on you good evening again he starts for the fireplace to get his coat  judith getting between him and the coat no no dont go please dont go  richard roughly why you dont want me here  judith yes i wringing her hands in despair oh if i tell you the truth you will use it to torment me  richard indignantly torment what right have you to say that do you expect me to stay after that  judith i want you to stay but suddenly raging at him like an angry child it is not because i like you  richard indeed  judith yes i had rather you did go than mistake me about that i hate and dread you and my husband knows it if you are not here when he comes back he will believe that i disobeyed him and drove you away  richard ironically whereas of course you have really been so kind and hospitable and charming to me that i only want to go away out of mere contrariness eh  judith unable to bear it sinks on the chair and bursts into tears  richard stop stop stop i tell you dont do that putting his hand to his breast as if to a wound he wrung my heart by being a man need you tear it by being a woman has he not raised you above my insults like himself she stops crying and recovers herself somewhat looking at him with a scared curiosity there thats right sympathetically youre better now arent you he puts his hand encouragingly on her shoulder she instantly rises haughtily and stares at him defiantly he at once drops into his usual sardonic tone ah thats better you are yourself again so is richard well shall we go to tea like a quiet respectable couple and wait for your husbands return  judith rather ashamed of herself if you please ii am sorry to have been so foolish she stoops to take up the plate of toast from the fender  richard i am sorry for your sake that i amwhat i am allow me he takes the plate from her and goes with it to the table  judith following with the teapot will you sit down he sits down at the end of the table nearest the press there is a plate and knife laid there the other plate is laid near it but judith stays at the opposite end of the table next the fire and takes her place there drawing the tray towards her do you take sugar  richard no but plenty of milk let me give you some toast he puts some on the second plate and hands it to her with the knife the action shows quietly how well he knows that she has avoided her usual place so as to be as far from him as possible  judith consciously thanks she gives him his tea wont you help yourself  richard thanks he puts a piece of toast on his own plate and she pours out tea for herself  judith observing that he tastes nothing dont you like it you are not eating anything  richard neither are you  judith nervously i never care much for my tea please dont mind me  richard looking dreamily round i am thinking it is all so strange to me i can see the beauty and peace of this home i think i have never been more at rest in my life than at this moment and yet i know quite well i could never live here its not in my nature i suppose to be domesticated but its very beautiful its almost holy he muses a moment and then laughs softly  judith quickly why do you laugh  richard i was thinking that if any stranger came in here now he would take us for man and wife  judith taking offence you mean i suppose that you are more my age than he is  richard staring at this unexpected turn i never thought of such a thing sardonic again i see there is another side to domestic joy  judith angrily i would rather have a husband whom everybody respects thanthan  richard than the devils disciple you are right but i daresay your love helps him to be a good man just as your hate helps me to be a bad one  judith my husband has been very good to you he has forgiven you for insulting him and is trying to save you can you not forgive him for being so much better than you are how dare you belittle him by putting yourself in his place  richard did i  judith yes you did you said that if anybody came in they would take us for man and she stops terrorstricken as a squad of soldiers tramps past the window the english soldiers oh what do they  richard listening sh  a voice outside halt four outside two in with me  judith half rises listening and looking with dilated eyes at richard who takes up his cup prosaically and is drinking his tea when the latch goes up with a sharp click and an english sergeant walks into the room with two privates who post themselves at the door he comes promptly to the table between them  the sergeant sorry to disturb you mum duty anthony anderson i arrest you in king georges name as a rebel  judith pointing at richard but that is not he looks up quickly at her with a face of iron she stops her mouth hastily with the hand she has raised to indicate him and stands staring affrightedly  the sergeant come parson put your coat on and come along  richard yes ill come he rises and takes a step towards his own coat then recollects himself and with his back to the sergeant moves his gaze slowly round the room without turning his head until he sees andersons black coat hanging up on the press he goes composedly to it takes it down and puts it on the idea of himself as a parson tickles him he looks down at the black sleeve on his arm and then smiles slyly at judith whose white face shows him that what she is painfully struggling to grasp is not the humor of the situation but its horror he turns to the sergeant who is approaching him with a pair of handcuffs hidden behind him and says lightly did you ever arrest a man of my cloth before sergeant  the sergeant instinctively respectful half to the black coat half to richards good breeding well no sir at least only an army chaplain showing the handcuffs im sorry air but duty  richard just so sergeant well im not ashamed of them thank you kindly for the apology he holds out his hands  sergeant not availing himself of the offer one gentleman to another sir wouldnt you like to say a word to your missis sir before you go  richard smiling oh we shall meet again beforeeh meaning before you hang me  sergeant loudly with ostentatious cheerfulness oh of course of course no call for the lady to distress herself still in a lower voice intended for richard alone your last chance sir  they look at one another significantly for a moment than richard exhales a deep breath and turns towards judith  richard very distinctly my love she looks at him pitiably pale and tries to answer but cannottries also to come to him but cannot trust herself to stand without the support of the table this gallant gentleman is good enough to allow us a moment of leavetaking the sergeant retires delicately and joins his men near the door he is trying to spare you the truth but you had better know it are you listening to me she signifies assent do you understand that i am going to my death she signifies that she understands remember you must find our friend who was with us just now do you understand she signifies yes see that you get him safely out of harms way dont for your life let him know of my danger but if he finds it out tell him that he cannot save me they would hang him and they would not spare me and tell him that i am steadfast in my religion as he is in his and that he may depend on me to the death he turns to go and meets the eye of the sergeant who looks a little suspicious he considers a moment and then turning roguishly to judith with something of a smile breaking through his earnestness says and now my dear i am afraid the sergeant will not believe that you love me like a wife unless you give one kiss before i go  he approaches her and holds out his arms she quits the table and almost falls into them  judith the words choking her i ought toits murder  richard no only a kiss softly to her for his sake  judith i cant you must  richard folding her in his arms with an impulse of compassion for her distress my poor girl  judith with a sudden effort throws her arms round him kisses him and swoons away dropping from his arms to the ground as if the kiss had killed her  richard going quickly to the sergeant now sergeant quick before she comes to the handcuffs he puts out his hands  sergeant pocketing them never mind sir ill trust you youre a game one you ought to a bin a soldier sir between them two please the soldiers place themselves one before richard and one behind him the sergeant opens the door  richard taking a last look round him goodbye wife goodbye home muffle the drums and quick march  the sergeant signs to the leading soldier to march they file out quickly                                  when anderson returns from mrs dudgeons he is astonished to find the room apparently empty and almost in darkness except for the glow from the fire for one of the candles has burnt out and the other is at its last flicker  anderson why what on earth calling judith judith he listens there is no answer hm he goes to the cupboard takes a candle from the drawer lights it at the flicker of the expiring one on the table and looks wonderingly at the untasted meal by its light then he sticks it in the candlestick takes off his hat and scratches his head much puzzled this action causes him to look at the floor for the first time and there he sees judith lying motionless with her eyes closed he runs to her and stoops beside her lifting her head judith  judith waking for her swoon has passed into the sleep of exhaustion after suffering yes did you call whats the matter  anderson ive just come in and found you lying here with the candles burnt out and the tea poured out and cold what has happened  judith still astray i dont know have i been asleep i suppose she stops blankly i dont know  anderson groaning heaven forgive me i left you alone with that scoundrel judith remembers with an agonized cry she clutches his shoulders and drags herself to her feet as he rises with her he clasps her tenderly in his arms my poor pet  judith frantically clinging to him what shall i do oh my god what shall i do  anderson never mind never mind my dearest dear it was my fault come youre safe now and youre not hurt are you he takes his arms from her to see whether she can stand there thats right thats right if only you are not hurt nothing else matters  judith no no no im not hurt  anderson thank heaven for that come now leading her to the railed seat and making her sit down beside him sit down and rest you can tell me about it tomorrow or misunderstanding her distress you shall not tell me at all if it worries you there there cheerfully ill make you some fresh tea that will set you up again he goes to the table and empties the teapot into the slop bowl  judith in a strained tone tony  anderson yes dear  judith do you think we are only in a dream now  anderson glancing round at her for a moment with a pang of anxiety though he goes on steadily and cheerfully putting fresh tea into the pot perhaps so pet but you may as well dream a cup of tea when youre about it  judith oh stop stop you dont know distracted she buries her face in her knotted hands  anderson breaking down and coming to her my dear what is it i cant bear it any longer you must tell me it was all my fault i was mad to trust him  judith no dont say that you mustnt say that heoh no no i cant tony dont speak to me take my handsboth my hands he takes them wondering make me think of you not of him theres danger frightful danger but it is your danger and i cant keep thinking of it i cant i cant my mind goes back to his danger he must be savedno you must be saved you you you she springs up as if to do something or go somewhere exclaiming oh heaven help me  anderson keeping his seat and holding her hands with resolute composure calmly calmly my pet youre quite distracted  judith i may well be i dont know what to do i dont know what to do tearing her hands away i must save him anderson rises in alarm as she runs wildly to the door it is opened in her face by essie who hurries in full of anxiety the surprise is so disagreeable to judith that it brings her to her senses her tone is sharp and angry as she demands what do you want  essie i was to come to you  anderson who told you to  essie staring at him as if his presence astonished her are you here  judith of course dont be foolish child  anderson gently dearest youll frighten her going between them come here essie she comes to him who sent you  essie dick he sent me word by a soldier i was to come here at once and do whatever mrs anderson told me  anderson enlightened a soldier ah i see it all now they have arrested richard judith makes a gesture of despair  essie no i asked the soldier dicks safe but the soldier said you had been taken  anderson i bewildered he turns to judith for an explanation  judith coaxingly all right dear i understand to essie thank you essie for coming but i dont need you now you may go home  essie suspicious are you sure dick has not been touched perhaps he told the soldier to say it was the minister anxiously mrs anderson do you think it can have been that  anderson tell her the truth if it is so judith she will learn it from the first neighbor she meets in the street judith turns away and covers her eyes with her hands  essie wailing but what will they do to him oh what will they do to him will they hang him judith shudders convulsively and throws herself into the chair in which richard sat at the tea table  anderson patting essies shoulder and trying to comfort her i hope not i hope not perhaps if youre very quiet and patient we may be able to help him in some way  essie yeshelp himyes yes yes ill be good  anderson i must go to him at once judith  judith springing up oh no you must go awayfar away to some place of safety  anderson pooh  judith passionately do you want to kill me do you think i can bear to live for days and days with every knock at the doorevery footstepgiving me a spasm of terror to lie awake for nights and nights in an agony of dread listening for them to come and arrest you  anderson do you think it would be better to know that i had run away from my post at the first sign of danger  judith bitterly oh you wont go i know it youll stay and i shall go mad  anderson my dear your duty  judith fiercely what do i care about my duty  anderson shocked judith  judith i am doing my duty i am clinging to my duty my duty is to get you away to save you to leave him to his fate essie utters a cry of distress and sinks on the chair at the fire sobbing silently my instinct is the same as hersto save him above all things though it would be so much better for him to die so much greater but i know you will take your own way as he took it i have no power she sits down sullenly on the railed seat im only a woman i can do nothing but sit here and suffer only tell him i tried to save youthat i did my best to save you  anderson my dear i am afraid he will be thinking more of his own danger than of mine  judith stop or i shall hate you  anderson remonstrating come am i to leave you if you talk like this your senses he turns to essie essie  essie eagerly rising and drying her eyes yes  anderson just wait outside a moment like a good girl mrs anderson is not well essie looks doubtful never fear ill come to you presently and ill go to dick  essie you are sure you will go to him whispering you wont let her prevent you  anderson smiling no no its all right all right she goes thats a good girl he closes the door and returns to judith  judith seatedrigid you are going to your death  anderson quaintly then i shall go in my best coat dear he turns to the press beginning to take off his coat where he stares at the empty nail for a moment then looks quickly round to the fire strides across to it and lifts richards coat why my dear it seems that he has gone in my best coat  judith still motionless yes  anderson did the soldiers make a mistake  judith yes they made a mistake  anderson he might have told them poor fellow he was too upset i suppose  judith yes he might have told them so might i  anderson well its all very puzzlingalmost funny its curious how these little things strike us even in the most he breaks off and begins putting on richards coat id better take him his own coat i know what hell say imitating richards sardonic manner anxious about my soul pastor and also about your best coat eh  judith yes that is just what he will say to you vacantly it doesnt matter i shall never see either of you again  anderson rallying her oh pooh pooh pooh he sits down beside her is this how you keep your promise that i shant be ashamed of my brave wife  judith no this is how i break it i cannot keep my promises to him why should i keep my promises to you  anderson dont speak so strangely my love it sounds insincere to me she looks unutterable reproach at him yes dear nonsense is always insincere and my dearest is talking nonsense just nonsense her face darkens into dumb obstinacy she stares straight before her and does not look at him again absorbed in richards fate he scans her face sees that his rallying has produced no effect and gives it up making no further effort to conceal his anxiety i wish i knew what has frightened you so was there a struggle did he fight  judith no he smiled  anderson did he realise his danger do you think  judith he realised yours  anderson mine  judith monotonously he said see that you get him safely out of harms way i promised i cant keep my promise he said dont for your life let him know of my danger ive told you of it he said that if you found it out you could not save himthat they will hang him and not spare you  anderson rising in generous indignation and you think that i will let a man with that much good in him die like a dog when a few words might make him die like a christian im ashamed of you judith  judith he will be steadfast in his religion as you are in yours and you may depend on him to the death he said so  anderson god forgive him what else did he say  judith he said goodbye  anderson fidgeting nervously to and fro in great concern poor fellow poor fellow you said goodbye to him in all kindness and charity judith i hope  judith i kissed him  anderson what judith  judith are you angry  anderson no no you were right you were right poor fellow poor fellow greatly distressed to be hanged like that at his age and then did they take him away  judith wearily then you were here thats the next thing i remember i suppose i fainted now bid me goodbye tony perhaps i shall faint again i wish i could die  anderson no no my dear you must pull yourself together and be sensible i am in no dangernot the least in the world  judith solemnly you are going to your death tonyyour sure death if god will let innocent men be murdered they will not let you see him they will arrest you the moment you give your name it was for you the soldiers came  anderson thunderstruck for me his fists clinch his neck thickens his face reddens the fleshy purses under his eyes become injected with hot blood the man of peace vanishes transfigured into a choleric and formidable man of war still she does not come out of her absorption to look at him her eyes are steadfast with a mechanical reflection of richards steadfastness  judith he took your place he is dying to save you that is why he went in your coat that is why i kissed him  anderson exploding blood an owns his voice is rough and dominant his gesture full of brute energy here essie essie  essie running in yes  anderson impetuously off with you as hard as you can run to the inn tell them to saddle the fastest and strongest horse they have judith rises breathless and stares at him incredulouslythe chestnut mare if shes freshwithout a moments delay go into the stable yard and tell the black man there that ill give him a silver dollar if the horse is waiting for me when i come and that i am close on your heels away with you his energy sends essie flying from the room he pounces on his riding boots rushes with them to the chair at the fire and begins pulling them on  judith unable to believe such a thing of him you are not going to him  anderson busy with the boots going to him what good would that do growling to himself as he gets the first boot on with a wrench ill go to them so i will to judith peremptorily get me the pistols i want them and money money i want moneyall the money in the house he stoops over the other boot grumbling a great satisfaction it would be to him to have my company on the gallows he pulls on the boot  judith you are deserting him then  anderson hold your tongue woman and get me the pistols she goes to the press and takes from it a leather belt with two pistols a powder horn and a bag of bullets attached to it she throws it on the table then she unlocks a drawer in the press and takes out a purse anderson grabs the belt and buckles it on saying if they took him for me in my coat perhaps theyll take me for him in his hitching the belt into its place do i look like him  judith turning with the purse in her hand horribly unlike him  anderson snatching the purse from her and emptying it on the table hm we shall see  judith sitting down helplessly is it of any use to pray do you think tony  anderson counting the money pray can we pray swindons rope off richards neck  judith god may soften major swindons heart  anderson contemptuouslypocketing a handful of money let him then i am not god and i must go to work another way judith gasps at the blasphemy he throws the purse on the table keep that ive taken 25 dollars  judith have you forgotten even that you are a minister  anderson minister befaugh my hat wheres my hat he snatches up hat and cloak and puts both on in hot haste now listen you if you can get a word with him by pretending youre his wife tell him to hold his tongue until morning that will give me all the start i need  judith solemnly you may depend on him to the death  anderson youre a fool a fool judith for a moment checking the torrent of his haste and speaking with something of his old quiet and impressive conviction you dont know the man youre married to essie returns he swoops at her at once well is the horse ready  essie breathless it will be ready when you come  anderson good he makes for the door  judith rising and stretching out her arms after him involuntarily wont you say goodbye  anderson and waste another half minute psha he rushes out like an avalanche  essie hurrying to judith he has gone to save richard hasnt he  judith to save richard no richard has saved him he has gone to save himself richard must die  essie screams with terror and falls on her knees hiding her face judith without heeding her looks rigidly straight in front of her at the vision of richard dying    act iii  early next morning the sergeant at the british headquarters in the town hall unlocks the door of a little empty panelled waiting room and invites judith to enter she has had a bad night probably a rather delirious one for even in the reality of the raw morning her fixed gaze comes back at moments when her attention is not strongly held  the sergeant considers that her feelings do her credit and is sympathetic in an encouraging military way being a fine figure of a man vain of his uniform and of his rank he feels specially qualified in a respectful way to console her  sergeant you can have a quiet word with him here mum  judith shall i have long to wait  sergeant no mum not a minute we kep him in the bridewell for the night and hes just been brought over here for the court martial dont fret mum he slep like a child and has made a rare good breakfast  judith incredulously he is in good spirits  sergeant tip top mum the chaplain looked in to see him last night and he won seventeen shillings off him at spoil five he spent it among us like the gentleman he is dutys duty mum of course but youre among friends here the tramp of a couple of soldiers is heard approaching there i think hes coming richard comes in without a sign of care or captivity in his bearing the sergeant nods to the two soldiers and shows them the key of the room in his hand they withdraw your good lady sir  richard going to her what my wife my adored one he takes her hand and kisses it with a perverse raffish  gallantry how long do you allow a brokenhearted husband for leavetaking sergeant  sergeant as long as we can sir we shall not disturb you till the court sits  richard but it has struck the hour  sergeant so it has sir but theres a delay general burgoynes just arrivedgentlemanly johnny we call him sirand he wont have done finding fault with everything this side of half past i know him sir i served with him in portugal you may count on twenty minutes sir and by your leave i wont waste any more of them he goes out locking the door richard immediately drops his raffish manner and turns to judith with considerate sincerity  richard mrs anderson this visit is very kind of you and how are you after last night i had to leave you before you recovered but i sent word to essie to go and look after you did she understand the message  judith breathless and urgent oh dont think of me i havent come here to talk about myself are they going toto meaning to hang you  richard whimsically at noon punctually at least that was when they disposed of uncle peter she shudders is your husband safe is he on the wing  judith he is no longer my husband  richard opening his eyes wide eh  judith i disobeyed you i told him everything i expected him to come here and save you i wanted him to come here and save you he ran away instead  richard well thats what i meant him to do what good would his staying have done theyd only have hanged us both  judith with reproachful earnestness richard dudgeon on your honour what would you have done in his place  richard exactly what he has done of course  judith oh why will you not be simple with mehonest and straightforward if you are so selfish as that why did you let them take you last night  richard gaily upon my life mrs anderson i dont know ive been asking myself that question ever since and i can find no manner of reason for acting as i did  judith you know you did it for his sake believing he was a more worthy man than yourself  richard laughing oho no thats a very pretty reason i must say but im not so modest as that no it wasnt for his sake  judith after a pause during which she looks shamefacedly at him blushing painfully was it for my sake  richard gallantly well you had a hand in it it must have been a little for your sake you let them take me at all events  judith oh do you think i have not been telling myself that all night your death will be at my door impulsively she gives him her hand and adds with intense earnestness if i could save you as you saved him i would do it no matter how cruel the death was  richard holding her hand and smiling but keeping her almost at arms length i am very sure i shouldnt let you  judith dont you see that i can save you  richard how by changing clothes with me eh  judith disengaging her hand to touch his lips with it dont meaning dont jest no by telling the court who you really are  richard frowning no use they wouldnt spare me and it would spoil half of his chance of escaping they are determined to cow us by making an example of somebody on that gallows today well let us cow them by showing that we can stand by one another to the death that is the only force that can send burgoyne back across the atlantic and make america a nation  judith impatiently oh what does all that matter  richard laughing true what does it matter what does anything matter you see men have these strange notions mrs anderson and women see the folly of them  judith women have to lose those they love through them  richard they can easily get fresh lovers  judith revolted oh vehemently do you realise that you are going to kill yourself  richard the only man i have any right to kill mrs anderson dont be concerned no woman will lose her lover through my death smiling bless you nobody cares for me have you heard that my mother is dead  judith dead  richard of heart diseasein the night her last word to me was her curse i dont think i could have borne her blessing my other relatives will not grieve much on my account essie will cry for a day or two but i have provided for her i made my own will last night  judith stonily after a moments silence and i  richard surprised you  judith yes i am i not to care at all  richard gaily and bluntly not a scrap oh you expressed your feelings towards me very frankly yesterday what happened may have softened you for the moment but believe me mrs anderson you dont like a bone in my skin or a hair on my head i shall be as good a riddance at 12 today as i should have been at 12 yesterday  judith her voice trembling what can i do to show you that you are mistaken  richard dont trouble ill give you credit for liking me a little better than you did all i say is that my death will not break your heart  judith almost in a whisper how do you know she puts her hands on his shoulders and looks intently at him  richard amazeddivining the truth mrs anderson the bell of the town clock strikes the quarter he collects himself and removes her hands saying rather coldly excuse me they will be here for me presently it is too late  judith it is not too late call me as witness they will never kill you when they know how heroically you have acted  richard with some scorn indeed but if i dont go through with it where will the heroism be i shall simply have tricked them and theyll hang me for that like a dog serve me right too  judith wildly oh i believe you want to die  richard obstinately no i dont  judith then why not try to save yourself i implore youlisten you said just now that you saved him for my sakeyes clutching him as he recoils with a gesture of denial a little for my sake well save yourself for my sake and i will go with you to the end of the world  richard taking her by the wrists and holding her a little way from him looking steadily at her judith  judith breathlessdelighted at the name yes  richard if i saidto please youthat i did what i did ever so little for your sake i lied as men always lie to women you know how much i have lived with worthless menaye and worthless women too well they could all rise to some sort of goodness and kindness when they were in love the word love comes from him with true puritan scorn that has taught me to set very little store by the goodness that only comes out red hot what i did last night i did in cold blood caring not half so much for your husband or ruthlessly for you she droops stricken as i do for myself i had no motive and no interest all i can tell you is that when it came to the point whether i would take my neck out of the noose and put another mans into it i could not do it i dont know why not i see myself as a fool for my pains but i could not and i cannot i have been brought up standing by the law of my own nature and i may not go against it gallows or no gallows she has slowly raised her head and is now looking full at him i should have done the same for any other man in the town or any other mans wife releasing her do you understand that  judith yes you mean that you do not love me  richard revoltedwith fierce contempt is that all it means to you  judith what morewhat worsecan it mean to me  the sergeant knocks the blow on the door jars on her heart oh one moment more she throws herself on her knees i pray to you  richard hush calling come in the sergeant unlocks the door and opens it the guard is with him  sergeant coming in times up sir  richard quite ready sergeant now my dear he attempts to raise her  judith clinging to him only one thing morei entreat i implore you let me be present in the court i have seen major swindon he said i should be allowed if you asked it you will ask it it is my last request i shall never ask you anything again she clasps his knee i beg and pray it of you  richard if i do will you be silent  judith yes  richard you will keep faith  judith i will keep she breaks down sobbing  richard taking her arm to lift her justher other arm sergeant  they go out she sobbing convulsively supported by the two men  meanwhile the council chamber is ready for the court martial it is a large lofty room with a chair of state in the middle under a tall canopy with a gilt crown and maroon curtains with the royal monogram g r in front of the chair is a table also draped in maroon with a bell a heavy inkstand and writing materials on it several chairs are set at the table the door is at the right hand of the occupant of the chair of state when it has an occupant at present it is empty major swindon a pale sandyhaired very conscientious looking man of about 45 sits at the end of the table with his back to the door writing he is alone until the sergeant announces the general in a subdued manner which suggests that gentlemanly johnny has been making his presence felt rather heavily  sergeant the general sir  swindon rises hastily the general comes in the sergeant goes out general burgoyne is 55 and very well preserved he is a man of fashion gallant enough to have made a distinguished marriage by an elopement witty enough to write successful comedies aristocraticallyconnected enough to have had opportunities of high military distinction his eyes large brilliant apprehensive and intelligent are his most remarkable feature without them his fine nose and small mouth would suggest rather more fastidiousness and less force than go to the making of a first rate general just now the eyes are angry and tragic and the mouth and nostrils tense  burgoyne major swindon i presume  swindon yes general burgoyne if i mistake not they bow to one another ceremoniously i am glad to have the support of your presence this morning it is not particularly lively business hanging this poor devil of a minister  burgoyne throwing himself onto swindons chair no sir it is not it is making too much of the fellow to execute him what more could you have done if he had been a member of the church of england martyrdom sir is what these people like it is the only way in which a man can become famous without ability however you have committed us to hanging him and the sooner he is hanged the better  swindon we have arranged it for 12 oclock nothing remains to be done except to try him  burgoyne looking at him with suppressed anger nothingexcept to save our own necks perhaps have you heard the news from springtown  swindon nothing special the latest reports are satisfactory  burgoyne rising in amazement satisfactory sir satisfactory he stares at him for a moment and then adds with grim intensity i am glad you take that view of them  swindon puzzled do i understand that in your opinion  burgoyne i do not express my opinion i never stoop to that habit of profane language which unfortunately coarsens our profession if i did sir perhaps i should be able to express my opinion of the news from springtownthe news which you severely have apparently not heard how soon do you get news from your supports herein the course of a month eh  swindon turning sulky i suppose the reports have been taken to you sir instead of to me is there anything serious  burgoyne taking a report from his pocket and holding it up springtowns in the hands of the rebels he throws the report on the table  swindon aghast since yesterday  burgoyne since two oclock this morning perhaps we shall be in their hands before two oclock tomorrow morning have you thought of that  swindon confidently as to that general the british soldier will give a good account of himself  burgoyne bitterly and therefore i suppose sir the british officer need not know his business the british soldier will get him out of all his blunders with the bayonet in future sir i must ask you to be a little less generous with the blood of your men and a little more generous with your own brains  swindon i am sorry i cannot pretend to your intellectual eminence sir i can only do my best and rely on the devotion of my countrymen  burgoyne suddenly becoming suavely sarcastic may i ask are you writing a melodrama major swindon  swindon flushing no sir  burgoyne what a pity what a pity dropping his sarcastic tone and facing him suddenly and seriously do you at all realize sir that we have nothing standing between us and destruction but our own bluff and the sheepishness of these colonists they are men of the same english stock as ourselves six to one of us repeating it emphatically six to one sir and nearly half our troops are hessians brunswickers german dragoons and indians with scalping knives these are the countrymen on whose devotion you rely suppose the colonists find a leader suppose the news from springtown should turn out to mean that they have already found a leader what shall we do then eh  swindon sullenly our duty sir i presume  burgoyne again sarcasticgiving him up as a fool quite so quite so thank you major swindon thank you now youve settled the question sirthrown a flood of light on the situation what a comfort to me to feel that i have at my side so devoted and able an officer to support me in this emergency i think sir it will probably relieve both our feelings if we proceed to hang this dissenter without further delay he strikes the bell especially as i am debarred by my principles from the customary military vent for my feelings the sergeant appears bring your man in  sergeant yes sir  burgoyne and mention to any officer you may meet that the court cannot wait any longer for him  swindon keeping his temper with difficulty the staff is perfectly ready sir they have been waiting your convenience for fully half an hour perfectly ready sir  burgoyne blandly so am i several officers come in and take their seats one of them sits at the end of the table furthest from the door and acts throughout as clerk to the court making notes of the proceedings the uniforms are those of the 9th 20th 21st 24th 47th 53rd and 62nd british infantry one officer is a major general of the royal artillery there are also german officers of the hessian rifles and of german dragoon and brunswicker regiments oh good morning gentlemen sorry to disturb you i am sure very good of you to spare us a few moments  swindon will you preside sir  burgoyne becoming additionally polished lofty sarcastic and urbane now that he is in public no sir i feel my own deficiencies too keenly to presume so far if you will kindly allow me i will sit at the feet of gamaliel he takes the chair at the end of the table next the door and motions swindon to the chair of state waiting for him to be seated before sitting himself  swindon greatly annoyed as you please sir i am only trying to do my duty under excessively trying circumstances he takes his place in the chair of state  burgoyne relaxing his studied demeanor for the moment sits down and begins to read the report with knitted brows and careworn looks reflecting on his desperate situation and swindons uselessness richard is brought in judith walks beside him two soldiers precede and two follow him with the sergeant in command they cross the room to the wall opposite the door but when richard has just passed before the chair of state the sergeant stops him with a touch on the arm and posts himself behind him at his elbow judith stands timidly at the wall the four soldiers place themselves in a squad near her  burgoyne looking up and seeing judith who is that woman  sergeant prisoners wife sir  swindon nervously she begged me to allow her to be present and i thought  burgoyne completing the sentence for him ironically you thought it would be a pleasure for her quite so quite so blandly give the lady a chair and make her thoroughly comfortable  the sergeant fetches a chair and places it near richard  judith thank you sir she sits down after an awestricken curtsy to burgoyne which he acknowledges by a dignified bend of his head  swindon to richard sharply your name sir  richard affable but obstinate come you dont mean to say that youve brought me here without knowing who i am  swindon as a matter of form sir give your name  richard as a matter of form then my name is anthony anderson presbyterian minister in this town  burgoyne interested indeed pray mr anderson what do you gentlemen believe  richard i shall be happy to explain if time is allowed me i cannot undertake to complete your conversion in less than a fortnight  swindon snubbing him we are not here to discuss your views  burgoyne with an elaborate bow to the unfortunate swindon i stand rebuked  swindon embarrassed oh not you i as  burgoyne dont mention it to richard very politely any political views mr anderson  richard i understand that that is just what we are here to find out  swindon severely do you mean to deny that you are a rebel  richard i am an american sir  swindon what do you expect me to think of that speech mr anderson  richard i never expect a soldier to think sir  burgoyne is boundlessly delighted by this retort which almost reconciles him to the loss of america  swindon whitening with anger i advise you not to be insolent prisoner  richard you cant help yourself general when you make up your mind to hang a man you put yourself at a disadvantage with him why should i be civil to you i may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb  swindon you have no right to assume that the court has made up its mind without a fair trial and you will please not address me as general i am major swindon  richard a thousand pardons i thought i had the honor of addressing gentlemanly johnny  sensation among the officers the sergeant has a narrow escape from a guffaw  burgoyne with extreme suavity i believe i am gentlemanly johnny sir at your service my more intimate friends call me general burgoyne richard bows with perfect politeness you will understand sir i hope since you seem to be a gentleman and a man of some spirit in spite of your calling that if we should have the misfortune to hang you we shall do so as a mere matter of political necessity and military duty without any personal illfeeling  richard oh quite so that makes all the difference in the world of course  they all smile in spite of themselves and some of the younger officers burst out laughing  judith her dread and horror deepening at every one of these jests and compliments how can you  richard you promised to be silent  burgoyne to judith with studied courtesy believe me madam your husband is placing us under the greatest obligation by taking this very disagreeable business so thoroughly in the spirit of a gentleman sergeant give mr anderson a chair the sergeant does so richard sits down now major swindon we are waiting for you  swindon you are aware i presume mr anderson of your obligations as a subject of his majesty king george the third  richard i am aware sir that his majesty king george the third is about to hang me because i object to lord norths robbing me  swindon that is a treasonable speech sir  richard briefly yes i meant it to be  burgoyne strongly deprecating this line of defence but still polite dont you think mr anderson that this is ratherif you will excuse the worda vulgar line to take why should you cry out robbery because of a stamp duty and a tea duty and so forth after all it is the essence of your position as a gentleman that you pay with a good grace  richard it is not the money general but to be swindled by a pigheaded lunatic like king george  swindon scandalised chut sirsilence  sergeant in stentorian tones greatly shocked silence  burgoyne unruffled ah that is another point of view my position does not allow of my going into that except in private but shrugging his shoulders of course mr anderson if you are determined to be hanged judith flinches theres nothing more to be said an unusual taste however with a final shrug  swindon to burgoyne shall we call witnesses  richard what need is there of witnesses if the townspeople here had listened to me you would have found the streets barricaded the houses loopholed and the people in arms to hold the town against you to the last man but you arrived unfortunately before we had got out of the talking stage and then it was too late  swindon severely well sir we shall teach you and your townspeople a lesson they will not forget have you anything more to say  richard i think you might have the decency to treat me as a prisoner of war and shoot me like a man instead of hanging me like a dog  burgoyne sympathetically now there mr anderson you talk like a civilian if you will excuse my saying so have you any idea of the average marksmanship of the army of his majesty king george the third if we make you up a firing party what will happen half of them will miss you the rest will make a mess of the business and leave you to the provomarshals pistol whereas we can hang you in a perfectly workmanlike and agreeable way kindly let me persuade you to be hanged mr anderson  judith sick with horror my god  richard to judith your promise to burgoyne thank you general that view of the case did not occur to me before to oblige you i withdraw my objection to the rope hang me by all means  burgoyne smoothly will 12 oclock suit you mr anderson  richard i shall be at your disposal then general  burgoyne rising nothing more to be said gentlemen they all rise  judith rushing to the table oh you are not going to murder a man like that without a proper trialwithout thinking of what you are doingwithout she cannot find words  richard is this how you keep your promise  judith if i am not to speak you must defend yourself save yourself tell them the truth  richard worriedly i have told them truth enough to hang me ten times over if you say another word you will risk other lives but you will not save mine  burgoyne my good lady our only desire is to save unpleasantness what satisfaction would it give you to have a solemn fuss made with my friend swindon in a black cap and so forth i am sure we are greatly indebted to the admirable tact and gentlemanly feeling shown by your husband  judith throwing the words in his face oh you are mad is it nothing to you what wicked thing you do if only you do it like a gentleman is it nothing to you whether you are a murderer or not if only you murder in a red coat desperately you shall not hang him that man is not my husband  the officers look at one another and whisper some of the germans asking their neighbors to explain what the woman has said burgoyne who has been visibly shaken by judiths reproach recovers himself promptly at this new development richard meanwhile raises his voice above the buzz  richard i appeal to you gentlemen to put an end to this she will not believe that she cannot save me break up the court  burgoyne in a voice so quiet and firm that it restores silence at once one moment mr anderson one moment gentlemen he resumes his seat swindon and the officers follow his example let me understand you clearly madam do you mean that this gentleman is not your husband or merelyi wish to put this with all delicacythat you are not his wife  judith i dont know what you mean i say that he is not my husbandthat my husband has escaped this man took his place to save him ask anyone in the townsend out into the street for the first person you find there and bring him in as a witness he will tell you that the prisoner is not anthony anderson  burgoyne quietly as before sergeant  sergeant yes sir  burgoyne go out into the street and bring in the first townsman you see there  sergeant making for the door yes sir  burgoyne as the sergeant passes the first clean sober townsman you see  sergeant yes sir he goes out  burgoyne sit down mr andersonif i may call you so for the present richard sits down sit down madam whilst we wait give the lady a newspaper  richard indignantly shame  burgoyne keenly with a half smile if you are not her husband sir the case is not a serious onefor her richard bites his lip silenced  judith to richard as she returns to her seat i couldnt help it he shakes his head she sits down  burgoyne you will understand of course mr anderson that you must not build on this little incident we are bound to make an example of somebody  richard i quite understand i suppose theres no use in my explaining  burgoyne i think we should prefer independent testimony if you dont mind  the sergeant with a packet of papers in his hand returns conducting christy who is much scared  sergeant giving burgoyne the packet dispatches sir delivered by a corporal of the 53rd dead beat with hard riding sir  burgoyne opens the dispatches and presently becomes absorbed in them they are so serious as to take his attention completely from the court martial  sergeant to christy now then attention and take your hat off he posts himself in charge of christy who stands on burgoynes side of the court  richard in his usual bullying tone to christy dont be frightened you fool youre only wanted as a witness theyre not going to hang you  swindon whats your name  christy christy  richard impatiently christopher

seizing swindon by the throat you infernal scoundrel  the sergeant rushes to the rescue from one side the soldiers from the other they seize richard and drag him back to his place swindon who has been thrown supine on the table rises arranging his stock he is about to speak when he is anticipated by burgoyne who has just appeared at the door with two papers in his hand a white letter and a blue dispatch  burgoyne advancing to the table elaborately cool what is this whats happening mr anderson im astonished at you  richard i am sorry i disturbed you general i merely wanted to strangle your

make some wild appeal and taking her arm resolutely not one word more come  she looks imploringly at him but is overborne by his determination they are marched out by the four soldiers the sergeant very sulky walking between swindon and richard whom he watches as if he were a dangerous animal  burgoyne gentlemen we need not detain you major swindon a word with you the officers go out burgoyne waits with unruffled serenity until the last of them disappears then he becomes very grave and addresses swindon for the first time without his title swindon do you know what this is showing him the

usual come we must send the safeconduct he goes out  swindon following distractedly my god my god we shall be wiped out  as noon approaches there is excitement in the market place the gallows which hangs there permanently for the terror of evildoers with such minor advertizers and examples of crime as the pillory the whipping post and the stocks has a new rope attached with the noose hitched up to one of the uprights out of reach of the boys its ladder too has been brought out and placed in position by the town beadle who stands by to guard it from unauthorized climbing the websterbridge townsfolk are present in force and in high spirits for the news has spread that it is the devils disciple and not the minister that the continentals so they call burgoynes forces are about to hang consequently the execution can be enjoyed without any misgiving as to its righteousness or to the cowardice of allowing it to take place without a struggle there is even some fear of a disappointment as midday approaches and the arrival of the beadle with the ladder remains the only sign of preparation but at last reassuring shouts of here they come here they are are heard and a company of soldiers with fixed bayonets half british infantry half hessians tramp quickly into the middle of the market place driving the crowd to the sides  sergeant halt front dress the soldiers change their column into a square enclosing the gallows their petty officers energetically led by the sergeant hustling the persons who find themselves inside the square out at the corners now then out of it with you out of it some o youll get strung up yourselves presently form that square there will you you damned hoosians no use talkin german to them talk to their toes with the butt ends of your muskets theyll understand that get out of it will you he comes upon judith standing near the gallows now then youve no call here  judith may i not stay what harm am i doing  sergeant i want none of your argufying you ought to be ashamed of yourself running to see a man hanged thats not your husband and hes no better than yourself i told my major he was a gentleman and then he goes and tries to strangle him and calls his blessed majesty a lunatic so out of it with you double quick  judith will you take these two silver dollars and let me stay  the sergeant without an instants hesitation looks quickly and furtively round as he shoots the money dexterously into his pocket then he raises his voice in virtuous indignation  sergeant me take money in the execution of my duty certainly not now ill tell you what ill do to teach you to corrupt the kings officer ill put you under arrest until the executions over you just stand there and dont let me see you as much as move from that spot until youre let with a swift wink at her he points to the corner of the square behind the gallows on his right and turns noisily away shouting now then dress up and keep em back will you  cries of hush and silence are heard among the townsfolk and the sound of a military band playing the dead march from saul is heard the crowd becomes quiet at once and the sergeant and petty officers hurrying to the back of the square with a few whispered orders and some stealthy hustling cause it to open and admit the funeral procession which is protected from the crowd by a double file of soldiers first come burgoyne and swindon who on entering the square glance with distaste at the gallows and avoid passing under it by wheeling a little to the right and stationing themselves on that side then mr brudenell the chaplain in his surplice with his prayer book open in his hand walking beside richard who is moody and disorderly he walks doggedly through the gallows framework and posts himself a little in front of it behind him comes the executioner a stalwart soldier in his shirtsleeves following him two soldiers haul a light military waggon finally comes the band which posts itself at the back of the square and finishes the dead march judith watching richard painfully steals down to the gallows and stands leaning against its right post during the conversation which follows the two soldiers place the cart under the gallows and stand by the shafts which point backwards the executioner takes a set of steps from the cart and places it ready for the prisoner to mount then he climbs the tall ladder which stands against the gallows and cuts the string by which the rope is hitched up so that the noose drops dangling over the cart into which he steps as he descends  richard with suppressed impatience to brudenell look here sir this is no place for a man of your profession hadnt you better go away  swindon i appeal to you prisoner if you have any sense of decency left to listen to the ministrations of the chaplain and pay due heed to the solemnity of the occasion  the chaplain gently reproving richard try to control yourself and submit to the divine will he lifts his book to proceed with the service  richard answer for your own will sir and those of your accomplices here indicating burgoyne and swindon i see little divinity about them or you you talk to me of christianity when you are in the act of hanging your enemies was there ever such blasphemous nonsense to swindon more rudely youve got up the solemnity of the occasion as you call it to impress the people with your own dignityhandels music and a clergyman to make murder look like piety do you suppose i am going to help you youve asked me to choose the rope because you dont know your own trade well enough to shoot me properly well hang away and have done with it  swindon to the chaplain can you do nothing with him mr brudenell  chaplain i will try sir beginning to read man that is born of woman hath  richard fixing his eyes on him thou shalt not kill  the book drops in brudenells hands  chaplain confessing his embarrassment what am i to say mr dudgeon  richard let me alone man cant you  burgoyne with extreme urbanity i think mr brudenell that as the usual professional observations seem to strike mr dudgeon as incongruous under the circumstances you had better omit them untileruntil mr dudgeon can no longer be inconvenienced by them brudenell with a shrug shuts his book and retires behind the gallows you seem in a hurry mr dudgeon  richard with the horror of death upon him do you think this is a pleasant sort of thing to be kept waiting for youve made up your mind to commit murder well do it and have done with it  burgoyne mr dudgeon we are only doing this  richard because youre paid to do it  swindon you insolent he swallows his rage  burgoyne with much charm of manner ah i am really sorry that you should think that mr dudgeon if you knew what my commission cost me and what my pay is you would think better of me i should be glad to part from you on friendly terms  richard hark ye general burgoyne if you think that i like being hanged youre mistaken i dont like it and i dont mean to pretend that i do and if you think im obliged to you for hanging me in a gentlemanly way youre wrong there too i take the whole business in devilish bad part and the only satisfaction i have in it is that youll feel a good deal meaner than ill look when its over he turns away and is striding to the cart when judith advances and interposes with her arms stretched out to him richard feeling that a very little will upset his selfpossession shrinks from her crying what are you doing here this is no place for you she makes a gesture as if to touch him he recoils impatiently no go away go away youll unnerve me take her away will you  judith wont you bid me goodbye  richard allowing her to take his hand oh goodbye goodbye now gogoquickly she clings to his handwill not be put off with so cold a last farewellat last as he tries to disengage himself throws herself on his breast in agony  swindon angrily to the sergeant who alarmed at judiths movement has come from the back of the square to pull her back and stopped irresolutely on finding that he is too late how is this why is she inside the lines  sergeant guiltily i dunno sir shes that artful cant keep her away  burgoyne you were bribed  sergeant protesting no sir  swindon severely fall back he obeys  richard imploringly to those around him and finally to burgoyne as the least stolid of them take her away do you think i want a woman near me now  burgoyne going to judith and taking her hand here madam you had better keep inside the lines but stand here behind us and dont look  richard with a great sobbing sigh of relief as she releases him and turns to burgoyne flies for refuge to the cart and mounts into it the executioner takes off his coat and pinions him  judith resisting burgoyne quietly and drawing her hand away no i must stay i wont look she goes to the right of the gallows she tries to look at richard but turns away with a frightful shudder and falls on her knees in prayer brudenell comes towards her from the back of the square  burgoyne nodding approvingly as she kneels ah quite so do not disturb her mr brudenell that will do very nicely brudenell nods also and withdraws a little watching her sympathetically burgoyne resumes his former position and takes out a handsome gold chronometer now then are those preparations made we must not detain mr dudgeon  by this time richards hands are bound behind him and the noose is round his neck the two soldiers take the shaft of the wagon ready to pull it away the executioner standing in the cart behind richard makes a sign to the sergeant  sergeant to burgoyne ready sir  burgoyne have you anything more to say mr dudgeon it wants two minutes of twelve still  richard in the strong voice of a man who has conquered the bitterness of death your watch is two minutes slow by the town clock which i can see from here general the town clock strikes the first stroke of twelve involuntarily the people flinch at the sound and a subdued groan breaks from them amen my life for the worlds future  anderson shouting as he rushes into the market place amen and stop the execution he bursts through the line of soldiers opposite burgoyne and rushes panting to the gallows i am anthony anderson the man you want  the crowd intensely excited listens with all its ears judith half rising stares at him then lifts her hands like one whose dearest prayer has been granted  swindon indeed then you are just in time to take your place on the gallows arrest him  at a sign from the sergeant two soldiers come forward to seize anderson  anderson thrusting a paper under swindons nose theres my safeconduct sir  swindon taken aback safeconduct are you  anderson emphatically i am the two soldiers take him by the elbows tell these men to take their hands off me  swindon to the men let him go  sergeant fall back  the two men return to their places the townsfolk raise a cheer and begin to exchange exultant looks with a presentiment of triumph as they see their pastor speaking with their enemies in the gate  anderson exhaling a deep breath of relief and dabbing his perspiring brow with his handkerchief thank god i was in time  burgoyne calm as ever and still watch in hand ample time sir plenty of time i should never dream of hanging any gentleman by an american clock he puts up his watch  anderson yes we are some minutes ahead of you already general now tell them to take the rope from the neck of that american citizen  burgoyne to the executioner in the cartvery politely kindly undo mr dudgeon  the executioner takes the rope from richards neck unties his hands and helps him on with his coat  judith stealing timidly to anderson tony  anderson putting his arm round her shoulders and bantering her affectionately well what do you think of you husband now eheheh  judith i am ashamed she hides her face against his breast  burgoyne to swindon you look disappointed major swindon  swindon you look defeated general burgoyne  burgoyne i am sir and i am humane enough to be glad of it richard jumps down from the cart brudenell offering his hand to help him and runs to anderson whose left hand he shakes heartily the right being occupied by judith by the way mr anderson i do not quite understand the safeconduct was for a commander of the militia i understand you are a he looks as pointedly as his good manners permit at the riding boots the pistols and richards coat and adds a clergyman  anderson between judith and richard sir it is in the hour of trial that a man finds his true profession this foolish young man placing his hand on richards shoulder boasted himself the devils disciple but when the hour of trial came to him he found that it was his destiny to suffer and be faithful to the death i thought myself a decent minister of the gospel of peace but when the hour of trial came to me i found that it was my destiny to be a man of action and that my place was amid the thunder of the captains and the shouting so i am starting life at fifty as captain anthony anderson of the springtown militia and the devils disciple here will start presently as the reverend richard dudgeon and wag his pow in my old pulpit and give good advice to this silly sentimental little wife of mine putting his other hand on her shoulder she steals a glance at richard to see how the prospect pleases him your mother told me richard that i should never have chosen judith if id been born for the ministry i am afraid she was right so by your leave you may keep my coat and ill keep yours  richard ministeri should say captain i have behaved like a fool  judith like a hero  richard much the same thing perhaps with some bitterness towards himself but no if i had been any good i should have done for you what you did for me instead of making a vain sacrifice  anderson not vain my boy it takes all sorts to make a worldsaints as well as soldiers turning to burgoyne and now general time presses and america is in a hurry have you realized that though you may occupy towns and win battles you cannot conquer a nation  burgoyne my good sir without a conquest you cannot have an aristocracy come and settle the matter at my quarters  anderson at your service sir to richard see judith home for me will you my boy he hands her over to him now general he goes busily up the market place towards the town hall leaving judith and richard together burgoyne follows him a step or two then checks himself and turns to richard  burgoyne oh by the way mr dudgeon i shall be glad to see you at lunch at halfpast one he pauses a moment and adds with politely veiled slyness bring mrs anderson if she will be so good to swindon who is fuming take it quietly major swindon your friend the british soldier can stand up to anything except the british war office he follows anderson  sergeant to swindon what orders sir  swindon savagely orders what use are orders now theres no army back to quarters and be d he turns on his heel and goes  sergeant pugnacious and patriotic repudiating the idea of defeat tention now then cock up your chins and show em you dont care a damn for em slope arms fours wheel quick march  the drum marks time with a tremendous bang the band strikes up british grenadiers and the sergeant brudenell and the english troops march off defiantly to their quarters the townsfolk press in behind and follow them up the market jeering at them and the town band a very primitive affair brings up the rear playing yankee doodle essie who comes in with them runs to richard  essie oh dick  richard goodhumoredly but wilfully now now come come i dont mind being hanged but i will not be cried over  essie no i promise ill be good she tries to restrain her tears but cannot ii want to see where the soldiers are going to she goes a little way up the market pretending to look after the crowd  judith promise me you will never tell him  richard dont be afraid  they shake hands on it  essie calling to them theyre coming back they want you  jubilation in the market the townsfolk surge back again in wild enthusiasm with their band and hoist richard on their shoulders cheering him  curtain    notes to the devils disciple  burgoyne  general john burgoyne who is presented in this play for the first time as far as i am aware on the english stage is not a conventional stage soldier but as faithful a portrait as it is in the nature of stage portraits to be his objection to profane swearing is not borrowed from mr gilberts h m s pinafore it is taken from the code of instructions drawn up by himself for his officers when he introduced light horse into the english army his opinion that english soldiers should be treated as thinking beings was no doubt as unwelcome to the military authorities of his time when nothing was thought of ordering a soldier a thousand lashes as it will be to those modern victims of the flagellation neurosis who are so anxious to revive that discredited sport his military reports are very clever as criticisms and are humane and enlightened within certain aristocratic limits best illustrated perhaps by his declaration which now sounds so curious that he should blush to ask for promotion on any other ground than that of family influence as a parliamentary candidate burgoyne took our common expression fighting an election so very literally that he led his supporters to the poll at preston in 1768 with a loaded pistol in each hand and won the seat though he was fined 1000 pounds and denounced by junius for the pistols  it is only within quite recent years that any general recognition has become possible for the feeling that led burgoyne a professed enemy of oppression in india and elsewhere to accept his american command when so many other officers threw up their commissions rather than serve in a civil war against the colonies his biographer de fonblanque writing in 1876 evidently regarded his position as indefensible nowadays it is sufficient to say that burgoyne was an imperialist he sympathized with the colonists but when they proposed as a remedy the disruption of the empire he regarded that as a step backward in civilization as he put it to the house of commons while we remember that we are contending against brothers and fellow subjects we must also remember that we are contending in this crisis for the fate of the british empire eightyfour years after his defeat his republican conquerors themselves engaged in a civil war for the integrity of their union in 1886 the whigs who represented the antiburgoyne tradition of american independence in english politics abandoned gladstone and made common cause with their political opponents in defence of the union between england and ireland only the other day england sent 200000 men into the field south of the equator to fight out the question whether south africa should develop as a federation of british colonies or as an independent afrikander united states in all these cases the unionists who were detached from their parties were called renegades as burgoyne was that of course is only one of the unfortunate consequences of the fact that mankind being for the most part incapable of politics accepts vituperation as an easy and congenial substitute whether burgoyne or washington lincoln or davis gladstone or bright mr chamberlain or mr leonard courtney was in the right will never be settled because it will never be possible to prove that the government of the victor has been better for mankind than the government of the vanquished would have been it is true that the victors have no doubt on the point but to the dramatist that certainty of theirs is only part of the human comedy the american unionist is often a separatist as to ireland the english unionist often sympathizes with the polish home ruler and both english and american unionists are apt to be disruptionists as regards that imperial ancient of days the empire of china both are unionists concerning canada but with a difference as to the precise application to it of the monroe doctrine as for me the dramatist i smile and lead the conversation back to burgoyne  burgoynes surrender at saratoga made him that occasionally necessary part of our british system a scapegoat the explanation of his defeat given in the play is founded on a passage quoted by de fonblanque from fitzmaurices life of lord shelburne as follows lord george germain having among other peculiarities a particular dislike to be put out of his way on any occasion had arranged to call at his office on his way to the country to sign the dispatches but as those addressed to howe had not been faircopied and he was not disposed to be balked of his projected visit to kent they were not signed then and were forgotten on his return home these were the dispatches instructing sir william howe who was in new york to effect a junction at albany with burgoyne who had marched from boston for that purpose burgoyne got as far as saratoga where failing the expected reinforcement he was hopelessly outnumbered and his officers picked off boer fashion by the american farmersharpshooters his own collar was pierced by a bullet the publicity of his defeat however was more than compensated at home by the fact that lord georges trip to kent had not been interfered with and that nobody knew about the oversight of the dispatch the policy of the english government and court for the next two years was simply concealment of germains neglect burgoynes demand for an inquiry was defeated in the house of commons by the court party and when he at last obtained a committee the king got rid of it by a prorogation when burgoyne realized what had happened about the instructions to howe the scene in which i have represented him as learning it before saratoga is not historical the truth did not dawn on him until many months afterwards the king actually took advantage of his being a prisoner of war in england on parole and ordered him to return to america into captivity burgoyne immediately resigned all his appointments and this practically closed his military career though he was afterwards made commander of the forces in ireland for the purpose of banishing him from parliament  the episode illustrates the curious perversion of the english sense of honor when the privileges and prestige of the aristocracy are at stake mr frank harris said after the disastrous battle of modder river that the english having lost america a century ago because they preferred george iii were quite prepared to lose south africa today because they preferred aristocratic commanders to successful ones horace walpole when the parliamentary recess came at a critical period of the war of independence said that the lords could not be expected to lose their pheasant shooting for the sake of america in the working class which like all classes has its own official aristocracy there is the same reluctance to discredit an institution or to do a man out of his job at bottom of course this apparently shameless sacrifice of great public interests to petty personal ones is simply the preference of the ordinary man for the things he can feel and understand to the things that are beyond his capacity it is stupidity not dishonesty  burgoyne fell a victim to this stupidity in two ways not only was he thrown over in spite of his high character and distinguished services to screen a court favorite who had actually been cashiered for cowardice and misconduct in the field fifteen years before but his peculiar critical temperament and talent artistic satirical rather histrionic and his fastidious delicacy of sentiment his fine spirit and humanity were just the qualities to make him disliked by stupid people because of their dread of ironic criticism long after his death thackeray who had an intense sense of human character but was typically stupid in valuing and interpreting it instinctively sneered at him and exulted in his defeat that sneer represents the common english attitude towards the burgoyne type every instance in which the critical genius is defeated and the stupid genius for both temperaments have their genius muddles through all right is popular in england but burgoynes failure was not the work of his own temperament but of the stupid temperament what man could do under the circumstances he did and did handsomely and loftily he fell and his ideal empire was dismembered not through his own misconduct but because sir george germain overestimated the importance of his kentish holiday and underestimated the difficulty of conquering those remote and inferior creatures the colonists and king george and the rest of the nation agreed on the whole with germain it is a significant point that in america where burgoyne was an enemy and an invader he was admired and praised the climate there is no doubt more favorable to intellectual vivacity  i have described burgoynes temperament as rather histrionic and the reader will have observed that the burgoyne of the devils disciple is a man who plays his part in life and makes all its points in the manner of a born high comedian if he had been killed at saratoga with all his comedies unwritten and his plan for turning as you like it into a beggars opera unconceived i should still have painted the same picture of him on the strength of his reply to the articles of capitulation proposed to him by his american conqueror general gates here they are  proposition  1 general burgoynes army being reduced by repeated defeats by desertion sickness etc their provisions exhausted their military horses tents and baggage taken or destroyed their retreat cut off and their camp invested they can only be allowed to surrender as prisoners of war  answer  1 lieutgeneral burgoynes army however reduced will never admit that their retreat is cut off while they have arms in their hands  proposition  2 the officers and soldiers may keep the baggage belonging to them the generals of the united states never permit individuals to be pillaged  answer  2 noted  proposition  3 the troops under his excellency general burgoyne will be conducted by the most convenient route to new england marching by easy marches and sufficiently provided for by the way  answer  3 agreed  proposition  4 the officers will be admitted on parole and will be treated with the liberality customary in such cases so long as they by proper behaviour continue to deserve it but those who are apprehended having broke their parole as some british officers have done must expect to be close confined  answer  4 there being no officer in this army under or capable of being under the description of breaking parole this article needs no answer  proposition  5 all public stores artillery arms ammunition carriages horses etc etc must be delivered to commissaries appointed to receive them  answer  5 all public stores may be delivered arms excepted  proposition  6 these terms being agreed to and signed the troops under his excellencys general burgoynes command may be drawn up in their encampments where they will be ordered to ground their arms and may thereupon be marched to the riverside on their way to bennington  answer  6 this article is inadmissible in any extremity sooner than this army will consent to ground their arms in their encampments they will rush on the enemy determined to take no quarter   and later on if general gates does not mean to recede from the 6th article the treaty ends at once the army will to a man proceed to any act of desperation sooner than submit to that article  here you have the man at his burgoynest need i add that he had his own way and that when the actual ceremony of surrender came he would have played poor general gates off the stage had not that commander risen to the occasion by handing him back his sword  in connection with the reference to indians with scalping knives who with the troops hired from germany made up about half burgoynes force i may mention that burgoyne offered two of them a reward to guide a miss mccrea betrothed to one of the english officers into the english lines  the two braves quarrelled about the reward and the more sensitive of them as a protest against the unfairness of the other tomahawked the young lady the usual retaliations were proposed under the popular titles of justice and so forth but as the tribe of the slayer would certainly have followed suit by a massacre of whites on the canadian frontier burgoyne was compelled to forgive the crime to the intense disgust of indignant christendom  brudenell  brudenell is also a real person at least an artillery chaplain of that name distinguished himself at saratoga by reading the burial service over major fraser under fire and by a quite readable adventure chronicled by burgoyne with lady harriet ackland lady harriets husband achieved the remarkable feat of killing himself instead of his adversary in a duel he overbalanced himself in the heat of his swordsmanship and fell with his head against a pebble lady harriet then married the warrior chaplain who like anthony anderson in the play seems to have mistaken his natural profession  the rest of the devils disciple may have actually occurred like most stories invented by dramatists but i cannot produce any documents major swindons name is invented but the man of course is real there are dozens of him extant to this day
