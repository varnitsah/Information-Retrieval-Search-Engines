83447247	sailors knots  by ww jacobs   1909    deserted   sailormen aint wot you might call dandyfied as a rule said the night watchman who had just had a passage of arms with a lighterman and been advised to let somebody else wash him and make a good job of it theyve got too much sense  they leave dressing up and making eyesores of theirselves to men wot ave never smelt salt water men wot drift up and down the river in lighters and get in everybodys way  he glanced fiercely at the retreating figure of the lighterman and turning a deaf ear to a request for a lock of his hair to patch a favorite doormat with resumed with much vigor his task of sweeping up the litter  the most dressy sailorman i ever knew he continued as he stood the broom up in a corner and seated himself on a keg was a young feller named rupert brown  his mother gave im the name of rupert while his father was away at sea and when he came ome it was too late to alter it  all that a man could do he did do and mrs brown ad a black eye till e went to sea agin  she was a very obstinate woman thoughlike most of emand a little over a year arterwards got pore old brown three months hard by naming er next boy roderick alfonso  young rupert was on a barge when i knew im fust but he got tired of always aving dirty hands arter a time and went and enlisted as a soldier  i lost sight of im for a while and then one evening he turned up on furlough and come to see me  o course by this time e was tired of soldiering but wot upset im more than anything was always aving to be dressed the same and not being able to wear a collar and necktie  he said that if it wasnt for the sake of good old england and the chance o getting six months hed desert  i tried to give im good advice and if id only known ow i was to be dragged into it id ha given im a lot more  as it appened he deserted the very next arternoon  he was in the three widders at aldgate in the saloon barwhich is a place where you get a pennorth of ale in a glass and pay twopence for itand arter being told by the barmaid that she had got one monkey at ome he got into conversation with another man wot was in there  he was a big man with a black moustache and a red face and is fingers all smothered in dimond rings  he ad got on a gold watchchain as thick as a rope and a scarfpin the size of a large walnut and he had ad a few words with the barmaid on is own account  he seemed to take a fancy to rupert from the fust and in a few minutes he ad given im a big cigar out of a sealskin case and ordered im a glass of sherry wine  illustration he seemed to take a fancy to rupert from the fust  have you ever thought o going on the stage he ses arter rupert ad told im of his dislike for the army  no ses rupert staring  you sprise me ses the big man youre wasting of your life by not doing so  but i cant act ses rupert  stuff and nonsense ses the big man  dont tell me  youve got an actors face  im a manager myself and i know  i dont mind telling you that i refused twentythree men and fortyeight ladies only yesterday  i wonder you dont drop down dead ses the barmaid lifting up is glass to wipe down the counter  the manager looked at her and arter she ad gone to talk to a gentleman in the next bar wot was knocking double knocks on the counter with a pint pot he whispered to rupert that she ad been one of them  she cant act a bit he ses  now look ere im a business man and my time is valuable  i dont know nothing and i dont want to know nothing but if a nice young feller like yourself for example was tired of the army and wanted to escape ive got one part left in my company that ud suit im down to the ground  wot about being reckernized  ses rupert  the manager winked at im  its the part of a zulu chief he ses in a whisper  rupert started  but i should ave to black my face he ses  a little ses the manager but youd soon get on to better partsand see wot a fine disguise it is  he stood im two more glasses o sherry wine and arter he ad drunk em rupert gave way  the manager patted im on the back and said that if he wasnt earning fifty pounds a week in a years time hed eat his ead and the barmaid wot ad come back agin said it was the best thing he could do with it and she wondered he adnt thought of it afore  they went out separate as the manager said it would be better for them not to be seen together and rupert keeping about a dozen yards behind follered im down the mile end road  by and by the manager stopped outside a shopwindow wot ad been boarded up and stuck all over with savages dancing and killing white people and hunting elephants and arter turning round and giving rupert a nod opened the door with a key and went inside  thats all right he ses as rupert follered im in  this is my wife mrs alfredi he ses introducing im to a fat redaired lady wot was sitting inside sewing  she has performed before all the crowned eads of europe  that dimond brooch shes wearing was a present from the emperor of germany but being a married man he asked er to keep it quiet  rupert shook ands with mrs alfredi and then her usband led im to a room at the back where a little lame man was cleaning up things and told im to take his clothes off  if they was mine he ses squinting at the fireplace i should know wot to do with em  rupert laughed and slapped im on the back and arter cutting his uniform into pieces stuffed it into the fireplace and pulled the dampers out  he burnt up is boots and socks and everything else and they all three laughed as though it was the best joke in the world  then mr alfredi took his coat off and dipping a piece of rag into a basin of stuff wot george ad fetched did rupert a lovely brown all over  thats the fust coat he ses  now take a stool in front of the fire and let it soak in  he gave im another coat arf an hour arterwards while george curled his air and when e was dressed in bracelets round is ankles and wrists and a leopardskin over his shoulder he was as fine a zulu as you could wish for to see  his lips was naturally thick and his nose flat and even his eyes appened to be about the right color  hes a fair perfect treat ses mr alfredi  fetch kumbo in george  the little man went out and came back agin shoving in a fat stumpy zulu woman wot began to grin and chatter like a pollparrot the moment she saw rupert  its all right ses mr alfredi shes took a fancy to you  isis she an actress ses rupert  one o the best ses the manager  shell teach you to dance and shy assegais  pore thing she buried her usband the day afore we come here but youll be surprised to see ow skittish she can be when she has got over it a bit  they sat there while rupert practisedtill he started shying the assegais that isand then they went out and left im with kumbo considering that she ad only just buried her usband rupert found her quite skittish enough and he couldnt elp wondering wot shed be like when shed got over her grief a bit more  the manager and george said he ad got on wonderfully and arter talking it over with mrs alfredi they decided to open that evening and pore rupert found out that the shop was the theatre and all the acting hed got to do was to dance wardances and sing in zulu to people wot had paid a penny a ead  he was a bit nervous at fust for fear anybody should find out that e wasnt a real zulu because the manager said theyd tear im to pieces if they did and eat im arterwards but arter a time is nervousness wore off and he jumped about like a monkey  they gave performances every arf hour from hapast six to ten and rupert felt ready to drop  his feet was sore with dancing and his throat ached with singing zulu but wot upset im more than anything was an elderly old party wot would keep jabbing im in the ribs with her umbrella to see whether he could laugh  illustration an elderly old party wot would keep jabbing im in the ribs with her umbrella  they ad supper arter they ad closed and then mr alfredi and is wife went off and rupert and george made up beds for themselves in the shop while kumbo ad a little place to herself at the back  he did better than ever next night and they all said he was improving fast and mr alfredi told im in a whisper that he thought he was better at it than kumbo  not that i should mind er knowing much he ses seeing that shes took such a fancy to you  ah i was going to speak to you about that ses rupert  forwardness is no name for it if she dont keep erself to erself i shall chuck the whole thing up  the manager coughed behind his and  and go back to the army he ses well i should be sorry to lose you but i wont stand in your way  mrs alfredi wot was standing by stuffed her pocketankercher in er mouth and rupert began to feel a bit uneasy in his mind  if i did he ses youd get into trouble for elping me to desert  desert ses mr alfredi  i dont know anything about your deserting  ho ses rupert  and wot about my uniform  uniform ses mr alfredi  wot uniform  i aint seen no uniform where is it  rupert didnt answer im but arter they ad gone ome he told george that he ad ad enough of acting and he should go  where to ses george  ill find somewhere ses rupert  i shant starve  you might ketch your death o cold though ses george  rupert said he didnt mind and then he shut is eyes and pretended to be asleep  his idea was to wait till george was asleep and then pinch is clothes consequently is feelings when e opened one eye and saw george getting into bed with is clothes on wont bear thinking about  he laid awake for hours and three times that night george who was a very heavy sleeper woke up and found rupert busy tucking him in  by the end of the week rupert was getting desperate  he hated being black for one thing and the more he washed the better color he looked he didnt mind the black for out o doors in case the army was looking for im but aving no clothes he couldnt get out o doors and when he said he wouldnt perform unless he got some mr alfredi dropped ints about having im took up for a deserter  ive ad my suspicions of it for some days he ses with a wink though you did come to me in a nice serge suit and tell me you was an actor  now you be a good boy for another week and ill advance you a couple o pounds to get some clothes with  rupert asked him to let im have it then but e wouldnt and for another week he ad to pretend e was a zulu of an evening and try and persuade kumbo that he was an english gentleman of a daytime  he got the money at the end of the week and ad to sign a paper to give a months notice any time he wanted to leave but he didnt mind that at all being determined the fust time he got outside the place to run away and ship as a nigger cook if e couldnt get the black off  he made a list o things out for george to get for im but there seemed to be such a lot for two pounds that mr alfredi shook his ead over it and arter calling imself a softarted fool and saying hed finish up in the workhouse he made it three pounds and told george to look sharp  hes a very good marketer he ses arter george ad gone he dont mind wot trouble he takes  hell very likely haggle for hours to get sixpence knocked off the trousers or twopence off the shirt  it was twelve oclock in the morning when george went and at hapast four rupert turned nasty and said e was afraid he was trying to get them for nothing  at five oclock he said george was a fool and at hapast he said e was something i wont repeat  it was just eleven oclock and they ad shut up for the night when the front door opened and george stood there smiling at em and shaking his ead  sush a lark he ses catching old of mr alfredis arm to steady imself  i gave im shlip  wot dye mean  ses the manager shaking him off  gave who the slip wheres them clothes  boys got em ses george smiling agin and catching hold of kumbos arm  sush a lark hes been carcarrying em all dayall day  now ive given im thethe shlip stead ostead o giving im fourpence take care o the pensh an pouns  he let go o kumbos arm turned round twice and then sat down eavy and fell fast asleep  the manager rushed to the door and looked out but there was no signs of the boy and he came back shaking his ead and said that george ad been drinking agin  well wot about my clothes  ses rupert hardly able to speak  praps he didnt buy em arter all ses the manager  lets try is pockets  he tried fust and found some strawberries that george ad spoilt by sitting on  then he told rupert to have a try and rupert found some bits of string a few buttons two penny stamps and twopence hapenny in coppers  never mind ses mr alfredi ill go round to the policestation in the morning praps the boy as taken them there  im disappinted in george  i shall tell im so too  he bid rupert goodnight and went off with mrs alfredi and rupert wishful to make the best o things decided that he would undress george and go off in is clothes  he waited till kumbo ad gone off to bed and then he started to take georges coat off  he got the two top buttons undone all right and then george turned over in is sleep  it surprised rupert but wot surprised im more when he rolled george over was to find them two buttons done up agin  arter it had appened three times he see ow it was and he come to the belief that george was no more drunk than wot he was and that it was all a putup thing between im and mr alfredi  he went to bed then to think it over and by the morning he ad made up his mind to keep quiet and bide his time as the saying is  he spoke quite cheerful to mr alfredi and pretended to believe im when he said that he ad been to the policestation about the clothes  two days arterwards he thought of something he remembered me  he ad found a dirty old envelope on the floor and with a bit o lead pencil he wrote me a letter on the back of one o the bills telling me all his troubles and asking me to bring some clothes and rescue im  he stuck on one of the stamps he ad found in georges pocket and opening the door just afore going to bed threw it out on the pavement  the world is full of officious interfering busybodies  i should no more think of posting a letter that didnt belong to me with an unused stamp on it than i should think o flying but some meddlesome son of a a gun posted that letter and i got it  i was never more surprised in my life  he asked me to be outside the shop next night at hapast eleven with any old clothes i could pick up if i didnt he said he should ang imself as the clock struck twelve and that his ghost would sit on the wharf and keep watch with me every night for the rest o my life  he said he expected it ud have a black face same as in life  a wharf is a lonely place of a night especially our wharf which is full of dark corners and being a silly goodnatured fool i went  i got a pal off of one of the boats to keep watch for me and arter getting some old rags off of another sailorman as owed me arf a dollar i ad a drink and started off for the mile end road  i found the place easy enough  the door was just on the jar and as i tapped on it with my fingernails a wildlooking black man arf naked opened it and said hsh  and pulled me inside  there was a bit o candle on the floor shaded by a box and a man fast asleep and snoring up in one corner  rupert dressed like lightning and he ad just put on is cap when the door at the back opened and a orrid fat black woman came out and began to chatter  rupert told her to hush and she ushed and then he waved is hand to er to say goodbye and afore you could say jack robinson she ad grabbed up a bit o dirty blanket a bundle of assegais and a spear and come out arter us  back  ses rupert in a whisper pointing  illustration back  ses rupert in a whisper pointing  kumbo shook her ead and then he took hold of er and tried to shove er back but she wouldnt go  i lent him a and but all wimmen are the same black or white and afore i knew where i was she ad clawed my cap off and scratched me all down one side of the face  walk fast ses rupert  i started to run but it was all no good kumbo kept up with us easy and she was so pleased at being out in the open air that she began to dance and play about like a kitten  instead o minding their own business people turned and follered us and quite a crowd collected  we shall ave the police in a minute ses rupert  come in ere quick  he pointed to a pub up a side street and went in with kumbo holding on to his arm  the barman was for sending us out at fust but such a crowd follered us in that he altered is mind  i ordered three pints and while i was anding rupert his kumbo finished ers and began on mine i tried to explain but she held on to it like grim death and in the confusion rupert slipped out  he adnt been gone five seconds afore she missed im and i never see anybody so upset in all my life  she spilt the beer all down the place where er bodice ought to ha been and then she dropped the pot and went arter im like a hare  i follered in a different way and when i got round the corner i found she ad caught im and was holding im by the arm  o course the crowd was round us agin and to get rid of em i did a thing id seldom done aforei called a cab and we all bundled in and drove off to the wharf with the spear sticking out o the window and most of the assegais sticking into me  this is getting serious ses rupert  yes i ses and wot ave i done to be dragged into it  you must ha been paying er some attention to make er carry on like this  i thought rupert would ha bust and the things he said to the man wot was spending money like water to rescue im was disgraceful  we got to the wharf at last and i was glad to see that my pal ad got tired of nightwatching and ad gone off leaving the gate open  kumbo went in anging on to ruperts arm and i follered with the spear which i ad held in my and while i paid the cabman  they went into the office and rupert and me talked it over while kumbo kept patting is cheek  he was afraid that the manager would track im to the wharf and i was afraid that the guvnor would find out that i ad been neglecting my dooty for the fust time in my life  we talked all night pretty near and then at hapast five arf an hour afore the ands came on i made up my mind to fetch a cab and drive em to my ouse  i wanted rupert to go somewhere else but e said he ad got nowhere else to go and it was the only thing to get em off the wharf  i opened the gates at ten minutes to six and just as the fust man come on and walked down the wharf we slipped in and drove away  we was all tired and yawning  theres something about the motion of a cab or an omnibus that always makes me feel sleepy and arter a time i closed my eyes and went off sound  i remember i was dreaming that i ad found a bag o money when the cab pulled up with a jerk in front of my ouse and woke me up  opposite me sat kumbo fast asleep and rupert ad disappeared  i was dazed for a moment and afore i could do anything kumbo woke up and missed rupert  wot made matters worse than anything was that my missis was kneeling down in the passage doing er doorstep and er face as i got down out o that cab with kumbo anging on to my arm was something too awful for words  it seemed to rise up slowlike from near the door step and to go on rising till i thought it ud never stop  and every inch it rose it got worse and worse to look at  illustration she stood blocking up the doorway with her ands on her ips  she stood blocking up the doorway with her ands on her ips while i explained with kumbo still anging on my arm and a crowd collecting behind and the more i explained the more i could see she didnt believe a word of it  she never as believed it  i sent for mr alfredi to come and take kumbo away and when i spoke to im about rupert he said i was dreaming and asked me whether i wasnt ashamed o myself for carrying off a pore black gal wot ad got no father or mother to look arter her  he said that afore my missis and my character as been under a cloud ever since waiting for rupert to turn up and clear it away
