64258190	deep down a tale of the cornish mines by rm ballantyne    chapter one  begins the story with a peculiar meeting  necessity is the mother of invention  this is undoubtedly true but it is equally true that invention is not the only member of necessitys large family  change of scene and circumstance are also among her children  it was necessity that gave birth to the resolve to travel to the end of the earthof english earth at all eventsin search of fortune which swelled the bosom of yonder tall wellfavoured youth who seated uncomfortably on the top of that clumsy public conveyance drives up marketjew street in the ancient town of penzance  yes necessitystern necessity as she is sometimes calleddrove that youth into cornwall and thus was the originating cause of that wonderful series of events which ultimately led to his attainingbut hold  let us begin at the beginning  it was a beautiful morning in june in that period of the worlds history which is ambiguously styled onceuponatime when the kittereenthe clumsy vehicle above referred torumbled up to the star inn and stopped there  the tall wellfavoured youth leapt at once to the ground and entered the inn with the air of a man who owned at least the half of the county although his muchworn grey shooting costume and single unpretentious portmanteau did not indicate either unusual wealth or exalted station  in an offhand hearty way he announced to landlord waiters chambermaids and hangerson to all indeed who might choose to listen that the weather was glorious that coaches of all kinds especially kittereens were detestable machines of torture and that he meant to perform the remainder of his journey on foot  he inquired the way to the town of st just ordered his luggage to be forwarded by coach or cart and with nothing but a stout oaken cudgel to encumber him set out on his walk of about seven miles with the determination of compensating himself for previous hours of forced inaction and constraint by ignoring roads and crossing the country like an irish foxhunter  acting on the presumptuous belief that he could find his way to any part of the world with the smallest amount of direction he naturally missed the right road at the outset and instead of taking the road to st just pursued that which leads to the lands end  the youth as we have observed was wellfavoured  tall broadshouldered deepchested and athletic with an active step erect gait and clear laughing eye he was one whom a recruitingsergeant in the guards would have looked upon with a covetous sigh  smooth fair cheeks and chin told that boyhood was scarce out of sight behind and an undeniable some thing on the upper lip declared that manhood was not far in advance  like most people in what may be termed an uncertain stage of existence our hero exhibited a variety of apparent contradictions  his great size and muscular strength and deep bass voice were those of a man while the smooth skin the soft curling hair and the rollicking gladsome look were all indicative of the boy  his countenance too might have perplexed a fortuneteller  sometimes it was grave almost to sternness at other times it sparkled with delight exhibiting now an expression that would have befitted a sage on whose decisions hung the fate of kingdoms and anon displaying a dash of mischief worthy of the wildest boy in a village school  some of the youths varied not to say extravagant actions and expressions were perhaps due to the exhilarating brilliancy of the morning or to the appearance of those splendid castles which his mind was actively engaged in building in the air  the country through which he travelled was at first varied with trees and bushes clothed in rich foliage but soon its aspect changed and ere long he pursued a path which led over a wide extent of wild moorland covered with purple heath and gorse in goldenyellow bloom  the ground too became so rough that the youth was fain to confine himself to the highroad but being of an explorative disposition he quickly diverged into the lanes which in that part of cornwall were and still are sufficiently serpentine and intricate to mislead a more experienced traveller  it soon began to dawn upon the youths mind that he was wandering in a wrong direction and when he suddenly discovered a solitary cottage on the right hand which he had previously observed on the left he made up his mind to sacrifice his independence and condescend to ask for guidance  lightly leaping a wall with this intent he crossed two fields and stooped as he looked in at the low doorway of the cottage from the interior of which there issued the loud cries of a child either in great pain or passion  a sturdy little boy seated on a stool and roaring like a young bull while an elderly woman tried to comfort him was the sight which met his gaze  can you show me the road to st just inquired our adventurer  st just sur said the woman stepping out in front of the door why youre on the way to st buryan sure  ef you do keep on the right of the hill over theere youll see the st just road  a yell of unparalleled ferocity issued at this moment from the cottage and it was found that the noisy urchin within overcome by curiosity had risen to ascertain who the stranger outside could be and had been arrested by a pang of agony  aw dear aw dear my poor booy exclaimed the woman endeavouring gently to press the boy down again on the stool amid furious roaring  whats wrong with him asked our traveller entering the apartment  hes tumbled off the wall dear booy an semen to me hes scat un shoulder very bad  let me have a look at him said the youth sitting down on the edge of a bed which stood at one end of the room and drawing the child between his knees  come little man dont shout so loud ill put it all right for you  let me feel your shoulder  to judge from the immediate result the young man seemed to put it all wrong instead of all right for his somewhat rough manipulation of the boys shoulder produced such a torrent of screams that the pitying woman had much ado to restrain herself from rushing to the rescue  ah exclaimed the youth in grey releasing his victim i thought so he has broken his collarbone my good woman not a serious matter by any means but it will worry him for some time to come  have you got anything to make a bandage of  sur said the woman  have you a bit of ragan old shirt or apronanything will do  the woman promptly produced a cotton shirt which the youth tore up into long strips  making a pad of one of these he placed it under the boys armpit despite of sobs and resistance  this pad acted as a fulcrum on which the arm rested as a lever  pressing the elbow close to the boys side he thus forced the shoulder outwards and with his left hand set the bone with its two broken ends together  to secure it in this position he bound the arm pretty firmly to the boys body so that he could not move a muscle of the left arm or shoulder  there said the youth assisting his patient to put on his shirt that will keep all straight  you must not on any account remove the bandage for some weeks  how long sur exclaimed the woman in surprise  for some weeks but that will depend on how the little fellow gets on he may go about and use his right arm as he pleases but no more climbing on walls for some time to come  do you hear little man  the urchin whose pain was somewhat relieved and who had moderated down to an occasional deep sob said iss  youre a doctor sur i think said the woman  yes i am and ill come to see you again so be careful to attend to my directions  goodmorning  good mornin sur an thank ee exclaimed the grateful dame as the youth left the house and leaping the low enclosure in front of it sped over the moor in the direction which had been pointed out to him  his resolution to ignore roads cost our traveller more trouble than he had anticipated for the moor was very rugged the brambles vexatious and the spines of the gorse uncommonly sharp  impediments of every kind were more numerous than he had been accustomed to meet with even on the heathclad hills of scotland with whichalthough the land of the mountain and the flood was not that of his birthhe had from childhood been familiar  after a good deal of vigorous leaping and resolute scrambling he reached one of those peculiar cornish lanes which are so deeply sunk in the ground and edged with such high solid walls that the wayfarer cannot in many places see the nature of the country through which he is passing  the point at which he reached the lane was so overgrown with gorse and brambles that it was necessary to search for a passage through them  this not being readily found he gave way to the impetuosity of his disposition stepped back a few paces cleared the obstacles with a light bound and alighted on the edge of the bank which gave way under his weight and he descended into the lane in a shower of stones and dust landing on his feet more by chance than by dexterity  a shout of indignation greeted the traveller and turning abruptly round he beheld a stout old gentleman stamping with rage covered from head to foot with dust and sputtering out epithets of opprobrium on the hapless wight who had thus unintentionally bespattered him  ugh hah you young jackanapesyou blind dumbledoryugh  what mean you by galloping over the country thus like a wild asseh  a fit of coughing here interrupted the choleric old gentleman in the midst of which our hero with much humility of demeanour many apologies and protestations of innocence of intention to injure picked up the old gentlemans hat assisted him to brush his clothes with a bunch of ferns and in various other ways sought to pacify him  the old man grumbled a good deal at first but was finally so far mollified as to say less testily while he put on his hat i warrant me young man you are come on some wildgoose chase to this outotheway region of the land in search of the picturesqueeha dauber on canvas  no sir replied the youth i profess not to wield the pencil or brush although i admit to having made feeble efforts as an amateur the scalpel is more to my taste and my object in coming here is to visit a relative  i am on my way to st just but having wandered somewhat out of my road have been obliged to strike into bypaths as you see  as i see young manyes and as i feel replied the old gentleman with some remains of asperity  i have already expressed regret for the mischance that has befallen you said the youth in grey somewhat sternly for his impulsive spirit fired a little at the continued illhumour of the old gentleman perhaps you will return good for evil by pointing out the way to st just  may i venture to ask this favour of you  you may venture and you have ventured and it is my belief young man that youll venture many a thing before this world has done with you however as you are a stranger in these parts and have expressed due penitence for your misdeed though i more than half doubt your sincerity i can do no less than point out the road to st just whither i will accompany you at least part of the way and young sir as you have taken pretty free liberty with me this morning may i take the liberty of asking you the name of your relative in st just  i am well acquainted with most of the inhabitants of that town  certainly replied the youth  the gentleman whom i am going to visit is my uncle  his name is donnithorne  what  tom donnithorne exclaimed the old gentleman in a tone of surprise as he darted a keen glance from under his bushy eyebrows at his companion  hah then from that fact i gather that you are oliver trembath the young doctor whom he has been expecting the last day or two  hmso old tom donnithorne is your uncle is he  the youth in grey did not relish the free and easy not to say patronising tone of his companion and felt inclined to give a sharp answer but he restrained his feelings and repliedhe is and you are correct in your supposition regarding myself  do you happen to know my uncle personally  know him personally cried the old gentleman with a sardonic laugh oh yes i know him intimatelyintimately some people say hes a very good fellow  i am glad to hear that for to say truth  he paused abruptly  ha  i suppose you were going to say that you have heard a different account of himeh  well i was going to observe replied oliver with a laugh that my uncle is rather a wild man for his yearsaddicted to smuggling i am told and somewhat given to the bottle but it is well known that tattlers give false reports and i am delighted to hear that the old boy is not such a bad fellow after all  humph ejaculated the other  then you have never seen him i suppose  no never although i am a cornishman i have seen little of my native county having left it when a little boybefore my uncle came to live in this part of the country  hmwell young man i would advise you to beware of that same uncle of yours  how exclaimed the youth in surprise did you not tell me just now that he is a very good fellow  no sir i did not  i told you that some people say he is a very good fellow but for myself i think him an uncommonly bad man a man who has done me great injury in his day  it grieves me to hear you say so interrupted oliver whose ire was again roused by the tone and manner of his companion  a decidedly bad man continued the old gentleman not noticing the interruption a thorough rascal a smuggler and a drunkard and  hold sir cried the youth sternly as he stopped and faced the old gentleman remember that you speak of my relative  had you been a younger man sir  again the youth paused abruptly  go on sir said the old gentleman ironically you would have pommelled me to a jelly with your cudgel i suppose is that itacting somewhat in the spirit of your kinsman that same smuggling and tippling old scoundrel who  enough sir interrupted the young man angrily we part company here  so saying he vaulted over the wall that separated the road from the moor and hurried away  take the first turn to the left and keep straight on else youll lose yourself agaaain roared the old gentleman and my compliments to the rascally old smuggleerr  the old scoundrel muttered the youth as he hurried away  the young puppy growled the old gentleman as he jogged along  given to smuggling and the bottle indeedhumph the excitable jackanapes but ive given him a turn in the wrong direction that will cool his blood somewhat and give me leisure to cool mine too before we meet again  here the old gentlemans red countenance relaxed into a broad grin and he chuckled a good deal in the midst of a running commentary on the conduct and appearance of his late companion from the disjointed sentences of which it might have been gathered that although his introduction to the young doctor had been unfortunate and the succeeding intercourse stormy his opinion of him was not altogether unfavourable    chapter two  shows what astonishing results may follow from taking the wrong road  before oliver trembath had advanced half a mile on his path he had cooled sufficiently to experience some regret at having been so quick to take offence at one who being evidently an eccentric character should not he thought have been broken with so summarily  regrets however had come too late so he endeavoured to shake off the disagreeable feelings that depressed him and the more effectually to accomplish this burst forth into a bravura song with so much emphasis as utterly to drown and no doubt to confound two larks which up to that time had been pouring their melodious souls out of their little bodies in the bright blue sky above  presently he came to a part of the moor where two roads divergedone to the right and the other to the left  recalling the shout of advice which the old gentleman had given him in parting he took that which led to the left and was gratified on gaining an eminence a short distance in advance to see in the far distance a square turret which he concluded was that of the church of st just  keeping this turret in view the youth stepped out so vigorously that he soon reached the small town that clustered round the church and going up to the first man he met said this is the town of st just i suppose is it not  no et isn thees come the wrang road sur replied the rustic this es sennen churchtown  st just es up over th hill theere  oliver trembaths first feeling was one of surprise this was followed by annoyance which quickly degenerated into anger as it flashed into his mind that the old gentleman might possibly have led him wrong on purpose  how far is it to st just he inquired  bout six miles sur  then i suppose i am not far from the lands end said oliver after a pause  no not fur replied the man  et do lie straight before ee  thanking the man oliver started off at a smart pace resolving before proceeding to st just to visit this extreme western point of england a visit to which he had often looked forward with pleasant anticipation  during the last hour of his walk the sun had been obscured by clouds but just as he approached the cliffs the clouds separated and a golden flood rushed over the broad atlantic which now lay spread out before him in all its wide majesty as far as the eye could see  a good omen cried the youth with a shout as he hurried towards the shore intending to fling off his garments and bathe in the mighty ocean which from the place where he first beheld it appeared to be smooth and still as a millpond  but oliver was compelled to restrain his ardour for on nearing the sea he found that he stood on the summit of high cliffs beyond which the lands end stretched in a succession of broken masses of granite so chafed and shattered by the action of the sea and so curiously split as to resemble basaltic columns  to reach the outermost of those weatherworn sentinels of old england required some caution on the part of our traveller even although well used to scaling the rocky heights of scottish mountains and when he did at last plant his foot on the veritable lands end he found that it was a precipice apparently sixty feet high which descended perpendicularly into deep water  his meditated bathe was therefore an impossibility for those glassy undulations which appeared so harmless at a distance gathered slow and gradual height as they approached the land and at last assuming the form of majestic waves flung themselves with a grand roar on the stern cliffs which they have battered so long in vain and round whichalways repulsed but never conqueredthey seethed in milky foam  with glistening eye and heaving breast and mantling colour the young doctor stood long and motionless on this extreme point of landabsorbed in admiration of the glorious scene before him  often had he beheld the sea in the firths and estuaries of the north but never till now had he conceived the grandeur of the great atlantic  it seemed to him as if the waves of those inland seas when tossed by wild storms were but rough miniature copies of the huge billows which arose before him without apparent cause and advancing without rush or agitation fell successively with solemn roar at his feet awakening irresistibly within him deep and new thoughts of the almighty creator of earth and sea  for many minutes he stood entranced his mind wandering in a species of calm delight over the grand scene but incapable of fixing itself definitely on any special featurenow sweeping out to where the scilly isles could be seen resting on the liquid horizon anon following the flight of circling seagulls or busy counting the innumerable ships and boats that rested on the sea but ever and anon recurring as if under the influence of fascination to that rich turmoil of foam which boiled leaped and churned around beneath and above the mighty breakers  awaking at last from his trance oliver tore himself from the spot and hastened away to seek the nearest strip of sand where he might throw off his clothes and plunge into the boiling surf  he proceeded in a southerly direction impatiently expecting at every step to discover some spot suitable for his purpose but he had taken a long and rapid walk before he found a break in those wild cliffs which afforded him the opportunity of descending to the waters edge  here on a narrow strip of sand he undressed and leaped into the waves  well was it for oliver that day that he had been trained in all manly exercises that his wind was good that his muscles were hard his nerves well strung and above all that in earliest youth he had learned to swim  misjudging in his ignorance the tremendous power of the surf into which he sprang and daring to recklessness in the conscious possession of unusual strength and courage he did not pause to look or consider but at once struck out to sea  he was soon beyond the influence of the breaking waves and for some time sported in the full enjoyment of the briny atlantic waters  then turning towards the shore he swam in and was speedily tossing among the breakers  as he neared the sandy beach and felt the full power of the water on his partially exhausted frame he experienced a slight feeling of anxiety for the thunder of each wave as it fell and rushed up before him in seething foam seemed to indicate a degree of force which he had not realised in his first vigorous plunge into the sea  a moment more and a wave caught him in its curling crest and swept him onwards  for the first time in his life oliver trembaths massive strength was of no avail to him  he felt like a helpless infant  in another instant the breaker fell and swept him with irresistible violence up the beach amid a turmoil of hissing foam  no sooner did he touch the ground than he sprang to his feet and staggered forward a few paces but the returning rush of water swept sand and stones from beneath his feet carried his legs from under him and hurled him back into the hollow of the succeeding wave which again rolled him on the sand  although somewhat stunned oliver did not lose consciousness or selfpossession  he now fully realised the extreme danger of his position and the thought flashed through his brain that at the farthest his fate must be decided in two or three minutes  acting on a brave spirit this thought nerved him to desperate effort  the instant he could plant his feet firmly he bounded forwards and then before the backward rush of water had gathered strength fell on his knees and dug his fingers and toes deep into the sand  had the grasp been on something firm he could easily have held on but the treacherous sand crumbled out of his grasp and a second time he was carried back into the sea  the next time he was cast on the beach he felt that his strength was failing he staggered forward as soon as he touched bottom with all the energy of one who avails himself of his last chance but the angry water was too strong for him  feeling that he was being overpowered he cast his arms up in the air and gave utterance to a loud cry  it was not like a cry of despair but sounded more like what one might suppose would be the shout of a brave soldier when compelled to give way fightingbefore the might of overwhelming force  at that moment a hand caught the young mans wrist and held it for a few seconds in a powerful grasp  the wave retreated a staggering effort followed and the next moment oliver stood panting on the beach grasping the rough hand of his deliverer  semen to me you was pretty nigh gone sur said the man who had come thus opportunely to the rescue as he wrung the seawater from his garments  he was a man of middle height but of extremely powerful frame and was habited in the garb of a fisherman  truly i had been gone altogether but for your timely assistance may god reward you for it said oliver earnestly  well i dont think you would be so ready to thank me if you did knaw i had half made up my mind to lev ee go  oliver looked at the man in some surprise for he spoke gruffly almost angrily and was evidently in earnest  you are jesting said he incredulously  jestin no i aint maister  do ee see the boat out over he said pointing to a small craft full of men which was being rowed swiftly round a point not more than half a mile distant the villains are after me  they might as well have tried to kitch a cunger by the tail as nab jim cuttance in one of his dens if he hadnt bin forced by the softness of his art to pull a young fool out o the say  youll have to help me to fight lad as ive saved your life  come follow me to the cave  butmy clothes said oliver glancing round him in search of his garments  theyre all safe up here come along sur an look sharp  at any other time and in other circumstances oliver trembaths fiery spirit would have resented the tone and manner of this mans address but the feeling that he owed his life to him and that in some way he appeared to be the innocent cause of bringing misfortune on him induced him to restrain his feelings and obey without question the mandate of his rescuer  jim cuttance led the way to a cave in the rugged cliffs the low entrance to which was concealed by a huge mass of granite  the moment they entered several voices burst forth in abuse of the fisherman for his folly in exposing himself but the latter only replied with a sarcastic laugh and advised his comrades to get ready for action for he had been seen by the enemy who would be down on them directly  at the same time he pointed to olivers clothes which lay in a recess in the side of the cavern  the youth dressed himself rapidly and while thus engaged observed that there were five men in the cavern besides his guide with whom they retired into the farthest recess of the place and entered into animated and apparently angry though lowtoned conversation  at length their leader for such he evidently was swung away from them exclaiming with a laugh well well hes a good recruit and if he should peach on weus can  he concluded the sentence with a significant grunt  now sur he said advancing with his comrade towards oliver who was completing his toilet theyll be here in ten minutes an it is expected that you will lend we a hand  heres a weapon for you  so saying he handed a large pistol to oliver who received it with some hesitation  i trust that your cause is a good one he said  you cannot expect me to fight for you even though i am indebted to you for my life without knowing against whom i fight and why  at this a tall thickset man suddenly cocked his pistol and uttering a fierce oath swore that if the stranger would not fight hed shoot him through the head  silence joe tonkin cried jim cuttance in a tone that at once subdued the man  oliver whose eyes had flashed like those of a tiger drew himself up and saidlook at me lads i have no desire to boast of what i can or will do but i assure you it would be as easy to turn back the rising tide as to force me to fight against my willexcept indeed with yourselves  as i have said i owe my life to your leader and apparently have been the innocent means of drawing his enemies upon him gratitude tells me to help him if i can and help him will if the cause be not a bad one  well spoken sur said the leader with an approving nod see to the weapons maggot and ill explain it all to the gentleman  so saying he too oliver aside told him hurriedly that the men who ere expected to attack them were fishermen belonging to a neighbouring cove whose mackerel nets had been accidentally cut by his boat some weeks ago and who were bent on revenge not believing that the thing had been done by accident  but surely you dont mean to use firearms against them in such a quarrel said oliver  a sort of humorous smile crossed the swarthy countenance of the man as he replied  they will use pistols against we  be that as it may said oliver i will never consent to risk taking the life of a countryman in such a cause  but you cant fight without a weapon said the man and sure if ee dont shut them theyll shut you  no matter ill take my chance said oliver my good cudgel would have served me well enough but it seems to have been swept away by the sea  here however is a weapon that will suit me admirably he added picking up a heavy piece of driftwood that lay at his feet  well if you scat their heads with that they wont want powder and lead observed the other with a grin as he rose and returned to the entrance of the cave where he warned his comrades to keep as quiet as mice  the boat which had caused so much angry discussion among the men of the cave had by this time neared the beach and one of the crew stood up in the bow to guide her into the narrow cove which formed but a slight protection even in calm weather against the violence of that surf which never ceases to grind at the hard rocks of west cornwall  at length they effected a landing and the crew consisting of nine men armed with pistols and cutlasses hurried up to the cliffs and searched for the entrance to the cavern  while the events which have been related were taking place the shades of evening had been gradually creeping over land and sea and the light was at that time scarcely sufficient to permit of things being distinguished clearly beyond a few yards  the men in the cavern hid themselves in the dark recesses on each side of the entrance ready for the approaching struggle  oliver crouched beside his rescuer with the piece of driftwood by his side  turning suddenly to his companion he said in an almost inaudible whisper  friend it did not occur to me before but the men we are about to fight with will recognise me again if we should ever chance to meet could i not manage to disguise myself in some way  if you get shut replied his companion in the same low tone it wont matter much but see hereshut your eyes  without further remark the man took a handful of wet earth and smeared it over olivers face then clapping his own souwester on his head he said with a soft chuckle there your own mother wouldnt knaw ee  just then footsteps were heard approaching and the shadow of a man was seen to rest for a moment on the gravel without  the mouth of the cave was so well hidden however that he failed to observe it and passed on followed by several of his comrades  suddenly one of them stopped and said  hold on lads it cant be far off im sartin sure i seed em disappear hereabouts  youre right cried jim cuttance with a fierce roar as he rushed from the cavern and fired full at the man who had spoken  the others followed and a volley of shots succeeded while shouts of defiance and anger burst forth on all sides  oliver sprang out at the same moment with the leader and rushed on one of the boats crew with such violence that his foot slipped on a piece of seaweed and precipitated him to the ground at the mans feet the other having sprung forward to meet him was unable to check himself tripped over his shoulders and fell on the top of him  the man named maggot having been in full career close behind oliver tumbled over both followed by another man named john cock  the others observing them down rushed with a shout to the rescue just as oliver making a superhuman effort flung the two men off his back and leaped to his feet  maggot and the boatman also sprang up and the latter turned and made for the boat at full speed seeing that his comrades overcome by the suddenness of the onset were in retreat fighting as they went  all of them succeeded in getting into the boat unharmed and were in the act of pushing off when jim cuttance burning with indignation leaped into the water grasped the bow of the boat and was about to plunge his cutlass into the back of the man nearest him when he was seized by a strong hand from behind and held back  next moment the boat was beyond his reach  turning round fiercely the man saw that it was oliver trembath who had interfered  he uttered a terrible oath and sprang on him like a tiger oliver stood firm parried with the piece of driftwood the savage cut which was made at his head and with his clenched left hand hit his opponent such a blow on the chest as laid him flat on the sand  the man sprang up in an instant but instead of renewing the attack to olivers surprise he came forward and held out his hand which the youth was not unwilling to grasp  thank ee sur he said somewhat sternly youve done me a sarvice youve prevented me committin two murders an taught me a lesson i never knawd aforethat jim cuttance ant invulnerable  i dont mind the blow surnot i  it wor govn in feer fight an i was wrang  im glad to find that you view the matter in that light said oliver with a smile and truly the blow was given in selfdefence by one who will never forget that he owes you his life  a groan here turned the attention of the party to one of their number who had seated himself on a rock during the foregoing dialogue  what not hurt are ee dan said his leader going towards him  to this dan replied with another groan and placed his hand on his hip  his comrades crowded round him and finding that he was wounded and suffering great pain raised him in their arms and bore him into the cavern where they laid him on the ground and lighting a candle proceeded to examine him  you had better let me look at him lads said oliver pushing the men gently aside i am a surgeon  they gave place at once and oliver soon found that the man had received a pistolball in his thigh  fortunately it had been turned aside in its course and lay only a little way beneath the skin so that it was easily extracted by means of a penknife  now friends said oliver after completing the dressing of the wound before i met with you i had missed my way while travelling to st just will one of you direct me to the right road and i shall bid you goodnight as i think you have no further need of my services  the men looked at their leader whom they evidently expected to be their spokesman  well sur you have rendered we some help this hevenin both in the way o pickin out the ball an helpin to break skulls as well as preventin worse so we can do no less than show ee the road but hark ee sur here the man became very impressive ef you do chance to come across any of us in your travels you had better not knaw us xcept in an ornary way dye understand an us will do the same by thee  of course i will act as you wish said oliver with a smile although i do not see why we should be ashamed of this affair seeing that we were the party attacked  there is only one person to whom i would wish to explain the reason of my not appearing sooner because he will probably know of the arrival in penzance this morning of the conveyance that brought me to cornwall  and who may that be demanded jim cuttance  my uncle thomas donnithorne of st just said oliver  whew whistled the fisherman in surprise while all the others burst into a hearty fit of laughter  why do you laugh asked oliver  oh never mind sur its all right said the man with a chuckle iss you may tell thomas donnithorne there wont be no harm in tellin heoh dear no  again the men laughed loud and long and oliver felt his powers of forbearance giving way when cuttance said to him an you may tell all his friends too for theyre the right sort  come now maggot here will show ee the way up to st just  so saying the stout fisherman conducted the young surgeon to the mouth of the cavern and shaking hands with him left him to the guidance of the man named maggot who led him through several lanes until he reached the highroad between sennen churchtown and st just  here he paused told his companion to proceed straight on for about four miles or so when he would reach the town and bade him goodnight  and mind ee dont go off the road sur shouted maggot a few seconds after the young man had left him if ee dont want to fall down a shaft and scat your skull  oliver not having any desire to scat his skull whatever that might be assured the man that he would keep to the road carefully  the moon shone clear in a cloudless sky covering the wide moor and the broad atlantic with a flood of silver light and rendering the road quite distinct so that our traveller experienced no further difficulty in pursuing his way  he hurried forward at a rapid pace yet could not resist the temptation to pause frequently and gaze in admiration on the scene of desolate grandeur around him  on such occasions he found it difficult to believe that the stirring events of the last few hours were real  indeed if it had not been that there were certain uneasy portions of his framethe result of his recent encounter on the beach which afforded constant and convincing evidence that he was awake he would have been tempted to believe that the adventures of that day were nothing more than a vivid dream    chapter three  introduces a few more characters and homely incidents  it was late when our hero entered the little town of st just and inquired for the residence of his uncle thomas donnithorne  he was directed to one of the most respectable of the group of old houses that stood close to the venerable parish church from which st just derives its title of churchtown  he tapped at the door which was opened by an elderly female  does mr thomas donnithorne live here asked oliver  iss sur he do answered the woman walk in sur  she ushered him into a small parlour in which was seated a pretty little darkeyed rosycheeked girl still in or only just out of her teens  oliver was so taken aback by the unexpected sight that he stood gazing for a moment or two in rather stupid silence  your name is oliver trembath i presume said the girl rising and laying down the piece of needlework with which she was occupied  it is replied oliver in some surprise as he blundered out an apology for his rudeness  pray sit down sir said the girl we have been expecting you for some time and my uncle told me to act the part of hostess till his return  your uncle exclaimed oliver whose selfpossession not to say impudence returned immediately if thomas donnithorne be indeed your uncle then fair maid you and i must needs be cousins the which i confess fills me with satisfaction and also with somewhat of surprise for up to this hour i have been ignorant of my good fortune in being related to soso  i made a mistake sir said the girl interrupting a speech which was evidently verging towards impropriety in calling mr donnithorne uncle to you who are not aware it seems that i am only an adopted niece  not aware of it  of course not said oliver throwing himself into a large armchair while his fair companion busied herself in spreading the board for a substantial meal  i could not be aware of much that has occurred in this distant part of the kingdom seeing that my worthy uncle has vouchsafed to write me only two letters in the course of my life once many years ago to condole with mein about ten lines address and signature includedon the death of my dear mother and once again to tell me he had procured an appointment for me as assistantsurgeon in the mining district of st just  he must have been equally uncommunicative to my mother for she never mentioned your existence  however since i have now made the agreeable discovery i trust that you will dispense with ceremony and allow me at once to call you cousin  by the way you have not yet told me your name  the maiden who was charmingly unsophisticated replied that her name was rose ellis and that she had no objection whatever to being called cousin without delay  well cousin rose said oliver if it be not prying into secrets i should like to know how long it is since my uncle adopted you  about nineteen years ago replied rose  oh said oliver remonstratively before you were born impossible  rose laugheda short clear little laugh which she nipped in the bud abruptly and replied  well it was only a short time after i was born  i was wrecked on this coastthe expressive face here became very graveand all on board our ship perished except myself  oliver saw at once that he had touched on a tender subject and hastened to change it by asking a number of questions about his uncle from which he gradually diverged to the recent events in his own history which he began to relate with much animation  his companion was greatly interested and amused  she laughed often and heartily in a melodious undertone and oliver liked her laugh for it was peculiar and had the effect of displaying a double row of pretty little teeth and of almost entirely shutting up her eyes  she seemed to enjoy a laugh so much that he exerted all his powers to tickle her risible faculties and dwelt long and graphically on his meeting with the irascible old gentleman in the lane  he was still busy with this part of the discourse when a heavy step was heard outside  theres my uncle exclaimed rose springing up  a moment after the door opened and in walked the identical irascible old gentleman himself  if a petrified impersonation of astonishment had been a possibility oliver trembath would on that occasion have presented the phenomenon he sat or rather lay extended for at least half a minute with his eyes wide and his mouth partly open bereft alike of the powers of speech and motion  heyday young man exclaimed the old gentleman planting his sturdy frame in the middle of the floor as if he meant then and there to demand and exact an ample apology or to inflict condign and terrible chastisement for past misdeeds you appear to be making yourself quite at homeeh  my dear sir exclaimed oliver leaping up with a look of dismay how can i express mymybut is it can it be possible that you are mr donnithornemmyuncle  olivers expression and the look of amazement on the countenance of rose ellis who could not account for such a strange reception of her newlyfound cousin proved almost too much for the old gentleman whose eyes had already begun to twinkle  ay young man i am tom donnithorne your uncle the vile old smuggling brandyloving rascal who met his respectful nephew on the road to st justat this point rose suddenly pressed her hand over her mouth darted to her own apartment in a distant corner of the house and there seated on her little bed went into what is not inaptly styled fits of laughterand who now continued the old gentleman relaxing into a genial smile and grasping his nephews hand welcomes oliver trembath to his house with all his heart and soul there who will say after that that old donnithorne does not know how to return good for evil  but my dear uncle began oliver allow me to explain  now now look at thatkept me hours too late for supper already and hes going to take up more time with explanations cried the old gentleman flinging himself on the chair from which oliver had risen and wiping his bald pate with a red silk handkerchief  what can you explain boy except that you met an angry old fellow in a lane who called your uncle such hard names that you couldnt help giving him a bit of your mindthere there sit down sit downhallo he shouted starting up impulsively and thrusting his head into the passage rose rose i say where are youhallo  coming uncleim here  the words came back like an echo and in another minute rose appeared with a muchflushed countenance  come along lass lets have supper without delay  where is aunty rout her out and tell that jade of a cook that if she dont dish up in five minutes illill  well oliver talking of explanations how comes it that you are so late  because i took the wrong road after leaving you in the lane replied the youth with a significant glance at his uncle whose eyes were at the moment fixed gravely on the ground  the wrong roadeh said mr donnithorne looking up with a sly glance and then laughing  well well it was only quid pro quo boy you put a good deal of unnecessary earth and stones over my head so i thought it was but fair that i should put a good deal more of the same under your feet besides giving you the advantage of seeing the lands end which of course every youth of intelligence must take a deep interest in beholding  but sure a walk thither and thence to st just could not have detained you so long  truly no replied oliver i had a rencontrea sort of adventure with fishermen which  fishermen exclaimed mr donnithorne in surprise are ye sure they were not smugglerseh  they said they were fishermen and they looked like such replied oliver but my adventure with them whatever they were was the cause of my detention and i can only express my grief that the circumstance has incommoded your household but you see it took some time to beat off the boats crew and then i had to examine a wound and extract  what say you boy exclaimed mr donnithorne frowning beat off a boats crewexamine a wound  why rose molly come hither  here we have a young gallant who hath begun life in the far west in good style but hold here comes my excellent friend captain dan who is no friend to the smugglers he is to sup with us tonight so we will repress our curiosity till after supper  let me introduce you oliver to my wife your aunt molly or if you choose to be respectful aunt mary  as he spoke a fat fair motherlylooking lady of about fiveandforty entered the room greeting her husband with a rebuke and her nephew with a smile  never mind him oliver said the good lady he is a vile old creature  i have heard all about your meeting with him this forenoon and only wish i had been there to see it  listen to that now captain dan cried mr donnithorne as the individual addressed entered the room my wife calls meme a staid sober man of fiftyfivecalls me a vile old creature  is it not too bad really one gets no credit nowadays for devoting oneself entirely to ones better half but i forget allow me to introduce you to my nephew oliver trembath just come from one of the northern universities to fight the smugglers of st justof which more anon  oliver captain hoskin of botallack better known as captain dan  now sit down and lets have a bit of supper  with hospitable urgency mr donnithorne and his good dame pressed their guests to do justice to the fare set before them and during the course of the meal the former kept up a running fire of question comment and reply on every conceivable subject so that his auditors required to do little more than eat and listen  after supper however and when tumblers and glasses were being put down he gave the others an opportunity of leading the conversation  now oliver he said fill your glass and let us hear your adventures  what will you havebrandy gin or rum  my friend captain dan here is one of those remarkable men who dont drink anything stronger than gingerbeer  of course you wont join him  thank you said oliver  if you will allow me i will join your good lady in a glass of wine  permit me aunt mary to fill  no i thank you oliver said mrs donnithorne goodhumouredly but firmly i side with captain dan but ill be glad to see you fill your own  ha exclaimed mr donnithorne mollys sure to side with the opponent of her lawful lord no matter who or what he be  fill your own glass boy with what you likecold water an it please youand let us drink the good old cornish toast fish tin and copper our three staples oliverthe bone muscle and fat of the county  fish tin and copper echoed captain dan  in good sooth continued mr donnithorne i have often thought of turning teetotaller myself but feared to do so lest my wife should take to drinking just out of opposition  however let that passand now oliver open thy mouth lad and relate those surprising adventures of which you have given me a hint  indeed uncle i do not say they are very surprising although doubtless somewhat new to one who has been bred if not born in comparatively quiet regions of the earth  here oliver related circumstantially to his wondering auditors the events which befell him after the time when he left his uncle in the lanebeing interrupted only with an occasional exclamationuntil he reached the part when he knocked down the man who had rescued him from the waves when mr donnithorne interrupted him with an uncontrollable burst  ha shouted the old gentleman what knocked down the man who saved your life nephew  fie fie  but you have not told us his name yet what was it  his comrades called him jim as i have said and i think that he once referred to himself as jim cuttance or something like that  what say you boy exclaimed mr donnithorne pushing back his chair and gazing at his nephew in amazement  hast fought side by side with jim cuttance and then knocked him down  indeed i have said oliver not quite sure whether his uncle regarded him as a hero or a fool  the roar of laughter which his answer drew from captain dan and his uncle did not tend to enlighten him much  oh  oliver oliver said the old gentleman on recovering some degree of composure you should have lived in the days of good king arthur and been one of the knights of the round table  knocked down jim cuttance  what thinkee captain dan  i think said the captain still chuckling quietly that the less our friend says about the matter the better for himself  why so inquired oliver quickly  because replied his uncle with some return of gravity you have assisted one of the most notorious smugglers that ever lived to fight his majestys coastguardthats all  what say you mollyshall we convict oliver on his own confession  the good lady thus appealed to admitted that it was a serious matter but urged that as oliver did the thing in ignorance and out of gratitude he ought to be forgiven  i think he ought to be forgiven for having knocked down jim cuttance said captain dan  is he then so notorious asked oliver  why he is the most daring smuggler on the coast replied captain dan and has given the preventive men more trouble than all the others put together  in fact he is a man who deserves to be hanged and will probably come to his proper end ere long if not shot in a brawl beforehand  i fear he stands some chance of it now said mr donnithorne with a sigh for he has been talking of erecting a battery near his den at prussia cove and openly defying the government men  you seem to differ from captain dan uncle in reference to this man said oliver with a smile  truly i do for although i condemn smugglingahem  the old gentleman cast a peculiar glance at the captain i dont like to see a sturdy man hanged or shotand jim cuttance is a stout fellow  i question much whether you could find his match captain dan amongst all your men  that i could easily said the captain with a quiet smile  pardon me captain said oliver my uncle has not yet informed me on the point  may i ask what corps you belong to  to a sturdy corps of tough lads answered the captain with another of his quiet smilesmen who have smelt powder most of em since they were little boyslive on the battlefield i may say almost night and dayspring more mines in a year than all the soldiers in the world put togetherand shorten their lives by the stern labour they undergo but they burn powder to raise not to waste metal  their uniform is red too though not quite so red nor yet so elegant as that of the men in his majestys service  i am one of the underground captains sir of botallack mine  captain dans colour heightened a very little and the tones of his voice became a little more powerful as he concluded this reply but there was no other indication that the enthusiastic soul of one of the captains of the most celebrated mine in cornwall was moved  oliver felt however the contact with a kindred spirit and expressing much interest in the mines proceeded to ask many questions of the captain who nothing loath answered all his queries and explained to him that he was one of the captains or agents whose duty it was to superintend the men and the works below the surfacehence the title of underground while those who superintended the works above ground were styled grass or surface captains  he also made an appointment to conduct the young doctor underground and go over the mine with him at an early date  while the party in old mr donnithornes dwelling were thus enjoying themselves a great storm was gathering and two events very different from each other in character were taking placethe one quiet and apparently unimportant the other tremendous and fatalboth bearing on and seriously influencing the subjects of our tale    chapter four  at work under the sea  chip chip chipdown in the dusky mine  oh but the rock at which the miner chipped was hard and the bit of rock on which he sat was hard and the muscles with which he toiled were hard from prolonged labour and the lot of the man seemed hard as he sat there in the hot heavy atmosphere hour after hour from morn till eve with the sweat pouring down his brow and over his naked shoulders toiling and moiling with hammer and chisel  but stout david trevarrow did not think his lot peculiarly hard  his workshop was a low narrow tunnel deep down under the surface of the earthay and deep under the bottom of the sea  his daily sun was a tallow candle which rose regularly at seven in the morning and set at three in the afternoon  his atmosphere was sadly deficient in lifegiving oxygen and much vitiated by gunpowder smoke  his working costume consisted only of a pair of linen trousers his colour from top to toe was red as brickdust owing to the iron ore around him his food was a slice of bread with perchance when he was unusually luxurious the addition of a cornish pasty and his drink was water  to an inexperienced eye the mans work would have appeared not only hard but hopeless for although his hammer was heavy his arm strong and his chisel sharp and tempered well each blow produced an apparently insignificant effect on the flinty rock  frequently a spark of fire was all that resulted from a blow and seldom did more than a series of little chips fly off although the man was of herculean mould and worked with a will as was evident from the kind of gasp or stern expulsion of the breath with which each blow was accompanied  unaided human strength he knew could not achieve much in such a process so he directed his energies chiefly to the boring of blastholes and left it to the mighty power of gunpowder to do the hard work of rending the rich ore from the bowels of the unwilling earth  yes the work was very hard probably the hardest that human muscles are ever called on to perform in this toiling world but again we say that david trevarrow did not think so for he had been born to the work and bred to it and was blissfully ignorant of work of a lighter kind so that although his brows frowned at the obstinate rock his compressed lips smiled for his thoughts were pleasant and far away  the unfettered mind was above ground roaming in fields of light basking in sunshine and holding converse with the birds as he sat there chip chip chipping down in the dusky mine  stopping at last the miner wiped his brow and rising stood for a few moments silently regarding the result of his days work  now david said he to himself the question is what shall us do shall us keep on or shall us knack  he paused as if unable to answer the question  after a time he muttered keep on it dont look promisin sure nuff an its poor pay but it wont do to give in yet  poor pay it was indeed for the mans earnings during the past month had been barely ten shillings  but david trevarrow had neither wife child nor mother to support so he could afford to toil for poor pay and being of a remarkably hopeful and cheery disposition he returned home that afternoon resolved to persevere in his unproductive toil in the hope that at last he should discover a good bunch of copper or a keenly lode of tin  david was what his friends and the world styled unfortunate  in early manhood he had been a somewhat wild and reckless fellowa noted wrestler and an adept in all manly sports and games  but a disappointment in love had taught him very bitterly that life is not all sunshine and this coupled with a physical injury which was the result of his own folly crushed his spirit so much that his comrades believed him to be a lost man  the injury referred to was the bursting of a bloodvessel in the lungs it was and still is the custom of the youthful miners of cornwall to test their strength by racing up the almost interminable ladders by which the mines are reached  this tremendous exertion after a day of severe toil affected them of course very severely and in some cases seriously  many an ablebodied man has by this means brought himself to a premature end  among others david trevarrow excelled and suffered no one could beat him in running up the ladders but one day on reaching the surface blood issued from his mouth and thenceforth his racing and wrestling days were ended and his spirit was broken  a long illness succeeded  then he began to mend  slowly and by degrees his strength returned but not his joyous spirit  still it was some comfort to feel able for work again and he went underground with some degree of his old vigour though not with the light heart or light step of former days but bad fortune seemed to follow him everywhere  when others among his comrades were fortunate in finding copper or tin david was most unaccountably unsuccessful  accidents too from falls and explosions laid him up more than once and he not only acquired the character of an unlucky man from his friends but despite a naturally sanguine temperament he began himself to believe that he was one of the unluckiest fellows in the world  about this time the followers of that noble christian john wesley began to make an impression on cornwall and to exert an influence which created a mighty change in the hearts and manners of the people and the blessed effects of which are abundantly evident at the present dayto the rejoicing of every christian soul  one of those ministers of our lord happened to meet with david trevarrow and was the means of opening his eyes to many great and previously unknown truths  among others he convinced him that gods ways are not as mans ways that he often though not always leads his people by thorny paths that they know not of but does it in love and with his own glory in their happiness as the end in view that the lord jesus christ must be to a man the chiefest among ten thousand and altogether lovely else he is to him nothing at all and that he could be convinced of all these truths only by the holy spirit  it were vain to attempt to tell all that this good man said to the unhappy miner but certain it is that from that time forth david became himself againand yet not himself  the desire to wrestle and fight and race returned in a new form  he began to wrestle with principalities and powers to fight the good fight of faith and to run the race set before him in the gospel  the old hearty smile and laugh and cheery disposition also returned and the hopeful spirit and so much of the old robust health and strength that it seemed as if none of the evil effects of the ruptured bloodvessel remained  so david trevarrow went as of old daily to the mine  it is true that riches did not flow in upon him any faster than before but he did not mind that much for he had discovered another mine in which he toiled at nights after the days toil was over and whence he extracted treasure of greater value than copper or tin or even goldtreasure which he scattered in a sabbath school with liberal hand and found himself all the richer for his prodigality  occasionally after prolonged labour in confined and bad air a faint trace of the old complaint showed itself when he reached the top of the ladders but he was not now depressed by that circumstance as he used to be  he was past his prime at the period of which we write and a confirmed bachelor  to return from this digression david trevarrow made up his mind as we have said to go on and being a man of resolute purpose he went on seized his hammer and chisel and continued perseveringly to smite the flinty rock surrounded by thick darkness which was not dispelled but only rendered visible by the feeble light of the tallow candle that flared at his side  over his head rolled the billows of the atlantic the whistling wind howled among the wild cliffs of the cornish coast but they did not break the deep silence of the miners place of midnight toil  heavens artillery was rending the sky and causing the hearts of men to beat slow with awe  the great boulders ground the pebbles into sand as they crashed to and fro above him but he heard them notor if he did the sound reached him as a deeptoned mysterious murmur for being in one of the low levels with many fathoms of solid rock between him and the bottom of the superincumbent sea he was beyond the reach of such disturbing influences tremendous though they were  the miner was making a final effort at his unproductive piece of rock and had prolonged his toil far into the night  hour after hour he wrought almost without a moments respite save for the purpose now and then of trimming his candle  when his right arm grew tired he passed the hammer swiftly to his left hand and turning the borer with his right continued to work with renewed vigour  at last he paused and looking over his shoulder called outzackey booy  the sound died away in a hollow echo through the retiring galleries of the mine but there was no reply  zackey booy are ee slaipin he repeated  a small reddishcoloured bundle which lay in a recess close at hand uncoiled itself like a hedgehog and yawning vociferously sat up revealing the fact that the bundle was a boy  ded ee call uncle asked the boy in a sleepy tone  iss did i said the man fetch me the powder an fuse my son  the lad rose and fetching out of a dark corner the articles required assisted in charging the hole which his uncle had just finished boring this was the last hole which the man intended to blast that night  for weeks past he had laboured day after daysometimes as on the present occasion at nightand had removed many tons of rock without procuring either tin or copper sufficient to repay him for his toil so that he resolved to give it up and remove to a more hopeful part of the mine or betake himself to another mine altogether  he had now bored his last hole and was about to blast it  applying his candle to the end of the fuse he hastened along the level to a sufficient distance to afford security warning his nephew as he passed  zackey leaped up and scrambling over the debris with which the bottom of the level was covered made good his retreat  about a minute they waited in expectancy  suddenly there was a bright blinding flash which lit up the rugged sides of the mine and revealed its cavernous ramifications and black depths  this was accompanied by a dull smothered report and a crash of falling rock together with a shower of debris  instantly the whole place was in profound darkness  aw booy exclaimed the miner we was too near  it have knacked us in the dark  sot have uncle ill go an search for the box  do my son said david  in those days lucifer matches had not been invented and light had to be struck by means of flint steel and tinder  the process was tedious compared with the rapid action of congreves and vestas in the present day  the man chipped away for full three minutes before he succeeded in relighting his candle  this done the rock was examined  bad still uncle david inquired the boy  iss zackey maggot so well knackn and try the higher mine tomorrow  having come to this conclusion uncle david threw down the mass of rock which he held in his brawny hands and picking up his implements said get the tools booy and lev us go to grass  zackey who had been in the mine all day and was tired tied his tools at each end of a rope so that they might be slung over his shoulder and leave his hands free  trevarrow treated his in the same way and removing his candle from the wall fixed it on the front of his hat by the simple process of sticking thereto the lump of clay to which it was attached  zackey having fixed his candle in the same manner both of them put on their redstained flannel shirts and linen coats and traversed the level until they reached the bottom of the laddershaft here they paused for a few moments before commencing the long wearisome ascent of almost perpendicular ladders by which the miners descended to their work or returned to grass as they termed the act of returning to the surface  it cost them more than half an hour of steady climbing before they reached the upper part of the shaft and became aware that a storm was raging in the regions above  on emerging from the mouth of the shaft or ladder road man and boy were in a profuse perspiration and the sharp gale warned them to hasten to the moorhouse at full speed  moorhouses were little buildings in which miners were wont to change their wet underground garments for dry clothes  some of these used to be at a considerable distance from the shafts and the men were often injured while going to them from the mine by being exposed in an overheated state to cutting winds  many a stout ablebodied miner has had a chill given him in this way which has resulted in premature death moorhouses have now been replaced by large dryinghouses near the mouths of shafts where every convenience is provided for the men drying their wet garments and washing their persons on coming to the surface  having changed their clothes uncle and nephew hastened to st just where they dwelt in the cottage of maggot the blacksmith  this man who has already been introduced to the reader was brotherinlaw to david and father to zackey  when david trevarrow entered his brotherinlaws cottage and told him of his bad fortune and of his resolution to try his luck next day in the higher mine little did he imagine that his change of purpose was to be the first step in a succession of causes which were destined to result at no very distant period in great changes of fortune to some of his friends in st just as well as to many others in the county    chapter five  describes a wreck and some of its consequences  while the miner had been pursuing his toilsome work in the solitude and silence of the level under the sea as already described a noble ship was leaping over the atlantic waveshomeward boundto old england  she was an eastindiaman under closereefed sails and although she bent low before the gale so that the waves almost curled over her lee bulwarks she rose buoyantly like a seagull for she was a good ship stout of plank and sound of timber with sails and cordage to match  naturally in such a storm those on board were anxious for they knew that they were drawing near to land and that dear old england had an ugly seaboard in these partsa coast not to be too closely hugged in what the captain styled dirty weather with a whole gale from the westard so a good lookout was kept  sharp eyes were in the foretop looking out for the guiding rays of the longships lighthouse which illumine that part of our rocky shores to warn the mariner of danger and direct him to a safe harbour  the captain stood on the fogesl with stern gaze and compressed lip  the chart had been consulted the bearings correctly noted calculations made and leeway allowed for everything in fact that could be done by a commander who knew his duty had been done for the safety of the shipso would the captain have said probably had he lived to be questioned as to the management of his vessel  but everything had not been done  the lead strange to say had not been hove  it was ready to heave but the order was delayed unaccountable fatality  the only safe guide that remained to the good ship on that wild night was held in abeyance  it was deemed unnecessary to heave it yet or it was troublesome and they would wait till nearer the land  no one now can tell the reasons that influenced the captain but the lead was not used  owing to similar delay or neglect hundreds upon hundreds of ships have been lost and thousands of human lives have been sacrificed  the ship passed like a dark phantom over the very head of the miner who was at work many fathoms below the bottom of the sea  land ho came suddenly in a fierce quick shout from the masthead  starboard starboardhard cried the captain as the roar of breakers ahead rose above the yelling of the storm  before the order was obeyed or another word spoken the ship struck and a shriek of human terror followed as the foremast went by the board with a fearful crash  the waves burst over the stern sweeping the decks fore and aft  wave after wave lifted the great ship as though it had been a childs toy and dashed her down upon the rocks  her bottom was stove in her planks and timbers were riven like matchwood  far down below man was destroying the flinty rock while overhead the rock was destroying the handiwork of man  but the destruction in the one case was slow in the other swift  a desperate but futile effort was made by the crew to get out the boats and the passengers many of whom were women and children rushed frantically from the cabin to the deck and clung to anything they could lay hold of until strength failed and the waves tore them away  one man there was in the midst of all the terrorstricken crew who retained his selfpossession in that dread hour  he was a tall stern old man with silver locksan indian merchant one who had spent his youth and manhood in the wealthy land collecting goldmaking a fortune he was wont to sayand who was returning to his fatherland to spend it  he was a thinking and calculating man and in the anticipation of some such catastrophe as had actually overtaken him he had secured some of his most costly jewels in a linen belt  this belt while others were rushing to the boats the old man secured round his waist and then sprang on deck to be swept with a dozen of his fellowpassengers into the sea by the next wave that struck the doomed vessel  there was no one on that rugged coast to lend a helping hand lifeboats did not then as now nestle in little nooks on every part of our dangerous coasts  no eye was there to see nor ear to hear when twenty minutes after she struck the eastindiaman went to pieces and those of her crew and passengers who had retained their hold of her uttered their last despairing cry and their souls returned to god who gave them  it is a solemn thought that man may with such awful suddenness and so unexpectedly be summoned into the presence of his maker  thrice happy they who when their hearts grow chill and their grasps relax as the last plank is rending can say neither death nor life nor any other creature is able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord  the scene we have described was soon over and the rich cargo of the eastindiaman was cast upon the sea and strewn upon the shore affording much work for many days to the coastguard and greatly exciting the people of the districtmost of whom appeared to entertain an earnest belief in the doctrine that everything cast by storms upon their coast ought to be considered public property  portions of the wreck had the name trident painted on them and letters found in several chests which were washed ashore proved that the ship had sailed from calcutta and was bound for the port of london  one little boy alone escaped the waves  he was found in a crevice of the cliffs the following day with just enough vitality left to give a few details of the wreck  although all possible care was bestowed on him he died before night  thus sudden and complete was the end of as fine a ship as ever spread her canvas to the breeze  at night she had been full of lifefull of wealth in the morning she was goneonly a few bales and casks and broken spars to represent the wealth and stiffened corpses to tell of the life departed  so she came and went and in a short time all remnants of her were carried away  one morning a few weeks after the night of the storm maggot the smith turned himself in his bed at an early hour and feeling disinclined to slumber got up to look at the state of the weather  the sun was just rising and there was an inviting look about the morning which induced the man to dress hastily and go out  maggot was a powerfullybuilt man rough in his outer aspect as well as in his inner man but by no means what is usually termed a bad man although morally speaking he could not claim to be considered a good one  in fact he was a hearty jolly reckless fisherman with warm feelings enthusiastic temperament and no principle a man who though very ready to do a kind act had no particular objection to do one that was decidedly objectionable when it suited his purpose or served his present interest  he was regarded by his comrades as one of the greatest madcaps in the district  old maggot was as we have said a blacksmith to trade but he had also been bred a miner and was something of a fisherman as well besides being like most of his companions an inveterate smuggler  he could turn his hand to almost anything and was everything by turns but nothing long  sauntering down to priests cove on the south of cape cornwall with his hands in his pockets and his souwester stuck carelessly on his shaggy head he fell in with a comrade whom he hailed by the name of john cock  this man was also a fisherman et cetera and the bosom friend and admirer of maggot  where bound to this mornin jack inquired maggot  to fish replied john  i go with ee booy said maggot  this was the extent of the conversation at that time  they were not communicative but walked side by side in silence to the beach where they launched their little boat and rowed out to sea  presently john cock looked over his shoulder and exclaimedmaggot i see summat  do ee  iss do i  what do un look like  like a dead corp  aw my dear said maggot lev us keep away  it can do no good to we  acting on this opinion the men rowed past the object that was floating on the sea and soon after began to fish but they had not fished long when the dead body drifted probably by some crosscurrent appeared close to them again  seeing this they changed their position but ere long the body again appeared  praps observed maggot theres somethin in its pockets  as the same idea had occurred to john cock the men resolved to examine the body so they rowed up to it and found it to be that of an elderly man much decomposed and nearly naked  a very short examination sufficed to show that the pockets of such garments as were still upon it were empty and the men were about to let it go again when maggot exclaimed  hold fast jack i see somethin tied round the waist of he a sort o belt it do seem  the belt was quickly removed and the body released when it sank with a heavy plunge but ere long reappeared on the surface  the fishermen rowed a considerable distance away from it and then shipped their oars and examined the belt which was made of linen  maggot sliced it up as he would have ripped up a fish and laid bare to the astonished gaze of himself and his friend a number of glittering gems of various colours neatly and firmly embedded in cotton besides a variety of rings and small brooches set with precious stones  now i tell ee said maggot tis like as this here will make our fortin or else git we into trouble  why whatever shud we git into trouble bout it for said john cock tis like as not they aint realonly painted glass scarce wuth the trouble o carin ashore  hould thy tongue thee geat chucklehead replied maggot a man wouldnt go for to tie such stuff round his waist to drown hisself with i do know if they wornt real  lev us car em to maister donnithorne  john cock replied with a nod and the two men packing up the jewels pulled inshore as fast as possible  hauling their boat beyond the reach of the surf they hastened to st just and requested a private audience of mr donnithorne  see note 1  that excellent gentleman was not unaccustomed to give private audiences to fishermen and as has been already hinted at the beginning of this tale was reported to have private dealings with them alsoof a very questionable nature  he received the two men however with the hearty air of a man who knows that the suspicions entertained of him by the calumnious world are false  well maggot said mr donnithorne what is your business with me you are not wont to be astir so early if all be true that is reported of ee  plaise sur said maggot with a glance at rose ellis who sat sewing near the window im come to talk bout private mattersif  leave us rose dear for a little said the old gentleman  as soon as she was out of the room maggot locked the door a proceeding which surprised mr donnithorne not a little but his surprise was much greater when the man drew a small parcel from the breast of his rough coat and unrolling it displayed the glittering jewels of which he had so unexpectedly become possessed  where got you these inquired mr donnithorne turning them over carefully  got em in the saycatched em sure nough said maggot  not with a baited hook i warrant said the old gentleman  come my son lets hear all about it  maggot explained how he had obtained the jewels and then asked what they were worth  i cant tell that said mr donnithorne shaking his head gravely some of them are undoubtedly of value the others for all i know may not be worth much  come now sur said maggot with a confidential leer its not the fust time we have done a bit o business  i spose i cud claim salvage on em  i dont know that said the old gentleman you cannot tell whom they belonged to and i suspect government would claim them ifbut by the way i suppose you found no lettersnothing in the shape of writing on the body  nothin whatsomever  well then i fear that  come now sur said maggot boldly spose you gives john and me ten pounds apaice an kape em to yourself to make what ee can of em  mr donnithorne shook his head and hesitated  often before had he defrauded the revenue by knowingly purchasing smuggled brandy and tobacco and by providing the funds to enable others to smuggle them but then the morality of that day in regard to smuggling was very lax and there were men who although in all other matters truly honest and upright could not be convinced of the sinfulness of smuggling and smiled when they were charged with the practice but who nevertheless would have scorned to steal or tell a downright lie  this however was a very different matter from smuggling  the old gentleman shrank from it at first and could not meet the gaze of the smuggler with his usual bold frank look  but the temptation was great  the jewels he suspected were of immense value and his heart readily replied to the objections raised by his conscience that after all there was no one left to claim them and he had a much better right to them in equity if not in law than government and as to the fellows who found themwhy the sum they asked would be a great and rich windfall to them besides freeing them from all further trouble as well as transferring any risk that might accrue from their shoulders to his own  while the old gentleman was reasoning thus with himself maggot stood anxiously watching his countenance and twisting the cloth that had enclosed the jewellery into a tight rope as he shifted his position uneasily  at length old mr donnithorne said  leave the jewels with me and call again in an hour from this time you shall then have my answer  maggot and his friend consented to this delay and left the room  no sooner were they gone than the old gentleman called his wife who naturally exclaimed in great surprise on beholding the table covered with such costly trinkets  where ever did you get these tom  mr donnithorne explained and then asked what she thought of maggots proposal  refuse it said she firmly  but my dear  dont but about it tom  whenever a man begins to but with sin it is sure to butt him over on his back  have nothing to do with it i say  but my dear it is not dishonest  i dont know that interrupted mrs donnithorne vigorously you think that smuggling is not dishonest but i do and so does the minister  what care i for the minister cried the old gentleman losing his temper who made him a judge of my doings  he is an expounder of gods word said mrs donnithorne firmly and holds that thou shalt not steal is one of the ten commandments  well well he and i dont agree thats all besides has he never expounded to you that obedience to your husband is a virtue a commandment i may say which you are  mr donnithorne said the lady with dignity i am here at your request and am now complying with your wishes in giving my opinion  there there molly said the subdued husband giving his better half a kiss dont be so sharp  you ought to have been a lawyer with your powerful reasoning capacity  however let me tell you that you dont understand these matters  then why ask my advice tom  why woman because an inexplicable fatality leads me to consult you although i know well enough what the upshot will be  but im resolved to close with maggot  i knew you would said mrs donnithorne quietly  the last remark was the turningpoint  had the good lady condescended to be earnest in her entreaties that the bargain should not be concluded it is highly probable her husband would have given in but her last observation nettled him so much that he immediately hoisted a flag of defiance nailed it to the mast and went out in great indignation to search for maggot  that individual was not far off  the bargain was completed the jewels were locked up in one of the old gentlemans secret repositories and the fishermen with ten pounds apiece in their pockets returned home    note 1  it may be well here to inform the reader that the finding of the jewels as here described and the consequences which followed are founded on fact    chapter six  treats of the miners cottage work and costume  maggots home was a disordered one when he reached it for his youngest baby a fat little boy had been seized with convulsions and his wife and little daughter grace and son zackey and brotherinlaw david trevarrow besides his next neighbour mrs penrose with her sixteen children were all in the room doing their best by means of useless or hurtful applications equally useless advice and intolerable noise and confusion to cure if not to kill the baby  maggots cottage was a poor one his furniture was mean and there was not much of it nevertheless its inmates were proud of it for they lived in comparative comfort there  mrs maggot was a kindhearted active woman and her husbanddespite his smuggling propensitieswas an affectionate father  usually the cottage was kept in a most orderly condition but on the present occasion it was as we have said in a state of great confusion  fetch me a bit of rag grace cried mrs maggot just as her husband entered  heres a bit old ooman said maggot handing her the linen cloth in which the jewels had been wrapped up and which he had unconsciously retained in his hands on quitting mr donnithornerun my dear man he added turning to john cock an fetch the noo doctor  john darted away and in a quarter of an hour returned with oliver trembath who found that the baby had weathered the storm by the force of its own constitution despite the adverse influences that were around it  he therefore contented himself with clearing the place of intruders and prescribing some simple medicine  are you going to work inquired oliver of david trevarrow observing that the man was about to quit the cottage  iss surto botallack  then i will accompany you  captain dan is going to show me over part of the mine today  goodmorning mrs maggot and remember my directions if this should happen to the little fellow again  leaving the cottage the two proceeded through the town to the north end of it accompanied by maggot who said he was going to the forge to do a bit of work and who parted from them at the outskirts of the town  times are bad with you at the mines just now i find said oliver as they walked along  iss sur they are replied trevarrow in the quiet tone that was peculiar to him but thank god we do manage to live though there are some of us with a lot o childn as finds it hard work  the bal the mine aint so good as she once was  i suppose that you have frequent changes of fortune said oliver  the miner admitted that this was the case for that sometimes a man worked underground for several weeks without getting enough to keep his family while at other times he might come on a bunch of copper or tin which would enable him to clear 50 pounds or more in a month  if report says truly observed oliver you have hit upon a keenly lode as you call it not many days ago  a do look very well now sur replied the miner but wan can never tell  i did work for weeks in the level under the say without success so i guv it up an went to wheal hazard and on the back o the fiftyfathom level i did strike pon a small lode of tin bout so thick as my finger  it may get better or it may take the bit in its teeth and disappear we cannot tell  well i wish you good luck said oliver and here comes captain dan so ill bid you goodmorning  goodmorning sur said the stoutlimbed and stouthearted man with a smile and a nod as he turned off towards the moorhouse to put on his mining garments  towards this house a number of men had been converging while oliver and his companion approached it and the former observed that whatever colour the men might be on entering it they invariably came out light red like lobsters emerging from a boiling pot  in botallack mine a large quantity of iron is mingled with the tin ore this colours everything in and around the mine including mens clothes hands and faces with a light rustyred  the streams of course are also coloured with it and the various pits and ponds for collecting the fluid mud of tin ore seem as if filled with that nauseous compound known by the name of gregorys mixture  in the moorhouse there were rows of pegs with red garments hung thereon to dry and there were numerous broadshouldered men dressing and undressingin every stage of the process while in a corner two or three were washing their bodies in a tank of water  these last were men who had been at work all night and were cleansing themselves before putting on what we may term their homegoing clothes  the mining dress is a very simple and often a very ragged affair  it consists of a flannel shirt a pair of linen trousers a short coat of the same and a hat in the form of a stiff wideawake but made so thick as to serve the purpose of a helmet to guard the head from the rocks etcetera  clumsy ankleboots complete the costume  as each man issued from the house he went to a group of wooden chests which lay scattered about outside and opening his own took from it a bag of powder some blasting fuse several iron tools which he tied to a rope so as to be slung over his shoulder a small wooden canteen of water and a bunch of tallow candles  these last he fastened to a button on his breast having previously affixed one of them to the front of his hat  thus accoutred they proceeded to a small platform close at hand with a square hole in it out of which protruded the head of a ladder  this was the ladder road  through the hole these red men descended one by one chatting and laughing as they went and disappeared leaving the moorhouse and all around it a place of solitude  captain dan now prepared to descend this ladder road with oliver trembath    chapter seven  tells of the great mine and of a royal dive under the sea  botallack to the dark depths of which we are now about to descend is the most celebrated mine in the great mining county of cornwall  it stands on the sea coast a little more than a mile to the north of st just  the region around it is somewhat bleak and almost destitute of trees  in approaching it the eyes of the traveller are presented with a view of enginehouses and piles of stones and rubbish in the midst of which stand a number of uncouth yet picturesque objects composed of boards and timber wheels ropes pulleys chains and suchlike gear these last are the winding erections of the shafts which lead to the various mines for the whole region is undermined and botallack is only one of several in st just parish  wherever the eye turns there in the midst of green fields where rocks and rocky fences abound may be seen rising prominently the labouring arms or bobs of the pump and skip engines and the other machinery required in mining operations while the ear is assailed by the perpetual clatter of the stamps or orecrushing machines which never cease their din day or night except on sundays  botallack like all the other mines has several shafts or entrances to the works below such as boscawen shaft wheal button wheal hazard chicornish shaft davis shaft wheal cock etcetera the most interesting of which are situated among the steep rugged cliffs that front and bid defiance to the utmost fury of the atlantic ocean  from whatever point viewed the aspect of botallack mine is grand in the extreme  on the rocky point that stretches out into the sea engines with all their fantastic machinery and buildings have been erected  on the very summit of the cliff is seen a complication of timbers wheels and chains sharply defined against the sky with apparently scarce any hold of the cliff while down below on rocky ledges and in black chasms are other engines and beams and rods and wheels and chains fastened and perched in fantastic forms in dangerouslooking places  here amid the most savage gorges of the sea and riven rockshalf clinging to the land half suspended over the wateris perched the machinery of and entrance to the most singular shaft of the mine named the boscawen diagonal shaft  this shaft descends under the sea at a steep incline  it is traversed on rails by an iron carriage called the gig which is lowered and drawn up by steam power starting as it does from an elevated position in the rocks that are close to the edge of the sea and slanting down through the cape outward or seaward this vehicle descends only a few fathoms when it is under the oceans bed and then its further course is far out and deep downabout twothirds of a mile out and full 245 fathoms down the gig conveys the men to and from their workthe ore being drawn up by another iron carriage  there is or rather there was before the selfacting brake was added danger attending the descent of this shaft for the rope although good and strong is not immaculate as was proved terribly in the year 1864when it broke and the gig flew down to the bottom like lightning dashing itself to pieces and instantly killing the nine unfortunate men who were descending at the time  nevertheless the prince and princess of wales did not shrink from descending this deep burrow under the sea in the year 1865  it was a great day for st just and botallack that 24th of july on which the royal visit was paid  great were the expectation and preparation on all hands to give a hearty welcome to the royal pair  the ladies arrayed themselves in their best to do fitting honour to the princess the balmaidens donned their holidayattire and johnny fortnight see note 1 took care by supplying the poor minegirls with the latest fashions that their appearance should be if we may be allowed the word splendiferous  the volunteers too turned out in force and no one looking at their trim soldierly aspect could have believed them to be the same miners who were wont to emerge each evening through a hole in the earth red as lobsters wet ragged and befouledin a word surrounded by a halo of dishevelment indicative of their rugged toils in the regions below  everywhere the people turned out to line the roads and worthily receive the expected visitors and great was the cheering when they arrived accompanied by the duke and duchess of sutherland the earl of mount edgecumbe lady de grey lord and lady vivian general knollys and others but louder still was the cheer when the princess rode down the steep descent to the cliffs in a donkeycarriage  the botallack cliffs themselves however were the central point not only of the interest but of the grandeur of the scene for here were presented such a view and combination as are not often witnessednature in one of her wildest aspects combined with innumerable multitudes of human beings swayed by one feeling of enthusiastic loyalty  above on every attainable point projection and eminence men and women clustered like gay flies on the giant cliffs leaving immense gaps here and there where no foot might venture save that of a bird  midway on the face of the precipice clung the great beams and supports of the boscawen diagonal shaft with the little gig perched on them and the royal party seated therein facing the entrance to the black abyssthe princess arrayed in a white flannel cloak trimmed with blue and a straw hat with a blue ribbon round it and the prince clad in miners costume underneath a dizzy depth to gaze down lay the rugged boulders of the shore with the spray of the atlantic springing over them  deafening was the cheer when the gig at last entered the shaft and disappeared and intense the anxiety of the vast multitude as they watched the descentin imagination of course for nothing could be seen but the tight wirerope uncoiling its endless length and disappearing like a thin snake down the jaws of some awful seamonster that had climbed so far up the cliffs to meet and devour it  now they are at the shore now passing under the sea fairly under it by this time a few minutes more and they have reached the spot where yonder seagull is now wheeling above the waves wondering what new species of bird has taken possession of its native cliffs  five minutes are passedyet still descending rapidly  they must be half a mile out from the land nowhalf of a mile out on the first part of a submarine tunnel to america  old england is on the lee but they are very much the reverse of afloat solid rock is above on either side and belowso close to them that the elbows must not be allowed to protrude over the edge of their car nor the head be held too high  here even royalty must stoopnot that we would be understood to imply that royalty cannot stoop elsewhere  those who dwell in highland cottages could contradict us if we did  presently the rope slowsthe lower depths are reached and now for some time there is patient waiting for it is understood that they are examining the levels where the stout men of cornwall tear out the solid rock in quest of copper and tin  after a time the thin snake begins to ascend they are coming up now but not so fast as they went down  it is about ten minutes before the gig emerges from that black hole and bears the prince and princess once more into the light of day  yes it was a great day for botallack and it will dwell long in the memories of those who witnessed itespecially of that fortunate captain of the mine who had the honour of conducting the princess on the occasion and of whose enthusiasm in recalling the event and in commenting on her intelligence and condescension we can speak from personal observation  but reader you will say what has all this to do with our story  nothingwe admit it franklynothing whatever in a direct way nevertheless indirectly the narrative may possibly arouse in you greater interest in the mine down which we are about to conduct younot by the same route as that taken by the prince and princess for the boscawen shaft did not exist at the period of our tale but by one much more difficult and dangerous as you shall see  before we go however permit us to add to the offence of digression by wandering still further out of our direct road  there are a few facts regarding botallack and mining operations without a knowledge of which you will be apt at times to misunderstand your position  let us suppose that a mine has been already opened that a lodethat is a vein of quartz with metal in ithas been discovered cropping out of the earth and that it has been dug down upon from above and dug in upon from the seacliffs  a shaft has been sunkin other words a hole excavatedlet us say two or three hundred yards inland to a depth of some forty or fifty fathomsnear the sealevel  this shaft is perhaps nine feet by six wide  the lode being a layer of quartz sometimes slopes one way sometimes another and is occasionally perpendicular it also varies in its run or direction a little here and there like a wildish horse being sometimes met by other lodes which like bad companions divert it from the straight course  unlike bad companions however they increase its value at the point of meeting by thickening it  whatever course the lode takes the miner conscientiously follows suit  his shaft slopes much little or not at all according to the lie of the lode  it is an ancient truism that water must find its level  owing to this law much water accumulates in the shaft obliging the miner to erect an enginehouse and provide a powerful pumpingengine with all its gear at immense cost to keep the works dry as he proceeds  he then goes to the shore and there in the face of the perpendicular cliff a little above the sealevel he cuts a horizontal tunnel about six feet high by three broad and continues to chisel and blast away the solid rock until he drives his tunnel a quarter of a mile inland which he will do at a rate varying from two to six feet per week according to the hardness of the rock until he reaches the shaft and thus provides an easy and inexpensive passage for the water without pumping  this tunnel or level he calls the adit level  but his pumpingengine is by no means rendered useless for it has much to do in hauling ore to the surface etcetera  in process of time the miner works away all the lode down to the sealevel and must sink the shaft deeperperhaps ten or twenty fathomswhere new levels are driven horizontally on the lode and water accumulates which must be pumped up to the adit level whence it escapes to the sea  thus down down he goes sinking his shaft and driving his levels on that is always following the lode ad infinitum  of course he must stop before reaching the other side of the world  at the present time botallack has progressed in that direction to a depth of 245 fathoms to those who find a difficulty in realising what depth that really is we would observe that it is equal to more than three and a half times the height of st pauls cathedral in london nearly four times the height of st rollox chimney in glasgow and considerably more than twice the height from the plain of arthurs seat near edinburgh  when the levels have been driven a considerable distance from the shaft the air naturally becomes bad from want of circulation  to remedy this evil holes or short shafts called winzes are sunk at intervals from the upper to the lower levels  these winzes are dangerous traps for the unwary or careless extending frequently to a depth of ten or fifteen fathoms and being bridged across by one or two loose planks ladders are fixed in many of them to facilitate progress through the mine  when a miner drives the end of his level so far that the air will not circulate a new winze is usually sunk down to him from the level above  the circulation is thus extended and the levels progress further and further right and left until they occupy miles of ground the levels and shafts of botallack if put together would extend to not less than forty miles and the superficial space of ground on and beneath which the mine lies is above 260 acres  when the lode is rich and extends upwards or downwards it is cut away from between levels in a regular systematic manner strong beams being placed to support temporary platforms on which the miners may stand and work as they ascend  when they have cut all the lode away up to the level above them a false timber bottom is made to replace the rocky bottom of the level which is being removed  thus in traversing the old workings of a mine one suddenly comes to great caverns very narrow but of such immense height above and depth below that the rays of your candle cannot penetrate the darkness  in such places the thick short beams that were used by the old miners are seen extending from side to side of the empty space disappearing in dim perspective  woe betide the man who stumbles off his narrow plank or sets his foot on an insecure beam in such places  where such workings are in progress the positions of the miners appear singularly wild and insecure  the men stand in the narrow chasm between the granite walls above each others heads slight temporary platforms alone preserving them from certain death and the candles of those highest above you twinkling like stars in a black sky  in these underground regions of botallack above three hundred men and boys are employed some of whom work occasionally by night as well as by day  on the surface about two hundred men women and boys are employed dressing the ore etcetera  other mines there are in the great mining centres of cornwallredruth st just st austell and helston which are well worthy of notesome of them a little deeper and some richer than botallack  but we profess not to treat of all the cornish mines our object is to describe one as a type of many if not all and as this one runs farthest out beneath the sea is deeper than most of the others and richer than many besides having interesting associations and being of venerable antiquity we hold it to be the one most worthy of selection  with a few briefly stated facts we shall take final leave of statistics  as we have said the boscawen shaft measures 245 fathoms  the ladderway by which the men ascend and descend daily extends to 205 fathoms  it takes a man half an hour to reach the bottom and fully an hour to climb to the surface  there are three pumping and seven winding engines at workthe largest being of 70 horsepower  the tin raised is from 33 to 35 tons a month  the price of tin has varied from 55 pounds to 90 pounds per ton  in time past when botallack was more of a copper than a tinmine a fathom has been known to yield 100 pounds worth of ore and a miner has sometimes broken out as much as 300 pounds worth in one month  the mine has been worked from time immemorial  it is known to have been wrought a hundred years before it was taken by the present company who have had it between thirty and forty years and under the able direction of the present manager and purser mr stephen harvey james it has paid the shareholders more than 100000 pounds  the profit in the year 1844 was 24000 pounds  at the termination of one period of working it left a profit of 300000 pounds  it has experienced many vicissitudes of fortune  formerly it was worked for tin and at one period 1841 was doing so badly that it was about to be abandoned when an unlooked for discovery of copper was made and a period of great prosperity again set in during which many shareholders and miners made their fortunes out of botallack  thus much with a humble apology we present to the reader and now resume the thread of our narrative    note 1  the packmen are so styled because of their visits being paid fortnightly    chapter eight  down down down  before descending the mine captain dan led oliver to the countinghouse where he bade him undress and put on miners clothing  ill need a biggish suit observed oliver  true said captain dan we are obliged usually to give visitors our smallest suits  you are an exception to the rule  indeed im not sure that i have a pair of trousers big enough forah yes by the way here is a pair belonging to one of our captains who is unusually stout and tall i dare say youll be able to squeeze into em  all right said oliver laughing as he pulled on the red garments they are wide enough round the waist at all events  now for a hat  there said the captain handing him a white cotton skullcap put that on  why whats this for said oliver  to keep that from dirtying your head replied the other as he handed his companion a thick felt hat which was extremely dirty on the front especially where the candle was wont to be fixed with wet clay now then attach these two candles to that button in your breast and you are completenot a bad miner to look at said captain dan with a smile of approval  the captain was already equipped in underground costume and the dirty disreputable appearance he presented was thought oliver a wonderful contrast to his sober and gentlemanly aspect on the evening of their first meeting at his uncles table  ill strike a light after we get down a bitso come along said captain dan leaving the office and leading the way  on reaching the entrance to the shaft oliver trembath looked down and observed a small speck of bright light in the black depths  a man coming upwait a bit said the captain in explanation  presently a faint sound of slow footsteps was heard they grew gradually more distinct and ere long the head and shoulders of a man emerged from the hole  perspiration was trickling down his face and painting him streakily with iron rust and mud  all his garments were soaking  he sighed heavily on reaching the surface and appeared to inhale the fresh air with great satisfaction  any more coming  no captain dan replied the man glancing with some curiosity at the tall stranger  now sir we shall descend said the captain entering the shaft  oliver followed and at once plunged out of bright sunshine into subdued light  a descent of a few fathoms brought them to the bottom of the first ladder  it was a short one most of the others the captain told him were long ones  the width of the shaft was about six feet by nine it was nearly perpendicular and the slope of the ladders corresponded with its widththe head of each resting against one side of it and the foot against the other thus forming a zigzag of ladders all the way down  at the foot of the first ladder the light was that of deep twilight here was a wooden platform and a hole cut through it out of which protruded the head of the second ladder  the captain struck a light and applying it to one of the candles affixed the same to the front of olivers hat  arranging his own hat in a similar way he continued the descent and in a few minutes both were beyond the region of daylight when they had got a short way down probably the distance of an ordinary churchsteeples height below the surface oliver looked up and saw the little opening far above him shining brightly like a star  a few steps more and it vanished from view he felt that he had for the first time in his life reached the regions of eternal night  the shaft varied in width here and there in most places it was very narrowabout six feet widebut what with crossbeams to support the sides and prevent soft parts from falling in and other obstructions the space available for descent was often not more than enough to permit of a man squeezing past  a damp smell pervaded the air and there was a strange sense of contraction and confinement so to speak which had at first an unpleasant effect on oliver  the silence when both men paused at a ladderfoot to trim candles or to rest a minute was most profound and there came over the young doctor a sensation of being buried alive and of having bid a final farewell to the upper earth the free air and the sunshine as they went down down down to the depths below  at last they reached a level or gallery by which the laddershaft communicated with the pumpshaft  here captain dan paused and trimmed olivers candle which he had thrust inadvertently against a beam and broken in two  you have to mind your head here sir said the captain with a quiet smile tis a good place to learn humility  oliver could scarce help laughing aloud as he gazed at his guide for standing as he did with the candle close to his face his cheeks nose chin forehead and part of the brim of his hat and shoulders were brought into brilliant light while the rest of him was lost in the profound darkness of the level behind and the flame of his candle rested above his head like the diadem of some aristocratic gnome  how far down have we come inquired oliver  about eighty fathoms said the captain we shall now go along this level and get into the pumpshaft by which we can descend to the bottom  take care of your feet and head as you go for youll be apt to run against the rocks that hang down and the winzes are dangerous  and pray what are winzes asked oliver as he stumbled along in the footsteps of his guide over uneven ground covered with debrisah hallo stop  whats wrong said the captain looking back and holding up his candle to olivers face  candle gone again captain ive run my head on that rock  lucky for me that your mining hats are so thick and hard for i gave it a butt that might have done credit to an ox  i told you to mind your head said captain dan relighting the candle you had better carry it in your hand in the levels it will light your path better  look out nowhere is a winze  the captain pointed to a black yawning hole about six or seven feet in diameter which was bridged across by a single plank  how deep does it go asked the youth holding up his candle and peering in i cant see the bottom  i dare say not said the captain for the bottom is ten fathoms down at the next level  and are all the winzes bridged with a single plank in this way  why no some of em have two or three planks but theyre quite safe if you go steady  and pray how many such winzes are there in the mine asked oliver  couldnt say exactly without thinkin a bit replied the captain but there are a great number of emlittle short of a hundred i should sayfor we have a good many miles of levels in botallack which possesses an underground geography as carefully measured and mapped out as that of the surface  and what would happen asked oliver with an expression of halfsimulated anxiety if you were to fall down a winze and break your neck and my candle were to get knocked or blown out leaving me to find my way out of a labyrinth of levels pierced with holes sixty feet deep  well its hard to say replied captain dan with much simplicity  go on said oliver pursing his lips with a grim smile as he followed his leader across the narrow bridge  captain dan continued his progress until he reached the pumpshaft the proximity of which was audibly announced by the slow ascent and descent of a great wooden beam which was styled the pumprod  alongside and almost touching it for space was valuable there and had to be economised was the iron pipenearly a foot in diameterwhich conveyed the water from the mine to the adit level  the slowheaving plunge of about ten feet in extent and the sough or sigh of the great beam with the accompanying gurgle of water in the huge pipe were sounds that seemed horribly appropriate to the subterranean scene  one could have imagined the mine to be a living giant in the last throes of death by drowning  but these were only one half of the peculiarities of the place  on the other side of the shaft an arrangement of beams and partially broken boards formed the traversing ways or tube up which were drawn the kibblesthese last being large iron buckets used for lifting ore to the surface  in the present day machinery being more perfect the ancient kibble has been to some extent supplanted by skips or small trucks with wheels in some cases iron boxes with guidingrods which are drawn up smoothly and without much tear and wear but in the rough times of which we write the sturdy kibble used to go rattling up the shaft with deafening noise dinting its thick sides and travelling with a jovial freeandeasy swing that must have added considerably to the debit side of the account of working expenses  between the pumprod and the kibbleway there was just room for the ladders upon which captain dan followed by oliver now stepped  this shaft was very wet water dropped and spirted about in fine spray everywhere and the rounds of the ladders were wet and greasy with muchsqueezed slime  it would seem as though the kibbles had known that a stranger was about to descend and had waited for him for no sooner did oliver get on the ladder than they began to movethe one to ascend full and the other to descend empty  whats that exclaimed oliver  its only the kibbles replied captain dan  before the captain could explain what kibbles were these reckless buckets met with a bang close to olivers cheek and rebounded on the beams that protected him from their fury  naturally the young man shrank a little from a noise so loud and so near  he was at once scraped down on the other side by the pumprod  drawing himself together as much as possible and feeling for once the disadvantage of being a large man he followed his leader down down ever down into the profounder depths below  all this time they had not met with a miner or with any sign of human lifeunless the pump and kibbles could be regarded as suchfor they had been hitherto traversing the old levels and workings of the mine but at last during one of their pauses they heard the faint sound of chip chip chip in the far distance  miners inquired oliver  captain dan nodded and said they would now leave the shaft and go to where the men were at work  he cautioned his companion again to have regard to his head and to mind his feet  as they proceeded he stopped ever and anon to point out some object of peculiar interest  theres a considerable space above and below you here sir said the captain stopping suddenly in a level which was not more than three feet wide  oliver had been so intent on his feet and mindful of the winzes that he had failed to observe the immense black opening overhead  it extended so high above him and so far forward and backward in the direction of the level that its boundaries were lost in an immensity of profoundly dark space  the rocky path was also lost to view both before and behind them so that the glare of their lights on the metallic walls rendered the spot on which they stood a point of brilliancy in the midst of darkness  only part of a great beam was visible here and there above them as if suspended in the gloom to render its profundity more apparent  this captain dan explained was the space that had once been occupied by a rich lode of ore all of which had been removed years ago to the great commercial advantage of a past generation  soon after passing this the captain paused at a deep cutting in the rock and looking sadly at it for a few minutes saidit was here that poor trevool lost his life  he was a good lad but careless and used to go rattling along the levels with his light in his hat and his thoughts among the stars instead of carrying the light in his hand and looking to his feet  he fell down that winze and broke his back  when we got him up to grass he was alive but he never spoke another word and died the same night  poor fellow said oliver i suppose your men have narrow escapes sometimes  they have sir but its most always owin to carelessness  there was a cousin of that very lad trevool who was buried with a comrade by the falling in of a shaft and came out alive  i was there at the time and helped to dig him out  captain dan here stopped and sticking his candle against the wet wall of the mine sat down on a piece of rock while our hero stood beside him  you see said he we were sinking a shaft or rather reopening an old one at the time and harvey that was the mans name was down working with a comrade  they came to a soft bit o ground an as they cut through it they boarded it up with timbers across to prevent it slipping but they did the work hastily  after they had cut down some fathoms below it the boarding gave way and down the whole thing went boards timbers stones and rubbish on their heads  we made sure they were dead but set to nevertheless to dig them out as fast as possibleturning as many hands to the work as could get at it  at last we came on them and both were alive and not very much hurt  the timbers and planks had fallen over them in such a way as to keep the stones and rubbish off  i had a talk with old harvey the other day on this very subject  he told me that he was squeezed flat against the side of the shaft by the rubbish which buried him and that he did not lose consciousness for a moment  a large stone had stuck right above his head and this probably saved him  he heard us digging down to him he said and when we got close he sang out to hold on as the shovel was touching him  sure enough this was the case for the next shovelful of rubbish that was lifted revealed the top of his head  we cleared the way to his mouth as carefully as we could and then gave him a drop of brandy before going on with the work of excavation  his comrade was found in a stooping position and was more severely bruised than old harvey but both of them lived to tell the tale of their burial and to thank god for their deliverance  yes continued the captain detaching his candle from the wall and resuming his walk we have narrow escapes sometimeslook here doctor did you ever see a rock like that  captain dan pointed to a place in the side of the rocky wall which was grooved and cut as if with a huge gouge or chisel and highly polished it was never cut by man in that fashion we found it as you see it and theres many of em in the mine  we call em slinking slides  the marks must have been caused when the rocks were in a state of partial fusion observed oliver examining the place with much curiosity  i dont know as to that sir said the captain moving on but there they are and some of em polished to that extent you could almost see your face in em  on turning the corner of a jutting rock a light suddenly appeared revealing a pair of large eyes and a double row of teeth as it were gleaming out of the darkness  on drawing nearer this was discovered to be a miner whose candle was at some little distance and only shone on him partially  well jack whats doing asked the captain  the man cast a disconsolate look on a large mass of rock which lay in the middle of the path at his feet  he had been only too successful in his last blasting and had detached a mass so large that he could not move it  its too hard for to break captain dan  better get it into the truck said the captain  cant lift it sur said the man who grudged to go through the tedious process of boring it for a second blast  you must get it out o that jack at all events  it wont do to let it lie there said the captain passing on and leaving the miner to get out of his difficulty as best he might  a few minutes more and they came on a pare of men in other words a band of two or more men working together who were stopeingin the back of the level as they termed the process of cutting upwards into the roof  theres a fellow in a curious place said oliver peering up through an irregular hole in which a man was seen at work standing on a plank supported by a ladder  he was chiselling with great vigour at the rock over his head and immediately beyond him another man stood on a plank supported by a beam of timber and busily engaged in a similar occupation  both men were stripped to the waist and panted at their toil  the little chamber or cavern in which they worked was brilliantly illuminated by their two candles and their athletic figures stood out dark and picturesque against the light glistering walls  a curious place and a singular man observed the captain that fellows family is not a small onehallo  james martin  hallo  captain dan replied the miner looking down  how many children have you had  how many childn say ee  ay how many  ive had nineteen sur an theres eight of em alive  seven of em came in three year an six months surthree doubles an a single but them uns are all gone dead sur  how old are you jim  fortyseven sur  your brother tom is at work here isnt he  iss in the south level drivin the end  how many children has tom had jim  seventeen sur an seven of ems alive but toms only thirtyeight years old sur  see note 1  goodmorning jim  goodmorning captain dan replied the sturdy miner resuming his work  good specimens of men these said the captain with a quiet smile to oliver  of course i dont mean to say that all the miners hereabouts are possessed of such large familiesnevertheless there are as i dare say you have observed a good many children in and about st just  proceeding onward they diverged into a branch level where a number of men were working overhead boring holes into the roof and burrowing upwards  they all drove onwards through flinty rock by the same slow and toilsome process that has already been describednamely by chipping with the pick driving holes with the borer and blasting with gunpowder  as the captain and oliver traversed this part of the mine they had occasionally to squeeze past small iron trucks which stood below holes in the sides of the level down which ever and anon masses of ore and debris came from the workings above with a hard crashing noise  the ore was rich with tin but the metal was invisible to any but trained eyes to oliver trembath the whole stuff appeared like wet rubbish  suddenly a low muffled report echoed through the cavernous place  it was followed by five or six similar reports in succession  they are blasting said captain dan  as he spoke the thick muddy shoes and brickdust legs of a man appeared coming down the hole that had previously discharged ore  the man himself followed his legs and alighting thereon saluted captain dan with a freeandeasy goodmorning  another man followed him from a different part of the surrounding darkness a third made his appearance and others came trooping in until upwards of a dozen of them were collected in the narrow tunnel each with his tallow candle in his hand or hat so that the place was lighted brilliantly  they were all clad in loose patched and ragged clothes  all were of a uniform rustyred colour each with his broad bosom bared and perspiration trickling down his besmeared countenance  here however the uniformity of their appearance ended for they were of all sizes and characters  some were robust and muscular some were lean and wiry some were just entering on manhood with the ruddy hue of health shining through the slime on their smooth faces some were in the prime of life pale from long working underground but strong and almost as hard as the iron with which they chiselled the rocks  others were growing old and an occasional cough told that the miners complaint had begun its fatal undermining of the longenduring toolongtried human body  there were one or two whose iron constitutions had resisted the evil influences of wet garments bad air and chills and who with much of the strength of manhood and some of the colour of youth were still plying their hammers in old age  but these were rare specimens of vigour and longevity not many such are to be found in botallack mine  the miners working life is a short one and comparatively few of those who begin it live to a healthy old age little boys were there too diminutive but sturdy urchins miniature copies of their seniors though somewhat dirtier proud as peacocks because of being permitted at so early an age to accompany their fathers or brothers underground and their bosoms swelling with that stern cornish spirit of determination to face and overcome great difficulties which has doubtless much to do with the excessive development of chest and shoulder for which cornish miners especially those of st just are celebrated  see note 2  it turned out that the men had all arranged to fire their holes at the same hour and assemble in a lower level to take lunch or as they term it kroust while the smoke should clear away  this rendered it impossible for the captain to take his young companion further into the workings at that part of the mine so they contented themselves with a chat with the men  these sat down in a row and each man unrolling a parcel containing a pasty or a thick lump of cake with currants in it commenced the demolition thereof with as much zeal as had previously been displayed in the demolition of the rock  this frugal fare was washed down with water drawn from little flat barrels or canteens while they commented lightly grumblingly or laughingly according to temperament on the poor condition of the lode at which they wrought we have already said that in mining as in other things fortune fluctuates and it was hard times with the men of botallack at that period  before they had proceeded far with their meal one of the palefaced men began to cough  smokes acoming down he said  we shall ave to move then observed another  the pouring in of gunpowder smoke here set two or three more acoughing and obliged them all to rise and seek for purerperhaps it were better to say less impureair in another part of the level where the draught kept the smoke away  here squatting down on heaps of wet rubbish and sticking their candles against the damp walls they continued their meal and here the captain and oliver left them retraced their steps to the foot of the shaft and began the ascent to the surface or in mining parlance began to return to grass  up up upthe process now was reversed and the labour increased tenfold  up they went on these nearly perpendicular and interminable ladders slowly for they had a long journey before them cautiously for oliver had a tendency to butt his head against beams and knock his candle out of shape carefully for the rounds of the ladders were wet and slimy and a slip of foot or hand might in a moment have precipitated them into the black gulf below and pantingly for strength of limb and lung could not altogether defy the influence of such a prolonged and upright climb  if oliver trembath felt while descending as though he should never reach the bottom he felt far more powerfully as if reaching the top were an event of the distant futureall the more that the muscles of his arms and legs unused to the peculiar process were beginning to feel rather stiff  this feeling however soon passed away and when he began to grow warm to the work his strength seemed to return and to increase with each stepa species of revival of vigour in the midst of hard toil with which probably all strong men are acquainted  up they went ladder after ladder squeezing through narrow places rubbing against wet rocks and beams scraping against the boarding of the kibbleshaft and being scraped by the pumprods until both of them were as wet and red and dirty as any miner below  as he advanced oliver began to take note of the places he had passed on the way down and so much had he seen and thought during his sojourn underground that when he reached the level where he first came upon the noisy kibbles and made acquaintance with the labouring pumprod he almost hailed the spot as an old familiar landmark of other days  a circumstance occurred just then which surprised him not a little and tended to fix this locality still more deeply on his memory  while he was standing in the level waiting until the captain should relight and trim his much and oft bruised candle the kibbles began their noisy motion  this was nothing new now but at the same time the shout of distant voices was heard as if the gnomes held revelry in their dreary vaults  they drew gradually nearer and oliver could distinguish laughter mingled with the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps  foolish lads ejaculated captain dan with a smile and an expression that proved he took some interest in the folly whatever it might be  what is it inquired oliver  they are racing to the kibble  look and you shall see replied the other  just then a man who had outrun his comrades appeared at the place where the level joined the shaft just opposite  almost at the same moment the kibble appeared flying upwards  the miner leaped upon it caught and clung to the chain as it passed and shouted a defiant adieu to his less fortunate comrades who arrived just in time to witness him disappear upwards in this rapid manner to grass  thats the way the young ones risk their lives said the captain shaking his head remonstratively if that young fellow had missed the kibble he would have been dashed to pieces at the bottom of the shaft  again captain dan said foolish lads and shook his head so gravely that oliver could not help regarding him with the respect due to a sedate fatherly sort of man but oliver was young and unsophisticated and did not know at the time that the captain had himself been noted in his youth as an extremely reckless and daring fellow and that a considerable spice of the daring remained in him still  diverging to the right at this point captain dan led oliver to an old part of the mine where there were a couple of men opening up and extending one of the old levels  their progress here was very different from what it had been  evidently the former miners had not thought it worth their while to open up a wide passage for themselves and oliver found it necessary to twist his broad shoulders into all sorts of positions to get them through  the first level they came to in this part was not more than three feet high at the entrance  a man cant hold his head very high here sir said his guide  truly no it is scarce high enough for my legs to walk in without any body above them said oliver  however lead the way and i will follow  the captain stooped and made his way through a winding passage where the roof was so low in many places that they were obliged to bend quite double and the back and neck of the young doctor began to feel the strain very severely  there were however a few spots where the roof rose a little affording temporary relief  presently they came to the place where the men were at work  the ground was very soft here the men were cutting through soft granitea condition of the stone which oliver confessed he had never expected to see  here the lights burned very badly  what can be the matter with it said oliver stopping for the third time to trim the wick of his candle  captain dan smiled as he said you asked me last night to take you into one of the levels where the air was badnow here you are with the air so bad that the candle will hardly burn  it will be worse before night  but i feel no disagreeable sensation said oliver  possibly not because you are not quite so sensitive as the flame of a candle but if you remain here a few hours it will tell upon you  here are the men you can ask them  the two men were resting when they approached  one was old the other middleaged  both were hearty fellows and communicative  the old one especially was ruddy in complexion and pretty strong  you look well for an old miner said oliver what may be your age  about sixty sur  indeed you are a notable exception to the rule  how comes it that you look so fresh  cant say sur replied the old man with a peculiar smile few miners live to my time of life much less do they go underground  praps its because i neither drink nor smoke  tom there now he added pointing to his comrade with his thumb he aint forty yit but hes so pale as a ghost though he is strong nuff  and do you neither drink nor smoke tom inquired oliver  well sur i both smokes and drinks but i do take em in moderation said tom  are you married asked oliver turning again to the old man  iss got a wife at hum an had six childn  dont you find this bad air tell on your health he continued  iss sur  after six or seven hours i do feel my head like to split an my stummik as if it wor on fire but what can us do we must live you knaw  bidding these men goodbye the captain and oliver went down to another level and then along a series of low galleries in some of which they had to advance on their hands and knees and in one of them particularly the accumulation of rubbish was so great and the roof so low that they could only force a passage through by wriggling along at full length like snakes  beyond this they found a miner and a little boy at work and here captain dan pointed out to his companion that the lodes of copper and tin were rich  glittering particles on the walls and drops of water hanging from points and crevices with the green purple and yellow colours around combined to give the place a brilliant metallic aspect  youd better break off a piece of ore here said captain dan  oliver took a chisel and hammer from the miner and applying them to the rock spent five minutes in belabouring it with scarcely any result  if it were not that i fear to miss the chisel and hit my knuckles he said i think i could work more effectively  as he spoke he struck with all his force and brought down a large piece a chip of which he carried away as a memorial of his underground ramble  the man is going to fire the hole said captain dan youd better wait and see it  the hole was sunk nearly two feet deep diagonally behind a large mass of rock that projected from the side of the level  it was charged with gunpowder and filled up with tamping or pounded granite then the miner lighted the fuse and hastened away giving the usual signal fire  the others followed him to a safe distance and awaited the result  in a few minutes there was a loud report a bright blinding flash and a concussion of the air which extinguished two of the candles  immediately a crash followed as the heavy mass of rock was torn from its bed and hurled to the ground  thats the way we raise tin and copper said captain dan now doctor we had better return if you would not be left in darkness for our candles are getting low  did you ever travel underground in the dark inquired oliver  not often but i have done it occasionally  once in particular i went down the main shaft in the dark and gave a miner an awful fright i had to go down in haste at the time and not having a candle at hand besides being well acquainted with the way i hurried down in the dark it so chanced that a man named sampy had got his light put out when about to ascend the shaft and as he also was well acquainted with the way he did not take the trouble to relight  there was a good deal of noise in consequence of the pump being at work  when i had got about halfway down i put my foot on something that felt soft  instantly there was uttered a tremendous yell and my legs at the same moment were seized by something from below  my heart almost jumped out of my mouth at this but as the yell was repeated it flashed across me i must have trod on some ones fingers so i lifted my foot at once and then a voice which i knew to be that of sampy began to wail and lament miserably  hope i havent hurt ee sampy said i  aw dear aw dear aw my dear was all that poor sampy could reply  let us go up my son said i and well strike a light  so up we went to the next level where i got hold of the poor lads candle and lighted it  aw my dear said sampy looking at his fingers with a rueful countenance thee have scat em all in jowds  pray interrupted oliver what may be the meaning of scat em all in jowds  broke em all in pieces replied captain dan but he was wrong for no bones were broken and the fingers were all right again in the course of a few days  sampy got a tremendous fright however and he was never known to travel underground without a light after that  continuing to retrace their steps captain dan and oliver made for the main shaft  on the way they came to another of those immense empty spaces where a large lode had been worked away and nothing left in the dark narrow void but the short beams which had supported the working stages of the men  here oliver looking down through a hole at his feet saw several men far below him  they were at work on the end in three successive tiersabove each others heads  youve seen two of these men before said captain dan  have i  yes they are local preachers  the last time you saw the upper one said captain dan with a smile you were seated in the wesleyan chapel and he was in the pulpit dressed like a gentleman and preaching as eloquently as if he had been educated at college and trained for the ministry  i should like very much to go down and visit them said oliver  tis a difficult descent  there are no ladders  will your head stand stepping from beam to beam and can you lower yourself by a chain  ill try said oliver  without more words captain dan left the platform on which they had been walking and descending through a hole led his companion by the most rugged way he had yet attempted  sometimes they slid on their heels down places that oliver would not have dreamed of attempting without a guide at other times they stepped from beam to beam with unknown depths below them  have a care here sir said the captain pausing before a very steep place  i will go first and wait for you  so saying he seized a piece of old rusty chain that was fastened into the rock and swung himself down  then looking up he called to oliver to follow  the young doctor did so and having cautiously lowered himself a few yards he reached a beam where he found the captain holding up his candle and regarding him with some anxiety  captain dan appeared as if suspended in midair  opposite to him in the distance the two local preachers were hard at work with hammer and chisel while far below a miner could be seen coming along the next level and pushing an iron truck full of ore before him  a few more steps and slides and then a short ascent and oliver stood beside the man who had preached the previous sunday  he worked with another miner and was red ragged and halfclad like all the rest and the perspiration was pouring over his face which was streaked with slime  very unlike was he at that time to the gentlemanly youth who had held forth from the pulpit  oliver had a long chat with him and found that he aspired to enter the ministry and had already passed some severe examinations  he was selftaught having procured the loan of books from his minister and some friends who were interested in him his language and manners were those of a gentleman yet he had had no advantages beyond his fellows  my friend there sir also hopes to enter the ministry said the miner pointing as he spoke to a gap between the boards on which he stood  oliver looked down and there beheld a stalwart young man about a couple of yards under his feet wielding a hammer with tremendous vigour  his light linen coat was open displaying his bared and muscular bosom  what is he a local preacher also  he is sir said the miner with a smile  oliver immediately descended to the stage below and had a chat with this man also after which he left them at their work wondering very much at the intelligence and learning displayed by them for he remembered that in their sermons they had without notes without hesitation and without a grammatical error entered into the most subtle metaphysical reasoning rather too much of it indeed and had preached with impassioned perhaps too impassioned eloquence quoting poets and prose writers ancient and modern with the facility of good scholarswhile they urged men and women to repent and flee to christ with all the fervour of men thoroughly in earnest  on the other hand he knew that their opportunities for selfeducation were not great and that they had to toil in the meantime for daily bread at the rate of about 3 pounds a month  following captain dan oliver soon reached the ladderway  while slowly and in silence ascending the ladders they heard a sound of music above them  men coming down to work singing said the captain as they stood on a crossbeam to listen  the sounds at first were very faint and inexpressibly sweet  by degrees they became more distinct and oliver could distinguish several voices singing in harmony keeping time to the slow measured tread of their descending steps  there seemed a novelty and yet a strange familiarity in the strains as they were wafted softly down upon his ear until they drew near and the starlike candles of the miners became visible  their manly voices then poured forth in full strength the glorious psalmtune called french which is usually sung in scotland to the beautiful psalm beginning i to the hills will lift mine eyes  the men stopped abruptly on encountering their captain and the stranger exchanging a few words with the former they stood aside on the beams to let them pass  a little boy came last  his small limbs were as active as those of his more stalwart comrades and he exhibited no signs of fatigue  his treble voice too was heard high and tuneful among the others as they continued their descent and resumed the psalm  the sweet strains retired gradually and faded in the depths below as they had first stolen on the senses from above and the pleasant memory of them still remained with the young doctor when he emerged from the mine through the hole at the head of the shaft and stood once more in the blessed sunshine    note 1  reader allow us to remark that this is a fact  indeed we may say here once for all that all the important statements and incidents in this tale are facts or founded on facts with considerable modification but without intentional exaggeration  note 2  it has been stated to us recently by a volunteer officer that at battalion parade when companies were equalised in numbers the companies formed by the men of st just required about four paces more space to stand upon than the other volunteers  no one who visits a st just miner at his underground toil will require to ask the reason why    chapter nine  treats of difficulties to be overcome  one afternoon a councilwe may appropriately say of warwas held in st just  the scene of the council was the shop of maggot the blacksmith and the members of it were a number of miners the president being the worthy smith himself who with a sledgehammer under his arm in the position of a short crutch occupied the chair if we may be allowed so to designate the raised hearth of the forge  the war with poverty had not been very successfully waged of late and at the time of which we write the enemy had apparently given the miners a severe check in the way of putting what appeared to be an insuperable obstacle in their path  now lads said maggot with a slap on the leathern apron that covered his knees this is the way on it an do ee be quiet and hould yer tongues while i do spaik  the other men of whom there were nearly a dozen nodded and said go on booy thees knaw tin sure by which expression they affirmed their belief that the blacksmith was a very knowing fellow  you do tell me that youve come so close to water that youre fraid to go on  is that so  iss iss responded the others  well ill hole into the house ef you do agree to give un a good pitch said maggot  agreed one and all cried the miners  in order that the reader may understand the drift of this conversation it is necessary to explain that the indefatigable miner david trevarrow whom we have already introduced in his submarine workshop had according to his plan changed his ground and transferred his labour to a more hopeful part of the mine  for some time previous the men had been at work on a lode which was very promising but they were compelled to cease following it because it approached the workings of an old part of the mine which was known to be full of water  to tap this old part or as the miners expressed it to hole into this house of water was they were well aware an exceedingly dangerous operation  the part of the mine to which we allude was not under the sea but back a little from the shore and was not very deep at that time  the aditor waterconductinglevel by which the spot was reached commenced at the cliffs on a level with the seashore and ran into the interior until it reached the old mine about a quarter of a mile inland  here was situated the house which was neither more nor less than a number of old shafts and levels filled with water  as they had approached the old mine its near proximity was made disagreeably evident by the quantity of moisture that oozed through the crevices in the rocksmoisture which ere long took the form of a number of tiny rillsand at last began to spirt out from roof and sides in such a way that the miners became alarmed and hesitated to continue to work in a place where they ran the most imminent risk of being suddenly drowned and swept into the sea by the bursting of the rocks that still withstood the immense pressure of the confined water  it was at this point in the undertaking that david trevarrow went to examine the place and made the discovery of a seama keenly lode which had such a promising appearance that the anxiety of the miners to get rid of this obstructive house was redoubled  it was at this point too that the council of which we write was held in order to settle who should have the undesirable privilege of constituting the forlorn hope in their subterranean assault  maggot who was known to be one of the boldest and at the same time one of the most utterly reckless men in st just was appealed to in the emergency and as we have seen offered to attack the enemy singlehanded on condition that the miners should give him a pitch of the good lode they had foundthat is give him the right to work out a certain number of fathoms of ore for himself  they agreed to this but one of them expressed some doubt as to maggots courage being equal to the occasion  to this remark maggot vouchsafed no other reply than a frown but his friend and admirer john cock exclaimed in supreme contemptwhat maggot afeard to do it aw my dear hould tha tongue  but he havent bin to see the place urged the previous speaker  no my son said maggot turning on the man with a look of pity but he can go an see it  come lads lev us go an see this place of danger  the miners rose at once as maggot threw his forehammer on a heap of coals put on his hat and strode out of the forge with a reckless fling  a few minutes sufficed to bring them to the beach at the mouth of the adit  it was a singularly wild spot close under those precipitous cliffs on which some of the picturesque buildings of botallack mine are percheda sort of narrow inlet or gorge which from its form is named the narrow zawn  there was nothing worthy of the name of a beach at the place save a little piece of rugged ground near the adit mouth which could be reached only by a zigzag path on the face of the almost perpendicular precipice  arrived here each man lighted a candle wrapped the customary piece of wet clay round the middle of it and entered the narrow tunnel  they advanced in single file james penrose leading  the height of the adit permitted of their walking almost upright but the irregularity of the cuttings rendered it necessary that they should advance carefully with special regard to their heads  in about a quarter of an hour they reached a comparatively open spacethat is to say there were several extensions of the cutting in various directions which gave the place the appearance of being a small cavern instead of a narrow tunnel here the water which in other parts of the adit flowed along the bottom ran down the walls and spirted in fine streams from the almost invisible crevices of the rock thus betraying at once the proximity and the power of the pentup water  what thinkee now my son asked an elderly man who stood at maggots elbow  after a short pause during which he sternly regarded the rocks before him the smith replied ill do it in the tone and with the air of a man who knows that what he has made up his mind to do is not childs play  the question being thus settled the miners retraced their steps and went to their several homes  entering his cottage the smith found his little girl grace busily engaged in the interesting process of nursing the baby  he seated himself in a chair by the fireside smoked his pipe and watched the process while his wife busied herself in preparing the evening meal  oh but the little maggot was a big babya worthy representative of his fathera true chip of the old block for he was not only fat riotous and muscular but very reckless and extremely positive  his little nurse on the contrary was gentle and delicate not much bigger than the baby although a good deal older and she had a dreadful business of it to keep him in order  all her efforts at lifting and restraining him were somewhat akin to the exertion made by wrestlers to throw each other by main force and her intense desire to make baby maggot be good was repaid by severe kicks on the shins and sundry dabs in the face with luckily a soft fat pair of fists  sit ee quiet now or ill scat oo nose said the little nurse suddenly with a terrible frown  it need scarcely be said that she had not the remotest intention of carrying out this dreadful threat to smash the little maggots nose she accompanied it however with a twist that suddenly placed the urchin in a sitting posture much to his own surprise for he opened his eyes very wide drew his breath sharply and appeared to meditate a roar  he thought better of it however and relapsed into goodness just as the door opened and david trevarrow entered  oh uncle david cried little grace jumping up and running towards him do help me nuss baby  whats the matter with the cheeldbad eh  fetch un to me and ill cure him  there was no necessity to fetch baby for that obstreperous individual entertained an immense regard for unkil day and was already on his fat legs staggering across the floor to him with outstretched arms thereafter he only required a pair of wings to make him a complete cherub  little grace relieved of her charge at once set to work to assist her mother in household matters  she was one of those dear little earnest creatures who of their own accord act in a motherly and wifely way from their early years  to look at little graces serious thoroughgoing face when she chanced to pause in the midst of work and meditate what was to be done next one might imagine that the entire care of the household had suddenly devolved upon her shoulders  in the matter of housewifery little grace was almost equal to big grace her respected mother in downright honesty and truthfulness she greatly excelled her  the description of maggots household on that evening would be very incomplete were we to omit mention of zackey maggot  that young man for man he deemed himself and man he was in all respects except the trifling matters of years size and whiskersthat young man entered the room with his uncle and without deigning to change his wet red garments sat him down at his fathers feet and caught hold of a small black kitten which at the time lay sound asleep on the hearth and began to play with it in a grave patronising way as though his taking notice of it at all were a condescension  that black kitten or chet as it was usually styled was accustomed to be strangled the greater part of the morning by the baby  most of the afternoon it was worried by zackey and during the intervals of torment it experienced an unusually large measure of the vicissitudes incident to kitten lifesuch as being kicked out of the way by maggot senior or thrown or terrified out of the way by mrs maggot or dashed at by stray dogs or yelled at by passing boys  the only sunshine of its life which was at all times liable to be suddenly clouded was when it slept or when little grace put it on her soft neck tickled its chin and otherwise soothed its ruffled spirit as only a loving heart knows how  a bad memory seemed to be that kittens chief blessing  a horror of any kind was no sooner past than it was straightway forgotten and the facetious animal would advance with arched back and glaring eyes in defiance of an incursive hen or twirl in mad hopeless career after its own miserable tail  tis a keenly lode said maggot puffing his pipe thoughtfully  iss assented david trevarrow also puffing his pipe at the clouds issuing from which baby gazed with endless amazement and admiration its worth much but it isnt worth your life  sure i aint goin to give my life fort replied maggot  but youre goin to risk it said david an you shouldnt for youve a wife an childn to provide for  now i tell ee what it is you lev it to me  ill hole to the house  it dont matter much what happens to me  no ee wont said maggot stoutly what i do promise to do i will do  but if you die said david  well what if i do we have all to come to that some day sooner or later  are you prepared to die asked trevarrow earnestly  now david dont ee trouble me with that  tis all very well for the women an childn but it dont suit me it dont so lev us have no more of it booy  ill do it tomorrow thats fixed so now well have a bit supper  the tone in which maggot said this assured david that further conversation would be useless so he dropped the subject and sat down with the rest of the family to their evening meal    chapter ten  shows how maggot made a desperate venture and what flowed from it  a wilful man must have his way is a proverb the truth of which was illustrated by the blacksmith on the following day  david trevarrow again attempted to dissuade him from his purpose and reiterated his offer to go in his stead but he failed to move him mrs maggot essayed and added tears to her suasion as also did little grace but they failed toothe obdurate man would not give way  the only one of his household who did not attempt to dissuade him excepting of course the baby who cared nothing whatever about the matter was zackey  that urchin not only rejoiced in the failure of the others to turn his father from his purpose but pleaded hard to be allowed to go with him and share his danger as well as glory  this however was peremptorily denied to the young aspirant to fame and a premature death by drowning in a dark hole  early in the forenoon maggot and his friends proceeded to the shore where they found a number of miners and others assembled near the adit mouthamong them our hero oliver trembath mr donnithorne and mr cornish at that time the purser and manager of botallack mine  the latter gentleman accosted maggot as he came forward and advised him to be cautious  of course the smith gave every assurance that was required of him and immediately prepared himself to make the dangerous experiment  supplying himself with a number of tallow candles a mining hammer and other tools maggot stripped to the waist and jestingly bidding his friends farewell entered the mouth of the tunnel and disappeared  the adit level or tunnel through which he had to pass to the scene of his operations was as we have said about a quarter of a mile in length about six feet high and two and a half feet wide  it varied in dimensions here and there however and was rough and irregular throughout  for the first hundred yards or so maggot could see well enough to grope his way by the daylight which streamed in at the entrance of the adit but beyond this point all was intense darkness so here he stopped and striking a light by means of flint steel and tinder lit one of his candles  this he attached to a piece of wet clay in the usual fashion except that he placed the clay at the lower end of the candle instead of round the middle of it  he then stuck it against the rock a little above the level of his head  lighting another candle he advanced with it in his hand  walking or rather wading onward for the stream was ankledeep far enough to be almost beyond the influence of the first candle he stopped again and stuck up another  thus at intervals he placed candles along the entire length of the adit so that he might have light to guide him in his race from the water which he hoped to set free  this precaution was necessary because although he meant to carry a candle in his hat all the time there was a possibilitynay a strong probabilitythat it would be blown or drowned out  little more than a quarter of an hour brought him to the scene of his intended adventure  here he found the water spirting out all round much more violently than it had been the day before  he did not waste much time in consideration having made up his mind on the previous visit as to which part of the rock he would drive the hole through sticking his last candle therefore against the driest part of the wall that could be found he seized his tools and commenced work  we have already said that maggot was a strong man  as he stood there naked to the waist holding the borer with his left hand and plying the hammer with all his might with the other his great breadth of shoulder and development of muscle were finely displayed by the candlelight which fell in brilliant gleams on parts of his frame while the rest of him was thrown into shadow so deep that it would have appeared black but for the deeper shade by which it was surroundedthe whole scene presenting a grand rembrandt effect  it is unnecessary to say that maggot wrought with might and main excited somewhat by the novelty and danger of his undertaking he felt relieved by the violence of his exertion  he knew besides that the candles which were to light him on his return were slowly but surely burning down  blow after blow resounded through the place incessantly when the smiths right arm felt a very little weariedit was too powerful to be soon or greatly exhaustedhe shifted the hammer to his left hand and so the work went on  suddenly and unexpectedly the borer was driven to its head into the hole by a tremendous blow  the rock behind it had given way  almost at the same instant a large mass of rock burst outwards followed by a stream of water so thick and violent that it went straight at the opposite side of the cavern against which it burst in white foam  this rebounding back and around rushed against roof and sides with such force that the whole place was at once deluged  maggot was knocked down at the first gush but leaped up and turned to fly  of course both candlesthat in his hat as well as that which he had affixed to the wallwere extinguished and he was at once plunged in total darkness for the rays of the next light although visible were too feeble to penetrate with any effect to the extremity of the adit  blinded by rushing water and confused by his fall the smith mistook his direction and ran against the side of the level with such violence that he fell again but his sturdy frame withstood the shock and once more he sprang to his feet and leaped along the narrow tunnel with all the energy of desperation  well was it for maggot at that hour that his heart was bold and his faculties cool and collected else then and there his career had ended bending forward and stooping low he bounded away like a hunted deer but the rush of water was so great that it rapidly gained on him and by concealing the uneven places in the path caused him to stumble  his relay of candles served him in good stead nevertheless despite their light and his own caution he more than once narrowly missed dashing out his brains on the low roof  on came the water after the fugitive a mighty hissing vaulting torrent filling the level behind and leaping up on the man higher and higher as he struggled and floundered on for life  quickly and before quarter of the distance to the adit mouth was traversed it gurgled up to his waist swept him off his legs and hurled him against projecting rocks  once and again did he succeed in regaining his foothold but in a moment or two the rising flood swept him down and hurled him violently onward sporting with him on its foaming crest until it disgorged him at last and cast him stunned bruised and bleeding on the seashore  of course the unfortunate mans friends had waited for him with some impatience and great was their anxiety when the first of the flood made its appearance  when immediately after the battered form of their comrade was flung on the beach they ran forward and bore him out of the stream  oliver trembath being on the spot maggot wae at once attended to and his wounds bound up  hell do hes all right said oliver on completing the workonly got a few cuts and bruises and lost a little blood but that wont harm him  the expression of anxiety that had appeared on the faces of those who stood around at once vanished on hearing these reassuring words  i knawd it said john cock energetically  i knawd he couldnt be killednot he  i trust that you may be right oliver said old mr donnithorne looking with much concern on the pale countenance of the poor smith who still lay stretched out with only a slight motion of the chest to prove that the vital spark had not been altogether extinguished  no fear of him hes sure to come round replied oliver come lads up with him on your backs  he raised the smiths shoulder as he spoke  three tall and powerful miners promptly lent their aid and maggot was raised shoulderhigh and conveyed up the steep winding path that led to the top of the cliff  it would never do to lose maggot murmured mr donnithorne as if speaking to himself while he followed the procession beside mr cornish hes far too good a  a smugglereh interrupted the purser with a laugh  eh ah did i say smuggler cried mr donnithorne surely not for of all vices that of smuggling is one of the worst unless it be an overfondness for the bottle  i meant to have said that he is too valuable a man for st just to losein many ways and you know mr cornish that he is a famous wrestlera man of whom st just may be justly proud  mr donnithorne cast a sly glance at his companion whom he knew to be partial to the ancient cornish pastime of wrestling  indeed if report said truly the worthy purser had himself in his youthful days been a celebrated amateur wrestler one who had never been thrown even although he had on more than one occasion been induced in a frolic to enter the public ring and measure his strength with the best men that could be brought against him  he was long past the time of life when men indulge in such rough play but his tall commanding figure and huge chest and shoulders were quite sufficient to warrant the belief that what was said of him was possible while the expression of his fine massive countenance and the humorous glance of his clear black eye bore evidence that it was highly probable  twould be foul injustice said the purser with a quiet laugh if i were to deny that maggot is a good man and true in the matter of wrestling nevertheless he is an arrant rogue and defrauds the revenue woefully  but after all he is only the catspaw those who employ him are the real sinnerseh mr donnithorne  surely surely replied the old gentleman with much gravity and it is to be hoped that this accident will have the effect of turning maggot from his evil ways  the purser could not refrain from a laugh at the hypocritical solemnity of the old gentleman who was he well knew one of the very sinners whom he condemned with such righteous indignation but their arrival at maggots cottage prevented further conversation on the subject at that time  mrs maggot although a good deal agitated when her husbands almost inanimate and bloody form was carried in and laid on the bed was by no means overcome with alarm  she like the wives of st just miners generally was too well accustomed to hear of accidents and to see their results to give way to wild fears before she had learned the extent of her calamity so when she found that it was not serious she dried her eyes and busied herself in attending to all the little duties which the occasion required  little grace too although terribly frightened and very pale was quite selfpossessed and went about the house assisting her mother ably despite the tendency to sob which she found it very difficult to overcome  but the baby behaved in the most shameful and outrageous manner  his naughtiness is almost indescribable  the instant the door opened and his fathers bloody face was presented to view baby set up a roar so tremendous that a number of dogs in the neighbourhood struck in with a loud chorus and the black kitten startled out of an innocent slumber rushed incontinently under the bed faced about and fuffed in impotent dismay  but not only did baby roarhe also fell on the floor and kicked thereby rendering his noise exasperating besides exposing his fat person to the risk of being trod upon  zackey was therefore told off as a detachment to keep this enemy in check a duty which he performed nobly until his worthy father was comfortably put to bed after which the friends retired and left the smith to the tender care of his own family  he has done good service anyhow observed mr donnithorne to his nephew as he parted from him that evening for he has cleared the mine of water that it would have cost hundreds of pounds and many months to pump out    chapter eleven  shows that music hath charms and also that it sometimes has disadvantages  one morning not long after his arrival at st just the young doctor went out to make a round of professional visits  he had on his way to pass the cottage of his uncle which stood a little apart from the chief square or triangle of the town and had a small piece of ground in front  here rose was wont to cultivate her namesakes and other flowers with her own fair hands and here mr thomas donnithorne refreshed himself each evening with a pipe of tobacco the flavour of which was inexpressibly enhanced to him by the knowledge that it had been smuggled  he was in the habit of washing the taste of the same away each night before retiring to rest with a glass of brandy and water hot which was likewise improved in flavour by the same interesting association  the windows of the cottage were wide open for no atlantic fog dimmed the glory of the summer sun that morning and the light air that came up from the mighty sea was fresh and agreeably cool  as oliver approached the end of the cottage he observed that rose was not at her accustomed work in the garden and he was about to pass the door when the tones of a guitar struck his ear and arrested his step he was surprised for at that period the instrument was not much used and the outoftheway town of st just was naturally the last place in the land where he would have expected to meet with one  no air was playedonly a few chords were lightly touched by fingers which were evidently expert  presently a female voice was heard to sing in rich contralto tones  the air was extremely simple and very beautifulat least so thought oliver as he leaned against a wall and listened to the words  these also were simple enough but sounded both sweet and sensible to the listener coming as they did from a womans lips so tunefully and sounding the praises of the sea of which he was passionately fond    song    i love the land where acres broad   are clothed in yellow grain   where cot of thrall and lordly hall   lie scattered oer the plain   oh  i have trod the velvet sod   beneath the beechwood tree   and roamed the brake by stream and lake   where peace and plenty be   but more than plain   or rich domain   i love the bright blue sea    i love the land where bracken grows   and heathclad mountains rise   where peaks still fringed with winter snows   tower in the summer skies   oh  i have seen the red and green   of fir and rowan tree   and heard the din of flooded linn   with bleating on the lea   but better still   than heathclad hill   i love the stormy sea  the air ceased and oliver stepping in at the open door found rose ellis with a spanish guitar resting on her knee  she neither blushed nor started up nor looked confusedwhich was of course very strange of her in the circumstances seeing that she is the heroine of this talebut rising with a smile on her pretty mouth shook hands with the youth  why cousin said oliver i had no idea you could sing so charmingly  i am fond of singing said rose  so am i especially when i hear such singing as yours and the song tooi like it much for it praises the sea  where did you pick it up  i got it from the composer a young midshipman said rose sadly at the same time a slight blush tinged her brow  oliver felt a peculiar sensation which he could not account for and was about to make further inquiries into the authorship of the song when it occurred to him that this would be impolite and might be awkward so he asked instead how she had become possessed of so fine a guitar  before she could reply mr donnithorne entered  how dee do oliver lad going your roundsehcome rose lets have breakfast lass you were not wont to be behind with it  ill be bound this gay gallantthis hedgejumper with his eyes shuthas been praising your voice and puffing up your heart but dont believe him rose its the fashion of these fellows to tell lies on such matters  you do me injustice uncle said oliver with a laugh but even if it were true that i am addicted to falsehood in praising women it were impossible in the present instance to give way to my propensity for truth herself would find it difficult to select an expression sufficiently appropriate to apply to the beautiful voice of rose ellis  heyday young man exclaimed mr donnithorne as he carefully filled his pipe with precious weed your oratorical powers are uncommon surely thy talents had been better bestowed in the church or at the bar than in the sickroom or the hospital  demosthenes himself would have paled before thee ladthough if truth must be told there is a dash more sound than sense in thine eloquence  sense uncle  surely your own good sense must compel you to admit that rose sings splendidly  well i wont gainsay it replied mr donnithorne now that rose has left the room for i dont much care to bespatter folk with too much praise to their faces  the child has indeed a sweet pipe of her own by the way you were asking about her guitar when i came in ill tell you about that  its history is somewhat curious said mr donnithorne passing his fingers through the bunch of gay ribbons that hung from the head of the instrument  you have heard i dare say of the burning of penzance by the spaniards more than two hundred years ago in the year 1595 i think it was  i have answered oliver but i know nothing beyond the fact that such an event took place  i should like to hear the details of it exceedingly  well continued the old gentleman our country was as you know at war with spain at the time but it no more entered into the heads of cornishmen that the spaniards would dare to land on our shores than that the giants would rise from their graves  there was indeed an old prediction that such an event would happen but the prediction was either forgotten or not believed so that when several spanish galleys suddenly made their appearance in mounts bay and landed about two hundred men near mousehole the inhabitants were taken by surprise before they could arm and defend themselves the spaniards effected a landing began to devastate the country and set fire to the adjacent houses  it is false continued the old man sternly to say as has been said by some that the men of mousehole were seized with panic and that those of newlyn and penzance deserted their houses terrorstricken  the truth is that the suddenness of the attack and their unprepared condition to repel it threw the people into temporary confusion and forced them to retreat as all history shows us the best and bravest will do at times  in mousehole the principal inhabitant was killed by a cannonball so that deprived of their leading spirit at the critical moment when a leader was necessary it is no wonder that at first the fishermen were driven back by wellarmed men trained to act in concert to fire the houses was the work of a few minutes  the spaniards then rushed on to newlyn and penzance and fired these places also after which they returned to their ships intending to land the next day and renew their work of destruction  but that night was well spent by the enraged townsmen  they organised themselves as well as they could in the circumstances and when day came attacked the spaniards with guns and bows and that so effectively that the dons were glad to hoist their sails and run out of the bay  well you must know there was one of the spaniards who it has been said either from bravado or vanity or a desire to insult the english or from all three motives together brought a guitar on shore with him at mousehole and sang and played to his comrades while they were burning the houses  this man left his guitar with those who were left to guard the boats and accompanied the others to penzance  on his return he again took his guitar and going up to a high point of the cliff so that he might be seen by his companions and heard by any of the english who chanced to be in hiding near the place sang several songs of defiance at the top of his voice and even went the length of performing a spanish dance to the great amusement of his comrades below who were embarking in their boats  while the halfcrazed spaniard was going on thus he little knew that not three yards distant from him a gigantic mousehole fisherman who went by the name of gurnet lay concealed among some low bushes watching his proceedings with an expression of anger on his big stern countenance  when the boats were nearly ready to start the spaniard descended from the rocky ledge on which he had been performing intending to rejoin his comrades  he had to pass round the bush where gurnet lay concealed and in doing so was for a few seconds hid from his comrades who immediately forgot him in the bustle of departure or if they thought of him at all each boats crew imagined no doubt that he was with one of the others  but he never reached the boats  as he passed the bush gurnet sprang on him like a tiger and seized him round the throat with both hands choking a shout that was coming up and causing his eyes to start almost out of his head  without uttering a word and only giving now and then a terrible hiss through his clenched teeth gurnet pushed the spaniard before him keeping carefully out of sight of the beach and holding him fast by the nape of the neck so that when he perceived the slightest symptom of a tendency to cry out he had only to press his strong fingers and effectually nip it in the bud  he led him to a secluded place among the rocks far beyond earshot of the shore and there setting him free pointed to a flat rock and to his guitar and hissed rather than said in tones that could neither be misunderstood nor gainsaid  there dance and sing will ee till ee bust  gurnet clenched his huge fist as he spoke and as the spaniard grew pale and hesitated he shook it close to his faceso close that he tapped the prominent bridge of the mans nose and hissed again more fiercely than before  ye haaf saved bucca ye mazed totle that can only frighten women an childn an burn housen theert fond o singin an dancindance now will ee ye gurt bufflehead or ef ye waant ill scat thee head in jowds an send ee scrougin over cliffs i will  in justice to the narrator it is right to say that these words are not so bad as they sound  the fishermans look and action were so terrible whilst he poured forth his wrath which was kept alive by the thought of the smouldering embers of his own cottage that the spaniard could not but obey  with a ludicrous compound of fun and terror he began to dance and sing or rather to leap and wail while gurnet stood before him with a look of grim ferocity that never for a moment relaxed  whenever the spaniard stopped from exhaustion gurnet shouted go on in a voice of thunder and the poor man being thoroughly terrified went on until he fell to the ground incapable of further exertion  up to this point gurnet had kept saying to himself he is fond o dancin an singin let un have it then but when the poor man fell his heart relented  he picked him up threw him across his shoulder as if he had been a bolster and bore him away  at first the men of the place wanted to hang him on the spot but gurnet claimed him as his prisoner and would not allow this  he gave him his liberty and the poor wretch maintained himself for many a day as a wandering minstrel at last he managed to get on board of a spanish vessel and was never more heard of but he left his guitar behind him  it was picked up on the shore where he left it probably in his haste to get away  the truth of this story of course i cannot vouch for concluded mr donnithorne with a smile but i have told it to you as nearly as possible in the words in which i have often heard my grandfather give itand as for the guitar why here it is having been sold to me by a descendant of the man who found it on the seashore  a wonderful story indeed said oliverif true  the guitar you must admit is at least a fact said the old gentleman  oliver not only admitted this but said it was a sweetsounding fact and was proceeding to comment further on the subject when mr donnithorne interrupted him  by the way talking of sweet sounds have you heard what that gruffvoiced scoundrel maggotthat roaring bull of bashanhas been about lately  no i have not said oliver who saw that the old gentlemans ire was rising  ha lad that man ought to be hanged  he is an arrant knave a smuggleraan ungrateful rascal  why sir youll scarcely believe it he has come to me and demanded more money for the jewels which he and his comrade sold me in fair and open bargain and because i refused and called him a few wellmerited names he has actually gone and given information against me as possessor of treasure which of right so they say belongs to government and last night i had a letter which tells me that the treasure as they call it must be delivered up without delay on pain of i dont know what penalties  penalties forsooth as if i hadnt been punished enough already by the harassing curtainlectures of my overscrupulous wife ever since the unlucky day when the baubles were found not to mention the uneasy probings of my own conscience which to say truth i had feared was dead altogether owing to the villainous moral atmosphere of this smuggling place but which i find quite lively and strong yeta matter of some consolation too for although i do have a weakness for cheap baccy and brandy being of an economical turn of mind i dont like the notion of getting rid of my conscience altogether  but man tis hard to bear  poor mr donnithorne stopped here partly owing to shortness of breath and partly because he had excited himself to a pitch that rendered coherent speech difficult  would it not be well at once to relieve your conscience sir suggested oliver respectfully by giving up the things that cause it pain  in my profession we always try to get at the root of a disease and apply our remedies there  ha exclaimed the old gentleman wiping his heated brow and lose twenty pounds as a sort of fee to doctor maggot who like other doctors i wot of created the disease himself and who will certainly never attempt to alleviate it by returning the fee  still the disease may be cured by the remedy i recommend said oliver  no man it cant cried the old gentleman with a perplexed expression because the dirty things are already sold and the money is invested in botallack shares to sell which and pay back the cash in the present depressed state of things would be utter madness  but hush here comes my better half and although she is a dear good soul with an unusual amount of wisdom for her size it would be injudicious to prolong the lectures of the night into the early hours of morning  as he spoke little mrs donnithornes round goodlooking face appeared like the rising sun in the doorway and her cheery voice welcomed oliver to breakfast  thank you aunt said oliver but i have already breakfasted more than an hour ago and am on my way to visit my patients  indeed i have to blame myself for calling at so early an hour and would not have done so but for the irresistible attraction of a newly discovered voice which  come come youngster interrupted mr donnithorne be pleased to bear in remembrance that the voice is connected with a pair of capital ears remarkable for their sharpness if not their length and at no great distance off i warrant  you do rose injustice observed mrs donnithorne as the voice at that moment broke out into a lively carol in the region of the kitchen whither its owner had gone to superintend culinary matters  but tell me oliver have you heard of the accident to poor batten  yes i saw him yesterday replied the doctor just after the accident happened and i am anxious about him  i fear though i am not quite certain that his eyesight is destroyed  dear dearoh poor man said mrs donnithorne whose sympathetic heart swelled while her blue eyes instantly filled with tears  it is so very sad oliver for his delicate wife and four young children are entirely dependent upon him and his two sonsand they found it difficult enough to make the two ends meet even when they were all in health for it is hard times among the miners at present as you know oliver and nowdear dear it is very very sad  little mrs donnithorne said nothing more at that time but her mind instantly reverted to a portly basket which she was much in the habit of carrying with her on her frequent visits to the poor and the sickfor the good lady was one of those whose inclinations as well as principles lead them to consider the poor  it must not be imagined however that the poor formed a large class of the community in st just  the miners of that district and indeed all over cornwall were and still are a selfreliant independent hardworking race and as long as tough thews and sinews and stout and willing hearts could accomplish anything they never failed to wrench a subsistence out of the stubborn rocks which contain the wealth of the land  begging goes very much against the grain of a cornishman and the lowest depth to which he can sink socially in his own esteem is that of being dependent on charity  in some cases this sentiment is carried too far and has degenerated into pride for when god in his wisdom sees fit by means of disabling accident or declining health to incapacitate a man from labour it is as honourable in him to receive charity as it is although not always sufficiently esteemed so a high privilege and luxury of the more fortunate to give  worthy mrs donnithornes charities were always bestowed with such delicacy that she managed in some mysterious way to make the recipients feel as though they had done her a favour in accepting them and yet she was not a soft piece of indiscriminating amiability whose chief delight in giving lay in the sensations which the act created within her own breast  by no means  none knew better than she when and where to give money and when to give blankets bread or tea  she was equally sharp to perceive the spirit that rendered it advisable for her to say i want you to do me a favourtheres a good woman now you wont refuse me etcetera and to detect the spirit that called forth the sharp remark accompanied with a dubious smile and a shake of her fat forefinger there now see that you make better use of it this time else i shall have to scold you  having received a message for poor mrs batten the miners wife the doctor left the cottage and proceeded to pay his visits  let us accompany him    chapter twelve  in which oliver gets a fall and sees some of the shadows of the miners life  in crossing a hayfield oliver trembath encountered the tall bluff figure and the grave sedate smile of mr cornish the manager  goodmorning doctor said the old gentleman extending his hand and giving the youth a grasp worthy of one of the old cornish giants do you know i was thinking as i saw you leap over the stile that you would make a pretty fair miner  thanks sir for your good opinion of me said oliver with a smile but i would rather work above than below ground  living the half of ones life beyond the reach of sunlight is not conducive to health  nevertheless the miners keep their health pretty well considering the nature of their work replied mr cornish and you must admit that many of them are stout fellows  you would find them so if you got one of their cornish hugs  perhaps said oliver with a modest look for he had been a noted wrestler at school i might give them a pretty fair hug in return for cornish blood flows in my veins  a fig for blood doctor it is of no avail without knowledge and practice as well as muscle  with these however i do acknowledge that it makes weightif by blood you mean high spirit  by the way how comes it sir said oliver that cornishmen are so much more addicted to wrestling than other englishmen  it were hard to tell doctor unless it be that they feel themselves stronger than other englishmen and being accustomed to violent exertion more than others they take greater pleasure in it  undoubtedly the greeks introduced it among us but whether they practised it as we now do cannot be certainly ascertained  here mr cornish entered into an enthusiastic account of the art of wrestling related many anecdotes of his own prowess in days gone by and explained the peculiar method of performing the throw by the heel the toe and the hip the heave forward the backheave and the cornish hug to all of which the youth listened with deep interest  i should like much to witness one of your wrestlingmatches he said when the old gentleman concluded for i cannot imagine that any of your peculiar cornish hugs or twists can be so potent as to overturn a stout fellow who is accustomed to wrestle in another fashion  can you show me one of the particular grips or twists that are said to be so effective  i think i can replied the old gentleman with a smile and a twinkle in his eye of course the style of grip and throw will vary according to the size of the man one has to deal with  give me hold of your wrist and plant yourself firmly on your legs  now you see you must turn the armso and use your toethus so as to lift your man and with a sudden twistthere  thats the way to do it said the old gentleman with a chuckle as he threw oliver head foremost into the middle of a haycock that lay opportunely near  it is hard to say whether mr cornish or oliver was most surprised at the result of the effortthe one that so much of his ancient prowess should remain and the other that he should have been so easily overthrown by one who although fully as large a man as himself had his joints and muscles somewhat stiffened by age  oliver burst into a fit of laughter on rising and exclaimed well done sir  you have effectually convinced me that there is something worth knowing in the cornish mode of wrestling although had i known what you were about to do it might not perhaps have been done so easily  i doubt it not said mr cornish with a laugh but that shows the value of science in such matters  goodmorning doctor  hope youll find your patients getting on well  he waved his hand as he turned off while oliver pursued his way to the miners cottages  the first he entered belonged to a man whose chest was slightly affected for the first time  he was a stout man about thirtyfive years of age and of temperate habitstook a little beer occasionally but never exceeded had a good appetite but had caught cold frequently in consequence of having to go a considerable distance from the shafts mouth to the changinghouse while exhausted with hard work underground and covered with profuse perspiration  often he had to do this in wet weather and when bitterly cold winds were blowingof late he had begun to spit blood  it is necessary here to remind the reader that matters in this respect and in reference to the condition of the miner generallyare now much improved  the changinghouses besides being placed as near to the several shafts as is convenient are now warmed with fires and supplied with watertroughs so that the men have a comfortable place in which to wash themselves on coming to grass and find their clothes thoroughly dried when they return in the morning to put them on before going underground  this renders them less liable to catch cold but of course does not protect them from the evil influences of climbing the ladders and of bad air  few men have to undergo such severe toil as the cornish miner because of the extreme hardness of the rock with which he has to deal  to be bathed in perspiration and engaged in almost unremitting and violent muscular exertion during at least eight hours of each day may be said to be his normal condition  oliver advised this man to give up underground work for some time and having prescribed for him and spoken encouragingly to his wife left the cottage to continue his rounds  several cases more or less similar to the above followed each other in succession also one or two cases of slight illness among the children which caused more alarm to the anxious mothers than there was any occasion for  these latter were quickly but goodnaturedly disposed of and the young doctor generally left a good impression behind him for he had a hearty though prompt manner and a sympathetic spirit  at one cottage he found a young man in the last stage of consumption he lay on his lowly bed pale and restlessalmost wishing for death to relieve him of his pains  his young wife sat by his bedside wiping the perspiration from his brow while a ruddycheeked little boy romped about the room unnoticedignorant that the hour was drawing near which would render him fatherless and his young mother a widow  this young man had been a daring highspirited fellow whose animal spirits led him into many a reckless deed  his complaint had been brought on by racing up the laddersa bloodvessel had given way and he had never rallied after  just as oliver was leaving him a wesleyan minister entered the dwelling  he wont be long with us doctor i fear he said in passing  not long sir replied oliver  his release will be a happy one said the minister for his soul rests on jesus but alas for his young wife and child  he passed into the sickroom and the doctor went on  the next case was also a bad one though different from the preceding the patient was between forty and fifty years of age and had been unable to go underground for several years  he was a staid sober man and an abstemious liver but it was evident that his life on earth was drawing to a close  he had been employed chiefly in driving levels and had worked a great deal in very bad air where the candles could not be made to burn unless placed nine or ten feet behind the spot where he was at work  indeed he often got no fresh air except what was blown to him and only a puff now and then  when he first went to work in the morning the candle would not keep alight so that he had to take his coat and beat the air about before going into the level and after a time went in when the candles could be got to burn by holding them on one side and teasing out the wick very much  this used to create a great deal of smoke which tended still further to vitiate the air when he returned to grass his saliva used to be as black as ink about five years before giving up underground work he had had inflammation of the lungs followed by bloodspitting which used to come on when he was at work in what he called poor air or in colddamp and he had never been well since  olivers last visit that day was to the man john batten who had exploded a blasthole in his face the day before  this man dwelt in a cottage in the small hamlet of botallack close to the mine of the same name  the room in which the miner lay was very small and its furniture scanty nevertheless it was clean and neatly arranged  everything in and about the place bore evidence of the presence of a thrifty hand the cotton curtain on the window was thin and worn but it was well darned and pure as the driven snow  the two chairs were old as was also the table but they were not rickety it was obvious that they owed their stability to a hand skilled in mending and in patching pieces of things together  even the squat little stool in the side of the chimney corner displayed a leg the whiteness of which compared with the other two told of attention to small things  there was a peg for everything and everything seemed to be on its peg  nothing littered the wellscrubbed floor or defiled the wellbrushed hearthstone and it did not require a second thought on the part of the beholder to ascribe all this to the tidy little middleaged woman who with an expression of deep anxiety on her goodlooking countenance attended to the wants of her injured husband  as oliver approached the door of this cottage two stout youths of about sixteen and seventeen respectively opened it and issued forth  goodmorning lads  going to work i suppose said oliver  iss sur replied the elder a fairhaired ruddy youth who like his brother had not yet sacrificed his colour to the evil influence of the mines we do work in the night corps brother and me  father is worse today sur  sorry to hear that said the doctor as he passed them and entered the cottage while the lads shouldered their tools and walked smartly down the lane that led to botallack mine  your husband is not quite so well today i hear said the doctor going to the side of the bed on which the stalwart form of the miner lay  no sur replied the poor woman he has much pain in his eyes today but his heart is braave sur i never do hear a complaint from he  this was true  the man lay perfectly still the compressed lip and the perspiration that moistened his face alone giving evidence of the agony he endured  do you suffer much inquired the doctor as he undid the bandages which covered the upper part of the mans face  iss sur i do was the reply  no more was said but a low groan escaped the miner when the bandage was removed and the frightful effects of the accident were exposed to view with intense anxiety mrs batten watched the doctors countenance but found no comfort there  a very brief examination was sufficient to convince oliver that the eyes were utterly destroyed for the miner had been so close to the hole when it exploded that the orbs were singed by the flame and portions of unburnt powder had been blown right into them  will he seea little sur whispered mrs batten  oliver shook his head  i fear not he said in a low tone  speak out doctor said the miner in firm tones i aint afeard to knaw it  it would be unkind to deceive you replied oliver sadly your eyes are destroyed  no word was spoken for a few minutes but the poor woman knelt by her husbands side and nestled close to him  batten raised his large brown hand which bore the marks and scars of many a year of manly toil and laid it gently on his wifes head  ill never see thee again annie he murmured in a low deep tone but i see thee face now lass as i last saw it wi the smile of an angel ontan ill see it so till the day i die bless the lord for that  mrs batten rose and went softly but quickly out of the room that she might relieve her bursting heart without distressing her husband but he knew her too well to doubt the reason of her sudden movement and a faint smile was on his lips for a moment as he said to olivershes gone to weep a bit sur and pray  it will do her good dear lass  your loss is a heavy onevery heavy said oliver with hesitation in his tone for he felt some difficulty in attempting to comfort one in so hopeless a condition  true sur true replied the man in a tone of cheerful resignation that surprised the doctor but it might have been worse the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord  mrs batten returned in a few minutes and oliver left them after administering as much comfort as he could in the circumstances but to say truth although well skilled in alleviating bodily pains he was incapable of doing much in the way of ministering to the mind diseased oliver trembath was not a medical missionary  his mother though a good amiable woman had been a weak easygoing creatureone of those goodtempered listless ladies who may be regarded as human vegetables who float through life as comfortably as they can giving as little trouble as possible and doing as little good as is compatible with the presence of even nominal christianity  she performed the duties of life in the smallest possible circle the centre of which was herself and the extremity of the radii extending to the walls of her garden  she went to church at the regulation hours said her prayers in the regulation tone of voice gave her charities in the stated way at stated periods with a hazy perception as to the objects for which they were given and an easy indifference as to the success of these objectsthe whole end and aim of her wishes being attained in and her conscience satisfied by the act of giving  hence her son oliver was not much impressed in youth with the power or value of religion and hence he found himself rather put out when his common sense told him as it not unfrequently did that it was his duty sometimes to administer a dose to the mind as well as to the body  but oliver was not like his mother in any respect  his fire his energy his intellectual activity and his impulsive generosity he inherited from his father  amiability alone descended to him from his motheran inheritance by the way not to be lightly esteemed for by it all his other qualities were immeasurably enhanced in value  his heart had beat in sympathy with the mourners he had just left and his manly disposition made him feel ashamed that the lips which could give advice glibly enough in regard to bandages and physic and which could speak in cheery comforting tones when there was hope for his patient were sealed and absolutely incapable of utterance when death approached or hopeless despair took possession of the sufferer  oliver had felt something of this even in his student life when the solemnities of sickness and death were new to him but it was pressed home upon him with peculiar power and his manhood was often put to the blush when he was brought into contact with the wesleyan methodism of west cornwall where multitudes of men and women of all grades drew comfort from the scriptures as readily and as earnestly as they drew water from their wellswhere religion was mingled with everyday and household dutiesand where many of the miners and fishermen preached and prayed and comforted one another with gods word as vigorously as simply and as naturally as they hewed a livelihood from the rocks or drew sustenance from the sea    chapter thirteen  treats of spirits and of sundry spirited matters and incidents  one sunny afternoon mrs maggot found herself in the happy position of having so thoroughly completed her round of household work that she felt at leisure to sit down and sew while little grace sat beside her near the open door rocking the cradle  baby in blissful unconsciousness of its own existence lay sound asleep with a thumb in its mouth the resolute sucking of that thumb having been its most recent act of disobedience  little grace was flushed and rather dishevelled for it had cost her half an hours hard wrestling to get baby placed in recumbent somnolence  she now sought to soothe her feelings by tickling the chin of the black kittena process to which that active creature submitted with purring satisfaction  faithers long of coming hum mother said little grace looking up  iss replied mrs maggot  dee knaw where he is inquired grace  no i doant replied her mother  it was evident that mrs maggot was not in the humour for conversation so grace relapsed into silence and devoted herself to the kitten  is that faither said grace after a few minutes pointing to the figure of a man who was seen coming over the distant moor or waste land which at that period surrounded the town of st just though the greater part of it is now cultivated fields  it isn like un said mrs maggot shading her eyes with her hand sure it do look like a boatsman  the men of the coastguard were called boatsmen at that time  iss i do see his cutlash said little grace and theres another man comin down road to meet un  haste ee grace cried mrs maggot leaping up and plucking her lastborn out of the cradle take the cheeld in to mrs penrose an bide theer till i send for eedost a hear  plucked thus unceremoniously from gentle slumber to be plunged headlong and without preparation into fierce infantine war was too much for baby maggot he uttered one yell of rage and defiance which was succeeded by a lulla sort of pause for the recovery of breathso prolonged that the obedient grace had time to fling down the horrorstruck chet catch baby in her arms and bear him into the neighbouring cottage before the next roar came forth  the youthful maggot was at once received into the bosom of the penrose family and succeeding yells were smothered by eight out of the sixteen penroses who chanced to be at home at the time  that mrs maggot had a guilty conscience might have been inferred from her future proceedings which to one unacquainted with the habits of her husband would have appeared strange if not quite unaccountable when baby was borne off as related she seized a small keg which stood in a corner near the door and smelt strongly of brandy and placing it with great care in the vacant cradle covered it over with blankets she next rolled a pair of stockings into a ball and tied on it a little frilled nightcap which she disposed on the pillow with the face pretty well down and the back of the head pretty well up and so judiciously and cleverly covered it with bedclothes that even maggot himself might have failed to miss his son or to recognise the outlines of a keg  a bottle half full of brandy with the cork out was next placed on the table to account for the odour in the room and then mrs maggot sat down to her sewing and rocked the cradle gently with her foot singing a sweet lullaby the while  ten minutes later two stout men of the coastguard armed with cutlasses and pistols entered the cottage  mrs maggot observed that they were also armed with a pick and shovel  goodhevenin missus how dost do said the man who walked foremost in a hearty voice  goodhevenin eben trezise how are you said mrs maggot  braave thank ee said trezise weve come for a drop o brandy missus havin heard that youve got some here an sure us can smell iteh  why iss weve got wan small drop said mrs maggot gently arranging the clothes on the cradle that the doctor have order for the cheeld youre welcome to a taste of it but plaise dont make so much noise for the poor cheelds slaipin  hell be smothered i do think if you dont turn his head up a bit missus said the man howsever youve no objection to let jim and me have a look round the place i dessay  mrs maggot said they were welcome to do as they pleased if they would only do it quietly for the sake of the cheeld so without more ado they commenced a thorough investigation of the premises outside and in then they went to the smithy where mrs maggot knew her husband had concealed two large kegs of smuggled liquor on the hearth under a heap of ashes and iron debris but these had been so cleverly yet carelessly hidden that the men sat down on the heap under which they lay to rest and wipe their heated brows after their fruitless search  hast ee found the brandy inquired mrs maggot with a look of innocence when the two men returned  not yet replied eben trezise but weve not done  theres a certain shaft near by that has got a bad name for drinkin missus praps you may have heard on it  its breath do smell dreadful bad sometimes  both men laughed at this and winked to each other while mrs maggot smiled and with a look of surprise vowed that she had not heard of the disreputable shaft referred to  despite her unconcerned look however mrs maggot felt anxious for she was aware that her husband had recently obtained an unusually large quantity of french brandy and tobacco from the scilly islands between which and the coasts of cornwall smuggling was carried on in a most daring and extensive manner at the time of our story and she knew that the whole of the smuggled goods lay concealed in one of those numerous disused shafts of old mines which lie scattered thickly over that part of the country  maggots absence rendered her position still more perplexing but she was a woman of ready wit and selfreliance and she comforted herself with the knowledge that the brandy lay buried far down in the shaft and that it would take the boatsmen some time to dig to itthat possibly they might give up in despair before reaching it  while the men went off to search for the shaft and while mrs maggot was calmly nursing her spirited little baby maggot himself in company with his bosom friend john cock was sauntering slowly homeward along the cliffs near kenidjack castle the ruins of which occupy a bold promontory a little to the north of cape cornwall  they had just come in sight of the tinmine and works which cover nancharrow valley from the shore to a considerable distance inland where stand the tall chimneys and enginehouses the whims and varied machinery of the extensive and prolific old tinmine named wheal owles  the cliffs on which the two men stood are very precipitous and rugged rising in some places to a height of about 300 feet above the rocks where the waters of the atlantic roll dark and deep fringing the coast with a milky foam that is carried away by the tide in long streaks to be defiled by the red waters which flow from nancharrow valley into porth ledden cove  this cove is a small one with a narrow strip of sand on its shore  at its northern extremity is a deep narrow gorge into which the waves rush even in calm weather with a peculiar sound  in reference to this it is said that the waves buzzandgoin hence the place has been named zawn buzzangein  the sides of the zawn are about sixty feet high and quite precipitous  in one part especially they overhang their base  it was here that maggot and his friend stopped on their way home and turned to look out upon the sea  no sign o pilchers yet observed maggot referring to the immense shoals of pilchards which visit the cornish coasts in the autumn of each year and form a large portion of the wealth of the county  too soon replied john cock  by the way jack said maggot wasnt it hereabouts that the schooner went ashore last winter  iss twor down theer close by pullandeese replied the other pointing to a deep pool in the rocks round which the swell of the atlantic broke in white foam  i was theere myself  i had come down bout daylightbefore others were stirring an sure nuff there she lay on the rocks bottom up an all the crew lost  we seed wan o them knackin on the rocks to the north so we got ropes an let a man down to fetch un up but of coorse it was gone dead  that minds me jack said maggot that i seed a daws nest here the last time i come along so lev us go an stroob that daws nest  thee cusnt do it said john cock  maggot laughed and said he not only could but would so he ran down to the neighbouring works and returned with a stout rope which he fixed firmly to a rock at the edge of the overhanging cliff  we have already said that maggot was a noted madcap who stuck at nothing and appeared to derive positive pleasure from the mere act of putting his life in danger  no human foot could by climbing have reached the spot where the nest of the daw or cornish chough was fixedfor the precipice besides being perpendicular and nearly flat projected a little near the top where the nest lay in a crevice overhanging the surf that boiled and raged in zawn buzzangein  indeed the nest was not visible from the spot where the two men stood and it could only be seen by going round to the cliffs on the opposite side of the gorge  without a moments hesitation maggot swung himself over the edge of the precipice merely cautioning his comrade as he did so to hold on to the rope and prevent it from slipping  he slid down about two yards and then found that the rock overhung so much that he was at least six feet off from the crevice in which the young daws nestled comfortably together and no stretch that he could make with his legs long though they were was sufficient to enable him to get on the narrow ledge just below the nest  several times he tried to gain a footing and at each effort the juvenile dawsas yet ignorant of the desperate nature of manopened their little eyes to the utmost in undisguised amazement  for full five minutes maggot wriggled and the daws gazed and the anxious comrade above watched the vibrations and jerks of the part of the rope that was visible to him while he listened intently  the bubbles on zawn buzzangein like millions of watery eyes danced and twinkled sixty feet below as if in wonder at the object which swung wildly to and fro in midair  at last maggot managed to touch the rock with the extreme point of his toe  a slight push gave him swing sufficient to enable him to give one or two vigorous shoves by which means he swung close to the side of the cliff  watching his opportunity he planted both feet on the narrow ledge before referred to stretched out his hands pressed himself flat against the rock let go the rope and remained fast like a fly sticking to a wall  this state of comparative safety he announced to his anxious friend above by exclaimingall right johnive got the daws  this statement was however not literally true for it cost him several minutes of slow and careful struggling to enable him so to fix his person as to admit of his hands being used for stroobing purposes  at length he gained the object of his ambition and transferred the horrified daws from their native home to his own warm but unnatural bosom in which he buttoned them up tight  a qualm now shot through maggots heart for he discovered that in his anxiety to secure the daws he had let go the rope which hung at a distance of full six feet from him and of course far beyond his reach  hullo  john he cried  hullo shouted john in reply  ive got the daws said maggot but ive lost the rope  aw my dear gasped john have ee lost th rope  it need scarcely be said that poor john cock was dreadfully alarmed at this and that he eagerly tendered much useless advicestretching his neck the while as far as was safe over the cliff  i say john shouted maggot again  hullo answered john  i tell ee what im goin to jump for th rope  if i do miss th rope run thee round to porth ledden cove an tak my shoes weth ee ill be theere before ee  having made this somewhat bold prediction maggot collected all his energies and sprang from his narrow perch into the air with arms and hands wildly extended  his effort was well and bravely made but his position had been too constrained and his foothold too insecure to admit of a good jump  he missed the rope and with a loud cry shot like an arrow into the boiling flood below  john cock heard the cry and the plunge and stood for nearly a minute gazing in horror into zawn buzzangein  presently he drew a deep sigh of relief for maggot made his appearance manfully buffeting the waves john watched him with anxiety while he swam out towards the sea escaped the perpendicular sides of the zawn towards which the breakers more than once swept him doubled the point and turned in towards the cove the opposite cliffs of the gorge now shut the swimmer out from johns view so he drew another deep sigh and picking up his comrades shoes ran round with all his might to porth ledden cove where true to his word having been helped both by wind and tide maggot had arrived before him  are ee safe my dear man was johns first question  iss replied maggot shaking himself safe enough an the daws too but semmen to me theyve gone dead  this was too true  the poor birds had perished in their captors bosom    chapter fourteen  continues to treat of spirits and shows the value of hospitality  having accomplished the feat narrated in the last chapter maggot proceeded with his friend towards the town  on their way they had to pass the mouth of an old shaft in which both of them chanced to be much interested at that time inasmuch as it contained the produce of a recent smuggling expedition on a large scale consisting of nearly a hundred tubs of brandy  the liquor had been successfully brought ashore and concealed in the mine and that night had been fixed on for its removal  mules had been provided and about fifty men were appointed to meet at a certain spot at a fixed hour to carry the whole away into the neighbouring towns  maggot and his comrade began to converse about the subject that was uppermost in their minds and the former increased his pace when john cock drew his attention to the fact that the sun was getting low  the boys will be mustering now said john an them theere daws have kep us late enough already  they do say that the boatsmen are informed about the toobs observed maggot  more need to look alive said john  hallo exclaimed maggot suddenly theres some wan in the shaft  he pointed to a neighbouring mound of rubbish on which just as he spoke a man made his appearance  without uttering a word the smugglers sauntered towards the mound assuming a careless air as though they were passing that way by chance on drawing near they recognised ebenezer trezise the coastguardman  goodhevening sur said maggot semmen as if youd found a keenly lode  why iss weve diskivered a noo vein said trezise with a sly smile and were sinkin a shaft here in the hope o raisin tin or somethin  ha hope youll let john an me have a pitch in the noo bal wont ee said maggot with a laugh  oh cernly cernly replied the boatsman if youll lend us a hand to sink the shaft  you appear to have been in the water and twill warm ee  no thank ee replied maggot ive bin stroobin a daws nest under cliff an i fell into the say so im goin hum to dry myself as im afeared o kitchin cold being of a delikit constitootion  but ill praps lend thee a hand afterwards  maggot nodded as he spoke and left the place at a slow saunter with his comrade followed by the thanks and goodwishes of the boatsman who immediately returned to the laborious task of clearing out the old shaft  theyve got the scent said maggot when out of earshot but well do em yet  whenever thee gets on the leeside o that hedge john do ee clap on all sail for balaswidden where the boys are waitin an tell em to be ready for a call  ill send zackey or wan o the childn to ee  john went off on his errand the moment he was out of sight of the boatsmen and maggot walked smartly to his cottage  owld ooman he said commencing to unbutton his wet garments do ee git ready a cup o tay as fast as you can lass we shall have company tonight  company exclaimed mrs maggot in surprise what sort o company  oh the best the best said maggot with a laugh boatsmen no less so look sharp  zackey booy come here  zackey put down the unfortunate black kitten which immediately sought comfort in repose and obeyed his fathers summons while his mother knowing that her husband had some plot in his wise head set about preparing a sumptuous meal which consisted of bread and butter tea and fried mackerel and cornish pasty  zackey my son said maggot while he continued his toilet  iss father  i want ee to come down to the owld shaft with me an when i give ee the ward cut away as hard as thee legs can spank to balaswidden an fetch the lads that are theere to the owld shaft  they knaw what to do but tell em to make so little noise as they can  dost a hear my son  iss faither replied zackey with a wink of such profound meaning that his sire felt quite satisfied he was equal to the duty assigned him  now doant ee wag tongue more than enough continued maggot and go play with the chet till im ready  the urchin at once descended like a thunderbolt on the black kitten but that marvellous animal had succeeded in snatching five minutes repose which seemed to be amply sufficient to recruit its energies for it began instantly to playin other words to worry and scratch the boys handwith the utmost glee and goodhumour  in a few minutes maggot and his son went out and hastened to the old shaft where they found the boatsmen still hard at work with pick and shovel clearing away the rubbish  you havent found a bunch o copper yet i dessay said maggot with a grin  no not yet but we shant be long replied eben trezise with a knowing smile  its warm work observed maggot as he looked down the hole and saw that what the boatsman said was true and that they would not be long of reaching the spot where the liquor had been concealed  trezise admitted that it was warm work and paused to wipe his heated brow  i wish we had a drop o water here he said looking up  ha exclaimed maggot not much chance o findin water in that hole i do thinkno nor brandy nuther  not so sure o that said trezise resuming his work  now et is a shame to let ee die here for want of a drop o water said maggot in a compassionate tone ill send my booy hum for some  the boatsmen thanked him and zackey was ordered off to fetch a jug of water but his fathers voice arrested him before he had gone a hundred yards  hold on a bit my sonpraps he said turning to trezise youd come up hum with me and have a dish o tay  missus have got it all ready  the invitation appeared to gratify the boatsmen who smiled and winked at each other as though they thought themselves very clever fellows to have discovered the whereabouts of a hidden treasure and to be refreshed in the midst of their toil by one whom they knew to be a noted smuggler and whom they strongly suspected of being concerned in the job they were at that time endeavouring to frustrate  throwing down their tools they laughingly accepted the invitation and clambered out of the shaft  nows your time whispered maggot with a nod to his hopeful son and then added aloud  cut away zackey booy an tell mother to get the tay ready  run my son let us knaw what thee legs are made of  hes a smart lad observed trezise as zackey gave his father an intelligent look and dashed away at the top of his speed  iss a clever cheeld assented maggot  bin down in the mines i dessay said trezise  iss oh iss he do knaw tin replied maggot with much gravity  in a few minutes the two coastguardmen were seated at mrs maggots wellsupplied board enjoying the most comfortable meal they had eaten for many a day  it was seasoned too with such racy talk abounding in anecdote from maggot and such importunate hospitality on the part of his better half that the men felt no disposition to cut it short little grace too was charmingly attentive for she poor child being utterly ignorant of the double parts which her parents were playing rejoiced in the native kindliness of her heart to see them all so happy  even the chet seemed to enter into the spirit of what was going on for regardless of the splendid opportunity that now presented itself of obtaining repose to its hearts content that black ball of concentrated essence of mischief dashed wildly about the floor and up the bedcurtains with its back up and its tail thickened and its green eyes glaring defiance at everything animate inanimate or otherwise insomuch that maggot made sundry efforts to quell it with the threelegged stooland mrs maggot followed suit with a dishcloutbut in vain  meanwhile men and mules and horses were converging by many paths and lanes towards the old shaft and the shaft itself was apparently endued with the properties of a volcano for out of its mouth issued a continuous shower of dust and stones while many stalwart arms laid bare the mine beneath and tossed up the precious tubs of brandy  before the pleasant little teaparty in maggots cottage broke up the whole were scattered abroad and men and mules and horses sped with their illgotten gains across the furzeclad moors  sure its early to break up said maggot when the boatsmen at last rose to take their leave theres no fear o the bunches o copper melting down there or flyin away  theres no saying replied eben trezise youve heerd as well as we of lodes takin the bit in their teeth an disappearingeh  well iss so they do sometimes ill not keep ee longer goodhevenin to ee said maggot going outside the door and wishing them all manner of success as they returned to the old shaft  reader shall we follow the two knowing fellows to that shaft  shall we mark the bewildered expression of amazement with which they gazed into it and listen to the wild fiendish laugh of mingled amusement and wrath that bursts from them in fitful explosions as the truth flashes into their unwilling minds  no vice had triumphed over virtue and we deem it a kindness to your sensitive nature to draw a veil over the scene of her discomfiture    chapter fifteen  introduces a stranger describes a picnic and reveals some secrets of mining  somewhere in the vicinity of that magnificent piece of coast scenery in west cornwall known by the name of gurnards head there sauntered one fine afternoon a gentleman of tall commanding aspect  all the parts of this gentleman were if we may so speak prononce  everything about him savoured of the superlative degree  his head and face were handsome and large but their size was not apparent because of the capacity of his broad shoulders and wide chest  his waist was slender hair curly and very black only to be excelled by the intense blackness of his eyes  his nose was prominent mouth large and well shaped forehead high and broad whiskers enormous and nostrils so large as to appear dilated  he was a bony man a powerful manalso tall and straight and a little beyond forty  he was to all appearance a hero of romance and his mind seemed to be filled with romantic thoughts for he smiled frequently as he gazed around him from the top of the cliffs on the beautiful landscape which lay spread out at his feet  above him there were wild undulating slopes covered with rich green gorse below were the cliffs of gurnards cove with rocky projections that resemble the castellated work of mans hand and intermingled therewith much of the materiel connected with the pilchard fishery with masses of masonry so heavy and picturesque as to resemble natures handiwork  beyond lay the blue waters of the atlantic which at that time were calm almost as a millpond studded with a hundred sails and glittering in sunshine  the spot appeared a beautiful solitude for no living thing was visible save the romantic gentleman and a few seagulls and sheep  the pilchard fishery had not yet commenced and the three or four fishermen who pitched and repaired their boats on the one little spot of sand that could be seen far below on that rugged coast appeared like mice and were too far distant to break the feeling of solitudea feeling which was not a little enhanced by the appearance on a spot not far distant of the ruined enginehouse of a deserted mine  it was indeed a lovely afternoon and a beautiful scenea very misanthrope would have gazed on it with an approach at least to benignity  no wonder that george augustus clearemout smiled on it so joyously and whisked his walkingcane vigorously in the exuberance of his delight  but strange to say his smile was always brightest and the cane flourished most energetically when he turned his eyes on the ruined mine  he even laughed once or twice and muttered to himself as he looked at the picturesque object yet there seemed nothing in its appearance calculated to produce laughter  on the contrary there were those alive whom the sight of it might have reduced to tears for in its brief existence it had raised uncommonly little tin or copper although it had succeeded in sinking an immense amount of gold nevertheless mr clearemout chuckled every time he looked at the ruin and appeared very much tickled with the thoughts to which it gave rise  yes the very thing capital he muttered to himself turning again and again to the object of his admiration couldnt be betterha ha most suitable yes it will do for em probably it will do emdo em he repeated the phrase two or three times with a greater display of white teeth at each utterance of it a most superb namewheal doemha ha  spell it with two os to make it look more natural and ensure correct pronunciationwheal dooemnothing could be finer quite candid and aboveboardno one can call it a swindle  this last idea caused mr clearemout to break into the loudest laugh in which he had hitherto indulged and he was about to repeat it when the appearance of a phaeton at a turn of the carriage road reduced him to gravity  the vehicle contained a party of ladies and gentlemen from st just among whom were rose ellis mrs donnithorne and her husband oliver trembath and mr william grenfell a gentleman of property in the neighbourhood  as it approached the spot where mr clearemout stood the horse swerved at a sheep which started out from behind a furze bush and then backed so rapidly that the hindwheels were on the point of passing over the edge of the road when the tall stranger sprang to its head and led it gently forward  the danger was not great for the road at the place was elevated little above the sward but it was sufficiently so to warrant a profusion of thanks from the occupants of the vehicle and a pressing invitation to mr clearemout to join the picnic party then and there assembling  you see were not all here said mr donnithorne bustling about energetically as he pulled baskets and bottles from the body of the vehicle while oliver assisted the ladies to alight theres another machineful coming but we have lots of grub for all and will only be too glad of your company mrmrwhat did you say  clearemout interposed that gentleman with a bow and a bland smile that quite took mr donnithorne by storm  ah yes glad to have you mr clearemout why our necks might all have been broken but for you  rose my dear do look after this basket therethankshow hot it is to be sure  mr clearemoutmr grenfell no introductiononly to let you know his namemy wife niece roseoliver trembath and all the rest there dispense with ceremony on a picnic always  thats the chief fun of it  while the lively old gentleman ran on thus and collected the baskets together mr grenfell who was a tall gentlemanly man of about sixty with a grave aristocratic countenance and polite manner assured mr clearemout that he was happy to make the acquaintance of a man who had rendered them such opportune service whereupon mr clearemout declared himself to be fortunate in being present at such a juncture and protested that his service was a trifle in itself although it had led to an introduction which was most gratifying  then turning with much urbanity of manner to the ladies he entered into conversation with them  here they come shouted old mr donnithorne as another carriage drove up  the rest of our party said mr grenfell turning to mr clearemout friends from st just  the carriage stopped as he spoke and a number of ladies and gentlemen descended therefrom and mingled their congratulations at the narrow escape which had just been made with thanks to the dark stranger and with orders questions counterorders and explanations innumerable about baskets to be carried and places to be selected  the picnic we need scarcely say very much resembled picnics in general  all were in good spiritselated with the splendour of the day the beauty of the views and the freshness of the seabreeze that sprang up soon after their arrival  the only one whose feelings were not absolutely unruffled was oliver trembath  that youth was afflicted with an unaccountable dislike to the dark stranger which rendered him somewhat uncomfortable  as for the stranger he made himself extremely agreeabletold anecdotes sang songs and became an immaculate waiter on the whole company handing about plates glasses knives etcetera etcetera as deftly as if he were dealing a pack of cards  above all he was a good listener and not only heard other peoples stories out to the end but commented on them as one who had been interested  with all this he was particularly attentive to rose ellis but so guarded was he that no one noticed the attentions as being peculiar except rose herself and oliver trembath who for the first time in his life to his great surprise and displeasure felt the demon of jealousy tormenting his breast  but in the midst of all this mr george augustus clearemout displayed an insatiable curiosity in regard to mines and miners  whatever might be the subject of conversation for the time he invariably took the first opportunity of returning to his favourite theme with one or another of the party as occasion served  ashamed of the feelings which troubled him oliver trembath resolved to take the bold and manly step of stifling them by making himself agreeable to the object of his dislike  accordingly he availed himself of an opportunity when the party broke up into groups to saunter about the cliffs and entered into converse with the stranger on the subject of mines  you appear to take much interest in mining i think said he as they walked out on the promontory together  i do indeed replied clearemout the mines of cornwall have ever been a subject of deep interest to me and the miners i regard as a race of men singularly endowed with courage and perseverance  your opinion of them is correct said oliver  have you ever seen them at work  no i have only just arrived in the county but i hope to visit the mines ere long  when you do said oliver with enthusiasm your opinion of them will be strengthened for their endurance underground and their perseverance in a species of labour which taxes their muscular power as well as their patience to the uttermost surpasses anything i have either seen or heard of  england does not fully appreciate because she is not minutely acquainted with the endurance and courage of her cornish miners  the rocks through which they have to cut are so hard and unyielding that men who had not been trained from childhood to subdue them would lose heart altogether at the weight of toil and the small return for it  sometimes indeed miners are fortunate and here as elsewhere lucky hits are made but for the most part their gains are barely sufficient for their wants and whether they are lucky or unlucky in that respect the toil is always hardso hard that few of them retain health or strength sufficient to go underground beyond the age of fortyfive while hundreds of them find an early grave owing to disease resulting from their peculiar work or to accidents  these last are usually occasioned by the bursting out of collections of water which flood the mines or the fall of masses of timber or the premature explosion of blastholes  at other times the men lose hold of the laddersfall away from them as they express itor stumble into a winze which is a small shaft connecting level with level in which latter case death is almost certain to ensue many of the winzes being sixty feet deep  in st just you will see many poor fellows who have been blinded or maimed in the mines  nevertheless cornish miners are a contented uncomplaining race of men and cornwall is justly proud of them  i am much interested in what you tell me said clearemout in fact i have come here for the purpose of making inquiry into mines and mining concerns  then you will find this to be the very place for you said oliver my uncle mr donnithorne and mr grenfell and mr cornish are intimately acquainted with mining in all its phases and will i am certain be happy to give you all the information in their power  as to the people of st just and its neighbourhood you will find them most agreeable and hospitable  i can speak from personal experience although i have only been a short time among them  i doubt it not replied mr clearemout with a bland smile my own limited experience goes far to corroborate what you say and i hope to have the pleasure of still further testing the truth of your observations  and mr george augustus clearemout did test their truth for several weeks after the picnic  he was received with kindness and hospitality everywhere he was taken down into the mines by obliging agents and was invited to several of the periodical business dinners called accountdinners at which he met shareholders in the mines and had an opportunity of conversing with men of note and wealth from various parts of the county  he dwelt during his stay with old mr donnithorne and much to the surprise if not pleasure of rose proved himself to be a proficient on the guitar and a good musician  at length the dark gentleman took his departure for london whither we shall follow him and watch his proceedings for a very short time before returning to the principal scene of our tale  almost immediately on his arrival in the great city he betook himself to the west end and there in a fashionable square solicited an interview with an old lady whose principal noteworthy points were that she had much gold and not much brains  she was a confiding old lady and had on a previous occasion been quite won by the insinuating address of the charming mr clearemout who had been introduced to her by a noble lord  to this confiding old lady george augustus painted cornish mines and mining in the most glowing colours and recommended her to invest in a mine a portion of her surplus funds  the confiding old lady had no taste for speculation and was rather partial to the three per cent consols but george augustus was so charmingly persuasive that she could not help giving inso george proposed little plans and opened up little prospects and the confiding old lady agreed to all the little plans without paying much regard to the little prospects  after this mr clearemout paid another visit in another west end squarethis time to a gentleman  the gentleman was young and noble for clearemout styled him my lord  strange to say he also was of a confiding naturevery much so indeedand appeared to be even more completely under the influence of george augustus than the confiding old lady herself  for the benefit of this young gentleman mr clearemout painted the same picture in the same glowing colours which colours seemed to grow warmer as the sun of success rose upon it  he added something about the value of a name and referred to money as being a matter of small consequence in comparison  the young lord like the old lady agreed to everything that was proposed to him except the proposal to advance money  on that point he was resolute but clearemout did not care much about obtaining money from the confiding young gentleman  his name was as good as gold and would enable him to screw money out of others  after this the dark man paid a visit to several other friends at the west end all of whom were more or less confidingsome with selfish others with unselfish dispositionsbut all without exception a little weak intellectually  these had the same glowing pictures of a cornish mine laid before them and most of them swallowed the bait whole only one or two being content to nibble  when afternoon began to merge into evening mr clearemout paid a last visit for the daybut not in the west end rather nearer to the city to a gentleman somewhat like himself though less prepossessing for whose benefit he painted no glowing picture of a mine but to whom he said come jack ive made a pretty good job of it lets go and have a chop  if your luck has equalled mine the thing is done and wheal dooem as i have named the sweet little thing will be going full swing in a couple of weekscosting perhaps a few hundreds to put it in working order with a trifle thereafter in the shape of wages to a man and a boy to coal the fire and keep the thing moving with as much noise as possible to make a show and leaving a pretty little balance of some twenty or thirty thousand at the credit of the company for you and me to enjoy in the meantimeminus a small sum for rent of office clerks salary gas and coal etcetera as long as the bubble lasts  thus did this polite scoundrel go about from house to house getting up a cornish mining company on false pretences as other polite scoundrels have done before and doubtless as others will do again bringing into unmerited disrepute those genuine and grand old mines of cornwall which have yielded stores of tin and copper to the enriching of the english nation ever since those oldworld days when the phoenicians sailed their adventurous barks to the cassiterides in quest of tin  while these things were being done in london a terrible catastrophe happened in botallack mine which threw a dark cloud for some time over more than one lowly cottage in st just    chapter sixteen  describes holing to a house of water and its terrible consequences  one morning about seven oclock george and james the two fairhaired sons of poor john batten of botallack started for their work as usual they were in high spirits having obtained a good pitch on last settingday and things were looking well  they put on their underground clothing at the changinghouse and with several spare candles attached to buttons on the breasts of their coats and their tools slung over their shoulders walked towards the head of the laddershaft  at the mouth of the shaft they paused for a moment and glanced round  the sky was bright the landscape green and the sun lit up many a distant sail on the atlantic  i do wish said the younger with a slight sigh that our work was more in the sunshine  youll never be a true miner jimmy if ee go hankerin after the sun like that said his brother with a laugh as he stepped on the ladder and began to descend  jimmy took a last look at the rising sun and followed him close without replying  the lads were soon beyond the reach of daylight  this was the last they ever saw of earthly sunshine  in a few minutes there came a low soft sound up the shaft it was the lads singing one of wesleys beautiful hymns  they had been taught to sing these by their mother from their infancy and usually beguiled the tedium of the long descent of the ladders by singing one or two of them  arrived at their place of work the brothers threw down their tools fixed their candles against the walls of the level and began the labour of the day  other men were in that part of the mine at the time and the brothers found that a message had been sent to one of the captains requesting him to come and examine the place as the men were becoming uneasy at the increasing flow of water from the walls  one miner named john nicols was driving an end that is extending the level lengthwise and two others were stopeing or cutting up into the roof in pursuit of a promising little lode  they were using hammer and pick in soft ground when the water trickled through to them  it was well known that they were approaching an old part of the mine which had not been worked for thirty years  the drainage of the ground was not however accurately known therefore questions had been put to experienced miners as to the probable condition of this untapped land the answer was that as far as was known the old mine was full of deads that is of rubbish and that there was therefore in all probability no gathering of water in it  just at that moment one of the captains entered the level accompanied by oliver trembath  the latter had been called to see a patient near the mine and chanced to be with the captain when he was summoned being anxious to see the place and the nature of the danger that threatened he had descended along with him  before the captain had time to put a question and while the men were still picking cautiously at the soft ground the flow of water suddenly increased  recognising probable danger a lad named oats called to his father who was at the end of the level with nicols  at the same moment the water forced a gap in the wall three feet long by about half a foot wide and burst in upon them with terrific violence  all turned and fled  oats and his son with the captain and nicols made for the nearest shaftwhich was about eighty yards distantand escaped but the brothers batten and oliver were thrown down and swept away  one desperate effort was made by oliver to outstrip the rushing stream but the candles had been blown out and not stooping sufficiently low he dashed his head against an overhanging rock and fell  he retained sufficient consciousness however to be aware that a desperate struggle for life must be made and without knowing what he did or at what he aimed he fought with the strength of a giant in thick darkness against the chaotic flood but his strength soon gave way and in a few seconds he became insensible  that a terrible catastrophe had occurred was at once known to all the men in the mine by the roar of the rushing water  in order that the reader may clearly understand the situation it is necessary to explain that the accident occurred in one of the upper levels at or near its extremity  at the same depth there were many of these underground passages running in various directions and several miles in extent some of them being worked but most of them old and used upall the ore having been extracted from them  at various depths below this level other levels had been cutalso running in various directions and of several miles extent  these successive levels were not only connected and communicated with by the main shafts of the mine but by winzes or smaller shafts which connected level with level in many places  some of these were used as ladderways but others had been cut merely for the purpose of securing ventilation  in many parts of these lower levels miners were at worksome in following the course of promising lodes stopeing or cutting overhead some cutting downwards some driving ends or extending the levels and others sinking winzes to keep up the ventilation as they pushed further and further from the shafts or throats down which flowed the lifegiving air  by all of these men the dreaded sounds abovewhich reached the profounder depths with the muffled but deeptoned roar of a distant stormwere well understood and well heard for the pentup waters in their irresistible fury carried before them the pentup atmosphere and sent it through the low and narrow levels as if through the circling tubes of a monster trumpet which mingled with the crash of hurling timbers rocks and debris created a mighty roar that excelled in hideous grandeur the prolonged peals of loud thunder  every man dropped his tools and ran to the nearest shaft for his life it was not indeed probable that the flood would fill all the wideextended ramifications of the vast mine but no one knew for certain where the catastrophe had occurred or how near the danger might be to the spot where he laboured  enough for each that death was dealing terrible destruction somewhere overhead and that unless every muscle were strained to the uttermost the pathway might be filled up and his retreat cut off  the rush was swiftly but not easily made those who have never traversed the levels of a cornish mine may perhaps fancy on hearing of levels six feet high and about two and a half feet broad on the average that the flight might resemble the rush of men through the windings and turnings of the intricate passages in a stupendous old castle  but it was far otherwise  the roofs walls and floors of these levels were irregular not only in direction but in height and form  there was no levelling or polishingoff anywhere  it was tunnelling of the roughest kind  angles and projections remained as the chisel the pick and the blastingpowder had left them  here the foot tripped over a lump or plunged into a hollow there the head narrowly missed a depending mass of rock or the shoulder grazed a projecting one  elsewhere pools of water lay in the path and at intervals the yawning chasm of a winze appeared with one or two broken planks to bridge the gulf of twenty forty or sixty feet that descended to the levels below  sometimes it was possible to run with the head stooped a little generally the back had to be bent lowoften double and occasionally progress could only be made on hands and kneesthis too with a candle to be guarded from blasts of air or dripping water and trimmed lest it should go out and leave the place in total darkness  but longcontinued habit and practice had made the men so familiar with the place and so nimble in their movements that they traversed the levels with wonderful rapidity and most of them ascended the shaft of the mine in safety  some however escaped with the utmost difficulty and a few there werechiefly among those who had been near to or immediately below the scene of the outbreakwho perished miserably  at the first rush the water had almost filled the level where it occurred and sweeping onward about eight fathoms to a winze plunged down and partly over it  the greater part however went down to the eightyfive fathom level  east of this a man named anguin with his two sons william and jamesyouths of about twenty years of agewere at work  they heard the roar of the approaching torrent and the father and younger son james rushed towards the winze intending to ascend the ladder  before they reached it the flood was pouring down with deafening noise  the least harmful part of the cataract was the water for the current now carried along with it stones pieces of timber and rubbish  to encounter all this might have caused the stoutest hearts to quail but miners can never calculate the probable extent of an inundation  they might indeed by remaining in the roof of the level escape but on the other hand if the flood should be great enough to fill the place they would certainly be drowned  father and son therefore preferred to make a desperate effort to save their lives they dashed into the flood and made a grasp at the ladder but before their hands touched the first round they were beaten down and swept away dead corpses  william on the other hand climbed to a crosspiece of timber where he remained until the water abated which it did in a very short time for events of this kind are for the most part awfully sudden and brief as well as fatal  then descending he groped his way in the dark over the very spot where his father and brother lay deadfearfully mutilated and covered with rubbishand escaped up the shaft  in a still lower level two brothers were at work  miners usually work in couplessometimes in larger numbersand brothers frequently go together  they were in a winze about thirty fathoms from the engineshaft  being overtaken by the flood they were washed down to the next level and along it nearly to the shaft  as the torrent tore past this place bearing splintered timber stones and rubbish along with it an iron wagon was caught up and flung across the level  this formed a barricade against which the brothers were dashed  the elder of these brothers was afterwards found alive here and carried to the surface but he was speechless and died twenty minutes after being brought up  when the dead body of the younger and weaker brother was recovered it was found to be dreadfully shattered nearly every bone being crushed  in the same level two menjohn paul and andrew teaguehearing the rush of the advancing torrent above their head made for a shaft went up it against a heavy fall of water and escaped  a man named richarda powerful man and a cool experienced miner who had faced death in almost every formwas at work in one of the lowest levels with his son william a youth of twentyone and his nephew a lad of seventeen who was the sole support of a widowed mother with six children  they were thirty fathoms from one of the winzes down which the water streamed  on hearing the roar richard cautioned the younger men to be prompt but collected  no time was to be lost but rash haste might prove as fatal as delay  he sent them on in front of him and they rushed under and past the winze where they were nearly crushed by the falling water and where of course their candles were extinguished leaving them in midnight darkness  this last was not so serious a matter to the elder richard as at first sight it might appear  he knew every foot of the ground they had to traverse with all its turnings yawning chasms and plank bridges and could have led the way blindfold almost as easily as with a light  as they neared the shaft he passed the younger men and led the way to prevent them falling into it  at this time the water raged round them as high as their waists  the nephew who was weak in consequence of a fever from which he had not quite recovered fell and passing the others unobserved went down the shaft and was lost  the escape of richard and his son was most wonderful  william was a stout fellow but the father much more so  they were driven at first into the shaft but there the fall of water was so great that they could do nothing more than cling to the ladder  by this cataract they were beaten back into the level but here the water rose around them so quickly and with such force as to oblige them to make another effort to ascend  there was a crevice in the roof of the level here in which the father had left part of his supply of candles and a tinderbox  he succeeded in reaching these and in striking a light which revealed to them the full horrors of their situation  it was with difficulty that the candle could be kept burning by holding it close to the roof under a projecting piece of rock which sheltered it partially from the dashing spray  let us try again shouted the father  the noise was so great that it was with difficulty they could make each other hear  its all over with we cried the son let us pray faither  the father urged his son however to make another effort as the water had risen nearly to their waists and prevailed on him to do so getting on the ladder himself first in order to bear the brunt of the falling water and thus break its force to his son  as the water below was now rising swiftly william only held the light long enough to enable his father to obtain a secure footing on the ladder when he dropped it and followed him  so anxious was the youth to escape from the danger that menaced him from below that he pressed eagerly up against his father in doing so he overreached the rounds of the ladder on which his father trod and almost at every step the latter unwittingly planted his heavynailed boots on the sons hands lacerating them terribly  to avoid this was impossible  so heavy was the descending flood that it was only his unusually great strength which enabled the father to advance slowly up against it  the son being partially sheltered by his fathers body knew not the power against which he had to contend and being anxious to go up faster pressed too closely on him regardless in his alarm of the painful consequences  masses of stone wood and rubbish dashed down the shaft and grazed their shoulders but providentially none struck them severely  thus slowly and painfully did they ascend to a height of eightyfour feet and were saved  in another part of the mine below the level where the accident occurred james penrose whom we have already introduced to the reader was at work with john cock  the latter having taken a fancy to try mining for a time instead of smugglingjust by way of a changehad joined the former in working a pitch in botallack mine  these men were peculiarly situated  they were in a level which the water entered not by flowing along or descending but by rising up through a winze on hearing the noise they ran to this winze and looking down saw the water boiling and roaring far below  they were about to pass on to the shaft when penrose observed a dark object moving on the ladder  it came slowly up  hallo  john cried penrose stay a bit heres some one on the ladder  john cock returned and they both stooped to afford help  in another moment oliver trembath drenched and bleeding and covered with mud stood or rather reeled before them  it was evident that he was only half conscious and scarcely able to stand  but they had no time to speakscarcely to thinkfor the water was already boiling up through the winze like a huge fountain and filling the level  they seized oliver by the arms and dragged him hastily towards the nearest winze that led upward  here they found water pouring down like rain and heard its thunders above them but the stream was not sufficient to retard their progress up the winze which they ascended with comparative ease  penrose and cock were surprised at this but the small quantity of water was soon accounted for by the fact that the hatch or trapdoor of the winze had been closed and thus while it prevented the great body of water above from descending also effectually shut off the only way of escape  they were therefore compelled to descend again to the level in which the water was now rising rapidly  oliver leaned against the rock and stood in apathetic silence  penrose tried to rouse him but failed  his injuries had rendered him almost in capable of coherent speech and his replies showed that his mind was rambling on the necessity of making haste and struggling hard  james penrose who was a classleader and a local preacher among the wesleyans and mentally much superior to his comrades now proved beyond a doubt that his god was to him a very present help in trouble  both he and cock knew or at least believed that death was certain to overtake them in a few minutes for both before and behind retreat was cut off and the water was increasing with frightful rapidity observing that cock looked anxious penrose turned and said earnestlyjohn you and i shall be dead in a few minutes  for myself i have no fear for my peace is already made with god through jesus christblessed be his namebut oh  john you do know that it is not so with you  turn john turn even now to the lord who tells you that though thy sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow and that now is the day of salvation if you will only repent and believe on him  pray for un james said cock whose face betrayed his fears  penrose at once clasped his hands and closing his eyes prayed for his comrade with such fervour that his voice rose loud and strong above the turmoil of the flood  he was still engaged in prayer when the water drove them from the level and compelled them to reascend the winze here john cock began to pray for himself in agonising tones  by this time oliver had partially recovered and suggested that they should ascend the winze to the top  penrose assured him that it was useless to do so but while he was still speaking he observed that the water ceased to rise and began quickly to abate  in fact all that we have taken so long to describefrom the outburst to the termination of the great rushtook place within half an hour  the noise overhead now grew less and less until it almost ceased  they then ascended to the trapdoor and tried to force it open but failed they shouted however and were heard ere long by those who had escaped and had returned to the mine to search for their less fortunate companions  the trapdoor was opened strong and willing hands were thrust down the dark winze to the rescue and in a few seconds the three men were saved  the danger was pastbut several lives had been lost in the terrible catastrophe    chapter seventeen  touches on the causes of accidents oliver in a new light and his uncle in a sad one  that was a sad day in st just which followed the event related in the last chapter  many a heartbroken wail was heard round the mouths of the shafts as the remains of those who perished were brought to the surface and conveyed to their former homes  saddest of all perhaps was the procession that marched slowly to the cottage of blind john batten and laid the two fairhaired lads before their stricken parents  tears were wrung from the strongest men there when they beheld the agonised but tearless mother guide her husbands hand to their faces that he might for the last time feel the loved ones whom she said in the bitterness of her grief he should never see more  never see more dear lass he replied with a sad smile how can thee say so  shall we not behold their dear faces again when we see our blessed lord face to face  thus the christian miner comforted himself and his sorrowing family  it is right to add that such catastrophes are not of frequent occurrence in the mines  the danger of holing to a house of water is so great and so well known that the operation is usually conducted with great care and accident is well guarded against  nevertheless an occasional act of carelessness will now and then result in a terrible disaster  a catastrophe similar in all its chief features to that which has been related in the last chapter happened in north levant mine many years ago and in the buryingground of the wesleyan chapel of st just may be seen a tombstone which bears record of the sad event as follows    sacred to the memory of james aged 20 and john aged 15   years sons of james and nanny thomas of bollowall in this parish   who were drowned with three others by the holing to a house of water   in north levant mine on the first of april 1867  a house of much larger dimensions and containing a much greater body of water than that which caused the latest destruction of life in north levant mine was cleared of water not long ago in botallack  the agents knew of its existence for the whole region both above and below ground being measured off and planned they could lay their finger on the exact spot where they knew that an old mine existed  they kept a large borer six feet long going constantly before them as they cut their way towards the point of danger  the result was that when the borer at last pierced through to the old mine there were six feet of solid rock between them and the water  through the small hole the water flowed and thus the mine was slowly but safely drained  in the other case the ground happened to be soft and had been somewhat recklessly cut away  of course there are occasionsproving the truth of the proverb that accidents will happen in the best regulated familiesin which neither foresight nor precaution can prevent evil but these are comparatively few  sometimes the cupidity of a miner will lead him for the sake of following a rich lode to approach too near and too recklessly to danger despite the vigilance of captains and cause considerable risk to the mine as well as to themselves  such was the case once long ago at botallack when the miners below the sea cut away the rock to within three or four feet of the water and actually made a small hole through so that they had to plug it up with a piece of wood  this is a fact which we can vouch for having seen the plug and heard the boulders rattling loudly over our head with each successive wave but there is no danger here because the cutting under the sea is narrow and the rock solid and intensely hard  such also was the case not many years since at levant mine where the men working in the levels under the sea drove upwards until the salt water began to trickle through to them in alarming quantitiesinsomuch that the other miners struck work and refused to go again into the mine unless the workings in that part were stopped and the place made secure  this was accordingly done and the men returned to the mine the danger here was really great because the cutting that had been made was wide and the ground overhead comparatively soft  but to return to our tale  for many days after the catastrophe oliver trembath lay in his bed suffering from severe cuts and bruises as well as from what must have been as nearly as possible concussion of the brain for he had certainly been washed down one of the winzes although he himself retained only a confused recollection of the events of that terrible day and could not tell what had befallen him  at length however he became convalescent and a good deal of his old vigour returned  during this period of illness and convalescence oliver had been constrained by old mr donnithorne to take up his abode in his house and the young doctor could not have experienced more attention and kindness from the old couple if he had been their son  rose ellis too did her best to cheer him and as we need scarcely add was wonderfully successful in her efforts  it was during this period that oliver made the acquaintance of a young man of st just named charles tregarthena congenial spiritand one who was besides a thorough gentleman and an earnest christian  with this youth he formed a sincere friendship and although the subject of religion was never obtrusively thrust upon him by young tregarthen it entered so obviously into all his thoughts and shone so clearly in his words and conduct that olivers heart was touched and he received impressions at that time which never left him  oliver and his friend were sitting one forenoon in mr donnithornes diningroom which commanded an extensive view of green fields and grasscovered stone walls with the beams and machinery of mines on the horizon and the blue sea beyond  they were planning a short walking tour which it was thought would be of great benefit to oliver in that stage of his recovery when old mr donnithorne entered the room with a somewhat perturbed expression of countenance  how are you charlie my boy he said  oliver i want to have a few minutes talk with you in my room on business i know charlie will excuse you  i was on the point of taking leave at any rate said tregarthen with a smile as he grasped olivers hand think over our plan like a good fellow i am sure mr donnithorne will approve of it and ill look in tomorrow forenoon to hear what decision you come to  oliver said mr donnithorne sitting down opposite the invalid when his friend had left and frowning portentously dyou know im a ruined man  i trust not uncle replied oliver with an incredulous smile supposing that the old gentleman was jesting  yes but i am he repeated with tremendous gravity  at all events i shall be ere long  thesethesevile jewels will be the death of me  having thus broken the ice mr donnithorne went on with much volubility of utterance and exasperation of tone to explain that legal proceedings had been instituted for the recovery of the jewels which he had purchased from the fishermen that things seemed almost certain to go against him and that in all probability he should be compelled to sell his estate in order to refund the money  but can you not sell your shares in botallack and refund with the proceeds said oliver  no i cannot replied the old gentleman  you know that at present these shares are scarcely saleable except at a ruinous discount and it would be a pity to part with them just now seeing that there is some hope of improvement at this time  there is nothing for it but to sell my estate and i dont think there will be enough left to buy butter to my bread after this unhappy affair is settled for it amounts to some thousands of pounds  indeed uncle how comes it that they found out the value of them  oh simply enough oliver but strangely too  you must know that maggot the scoundrel and yet not such a scoundrel either for the fellow informed on me in a passion without having any idea of the severity of the consequences that would followmaggot it seems kept the cloth belt in which the jewels were found tied round the owners waist and there happened to be a piece of parchment sewed up in the folds of it in which the number and value of the jewels were enumerated  this belt was ferreted out by the lawyers and the result is that as i said before i shall be a ruined man  verily added mr donnithorne with a look of vexation as he stumped up and down the room with his hands thrust deep into his breeches pockets verily my wife was a true prophetess when she told me that my sin would be sure to find me out and that honesty was the best policy  pon my conscience im half inclined to haul down my colours and let her manage me after all  i am much concerned at what you tell me said oliver and i regret now very deeply that the few hundreds which i possessed when i came hereand which you know are all my fortunehave also been invested in botallack shares for they should have been heartily at your service uncle  dont trouble yourself about your hundreds lad said the old gentleman testily i didnt come here to ask assistance from you in that way but to tell you the facts of the case and ask you to do me the favour to carry a letter to my lawyer in penzance and inquire into the condition of a mine i have something to do with therea somewhat singular mine which i think will surprise as well as interest you will you do this for me lad  most willingly replied oliver  you heard my friend charlie tregarthen speak of our intention to go on a walking tour for a couple of days now if you have no objection he and i will set off together without delay and make penzance our goal going round by the lands end and the coast  so be it oliver and dont hurry yourselves for the business will wait well enough for a day or two  but take care of yourself lad dont go swimming off the lands end again and above all things avoid smugglers  the scoundrels they have been the ruin of me oliver  not bad fellows in their way either but unprincipled characters desperately regardless of the national laws andandkeep clear of em i advise you stronglyhave nothing to do with em oliver my son  so saying the old gentleman left the room shaking his head with profound gravity    chapter eighteen  tells of king arthur and other more or less fabulous matters  next day oliver trembath and his friend charles tregarthen before the sun had mounted his own height above the horizon were on their way to the lands end  the young men were admirably suited to each other  both were well educated and possessed similar tastes though their temperaments were dissimilar and both were strong athletic youthsolivers superiority in this latter respect being at that time counterbalanced by his recent illness which reduced him nearly to a level with his less robust companion  their converse was general and desultory until they reached the lands end on the point of which they had resolved to breakfast  now oliver we have purchased an appetite said tregarthen throwing down a wallet in which he carried some provisions let us to work  stay charlie not here said oliver let us get out on the point where we shall have a better view of the cliffs on either side of the lands end  i love a wide unobstructed view  as you will oliver i leave you to select our table but i pray you to remember that however steady your head may have been in days of yore when you scaled the scottish mountains the rough reception it has met with in our cornish mines has given it a shake that renders caution necessary  pshaw  charlie dont talk to me of caution as if i were a timid old woman  nay then i talk of it because you are not a timid old woman but a reckless young man who seems bent on committing suicide  yonder is a grassy spot which i think will suit you well  he pointed to a level patch of sward on the neck of land that connects the outlying and rugged promontory which forms the extreme lands end with the cliffs of the mainland  here they spread their meal and from this point they could see the cliffs and bays of the ironbound shore extending on the one hand towards cape cornwall and on the other towards that most romantic part of the coast known by the somewhat curious name of tolpedenpenwith where rocks and caverns are found in such fantastic fashion that the spot has become justly celebrated for picturesque grandeur  at their feet far below the great waves caused by the swell for there was no wind boomed in solemn majesty encircling the cliffs with a lacework of foam while on the horizon the scilly islands could be seen shimmering faintly  a bright sun shone on the unruffled sea and hundreds of ships and boats lay becalmed on its breast  tis a splendid scene said oliver sitting down beside his friend  it is indeed and reminds me of the sea of glass before the great white throne that we read of in revelation  it is difficult to imagine or to believe that the peaceful water before us lying between this spot and the scilly islands yonder was once a land full of verdure and lifeyet such tradition tells us was the case  you mean i suppose the fabled land of lionesse said oliver  yes you have heard the story of its destruction i suppose  not i said oliver so if you have a mind to tell it me while i satisfy the cravings of an unusually sharp appetite ill consider you a most obliging fellow  pass me the knuckle of hamthanksand the bread now go ahead  tis a romantic story said tregarthen  all the better replied oliver  and terrible added tregarthen  it wont spoil my appetite said his friend  well then ill tell itto the best of my ability  the youth then began the following legend pausing ever and anon during the narration to swallow a piece of bread or a mouthful of cold tea which constituted the principal elements of their frugal meal  you must know that once upon a time long long ago in those ancient days before norman or dane had invaded this land while britain still belonged to the british and king arthur held his court in tintagels halls there was a goodly land named lethowsow or the lionesse extending a distance of thirty miles between this cape and yonder shadowy islets which seem to float like cirrus clouds on the horizon it is said that this land of lionesse was rich and fertile supporting many hundreds of families with large flocks and herds  there were no fewer than forty churches upon it from which it follows that there must have been a considerable population of welldoing people there  about the time of the events which i am going to narrate king arthurs reign was drawing to a close  treason had thinned the ranks of the once united and famous knights of the round table  it is true that sir kaye the seneschal remained true and sir ector de mans and sir caradoc and sir tristram and sir lancelot of the lake of whom it was said that he was the kindest man that ever struck with sword and he was the goodliest person that ever rode among the throng of knights and he was the meekest man and the gentlest that did ever eat in hall among ladies and he was the sternest knight to his mortal foe that ever laid lance in rest  but many seats at the round table that once were filled by brave warriors had become empty and among these that of prince mordred who it was rumoured meant to declare open war against his royal cousin and benefactor  one night king arthur sat at the round table in tintagel castle with his knights gathered round him and queen guenever with her maidens by his side  at the beginning of the feast the kings brow was clouded for although there was no lack of merriment or song there was a want of the freehearted courtesy and confidence of former days  still the semblance of unabated goodfellowship was kept up and the evening passed in gaiety until its close when the king rose to retire  taking in his hand a golden cup to pledge his guests he was about to drink when a shudder passed through his frame and he cast the goblet away exclaiming it is not wine but blood  my father merlin is among us and there is evil in the coming days  break we up our court my peers it is no time for feasting but rather for fasting and for prayer  the king glanced with a dark frown at the chair of his kinsman mordred but it was not empty  a strange indistinct shadowy form rested on it it had no human shape but a dreadful outline of something unearthly awestruck and silent the company at once broke up  on the following day news of mordreds revolt arrived at tintagel castle and day after day fresh rumours reached it of foes flocking in numbers to the rebel standard  the army increased as it advanced but strange to say king arthur showed no disposition to sally forth and meet the traitor  it seemed as if his brave heart had quailed at last and his good sword excalibur had lost its magic virtue  some thought that he doubted the fidelity of those who still remained around him but whatever the cause might have been king arthur made no preparation and indicated no feeling or intention  he lay still in his castle until the rebels had approached to the very gates  there was something terrible in this mysterious silence of the king which had a tendency to overawe the rebels as they drew near and remembered that they were about to match themselves against warriors who had grown old in fellowship with victory  when the main body of the invaders appeared the great bell of the fortress at last rang out a stirring peal and before the barbican the trumpets sounded to horse  king arthur then with his knights and menatarms the best warriors of britain arose and sallied forth to fight in their last battle  next evening a broken band of horsemen alone remained to tell of the death of their king and the destruction of all their hopes  they numbered several hundreds but their hacked armour jaded steeds and gaping wounds told that they were unfit to offer battle to any foe they were in full flight bearing a torn banner still wet with the blood of king arthur yet they fled unwillingly as men who were unused to retreat and scarce knew how to comport them in the novel circumstances  their course was in the direction of the lionesse the tract of country called in the cornish tongue lethowsow  on they dashed without uttering a word over the bleak moors before them sometimes they halted to drink at a spring or tighten their girths and occasionally a man fell behind from sheer exhaustion  at night they encamped after a hard ride of thirty miles  next morning the flight was resumed but the vindictive mordred still thundered on in pursuit ere long they heard a trumpet sounding in their rear and king arthurs men halted for a few minutes with the halfformed design of facing the foe and selling their lives dearly  while they paused in gloomy irresolution gazing sternly on the advancing host whose arms flashed back the rays of the morning sun a mist rose up between them and their foes  it was a strange shadowy mist without distinct form yet not without resemblance to something ghostly  the knights at once recognised it as the shade of merlin the great wizard  slowly the cloud uprose between the pursuers and pursued effectually protecting the latter nevertheless although baffled the former did not give up the chase  at last mordred reached a lofty slope from the top of which he descried his enemies retreating across the land of lionesse  mad with rage he descended to the plain where soft sunlight shone through luxuriant glades and across the green pastures gladdening the hearts of man and beast  nature was all peaceful and gloriously beautiful but mordreds eyes saw it not his heart felt not the sweet influences  the bitterness induced by hatred and an evil conscience reigned within as he urged his steed furiously onward  suddenly a terrible change occurred in the atmosphere which became oppressively sultry and horrible while low muttering thunders were heard and heavings of the earth felt  at the same time the cloud gradually condensed in front of mordred and assuming a distinct form stood before him in the person of merlin the wizard  for a few seconds they stood face to face frowning on each other in awful silence  then merlin raised his arm and immediately the thunders and confused mutterings increased until the earth began to undulate and rend as if the foundations of the world were destroyed  great fissures appeared and the rocks welled up like the waves of the sea  with a cry of agony the pursuers turned to fly  but it was too late  already the earth was rent into fragments it upheaved convulsively for a few seconds then sank beneath the level of the deep and the ocean rushed wildly over the land leaving nothing behind to mark the spot where land had been save the peaked and barren rocks you see before you with the surge beating continually around them  a most extraordinary tale truly said oliver  do you believe it has any foundation  i believe not the supernatural parts of it of course replied tregarthen but there is something in the fact that the land of cornwall has unquestionably given up part of its soil to the sea  you are aware i suppose that st michaels mount the most beautiful and prominent object in mounts bay has been described as a hoare rock in a wood about six miles from the sea although it now stands in the bay and this idea of a sunken land is borne out by the unquestionable fact that if we dig down a few feet into the sand of the shore near penzance we shall come on a black vegetable mould full of woodland detritus such as branches leaves of coppice wood and nuts together with carbonised roots and trunks of forest trees of larger growth and these have been found as far out as the lowest tide would permit men to dig in addition to this portions of land have been overwhelmed by the sea near penzance in the memory of men now alive  hum said oliver stretching out his huge limbs like a giant basking in the sunshine i dare say you are correct in your suppositions but i do not profess to be an antiquary so that i wont dispute the subject with you  at the same time i may observe that it does seem to me as if there were a screw loose somewhere in the historical part of your narrative for methinks i have read heard or dreamt that king arthur was mordreds uncle not his cousin and that mordred was slain and that the king was the victor at the fatal field of camelford although the victory was purchased dearlyarthur having been mortally wounded and carried back to tintagel to die there  but of course i wont pretend to doubt the truth of your narrative because of such trifling discrepancies  as to the encroachment of the sea on the cornish coast and the evidences thereof in mounts bay i raise no objection thereto but i cannot help thinking that we want stronger proof of the existence of the land of lionesse  why oliver said tregarthen laughing you began by saying that you would not dispute the subject with me and in two minutes you have said enough to have justified a regular attack on my part had i been so disposed  however we have a long road before us so i must protest against a passage of arms just now  having finished breakfast the two friends proceeded along the coast a few miles to tolpedenpenwith  here in the midst of the finest scenery on the coast they spent the greater part of the day and then proceeded to penberth cove intending to secure a lodging for the night order supper and while that was in preparation pay a visit to the famous logan rock  penberth cove is one of the prettiest little vales in the west of cornwall  it is enriched with groups of trees and picturesque cottages and possesses a luxuriant growth of shrubs and underwood that almost conceals from view the streamlet which is the chief cause of its fertility  there were also at the time we write of one or two houses which although not public inns were open for the entertainment of travellers in a semiprivate fashion  here therefore our excursionists determined to put up for the night with the widow of a fisherman who had perished in a storm while engaged in the herring fishery off the irish coast  this good womans chief physical characteristic was rotundity and her prominent mental attribute goodhumour  she at once received the gentlemen hospitably and promised to prepare supper for them while they went to visit the farfamed logan or logging rock which lay in the vicinity  this rock is one of those freaks of nature which furnish food for antiquaries points of interest to strangers and occupation to guides every one who goes to the lands end must needs visit the logan rock if he would do the country properly and if our book were a guide to cornwall we should feel bound to describe it with much particularity referring to its size form weight and rocking quality besides enlarging on the memorable incident in its career when a wild officer of the navy displaced it from its pivot by means of seamen and crowbars and was thereafter ordered to replace it a herculean task which he accomplished at great cost on pain of we know not what penalties  but as we make no pretensions to the important office of a guide we pass this lion by with the remark that oliver and his friend visited it and rocked it and then went back to penberth cove to sup on pilchards after which followed a chat then bed sound sleep daybreak and breakfast and finally the road to penzance with bright sunshine light hearts and the music of a hundred larks ringing in the sky    chapter nineteen  small talk and some account of cornish fairies  what a splendid country for a painter of cliffs observed oliver as the friends walked briskly along i wonder much that our artists do not visit it more frequently  perhaps they find metal more attractive nearer home replied tregarthen all the world has not fallen so violently in love with furzeclad moorland and rugged seacliffs as you seem to have done besides the country is somewhat remote  mayhap when a railway runs into it which will doubtless be the case before many years pass by we shall see knights of the brush pitching their white tents on the lands end meanwhile we have a few promising young men of our own who bid fair to rival the great opie himself  you have heard of him of course  i have heard of him indeed and seen some of his works but im ashamed to confess that having left cornwall when very young and been a dweller in the far north of the kingdom ever since i have only known the facts that he was a celebrated cornish artist and became the president of the royal academy  can you tell me anything of his personal history  not much but i can give you a brief outline of his career  john opie was the son of a carpenter of st agnes near truro and was discovered and extracted like a bunch of rich ore from the midst of the tinmines by dr wolcotwho was celebrated under the name of peter pindar  the doctor first observed and appreciated opies talent and resolving to bring him into notice wrote about him until he became celebrated as the cornish wonder  he also introduced people of note to the artists studio in london many of whom sat for their portraits these gave so much satisfaction that the reputation of the cornish wonder spread far and wide and orders came pouring in upon him insomuch that he became a rich man and a royal academician and ultimately president of the academy  he married an authoress and his remains were deposited in st pauls cathedral near to those of sir joshua reynolds  i have heard my grandfather say that he met him once in the town of helston and he described him as somewhat rough and unpolished but a sterling kindhearted man  did he paint landscape at all inquired oliver  not much i believe  he devoted himself chiefly to portraits  well now said oliver looking round him it strikes me that this is just the country for a landscape painter  there is nowhere else such fine cliff scenery and the wild moors which remind me much of scotland are worthy of being sketched by an able brush  people have curiously different opinions in reference to the moors which you admire so much said tregarthen  a clergyman who lived and wrote not very long ago came to cornwall in search of the picturesque and he was so disappointed with what he termed a barren desolate region that he stopped suddenly on the road between launceston and bodmin and turned his back on cornwall for ever  as might be expected such a man gave a very false idea of the country  on the other hand a more recent writer commenting on the first speaks of his delight after having grown somewhat tired of the almost too rich and overcultivated scenery of kenton coming to what he styled a sombre apparition of the desert in a corner of green england and dwells with enthusiasm on these solitudes and hills crowned with rugged rocks classical heaths and savage ravines possessing a character of desolate grandeur  but this writer did more  he travelled through the country and discovered that it possessed other and not less beautiful features that there were richly clothed vales and beautiful rivulets cultivated fields and prolific gardens in close proximity to our grand cliffs and moors  he might have added said oliver that plants and flowers flourish in the open air here and attain to a size and luxuriance which are rare in other parts of england  why i have seen myrtles laurels fuchsias pomegranates and hortensias forming hedges and growing on the windows and walls of many houses  to my mind cornwall is one of the finest counties in englandof which flora herself has reason to be proud and in which fairies as well as giants might dwell with much delight  spoken like a true cornishman said tregarthen laughing and in regard to the fairies i may tell you that we are not without a few of them although giants confessedly preponderate  indeed said oliver pray whereabouts do they dwell  you have heard of the gump i suppose  what the barren plain near carn kenidjack to the north of st just  the same  well this is said to be a celebrated haunt of the pixies who have often led benighted travellers astray and shown them wonderful sights  of course one never meets with any individual who has actually seen them but i have frequently met with those who have assured me they had known others who had conversed with persons who had seen fairies one old man in particular i have heard of who was quite convinced of the reality of a fairy scene which he once witnessed  this old fellow was crossing the gump one evening by one of the numerous paths which intersect it  it was summertime  the sun had gone down beyond the sealine and the golden mists of evening were merging into the quiet grey that hung over the atlantic  not a breath of wind passed over land or sea  to the northward chun castle stood darkly on the summit of the neighbouring hill and the cromlech loomed huge and mysterious southward were traces of mystic circles and upright stones and other of those inexplicable pieces of antiquity which are usually saddled on the overladen shoulders of the druids  everything in factin the scene the season and the weathercontributed to fill the mind of the old man with romantic musings as he wended his way over the barren moor  suddenly there arose on the air a sound of sweet soft music like the gentle breathings of an aeolian harp  he stopped and gazed around with looks of mingled curiosity and surprise but could see nothing unusual  the mysterious sounds continued and a feeling of alarm stole over him for twilight was deepening and home was still far distant  he attempted to advance but the music had such a charm for him that he could not quit the spot so he turned aside to discover if possible whence it came  presently he came to a spot where the turf was smoother and greener than elsewhere and here the most wonderful and enchanting scene met his gaze  fairies innumerable were before him real live fairies and no mistake  lying down on the grass the old man crept cautiously towards them and watched their proceedings with deep interest  they were evidently engaged in the pleasant occupation of holding a fair  there were stalls tastefully laid out and decorated with garlands of flowers  on these were spread most temptingly all the little articles of fairy costume  to be sure the said costume was very scanty and to all appearance more picturesque than useful nevertheless there was great variety  some wore heathbells jauntily stuck on their heads some were helmeted with golden blossoms of the furze and looked warlike others had nothing but their own luxuriant hair to cover them a few of the lady fairies struck the old man as being remarkably beautiful and one of these who wore an inverted tulip for a skirt with a small forgetmenot in her golden hair seemed to him the very picture of what his old molly had been fifty years before  it was particularly noticeable that the stalls were chiefly patronised by the fairy fair sex with the exception of one or two which were much frequented by the men  at these latter articles were sold which marvellously resembled cigars and brandy and the old man declared that he saw them smoke the former and that he smelt the latter but as he had himself been indulging a little that evening in smuggled spirits and tobacco we must regard this as a somewhat ungenerous statement on his part for it is ridiculous to suppose that fairies could be such senseless creatures as to smoke or drink  they danced and sang however and it was observed that one young man with a yellow nightcap and a bad cold was particularly conspicuous for his anxiety to be permitted to sing  the music was naturally the great attraction of the evening  it consisted of a large band and although some of the performers used instruments made of reeds and straws and other hollow substances cut into various forms and lengths most of them had noses which served the purpose of musical instruments admirably  indeed the leader of the band had a prolongation of the nose so like to a fleshcoloured clarionet that it might easily have been mistaken for the real thing and on this he discoursed the most seraphic music  another fairy beside him had a much longer nose which he used as a trombone with great effect  this fellow was quite a character and played with such tremendous energy that on more than one occasion he brought on a fit of sneezing which of course interrupted the music and put the clarionet in a passion  a stout old misshapen gnome or some such creature with an enormous head served for the big drum  four fairies held him down and a fifth belaboured his head with a drumstick  it sounded wonderfully hollow and convinced the old man that it was destitute of brains and not subject to headache  all the time that the old man gazed at them troops of fairies continued to arrive some on the backs of bats from which they slipped as they whirred past others descending apparently on moonbeams  the old man even fancied that he saw one attempting to descend by a starbeam which being apparently too weak to support his weight broke and let him down with a crash into the midst of a party who were very busy round a refreshment stall where a liberal supply of mountain dew was being served out but the old man never felt quite sure upon this point for at sight of the mountain dew he felt so thirsty that he determined to taste it  fixing his eyes on the stall he suddenly threw his hat into the midst of the party and made a dash at it but to his intense disappointment the vision was instantly dispelled and nothing was to be seen on the spot but a few snails creeping over the wet grass and gossamer threads bespangled with dewdrops  a very pretty little vision exclaimed oliver and not the first that has been prematurely dispelled by too ardent a pursuit of strong drink and now charlie as you appear to be in the vein and we have still some distance to go will you tell me something about the giants and how it came to pass that they were so fond of roaming about cornwall  their fondness for it oliver must be ascribed to the same cause as your ownjust because it is a lovable place said tregarthen moreover being a thinlypeopled county they were probably not much disturbed in their enjoyment of it  to recount their surprising deeds would require a longer space of time than is just now at our disposal but you have only to look round in passing through the country to understand what a mighty race of men they were  there are giants quoits as you know without end some of which have the marks of the fingers and thumbs with which they grasped them  their strength may be estimated by the fact that one of these quoits is no less than forty feet long and twenty wide and weighs some hundreds of tons  it would puzzle even your strong arm to toss such a quoit  one of these giants was a very notable fellow  he was named wrath and is said to have been in the habit of quenching his thirst at the holy well under st agness beacon where the marks of his hands made in the solid granite while he stooped to drink may still be seen  this rascal who was well named is said to have compelled poor st agnes in revenge for her refusing to listen to his addresses to carry in her apron to the top of beacon hill the pile of stones which lies there  but here we are at penzance so we shall have done with fiction for the present and revert to matters of fact  you have business with a lawyer i believe and i have business for a short time with a friend  let us appoint a time and place of meeting  what say you to the wherry mine at two oclock said oliver  it is probable that my business will be concluded by that time when we can go and see this mine together  my uncle seems to set great store by it because of an old prophecy to the effect that some day or other it will enrich somebody  why that prophecy has been fulfilled long ago said tregarthen with a laugh  the mine was a bold undertaking and at one time paid well but i fear it wont do so again  however let us meet there so farewell old boy till two    chapter twenty  the mine in the sea  true to their appointment young tregarthen and oliver trembath met at the western end of the town of penzance close to the seabeach where a mass of buildings and a chimney indicated the position of the wherry mine  olivers countenance betrayed anxiety as he came forward  nothing wrong i hope said tregarthen  well i cant say exactly that things are wrong but at the same time i dont know that they are altogether right  much the same thing said tregarthen smiling come oliver unbosom yourself as novelists say  it will do you good and two heads you know are better than one  its not easy to unbosom myself old fellow returned oliver with a troubled look for my poor uncles affairs are in a perplexed condition and i hate explanations especially when i dont understand the nature of what i attempt to explain so well not talk about it please till after our visit to the mine  let it suffice to say that that notorious smuggler jim cuttance is concerned in it and that we must go to newlyn this afternoon on a piece of business which i shall afterwards disclose  meanwhile where is this mine  lift up your eyes and behold said tregarthen pointing to an object which was surrounded by the sea and stood above two hundred yards from the beach  what that martellotowerlike object exclaimed oliver in much surprise  even so replied tregarthen who thereupon proceeded to give his friend a history and description of the mineof which the following is the substance  at the western extremity of the seabeach at penzance there is a reef of sunken rocks which shows its black crest above water at low tide  it was discovered that this reef contained tin and the people of the town attacked it with hammers and chisels when each receding tide left it exposed as long as the seasons would permit until the depth became unmanageable  after having been excavated a few fathoms the work was abandoned  fortunately for the progress of this world there exist a few enterprising men whom nothing can discourage who seem to be spurred on by opposition and to gather additional vigour and resolution from increasing difficulties  these men are not numerous but the world is seldom without a few of them and one made his appearance in penzance about the end of last century in the person of a poor miner named thomas curtis  this man conceived the bold design of sinking a shaft through this watercovered rock and thus creating a mine not only under but in the sea  with the energy peculiar to his class he set to work  the distance of the rock from the beach was about two hundred and forty yards the depth of water above it at spring tides about nineteen feet  being exposed to the open sea a considerable surf is raised on it at times by the prevailing winds even in summer while in winter the sea bursts over with such force as to render all operations on it impossible  that curtis was a man of no common force of character is obvious from the fact that apart from the difficulties of the undertaking he could not expect to derive any profit whatever from his labour for several years  as the work could only be carried on during the short period of time in which the rock was above water and part of this brief period must necessarily be consumed each tide in pumping out the water in the excavation it of course progressed slowly  three summers were consumed in sinking the pumpshaft  after this a framework or caisson of stout timber and boards was built round the mouth of the shaft and rendered watertight with pitch and oakum  it rose to a height of about twelve feet above the surface of the sea and was strengthened and supported by stout bars or buttresses of timber  a platform was placed on the top and a windlass at which four men could work was fixed thereon  this erection was connected with the shore by a stage or wherry erected on piles  the water was cleared out the men went underground and with the sea rolling over their heads and lashing wildly round the turret which was their only safeguard from terrible and instant destruction they hewed daily from the submarine rock a considerable portion of tin  these first workers however had committed an error in carrying on their operations too near the surface so that water permeated freely through the rock and the risk of the pressure above being too great for it rendered the introduction of immense supporting timbers necessary  the water too forced its way through the shaft during the winter months so that the regular working of the mine could not be carried on except in summer nevertheless this short interval was sufficient to enable the projector to raise so much ore that his mine got the reputation of being a profitable adventure and it was wrought successfully for many years  about the end of the century the depth of the pumpshaft was about four fathoms and the roof had been cut away to the thinness of three feet in some places  twelve men were employed for two hours at the windlass in hauling the water while six others were teaming from the bottom into the pump  when sufficient water had been cleared away the men laboured at the rock for six hoursin all eight hours at a time  the prolific nature of the mine may be gathered from the fact that in the space of six months ten men working about one tenth of that timeless than three weeksbroke about 600 pounds worth of ore  during one summer 3000 pounds worth of tin was raised  a steamengine was ultimately attached to the works and the mine was sunk to a depth of sixteen fathoms but the expense of working it at length became so great that it was abandonednot however before ore to the amount of 70000 pounds had been raised from under the sea  at the time of our tale another effort had been made to work the wherry mine and great expectations had been raised but these expectations were being disappointed  our unfortunate friend mr donnithorne was among the number of those who had cause to regret having ventured to invest in the undertaking and it was to make inquiries in regard to certain unfavourable rumours touching the mine that oliver trembath had been sent to penzance  after inspecting wherry mine the two friends walked along the shore together and oliver explained the nature of the difficulties in which his uncle was involved  the fact is charlie he said an old fishpurchaser of newlyn named hitchin is one of the principal shareholders in this concern  he is as rich they say as croesus and if we could only prevail on him to be amiable the thing might be carried on for some time longer with every hope of a favourable result for there can be no doubt whatever that there is plenty of tin in the mine yet and the getting of it out is only a question of time and capital  a pretty serious questionas most speculators find said tregarthen laughing you appear to think lightly of it  well i dont pretend to know much about such matters replied oliver but whatever may be the truth of the case old hitchin refuses to come forward  he says that he is low in funds just now which nobody seems to believe and that he owes an immense sum of money to jim cuttance the smuggler for what of course he will not tell but we can have no difficulty in guessing  he says that cuttance is pressing him just now and that therefore he cannot afford to advance anything on the mine this being the case it must go down and if it does one of the last few gleams of prosperity that remain to my poor uncle will have fluttered away  this must be prevented if possible and it is with that end in view that i purpose going to newlyn this afternoon to see hitchin and bring my persuasive powers to bear on him  hm not of much use i fear said tregarthen  hitchin is a tough old rascal with a hard heart and a miserly disposition  however it may be worth while to make the attempt for you have a very oily tongue oliver  and you have an extremely impudent one charlie  but can you tell me at what time the mackerel boats may be expected this evening for it seems the old fellow is not often to be found at home during the day and we shall be pretty sure to find him on the beach when the boats arrive  thus appealed to tregarthen cast a long look at the sea and sky  well i should say considering the state of the tide and the threatening appearance of the sky we may expect to see them at six oclock or thereabouts  that leaves us nearly a couple of hours to spare how shall we spend it said oliver  go and have a look at this fine old town suggested tregarthen  it is worth going over i assure you  besides the town hall market museum etcetera there are from many points of the surrounding eminences most superb views of the town and bay with our noble st michaels mount  the view from some of the heights has been said by some visitors to equal that of the farfamed bay of naples itself  part of this i have already seen said oliver the rest i hope to live to see but in the meantime tin is uppermost in my mind so if you have no objection i should like to have a look at the tinsmelting works  what say you  agreed by all means cried tregarthen poor indeed would be the spirit of the cornishman who did not feel an interest in tin    chapter twenty one  treats of tinsmelting and other matters  there is something grand in the progress of a mechanical process from its commencement to its termination  especially is this the case in the production of metals nearly every step in the course of which is marked by the hard unyielding spirit of vis inertiae on the one hand and the tremendous power of intelligence machinery and manual dexterity on the other  take for example the progress of a mass of tin from botallack  watch yonder stalwart miner at work deep in the bowels of the mine slowly with powerful blows he bores a hole in the hard rock  after one two or three hours of incessant toil it is ready for the powder it is charged the match is applied the man takes shelter behind a projection the mass is rent from its ancient bed and the miner goes off to lunch while the smoke is clearing away  he returns to his work at length coughing and rubbing his eyes for smoke still lingers there unable it would seem to find its way out and no wonder lost as it is in intricate ramifications at the depth of about one thousand five hundred feet below the green grass  he finds but a small piece of oreperhaps it is twice the size of his head it may be much larger but in any case it is an apparently poor return for the labour expended  he adds it however to the pile at his side and when that is sufficiently large fills a little iron wagon and sends it up to grass through the shaft by means of the iron kibble  here the large pieces of ore are broken into smaller ones by a man with a hammer as far as the inexperienced eye can distinguish he might be breaking ordinary stones to repair the road  these are then taken to the stamps  those who have delicate nerves would do well to keep as far as possible from the stamps of a tinmine  enormous hammers or pounders they are with shanks as well as heads of malleableiron each weighing shank and head together seven hundredweight  they are fearful things these stamps iron in spirit as well as in body for they go on for ever night and daywrought by a steamengine of one hundred horsepower as enduring as themselves  the stamps are so arranged as to be selffeeders by means of huge wooden troughs with sloping bottoms into which the ore is thrown in quantities sufficient to keep them constantly at work without requiring much or constant attendance  small streams of water trickle over the ore to keep it slowly sliding down towards the jaws where the stamps thunder up and down alternately  a dread power of pounding have they truly and woe be to the toe that should chance to get beneath them  the rock they have to deal with is as we have said uncommonly hard and it enters the insatiable mouth of the stamps about the size of a mans fist on the average but it comes out from these iron jaws so exceeding fine as to be incapable of thickening the stream of reddishyellow water that carries it away  the colour of the stream is the result of iron with which the tin is mingled  the particles of tin are indeed set free by the stamps from solid bondage but they are so fine as to be scarcely visible and so commingled with other substances such as iron copper sulphur etcetera that a tedious process of separation has yet to be undergone before the bright metal can be seen or handled  at the present time the stream containing it is poured continuously on several huge wooden tables  these tables are each slightly raised in the centre where the stream falls so that all the water runs off leaving the various substances it contains deposited on the table and these substances are spread over it regularly while being deposited by revolving washers or brushes  tin being the heaviest of all the ingredients contained in the stream falls at once to the bottom and is therefore deposited on the head or centre of the table iron being a shade lighter is found to lodge in a circle beyond while all other substances are either spread over the outer rim or washed entirely away  when the tables are fullthat is coated with what appears to be an earthy substance up wards of a foot in depththe rich tin in the centre is carefully cut out with shovels and placed in tubs while the rest is rewashed in order that the tin still mingled with it may be captureda process involving much difficulty for tin is so very little heavier than iron that the lighter particles can scarcely be separated even after repeated and careful washings  in old times the tin was collected in large pits whence it was transferred to the hands of balmaidens or minegirls to be washed by them in wooden troughs called frames which somewhat resembled a billiard table in form  indeed the frames are still largely employed in the mines but these and the modern table perform exactly the same officethey wash the refuse from the tin  being finally cleansed from all its impurities our mass of tin bears more resemblance to brown snuff than to metal  an ignorant man would suppose it to be an ordinary earthy substance until he took some of it in his hand and felt its weight  it contains however comparatively little foreign substance  about seventy per cent of it is pure tin but this seventy per cent is still locked up in the tight embrace of thirty per cent of refuse from which nothing but intense fire can set it free  at this point in the process our mass of tin leaves the rough hand of the miner  in former days it was divided among the shareholders in this formeach receiving instead of cash so many sacks of tin ore according to the number of his shares or doles and carrying it off on mule or horse back from the mine to be smelted where or by whom he pleased  but whether treated in this way or as in the present day sold by the manager at the market value it all comes at last to the tinsmelter whose further proceedings we shall now follow in company with oliver and his friend  the agent of the smelting companya stout intelligent man who evidently did knaw tinconducted them first to the furnaces in the neighbourhood of which were ranged a number of large wooden troughs or bins all more or less filled with tin ore  the ore got from different mines he said differed in quality as well as in the percentage of tin which it contained  some had much iron mixed with it in spite of all the washings it had undergone some had a little copper and other substances while some was very pure  by mixing the tin of different mines better metal could be procured than by simply smelting the produce of each mine separately  pointing to one of the bins about three yards square he told them it contained tin worth 1000 pounds there was a large quantity of black sand in one of the bins which the agent said was got by the process of streaming  it is the richest and best kind of tin ore and used to be procured in large quantities in cornwallespecially in ancient timesbeing found near the surface but as a matter of course not much of that is to be found now the land having been turned over three times in search of it  this black sand is now imported in large quantities from singapore  the agent then conducted his visitors to the testinghouse where he showed them the process of testing the various qualities of tin ore offered to the house for sale  first he weighed out twenty parts of the ore which as we have said resembled snuff  this he remarked contained about fivesixths of pure tin the remaining onesixth being dross  he mixed it with four parts of fine coal dust or culm and added a little boraxthese last ingredients being intended to expedite the smelting process  this compound was put into a crucible and subjected to the intense heat of a small furnace for about twenty minutes  at the end of that time the agent seized the crucible with a pair of tongs poured the metal into an iron mould and threw away the dross  the little mass of tin thus produced was about four inches long by half an inch broad and of a dull bluishgrey colour  it was then put into an iron ladle and melted as one would melt lead when about to cast bullets but it was particularly noteworthy here that a very slight heat was required  to extract the metal from the tin ore a fierce heat long applied was necessary but a slight heat continued for a few minutes sufficed to melt the metal  this remelted metal was poured into a stone mould where it lay like a bright little pool of liquid silver  in a few seconds it solidified retaining its clear purity in all its parts  that said the agent is tin of the very best quality  we sell it chiefly to dyers who use it for colouring purposes and for whom no tin but the best is of any use  i will now show you two other qualities namely second and inferior  he went to a small cupboard as he spoke and took therefrom a small piece of tin which had already gone through the smelting process in the crucible above described  melting this in the ladle he poured it into the mould where it lay for a few moments quite bright and pure but the instant it solidified a slight dimness clouded its centre  that explained the agent is caused by a little copper which they have failed to extract from the tin  such tin would not do for the dyers but it is good for the tinplate makers who by dipping thin sheets of iron into molten tin produce the wellknown tinplates of which our potlids and pans etcetera are manufactured  this last bit gentlemen he added taking a third piece of tin from the cupboard is our worst quality  having melted it he poured it into the mould where it assumed a dull halfsolid appearance as if it were a liquid only half frozenor if you prefer it a solid in a half molten state  this is only fit to mix with copper and make brass said the agent throwing down the mould  we test the tin ore twiceonce to find out the quantity of metal it contains and again to ascertain its quality the latter process you have seenthe former is just the same with this difference that i am much more careful in weighing measuring etcetera  every particle of dross i would have collected and carefully separated from any metal it might contain the whole should then have been reweighed and its reduction in the smelting process ascertained thus if twenty parts had been the weight of tin ore the result might perhaps have been fourteen parts of metal and six parts of dross  and now gentlemen having explained to you the testing process if you will follow me i will show you the opening of one of our furnaces  the smeltingfurnace just shows the testing process on a large scale  into this furnace six hours ago he said pointing to a brick erection in the building to which he led them we threw a large quantity of tin ore mingled with a certain proportion of culm  it is smelted and ready to be run off now  here he gave an order to a sturdy man who with brawny arms bared to the shoulders stood close at hand  he was begrimed and hairylike a very vulcan  seizing an iron poker vulcan probed the orifice of the furnace and forthwith there ran out a stream of liquid fire which was caught in an iron bowl nearly four feet in diameter  the intense heat of this pool caused the visitors to step back a few paces and the ruddy glow shone with a fierce glare on the swart frowning countenance of vulcan who appeared to take a stern delight in braving it  olivers attention was at once attracted to this man for he felt convinced that he had seen his face before but it was not until he had taxed his memory for several minutes that the scene of his adventure with the smugglers near the lands end flashed upon him when he at once recognised him as the man named joe tonkin who had threatened his life in the cavern  from a peculiar look that the man gave him he saw that he also was recognised  oliver took no further notice of him at the time however but turned to watch the flow of the molten tin  when the iron cauldron was almost full slag or molten refuse began to flow and cover the top of the metal  the hole was immediately plugged up by vulcan and the furnace cleared out for the reception of another supply of ore  the surface of the tin was now cleared of slag after which it was ladled into moulds and allowed to cool  this was the first process completed but the tin was still full of impurities and had to undergo another melting and stirring in a huge cauldron  this latter was a severe and protracted operation which vulcan performed with tremendous power and energy  in reference to this it may interest the reader to mention a valuable discovery which was the result of laziness  a man who was employed in a tinsmelting establishment at this laborious work of stirring the molten metal in order to purify it accidentally discovered that a piece of green wood dropped into it had the effect of causing it to bubble as if it were boiling  to ease himself of some of his toil he availed himself of the discovery and by stirring the metal with a piece of green wood caused such a commotion that the end in view was accomplished much more effectually and speedily than by the old process the lazy mans plan we need scarcely add is now universally adopted  the last operation was to run the metal into moulds with the smelters name on them and these ingots being of portable size were ready for sale  while the agent was busily engaged in explaining to charles tregarthen some portions of the work oliver stepped aside and accosted joe tonkin  so friend he said with a smile it seems that smuggling is not your only business  no sur it aint replied joe with a grin  im a jackofalltradesa smelter as you do see an a miner also when it suits me  im glad to hear it my man for it gives you a chance of coming in contact with better men than smugglersalthough im free to confess that there is some good among them too  i dont forget that your comrade jim cuttance hauled me out of the sea  where is he  dont knaw sur replied tonkin with an angry frown he and i dont pull well together  weve parted now  oliver glanced at the man and as he observed his stern proud expression of face and his huge powerful frame he came to the conclusion that cuttance had met a man of equal power and force of character with himself and was glad to get rid of him  but i have not gin up smuggling added the man with a smile  it do pay pretty well and is more heartylike than this sort o thing  id advise you to fall back on mining said oliver  it is hard work i know but it is honest labour and as far as i have seen there does not appear to be a more free hearty and independent race under the sun than cornish miners  joe tonkin shook his head and smiled dubiously  you do think so sur but you havent tried it  i dont like it  it dont suit me it dont  no no theres nothin like a good boat and the open sea  things are looking a little better at botallack just now joe said oliver after a pause  id strongly advise you to try it again  the man remained silent for a few minutes then he saidwell mr trembath i dont mind if i do  im tired o this work and as my time is up this very day ill go over tomorrow and see bout it  theres a man at newlyn as ive got somethin to say to ill go see him tonight and then  come along oliver shouted tregarthen at that moment its time to go  oliver bade tonkin goodafternoon and turning hastily away followed his friend  the two proceeded arm in arm up marketjew street and turning down towards the shore walked briskly along in the direction of the picturesque fishing village of newlyn which lies little more than a mile to the westward of penzance    chapter twenty two  shows how oliver and his friend went to newlyn and saw the mackerel market and found some difficulties and mysteries awaiting them there  the beach opposite newlyn presented a busy scene when oliver trembath and his friend charlie tregarthen reached it  although the zenith of the season was over mackerel fishing was still going on there in full vigour and immense crowds of men women and children covered the sands  the village lies on the heights above and crowds of people were leaning over the iron rails which guard the unwary or unsteady passenger from falling into the sea below  a steep causeway connects the main street above with the shore beneath and up and down it horses carts and people were hurrying continuously  true there was not at that time quite as much bustle as may be witnessed there at the present day  the railway has penetrated these remote regions of the west and now men work with a degree of feverish haste that was unknown then  while hundreds of little boats tenders to the large ones crowd in on the beach auctioneers with long heavy boots wade kneedeep into the water followed and surrounded by purchasers and ringing a bell as each boat comes in shoutnow then five hundred more or less in this boat who bids  twenty shillings a hundred for five hundredtwenty shillingssay nineteenim bid nineteennineteenandsixsay nineteenantwentytwenty shillings im bidsay twentyoneshall i make it twentyone shillings for any person etcetera  the bells and voices of these auctioneers loud though they be are mild compared with the shouts of men women and children as the fish are packed in baskets with hot haste to be in time for the train and horses with laden carts gallop away over the sands at furious speed while others come dashing back for more fish  and there is need for all this furious haste for trains like time and tide wait for no man and prices vary according to trains  just before the starting of one you will hear the auctioneers put the fish up at 20 shillings 25 shillings and even 30 shillings a hundred and in the next halfhour after the train is gone and no chance remains of any more of the fish being got into the london market by the following morning the price suddenly falls to 8 shillings a hundred sometimes even less  there is need for haste too because the quantity of fish is very great for there are sometimes two hundred boats at anchor in the bay each with four thousand fish on the average which must all be washed and packed in four or five hours  yes the old days cannot be compared with the present times when between the months of april and june the three hundred boats of mounts bay will land little short of three thousand tons of mackerel and the railway for the mere carriage of these to london manchester birmingham etcetera will clear above 20000 pounds  nevertheless the busy bustling hearty nature of the scene on newlyn beach in days of yore was not so very different as one might suppose from that of the present time  the men were not less energetic then than now the women were not less eager the children were quite as wild and mischievous and the bustle and noise apparently if not really as great  what interests you asked charlie tregarthen observing that his companion gazed pointedly at some object in the midst of the crowd  that old woman said oliver see how demurely she sits on yonder upturned basket knitting with all her might  in the midst of chaos observed tregarthen laughing and she looks as placidly indifferent to the noise around her as if it were only the murmuring of a summer breeze although there are two boys yelling at her very ear at this moment  perhaps shes deaf suggested oliver  tregarthen said he thought this highly probable and the two remained silent for some time watching from an elevated position on the road leading down to the sands the everchanging and amusing scene below talk of a pantomime indeed  no christmas pantomime ever got up in the great metropolis was half so amusing or so grand as that summer pantomime that was performed daily on newlyn sands with admission to all parts of the housethe stage includedfor nothing  the scenery was painted with gorgeous splendour by nature and embraced the picturesque village of newlyn with its irregular gables variously tinted roofs and whitewashed fronts the little pier with its modest harbour perfectly dry because of the tide being out but which even if the tide had been in and itself full to overflowing could not apparently have held more than a dozen of the larger fishingboats the calm bay crowded with boats of all sizes their brown and yellow sails reflected in the clear water and each boat resting on its own image on the faroff horizon might be seen the lizard point and the open sea over which hung red and lurid clouds which betokened the approach of a storm although at the time all nature was quiet and peaceful  yes the scenery was admirably painted and nothing could exceed the perfection of the acting  it was so very true to nature  right in front of the spot where the two friends stood a fisherman sat astride of an upturned basket enjoying a cup of tea which had been brought to him by a little girl who sat on another upturned basket at his side gazing with a pleased expression into his rugged countenance one cheek of which was distended with a preposterously large bite of bread and butter  the great mathews himself never acted his part so well  what admirable devotion to the one engrossing object in hand what a perfect and convincing display of a hearty appetite  what obvious unconsciousness of being looked at and what a genuine and sudden burst of indignation when owing to a touch of carelessness he capsized the cup and poured the precious tea upon the thirsty sand  at the distance from which oliver and his friend observed him no words were audible but none were necessary  the mans acting was so perfect that they knew he was scolding the little girl for the deed which he himself had perpetrated  then there was something peculiarly touching in the way in which he suddenly broke into a short laugh and patted the childs head while she wiped out the cup and refilled it from the little brown brokennosed teapot hitherto concealed under her ragged shawl to keep it warm  no wizard was needed to tell however that this was quite an unnecessary piece of carefulness on the little girls part for any brown teapot in the world possessing the smallest amount of feeling would have instantly made hot and strong tea out of cold water on being pressed against the bosom of that sunny child  just beyond this couple three tired men in blue flannel shirts long boots and souwesters grouped themselves round a bundle of straw to enjoy a pipe one stretched himself almost at full length on it in lazy nonchalance another sat down on it and resting his elbows on his knees gazed pensively at his pipe as he filled it while the third thrust his hands into his pockets and stood for a few seconds with a grand bend at the small of his back as if he felt that his muscles worked easily and gazed out to sea  the greatest of the old masters could have painted nothing finer  away to the right an old man might be seen tying up the lid of a basket full of fish beside his cart and dividing his attention between the basket and the horse which latter much to his surprise was unwontedly restive that evening and required an unusual number of cautions to remain still and of threats as to the punishment that would follow continued disobedience all of which afforded the most intense and unutterable delight to a very small precocious boy who standing concealed on the off side of the animal tickled its ear with a straw every time it bent its head towards the bundle of hay which lay at its feet  no clown or pantaloon was there to inflict condign punishment because none was needed  a brother carter standing by performed the part extempore  his eye suddenly lit on the culprit his whip sprang into the air and descended on the urchins breech  horrorstruck his mouth opened responsive to the crack and a yell came forth that rose high above the surrounding din while his little legs carried him away over the sands like a ragged leaf driven before the wind  to the left of this scene and ignorant of it for the stage was so large the actors were so numerous and the play so grand that few could do more than attend to their own part a cripple might be seen with a crutch hopping actively about  he was a young man had lost his leg by an accident probably and was looking about for a castaway fish for his own supper  he soon found one  whether it was that one had been dropped accidentally or that some generoushearted fishdealer had dropped one on purpose we cannot tell but he did get onea large fat one tooand hobbled away as quickly as he could evidently rejoicing  the cripple was not the only one who crossed the stage thus lightly burdened  there were several halt and maimed and some blind and aged ones there whose desires in regard to piscatorial wealth extended only to one or perhaps two and they all got what they wanted  that was sufficient for the evenings supperfor the morrow there was no need to care they could return to get a fresh supply evening after evening for many a day to come for it was a splendid mackerel seasonsuch as had not been for many yearsso said the sages of the village  there were other groups and other incidents that would have drawn laughter as well as tears from sympathetic hearts but we must forbear the play was long of being acted outit was no common play besides it is time for our actors to come upon the stage themselves  i see old hitchin exclaimed oliver trembath starting suddenly out of a reverie and pointing into the thickest of the crowd  how can you tell you dont know him said his companion  know him  of course i do who could fail to know him after the graphic description the lawyer gave of him  seelook yonder beside the cart with the big man in it arranging baskets  dyou see  which the one painted green and a scraggy horse with a bag hanging to its nose  no no a little further to the left manthe one with the broken rail and the highspirited horse  there there he is a thin driedup wrinkled old shabby  ah thats the man exclaimed tregarthen laughing  come along and lets try to keep our eyes on him for there is nothing so difficult as finding any one in a crowd  the difficulty referred to was speedily illustrated by the fact that the two friends threaded their way to the spot where the cart had stood and found not only that it was gone but that hitchin had also moved away and although they pushed through the crowd for more than a quarter of an hour they failed to find him  as they were wandering about thus they observed a very tall broadshouldered man talking earnestly in undertones to a sailorlike fellow who was still broader across the shoulders but not quite so tall  it is probable that oliver would have paid no attention to them had not the name of hitchin struck his ear  glancing round at the men he observed that the taller of the two was joe tonkin and the other his friend of the lands end the famous jim cuttance  oliver plucked his companion by the sleeve and whispered him to stand still  only a few words and phrases reached them but these were sufficient to create surprise and arouse suspicion  once in particular tonkin who appeared to be losing his temper raised his voice a little exclaimingi tell ee what it is cuttance i do knaw what youre up to an ill hinder ee ef i can  the man confirmed this statement with a savage oath to which cuttance replied in kind nevertheless he was evidently anxious to conciliate his companion and spoke so low as to be nearly inaudible  only the words not tonight i wont do it tonight reached the ears of the listeners  at this point tonkin turned from the smuggler with a fling muttering in an undertone as he went i dont blieve ee cuttance for theert a liard so ill watch ee booy  oliver was about to follow tonkin when he observed hitchin himself slowly wending his way through the crowd  he had evidently heard nothing of the conversation that appeared to have reference to himself for he sauntered along with a careless air and his hands in his pockets as though he were an uninterested spectator of the busy scene  oliver at once accosted him pray sir is your name hitchin  it is replied the old man eyeing his interrogator suspiciously  allow me to introduce myself siroliver trembath nephew to mr thomas donnithorne of st just  mr hitchin held out his hand and said that he was happy to meet with a nephew of his old friend in the tone of a man who would much rather not meet either nephew or uncle  oliver felt this so he put on his most insinuating air and requested mr hitchin to walk with him a little aside from the crowd as he had something of a private nature to say to him  the old man agreed and the two walked slowly along the sands to the outskirts of the crowd where young tregarthen discreetly left them  the moment oliver broached the subject of the advance of money hitchin frowned and the colour in his face betrayed suppressed anger  sir said he i know all that you would say to me  it has already been said oftener than there is any occasion for  no one appears to believe me when i assert that i have met with heavy losses of late and have no cash to sparenot even enough to pay my debts  indeed sir replied oliver i regret to hear you say so and i can only apologise for having troubled you on the subject  i assure you nothing would have induced me to do so but regard for my uncle to whom the continuance of this mine for some time would appear to be a matter of considerable importance but since you will not  wilt not interrupted hitchin angrily have i not said can not i tell you young man that there is a scoundrel to whom i owe a large sum forforwell no matter what its for but the blackguard threatens that if i dontpshaw  the old man seemed unable to contain himself at this point for he turned angrily away from oliver and hastening back towards the town was soon lost again in the crowd  oliver was so taken by surprise that he stood still gazing dreamily at the point where hitchin had disappeared until he was roused by a touch on the shoulder from charlie tregarthen  well said he smiling how fares your suit  oliver replied by a burst of laughter  how fares my suit he repeated badly very badly indeed why the old fellows monkey got up the moment i broached the subject and i was just in the middle of what i meant to be a most conciliating speech when he flung off as you have seen  odd very odd said tregarthen to see how some men cling to their money as if it were their life  after all it is life to someat least all the life they have got  come now dont moralise charlie for we must act just now  im ready to act in any way you propose oliver what do you intend to do  issue your commands and ill obey  shall we attack the village of newlyn singlehanded and set fire to it as did the spaniards of old or shall we swim off to the fleet of boats cut the cables bind the men in charge and set sail for the mackerel fishing  neither my chum and especially not the latter seeing that a thundercloud is about to break over the sea ere long if i do not greatly misjudge appearances in the sky but man we must see this testy old fellow again and warn him of the danger which threatens him i feel assured that that rascal cuttance means him harm for he let something fall in his anger which coupled with what we have already heard from the smuggler himself and from tonkin convinces me that evil is in the wind  now the question is how are we to find him for searching in that crowd is almost useless  let us go to his house suggested tregarthen and if he is not at home wait for him  do you know where his house is  no not i  then we must inquire so come along  pushing once more through the throng of busy men and women the friends ascended the sloping causeway that led to the village and here asked the first man they met where mr hitchin lived  right over top o hill replied the man  thank you  thatll do charlie come along said oliver turning into one of the narrow passages that diverged from the main street of newlyn and ascending the hill with giant strides one should never be particular in their inquiries after a place  when im told to turn to the right after the second turning to the left and that if i go right on till i come to some other turning that will conduct me point blank to the street that enters the square near to which lies the spot i wish to reach im apt to get confused  get a general direction if possible the position indicated by compass is almost enough and ask again thats my plan and i never found it fail    chapter twenty three  in which is recorded a visit to an infantschool a warning to a thankless old gentleman also a storm and a sudden as well as surprising end of a mine besides dark designs  oliver trembaths plan of asking again had to be put in practice sooner than had been anticipated for the back alleys and lanes of newlyn were a little perplexing to a stranger  let us inquire here said tregarthen seeing the halfopen door of a very small cottage with part of a womans back visible in the interior  by all means said oliver pushing open the door and stooping low as he entered  the visitors were instantly transfixed by thirty pair of eyesall of them bright blue or bright blackfew of them elevated much more than two feet from the ground and not one of them dimmed by the smallest approach to a wink  nay on the contrary they all opened so wide when the strangers entered that it seemed as if either winking or shutting were in future out of the question and that to sleep with eyes wide open was the sad prospect of the owners thereof in all time coming  an infantschool murmured tregarthen  the very smallest boy in the schoolan infant with legs about five inches long who sat on a stool not more than three inches high appeared to understand what he said and to regard it as a personal insult for he at once began to cry  a little girl with bright red hair a lovely complexion and a body so small as to be scarce worth mentioning immediately embraced the small boy whereupon he dried his eyes without delay  you have a nice little school here said oliver  iss sur we do feel proud of it said the goodlooking motherly dame in charge with a little twitch of her shoulders which revealed the horrible fact that both her arms had been taken off above the elbows the childn are very good and they do sing bootiful  now then let the gentlemen hear youo thatll become  instantly and in every possible pitch the thirty mouths belonging to the thirty pair of eyes opened and o that will be joyful etcetera burst forth with thrilling power  a few leading voices gradually turned the torrent into a united channel and before the second verse was reached the hymn was tunefully sung the sweet voice of the little girl with the bright hair being particularly distinguishable and the shrill pipe of the smallest boy sounding high above the rest as he sang o that will be doyful doyful doyful doyful with all his might and main  when this was finished tregarthen asked the schoolmistress what misfortune had caused the loss of her arms to which she replied that she had lost them in a coach accident  as she was beginning to relate the history of this sad affair oliver broke in with a question as to where old mr hitchins house was  being directed to it they took leave of the infantschool and soon found themselves before the door of a small cottage  they were at once admitted to the presence of the testy old hitchin who chanced to be smoking a pipe at the time  he did not by any means bestow a welcome look on his visitors but oliver nevertheless advanced and sat down in a chair before him  i have called mr hitchin he began not to trouble you about the matter which displeased you when we conversed together on the beach but to warn you of a danger which i fear threatens yourself  what danger may that be inquired hitchin in the tone of a man who held all danger in contempt  what it is i cannot tell but  cannot tell interrupted the old man then whats the use of troubling me about it  neither can i tell of what use my troubling you may be retorted oliver with provoking coolness but i heard the man speak of you on the beach less than an hour ago and as you referred to him yourself i thought it right to call  at this point hitchin again broke inheard a man speak of mewhat man  really mr trembath your conduct appears strange to me  will you explain yourself  certainly  i was going to have added if your irascible temper would have allowed me that the notorious smuggler jim cuttance  oliver stopped for at the mention of the smugglers name the pipe dropped from the old mans mouth and his face grew pale  jim cuttance he exclaimed after a moments pause the villain the scoundrelwhat of him what of him  no good i warrant  there is not a rogue unhanged who deserves more richly to swing at the yardarm than jim cuttance  what said he about me  when he finished this sentence the old mans composure was somewhat restored  he took a new pipe from the chimneypiece and began to fill it while oliver related all that he knew of the conversation between the two smugglers  when he had finished hitchin smoked for some minutes in silence  do you really think he said at length that the man means to do me bodily harm  i cannot tell replied oliver you can form your own judgment of the matter more correctly than i can but i would advise you to be on your guard  what says your friend asked hitchin turning towards tregarthen of whom up to that point he had taken no notice  thus appealed to the youth echoed olivers opinion and added that the remark of cuttance about his intention not to do something unknown that night and joe tonkins muttered expressions of disbelief and an intention to watch seemed to him sufficient to warrant unusual caution in the matter of locks bolts and bars  as he spoke there came a blinding flash of lightning followed by a loud and prolonged peal of thunder  oliver sprang up  we must bid you goodnight he said for we have to walk to st just and dont wish to get more of the storm than we can avoid  but you cannot escape it said hitchin  nevertheless we can go as far as possible before it begins and then take shelter under a bush or hedge or in a house if we chance to be near one  i would rather talk in rain any day than drive in a kittereen  pray be persuaded to stop where you are gentlemen said the old man in a tone of voice that was marvellously altered for the better  i can offer you comfortable quarters for the night and good though plain fare with smuggled brandy of the best and tobacco to match  still oliver and tregarthen persisted in their resolution to leave until hitchin began to plead in a tone that showed he was anxious to have their presence in the house as protectors  then their resolution began to waver and when the old man hinted that they might thus find time to reconsider the matter of the wherry mine they finally gave in and made up their minds to stay all night  according to the opinion of a celebrated poet the bestlaid plans of men as well as mice are apt to miscarry  that night the elements contrived to throw mens calculations out of joint and to render their cupidity villainy and wisdom alike ineffectual  a storm the fiercest that had visited them for many years burst that night on the southern shores of england and strewed her rocks and sands with wrecks and dead bodies  nothing new in this alas as all know who dwell upon our shores or who take an interest in and read the records of our royal and noble lifeboat institution  but with this great subject we have not to do just now further than to observe as we have said before that in those days there were no lifeboats on the coast  under the shelter of an old house on the shore at penzance were gathered together a huge concourse of townspeople and seafaring men watching the storm  it was a grand and awful sightone fitted to irresistibly solemnise the mind and incline it unless the heart be utterly hardened to think of the great creator and of the unseen world which seems at such a season to be brought impressively near  the night was extremely dark and the lightning by contrast peculiarly vivid  each flash appeared to fill the world for a moment with lambent fire leaving the painful impression on observers of having been struck with total blindness for a few seconds after and each thunderclap came like the bursting of artillery with scarcely an interval between the flash and crash while the wind blew with almost tropical fury  the terrible turmoil and noise were enhanced tenfold by the raging surf which flew up over the roadway and sent the spray high above and beyond the tops of the houses nearest to the shore  the old house creaked and groaned in the blast as if it would come down and the men taking shelter there looked out to sea in silence  the bronzed veterans there knew full well that at that hour many a despairing cry was being uttered many a hand was stretched wildly helplessly and hopelessly from the midst of the boiling surf and many a soul was passing into eternity  they would have been ready then as well as now to have risked life and limb to save fellowcreatures from the sea but ordinary boats they knew could not live in such a storm  among the watchers there stood jim cuttance  he had been drinking at a publichouse in penzance and was at the time to use his own expression three sheets in the windthat is about halfdrunk  what his business was nobody knew and we shall not inquire but he was the first to express his belief that the turret and bridge of the wherry mine would give way  as he spoke a vivid flash of lightning revealed the stout timbers of the mine standing bravely in the storm each beam and chain painted black and sharp against the illumined sky and the foaming sea  she have stud out many a gale observed a weatherbeaten old seaman praps she wont go down yet  i do hope she wont observed another  she havent got a chance said cuttance  just then another flash came and there arose a sharp cry of alarm from the crowd for a ship was seen driving before the gale close in upon the land so close that she seemed to have risen there by magic and appeared to tower almost over the heads of the people  the moments of darkness that succeeded were spent in breathless intense anxiety  the flashes which had been fast enough before seemed to have ceased altogether now but again the lightning gleamedbright as full moonlight and again the ship was seen nearer than beforeclose on the bridge of the mine  tis the yankee ship broken from her anchors in gwavus lake exclaimed a voice  the thunderpeal that followed was succeeded by a crash of rending timber and flying bolts that almost emulated the thunder  certainly it told with greater power on the nerves of those who heard it  once again the lightning flashed and for a moment the american vessel was seen driving away before the wind but no vestige of wherry mine remained  the bridge and all connected with it had been completely carried away and its shattered remnants were engulfed in the foaming sea  it deserved a better fate but its course was run and its hour had come  it passed away that stormy night and now nothing remains but a few indications of its shaftmouth visible at low water to tell of one of the boldest and most singular of mining enterprises ever undertaken and carried out by man  there was one spectator of this imposing scene who was not very deeply impressed by it  jim cuttance cared not a straw for storms or wrecks so long as he himself was safe from their influence  besides he had other work in hand that night so he left the watchers on the beach soon after the destruction of the bridge  buttoning his coat up to the neck and pulling his souwester tight over his brows he walked smartly along the road to newlyn while many of the fishermen ran down to the beach to render help to the vessel  between the town of penzance and the village of newlyn several old boats lay on the grass above highwater mark  here the smuggler stopped and gave a loud whistle  he listened a moment and than repeated it still louder  he was answered by a similar signal and four men in sailors garb issuing from behind one of the boats advanced to meet him  all right bill inquired cuttance  all right sur was the reply  didnt i tell ee to leave them things behind said cuttance sternly as he pointed to the butt of a pistol which protruded from the breastpocket of one of the men sure we dont require powder and lead to overcome an old man  no more do we need a party o five to do it replied the man doggedly  to this cuttance vouchsafed no reply but plucking the weapon from the man he tossed it far into the sea and without further remark walked towards the fishing village followed by his men  by this time the thunder and rain had abated considerably but the gale blew with increased violence and as there were neither moon nor stars the darkness was so intense that men less acquainted with the locality would have been obliged to proceed with caution  but the smugglers knew every foot of the ground between the lizard and the lands end and they advanced with rapid strides until they reached the low wall that encompassed but could not be said to guard old mr hitchins gardenplot  the hour was suited for deeds of darkness being a little after midnight and the noise of the gale favoured the burglars who leaped the wall with ease and approached the back of the cottage  in ordinary circumstances hitchin would have been in bed and cuttance knew his habits sufficiently to be aware of this his surprise therefore was great when he found lights burning and greater still when peeping through a chink of the windowshutter he observed two stout fellows seated at the old mans table  charles tregarthen he had never seen before and as oliver trembath sat with his back to the window he could not recognise him  theres company wi the owld man said cuttance returning to his comrades two men young and stout but we do knaw how to manage they  this was said by way of an appeal and was received with a grin by the others and a brief recommendation to go to work without delay  for a few minutes they whispered together as to the plan of attack and then having agreed on that point they separated  cuttance and the man whom he had called bill went to the window of the room in which hitchin and his guests were seated and stationed themselves on either side of it  the sill was not more than breast high  the other three men quickly returned bearing a heavy boatsmast which they meant to use as a batteringram  it had been arranged that cuttance should throw up the window and at the same moment his comrades should rush at the shutter with the mast  the leader could not see their faces but there was light sufficient to enable him to distinguish their dark forms standing in the attitude of readiness  he therefore stepped forward and made a powerful effort to force up the window but it resisted him although it shook violently  those inside sprang up at the sound and the smugglers sank down as if by mutual consent among the bushes which grew thickly near the window  i told you it was only the wind said oliver trembath who had opened the shutter and gazed through the window for some time into the darkness where of course he saw nothing  well was it for him that cuttance refused to follow bills advice which was to charge him through the window with the mast  the former knew that with the window fastened it would be impossible to force an entrance in the face of such a youth as tregarthen even although they succeeded in rendering the other hors de combat so he restrained bill and awaited his opportunity  olivers remark appeared to be corroborated by a gust of wind which came while he was speaking and shook the windowframe violently  there it is again he said turning to his host with a smile  depend upon it they wont trouble you on such a night as this  he closed and refastened the shutter as he spoke and they all returned to their places at the table  unfortunately oliver had not thought of examining the fastening of the window itself  had he done so he would have seen that it was almost wrenched away  cuttance saw this however and resolved to make sure work of it next time  when the men with the batteringram were again in position he and bill applied their united strength to the window and it instantly flew up to the top  at same moment bolts and bars gave way and the shutter went in with a crash  making use of the mast as a rest cuttance sprang on the windowsill and leaped into the room  the whole thing was done with such speed and if we may so express it with such simultaneity of action that the bold smuggler stood before the astonished inmates almost as soon as they could leap from their chairs  cuttance ducked to evade a terrific blow which oliver aimed at him with his fist and in another instant grappled with him  tregarthen rushed to the window in time to meet bill on whose forehead he planted a blow so effectual that that worthy fell back into the arms of his friends who considerately let him drop to the ground and made a united assault on charlie  had oliver trembath possessed his wonted vigour he would speedily have overcome his adversary despite his great strength but his recent illness had weakened him a little so that the two were pretty equally matched  the consequence was that neither daring to loosen his hold in order to strike an effective blow each had to devote all his energies to throw the other in which effort they wrenched thrust and swung each other so violently round the room that chairs and tables were overturned and smashed and poor old hitchin had enough to do to avoid being floored in the melee and to preserve from destruction the candle which lighted the scene of the combat  at first oliver had tried to free his right hand in order to strike but finding this impossible he attempted to throw the smuggler and with this end in view lifted him bodily in the air and dashed him down but cuttance managed to throw out a leg and meet the ground with his foot which saved him  he was a noted wrestler  he could give the famous cornish hug with the fervour of a black bear and knew all the mysteries of the science  often had he displayed his great muscular power and skill in the ring where wrestlers were wont to engage in those combats of which the poet writes    they rush impetuous with a shock   their arms implicit rigid lock   they twist they trip their limbs are mixed   as one they move as one stand fixed   now plant their feet in wider space   and stand like statues on their base  but never before had jim cuttance had to deal with such a man as oliver trembath who swung him about among the chairs and crashed him through the tables until seizing a sudden opportunity he succeeded in flinging him flat on the floor where he held him down and planted his knee on his chest with such force that he nearly squeezed all the breath out of him  no word did jim cuttance utter for he was incapable of speech but the colour of his face and his protruding tongue induced oliver to remove his knee  meanwhile charlie tregarthen had enough to do at the window  after he had tumbled bill out as we have described two of the other men sprang at him and seizing him by the collar of his coat attempted to drag him out  one of these he succeeded in overthrowing by a kick on the chest but his place was instantly taken by the third of the bearers of the batteringram and for a few minutes the struggle was fierce but undecided  suddenly there arose a great shout and all three tumbled head over heels into the shrubbery  it was at this moment that oliver rose from his prostrate foe  he at once sprang to the rescue leaped out of the window and was in the act of launching a blow at the head of the first man he encountered when a voice shoutedhold on sur  it is certain that oliver would have declined to hold on had not the voice sounded familiar  he held his hand and next moment charlie appeared in the light of the window dragging a struggling man after him by the nape of the neck  at the same time joe tonkin came forward trailing another man by the hair of the head  has cuttance got off inquired tonkin  no replied oliver leaping back into the room just in time to prevent jim who had recovered from making his escape  now my man keep quiet said oliver thrusting him down into a chair you and i have met before and you know that it is useless to attempt resistance  cuttance vouchsafed no reply but sat still with a dogged expression on his weatherbeaten visage  hitchin whose nerves were much shaken by the scene of which he had been a trembling spectator soon produced ropes with which the prisoners were bound and then they were conducted to a place of safe keeping each of the victors leading the man he had secured and old hitchin going beforean excited advanceguard  the two men whom tregarthen knocked down had recovered and made their escape just before the fight closed  oliver trembath walked first in the procession leading jim cuttance  i gave you credit for a more manly spirit than this said oliver as he walked along  how could you make so cowardly an attack on an old man  cuttance made no reply and oliver felt sorry that he had spoken for the remembrance of the incident at the lands end was strong upon him and he would have given all he possessed to have had no hand in delivering the smuggler up to justice  at the same time he felt that the attempt of cuttance was a dastardly one and that duty required him to act as he did  it seemed to oliver as if joe tonkin had divined his thoughts for at that moment he pushed close to him and whispered in his ear jim cuttance didnt mean to rob th owld man sur  he only wanted to give he a fright an make un pay what he did owe un  this was a new light on the subject to oliver who at once formed his resolution and acted on it  cuttance he said it is not unlikely that if brought to justice you will swing for this nights adventure  he paused and glanced at the face of his prisoner who still maintained rigid silence  well continued our hero i believe that your intentions against mr hitchin were not so bad as they would appear to be  who told ee that asked the smuggler sternly  no matter replied oliver drawing a knife from his pocket with which he deliberately cut the cords that bound his prisoner  thereyou are free  i hope that you will make better use of your freedom in time to come than you have in time past although i doubt it much but remember that i have repaid the debt i owe you  nay replied cuttance still continuing to walk close to his companions side  i did give you life  you have but given me liberty  id advise you to take advantage of that liberty without delay said oliver somewhat nettled by the mans remark as well as by his cool composure else your liberty may be again taken from you in which case i would not give much for your life  if you do not assist there is no one here who can take me now replied cuttance with a smile  however im not ungrateful goodnight  as he said this the smuggler turned sharp to the right into one of the numerous narrow passages which divide the dwellings of newlyn and disappeared  charles tregarthen who was as sharp as a needle observed this and leaving his man in charge of tonkin darted after the fugitive  he soon returned however wiping the perspiration from his brow and declaring that he had wellnigh lost himself in his vain endeavours to find the smuggler  how in all the world did you manage to let him go he demanded somewhat sharply of oliver  why charlie replied his friend with a laugh you know i have not been trained to the duties of a policeman and it has always been said that jim cuttance was a slippery eel  however hes gone now so we had better have the others placed in safe custody as soon as possible  saying this he passed his arm through that of old mr hitchin and soon after the smugglers were duly incarcerated in the lockup of penzance    chapter twenty four  exhibits the managing director and the secretary of wheal dooem in confidential circumstances and introduces the subject of locals  about this time that energetic promoter of mining operations mr george augustus clearemout found it necessary to revisit cornwall  he was seated in an easychair in a snug little backoffice or boardroom in one of the airiest little streets of the city of london when this necessity became apparent to him  mr clearemout did not appear to have much to do at that particular time for he contented himself with tapping the arm of his easychair with the knuckles of his right hand while he twirled his gold watchkey with his left and smiled occasionally  to judge from appearances it seemed that things in general were prospering with george augustus  everything about him was new and we might almost say gorgeous  his coat and vest and pantaloons had a look and a cut about them that told of an extremely fashionable tailor and a correspondingly fashionable price  his rings of which he wore several were massive one of them being a diamond ring of considerable value his boots were faultlessly made quite new and polished so highly that it dazzled one to look at them while his linen of which he displayed a large quantity on the breast was as white as snownot london snow of course  altogether mr ga clearemout was a most imposing personage  come in he said in a voice that sounded like the deep soft whisper of a trombone  the individual who had occasioned the command by tapping at the door opened it just enough to admit his head which he thrust into the room it was a shaggy red head belonging to a lad of apparently eighteen its chief characteristics being a prolonged nose and a retracted chin with a gash for a mouth and two blue holes for eyes  please sir mr muddle said the youth  admit mr muddle  the head disappeared and immediately after a gentleman sauntered into the room and flung himself lazily into the empty armchair which stood at the fireplace visavis to the one in which mr clearemout sat explaining that he would not have been so ceremonious had he not fancied that his friend was engaged with some one on business  how are you jack said george augustus  pretty bobbish replied jack  he was the same jack whom we have already introduced as being mr clearemouts friend and kindred spirit  any news inquired mr clearemout  no nothing moving said jack languidly  hm i see it is time to stir now jack for the wheel of fortune is apt to get stiff and creaky if we dont grease her now and then and give her a jog  here is a little pot of grease which i have been concocting and intend to lay on immediately  he took a slip of paper from a large pocketbook which lay at his elbow on the new green clothcovered table and handed it to his friend who slowly opened and read it in a slovenly way mumbling the most of it as he went on  wheal dooem in

esquire 99 new gull street londonmsecretary john muddle esquireahem  but i say it wont do to publish anything of this sort just yet you know said secretary jack in a remonstrative tone for theres nothing doing at all i believe  i beg your pardon replied the managing director there is a good deal doing  i have written to st just appointing the local manager and it is probable that things are really under way by this time besides i shall set out for cornwall tomorrow to superintend matters leaving my able secretary in charge here in the meantime and when he hears from me this paper may be completed and advertised  i say it looks awful reallike dont it said jack with a grin only fancy if it should turn out to be a good mine after allwhat a lark that would be and it might you know for it was a real one once wasnt it  and if you set a few fellows to sink the whatdyecallems and drive the thingumbobs it is possible they may come upon tin and copper or something of that sortwouldnt it be jolly  of course it would and that is the very thing that gives zest to it its a speculation not a swindle by any means and admirably suits our easy consciences  but i say jack you must break yourself off talking slang  it will never do to have the secretary of the great wheal dooem mining company talk like a street boy  besides i hate slang even in a blackguardnot to mention a blacklegso you must give it up jack you really must else youll ruin the concern at the very beginning  secretary jack started into animation at this  why george he said drawing himself up i can throw it off when i please  look heresuppose yourself an inquiring speculatorahem  i assure you sir that the prospects of this mine are most brilliant and the discoveries that have been made in it since we commenced operations are incredibleabsolutely incredible sir  some of the lodes thats the word isnt it are immensely rich and upwards of a hundred feet thick while the part that runs under the sea or is to run under the sea at a depth of three thousand fathoms is probably as rich in copper ore as the celebrated botallack whose majestic headland bristling with machinery overhangs the raging billows of the wide atlantic etcetera etcetera  o george its a great lark entirely  youll have to learn your lesson a little better else youll make a great mess of it said clearemout  a muddle of itaccording to my name and destiny george said the secretary a muddle of it and a fortune by it  here the secretary threw himself back in the easychair and grinned at the opposite wall where his eye fell on a large picture which changed the grin into a stare of surprise  what have we here george he said rising and fitting a gold glass in his eyenot a portrait of wheal dooem is it  you have guessed right replied the other  i made a few sketches on the spot and got a celebrated artist to put them together which he has done you see with considerable effect  here in the foreground you observe continued the managing director taking up a new white pointer stands wheal dooem on a prominent crag overlooking the atlantic with gurnards head just beyond  farther over we have the celebrated levant mine and the famous botallack and the great wheal owles and a crowd of other more or less noted mines with cape cornwall and the lands end and tolpedenpenwith in the middledistance and the celebrated logan rock behind them while we have mounts bay with the beautiful town of penzance and st michaels mount and the lizard in the background with france in the remote distance  dear dear me quite a geographical study i declare exclaimed secretary jack examining the painting with some care  can you really see all these places at once from wheal dooem  not exactly from wheal dooem jack but if you were to go up in a balloon a few hundred yards above the spot where it stands you might see em all on a very clear day if your eyes were good  the fact is that i regard this picture as a triumph of art exhibiting powerfully what is by artists termed bringing together and great breadth united with exceedingly minute detail  the colouring too is highvery high indeed and the chiaroscuro is perfect  ha interposed jack all the chiar being on the surface and the oscuro down in the mine eh  exactly so replied clearemout  it is a splendid picture  the artist regards it as his chef doeuvre and you must explain it to all who come to the office as well as those magnificent geological sections rolledup in the corner which it would be well by the way to have hung up without delay  they arrived only this morning  and now jack having explained these matters i will leave you to study them at your leisure while i prepare for my journey to cornwall where by the way i have my eye upon a sweet little girl whose uncle i believe has lots of tin both in the real and figurative sense of the word something may come of itwho knows  next morning saw the managing director on the road and in due time he found his way by coach kittereen and gig to st just where as before he was hospitably received by old mr donnithorne  that gentlemans buoyancy of spirit however was not quite so great as it had been a few months before but that did not much affect the spirits of clearemout who found good mrs donnithorne as motherly and rose ellis as sweet as ever  it happened at this time that oliver trembath had occasion to go to london about some matter relating to his deceased mothers affairs so the managing director had the field all to himself  he therefore spent his time agreeably in looking after the affairs of wheal dooem during the day and making love to rose ellis in the evening  poor rose was by no means a flirt but she was an innocent straightforward girl ignorant of many of the worlds ways and of a trusting disposition  she found the conversation of mr clearemout agreeable and did not attempt to conceal the fact  mr clearemouts vanity induced him to set this down to a tender feeling although rose never consciously gave him by word or look the slightest reason to come to such a conclusion  one forenoon mr clearemout was sitting in mr donnithornes diningroom conversing with rose and mrs donnithorne when the old gentleman entered and sat down beside them  i had almost forgotten the original object of my visit this morning said the managing director with a smile and a glance at rose the fact is that i am in want of a man to work at wheal dooem a steady trustworthy man who would be fit to take chargebecome a sort of overseer can you recommend one  mr donnithorne paused for a moment to reflect but mrs donnithorne deeming reflection quite unnecessary at once repliedwhy there are many such men in st just  theres john cock as good a man as you could find in all the parish and david trevarrow and james penrose hes a firstrate man you remember him my dear  turning to her worse halfone of our locals you know  yes my dear i remember him perfectlyyou could not mr clearemout get a better man i should say  i think you observed madam said mr clearemout that this man is a local  pray what is a local  rose gave one of her little laughs at this point and her worthy aunt exclaimedla  mr clearemout dont you know what a local preacher is  oh a preacher  connected with the methodist body i presume  yes and a firstrate man i assure you  but said mr clearemout with a smile i want a miner not a preacher  well he is a miner and a good one too  allow me to explain my dear said mr donnithorne interrupting his spouse  you may not be aware sir that many of our miners are men of considerable mental ability and some of them possess such power of speech and so earnest a spirit that the wesleyan body have appointed them to the office of local preaching  they do not become ministers however nor are they liable to be sent out of the district like them they dont give up their ordinary calling but are appointed to preach in the various chapels of the district in which they reside and thus we accomplish an amount of work which could not possibly be overtaken by the ordinary ministry  indeed but are they not untrained men liable to teach erroneous doctrine asked mr clearemout  they are not altogether untrained men replied mr donnithorne  they are subjected to a searching examination and must give full proof of their christianity knowledge and ability before being appointed  and good excellent christian men many of them are observed mrs donnithorne with much fervour  quite true said her husband  this james penrose is one of our best local preachers and sometimes officiates in our principal chapel  i confess however that those who have the management of this matter are not always very judicious in their appointments  some of our young men are sorely tempted to show off their acquirements and preach themselves instead of the gospel and there are one or two whom i could mention whose hearts are all right but whose brains are so muddled and empty that they are utterly unfit to teach their fellows we must not however look for perfection in this world mr clearemout a little chaff will always remain among the wheat  there is no system without some imperfection and i am convinced that upon the whole our system of appointing local preachers is a firstrate one  at all events it works well which is one of the best proofs of its excellence  perhaps so said mr clearemout with the air of a man who did not choose to express an opinion on the subject nevertheless i had rather have a man who was not a local preacher  you can see and hear him and judge for yourself said mr donnithorne for he is i believe to preach in our chapel tomorrow and if you will accept of a seat in our pew it will afford my wife and myself much  thank you interrupted mr clearemout i shall be very glad to take advantage of your kind offer  service you say begins at  ten precisely said mr donnithorne    chapter twenty five  shows the miner in his sunday garb and astonishes clearemout besides relating some incidents of an accident  the sun rose bright and hot on sunday morning but the little birds were up before the great luminary singing their morning hymn with noisy delight  it was a peaceful day  the wind was at rest and the sea was calm  in the ancient town of st just it was peculiarly peaceful for the numerous and untiring stampswhich all the week had continued their clang and clatter morning noon and night without intermissionfound rest on that hallowed day and the great engines ceased to bow their massive heads with the exception of those that worked the pumps  even these however were required to do as little work as was compatible with the due drainage of the mines and as their huge pulsations were intermittentfew and far betweenthey did not succeed in disturbing the universal serenity of the morning  if there are in this country men who more than any other need repose we should say they are the miners of cornwall for their weeks work is exhausting far beyond that of most other labourers in the kingdom perhaps the herculean men employed in malleableiron works toil as severely but besides the cheering consciousness of being well paid for their labour these men exert their powers in the midst of sunlight and fresh air while the miners toil in bad air and get little pay in hard times  sunday is indeed to them the sabbathdayit is literally what that word signifies a day of muchrequired rest for body soul and spirit  pity that the good old word which god gave us is not more universally used among christians  would it not have been better that the translation restday had been adopted so that even ignorant men might have understood its true signification than that we should have saddled it with a heathen name to be an apple of discord in all generations however sunday it is so sunday it will stand we suppose as long as the world lasts  after all despite its faulty origin that word is invested with old and hallowed associations in the minds of many so we enter our protest against the folly of our forefathers very humbly beseeching those who are prone to become nettled on this subject to excuse our audacity  well as we have said the sunday morning to which we refer was peaceful so would have been maggots household had maggots youngest baby never been born but having been born that robust cherub asserted his right to freedom of action more violently than ever did the most rabid radical or tyrannical tory  he swarmed about the house and kicked and yelled his uttermost to the great distress of poor little grace whose anxiety to get him ready for chapel was gradually becoming feverish  but baby maggot had as much objection to go to chapel as his wicked father who was at that time enjoying a pipe on the cliffs and intended to leave his family to the escort of david trevarrow fortunately baby gave in about halfpast nine so that little grace had him washed and dressed and on his way to chapel in pretty good time all things considered  no one who entered the wesleyan chapel of st just that morning for the first time could have imagined that a large proportion of the welldressed people who filled the pews were miners and balmaidens some of the latter were elegantly we might almost say gorgeously attired insomuch that but for their hands and speech they might almost have passed for ladies of fashion  the very latest thing in bonnets and the newest mantles were to be seen on their pretty heads and shapely shoulders  as we have said before and now repeat this circumstance arose from the frequency of the visits of the individual styled johnny fortnight whose great aim and end in life is to supply miners chiefly the females among them with the necessaries and unnecessaries of wearing apparel  when the managing director entered mr donnithornes pew and sat down beside his buxom hostess he felt but of course was much too well bred to express astonishment for his host had told him that a large number of the people who attended the chapel were miners and for a time he failed to see any of the class whom he had hitherto been accustomed to associate with rustyred and torn garbs and dirty hands and faces  but he soon observed that many of the stalwart seriouslooking men with black coats and white linen had strong muscular hands with hardlooking knuckles which in some instances exhibited old or recent cuts and bruises  it was a new sight for the managing director to behold the large and apparently welloff families filing into the pews for to say truth mr clearemout was not much in the habit of attending church and he had never before entered a methodist chapel  he watched with much curiosity the gradual filling of the seats and the grave quiet demeanour of the people  especially interesting was it when maggots family came in and sat down with the baby maggot in charge of little grace  mr clearemout had met maggot and had seen his family but interest gave place to astonishment when mrs penrose walked into the church backed by her sixteen children the eldest males among whom were miners and the eldest females tindressers while the little males and females aspired to be miners and tindressers in the course of time  thats penroses family whispered mr donnithorne to his guest  what the locals family  mr donnithorne nodded  soon after a tall gentlemanly man ascended the pulpit  the managing director was disappointed  he had come there to hear a miner preach and behold a clergyman  who is he inquired clearemout  but mr donnithorne did not answer  he was looking up the hymn for mrs d who being shortsighted claimed exemption from the duty of looking up anything  besides he was a kind good man at heartthough rather fond of smuggling and given to the bottle according to oliver trembaths account of himand liked to pay his wife little attentions  but there were still greater novelties in store for the london man that morning  it was new to him to hear john wesleys beautiful hymns sung to equally beautiful tunes which were not however unfamiliar to his ear and sung with a degree of fervour that quite drowned his own voice powerful and deep though it was  it was a new and impressive thing to hear the thrilling earnest tones of the preacher as he offered up an eloquent extempore prayerto the petitions in which many of the people in the congregation gave utterance at times to startlingly fervent and loud responsesnot in set phraseology but in words that were called forth by the nature of each petition such as glory to god amen thanks be to himshowing that the worshippers followed and sympathised with their spokesman thus making his prayer their own  but the newest thing of all was to hear the preacher deliver an eloquent earnest able and welldigested sermon without book or note in the same natural tone of voice with which a man might address his fellow in the streeta style of address which riveted the attention of the hearers induced them to expect that he had really something important to say to them and that he thoroughly believed in the truth of what he said  a powerful man observed the managing director as they went out your clergyman i suppose  no sir replied mr donnithorne with a chuckle our minister is preaching elsewhere today  that was james penrose  what the miner exclaimed clearemout in astonishment  ay the local preacher too  why the man spoke like demosthenes and quoted bacon locke milton and i know not whom allyou amaze me said mr clearemout  surely all your local preachers are not equal to this one  alas no some of the young ones are indeed able enough to spout poetry and quote old authors and too fond they are of doing so nevertheless as i have said to you before most of the local preachers are soberminded sterling christian men and a few of them have eminent capabilities  had penrose been a younger man he would probably have entered the ministry but being above forty with an uncommonly large family he thinks it his duty to remain as he is and do as much good as he can  but surely he might find employment better suited to his talents said clearemout  there is not much scope in st just replied mr donnithorne with a smile and it is a serious thing for a man in his circumstances to change his abode and vocation  no no i think he is right to remain a miner  well i confess that i admire his talents returned clearemout but i still think that an ordinary miner would suit me better  well i know of one who will suit you admirably  he is common enough to look at and if you will accompany me into the mine tomorrow ill introduce you to him  im not fond of descending the ladders nowadays though i could do it very well when a youth but as the man i speak of works in one of the levels near the surface ill be glad to go down with you and captain dan shall lead us  true to his word the old gentleman met mr clearemout the following morning at nine oclock and accompanied him down into the mine  their descent was unmarked by anything particular at first  they wore the usual suit of underground clothing and each carried a lighted candle attached to his hat  after descending about thirty fathoms they left the main shaft and traversed the windings of a level until they came to a place where the sound of voices and hammers indicated that the miners were working  in a few seconds they reached the end of the level  here two men were driving the level and anothera very tall powerful manwas standing in a hole driven up slantingways into the roof and cutting the rock above his head  his attitude and aspect were extremely picturesque standing as he did on a raised platform with his legs firmly planted his muscular arms raised above him to cut the rock overhead and the candle so placed as to cause his figure to appear almost black and unnaturally gigantic  stay a minute captain dan said mr donnithorne  that mr clearemout is the man i spoke ofwhat think you of his personal appearance  clearemout did not reply for a few minutes but stood silently watching the man as he continued to wield his heavy hammer with powerful strokesdelivering each with a species of gasp which indicated not exhaustion but the stern vigour with which it was given  hell do said clearemout in a decided tone  hallo  james shouted mr donnithorne  hallo sir answered the man looking back over his shoulder  theres a gentleman here who wants to speak to you  the miner flung down his tools which clattered loudly on the hard rock as he leaped from his perch with the agility of one whose muscles are all in full and constant exercise  what not the local  before the managing director could finish his sentence mr donnithorne introduced him to james penrose and left the two for a time to talk together  it need scarcely be added that clearemout was quite willing to avail himself of the services of the local but the local did not meet his proposals so readily as he would have wished  penrose was a cautious man and said he would call on mr clearemout in the evening after he had had time to consider the matter  with this reply the other was fain to rest satisfied and shortly after he returned to the bottom of the shaft with his friends leaving the hardy miner to pursue his work  at the bottom of the shaft they were accosted by a sturdy little man who told them that a large piece of timber was being sent down the shaft and it would be advisable to wait until it reached the bottom  is it on the way spankey asked captain dan  iss sur if it havent walked into the thirtyfathom level in passin  spankey was a humorous individual addicted to joking  are you married spankey asked clearemout looking down with a grin at the dirty little fellow beside him  iss sur  had two wives an the third wan is waitin for me spose  any children spankey  iss six countin the wan that died before it could spaik  at this point the beam was heard coming down  in a few seconds it made its appearance and was hauled a little to one side by spankey who proceeded to unwind the chain that had supported it  ill give em the signal captain dan to haul up the chain before thee do go on the ladders  the signal was given accordingly and the engine immediately began to draw up the chain by which the beam had been lowered  this chain had a hook at one end of it and as illluck would have it the hook caught spankey by the right leg of his trousers and whisked him off his feet  almost before those beside him could conceive what had happened the unfortunate man went up the shaft feet foremost with a succession of dreadful yells in the midst of which could be heard a fearful rending of strong linen  fortunately for spankey his nether garments were not only strong but new so that when the rend came to the seam at the foot it held on else had that facetious miner come down the shaft much faster than he went up and left his brains at the bottom as a memorial of the shocking event  with palpitating hearts captain dan clearemout and old donnithorne ran up the ladders as fast as they could  in a few minutes they reached the thirtyfathom level and here to their great relief they found spankey supported in the arms of stout joe tonkin  that worthy true to his promise to oliver trembath had gone to work in botallack mine and had that very day commenced operations in the thirtyfathom level referred to  hearing the terrible screams of spankey he rushed to the end of the level just as the unfortunate man was passing it  the risk was great but tonkin was accustomed to risks and prompt to act  he flung his arms round spankey drew him forcibly into the level and held on for life  there was a terrible rend the leg of the trousers gave way at the hip and went flapping up to grass leaving the horrified miner behind  not gone dead yet sur but goin fast was spankeys pathetic reply to captain dans anxious inquiries  it was found however that beyond the fright the man had received no damage whatever  the only other noteworthy fact in reference to this incident is that when captain dan and his companions reached the surface they were met by the lander who with a face as pale as a ghost held up the torn garment  great was this mans relief and loud the fit of laughter with which he expressed it when spankey issuing from the mouth of the shaft presented his naked limb and claimed the leg of his trousers    chapter twenty six  tells of a discovery and a disaster  that afternoon another accident occurred in the mine which was of a much more serious nature than the one just recorded and which interfered somewhat with the plans of the managing director of the great wheal dooem mining company  not long after his interview with clearemout james penrose finished a blasthole and called to zackey maggot to fetch the fuse  zackey had been working for a week past in connection with penrose and at the time he was called was engaged in his wonted occupation of pounding tamping wherewith to fill the hole  wherever zackey chanced to be at work he always made himself as comfortable as circumstances would admit of  at the present time he had discovered a little hollow or recess in the wall of the level which he had converted into a private chamber for the nonce  there was a piece of flat rock on the floor of this recess which zackey used as his anvil and in front of which he kneeled  at his side was a candle stuck against the wall where it poured a flood of light on objects in its immediate neighbourhood and threw the boys magnified shadow over the floor and against the opposite wall of the level  above his head was a small shelf which he had ingeniously fixed in a narrow part of the cell and on this lay a few candles a stone bottle of water a blasting fuse and part of his lunch which he had been unable to consume wrapped in a piece of paper  a small wooden box on the floor and a couple of pickhilts leaning against the wall completed the furniture of this subterranean grotto  zackey besides being a searcher after metals possessed an unusual amount of metal in himself  he was one of those earnest hardworking stronghearted boys who pass into a state of full manhood do the work of men and are looked upon as being men before they have passed out of their teens  the boys manhood which was even at that early period of his life beginning to show itself consisted not in his looks or his gait although both were creditable but in his firmness of purpose and force of character  what zackey undertook to do he always did  he never left any work in a halffinished state and he always employed time diligently  in the mine he commenced to labour the moment he entered and he never ceased except during a short period for kroust until it was time to shoulder his tools and mount to the regions of light  above ground he was as ready to skylark as the most volatile of his companions but underground he was a pattern of perseverancea true cornish miner in miniature  his energy of character was doubtless due to his reckless father but his steadiness was the result of uncle davys counsel and example  are you coming zackey shouted penrose from the end of the level  iss im comin replied the boy taking the fuse from the shelf and hastening towards his companion  penrose had a peculiar and pleased expression on his countenance which zackey observed at once  what do ee grizzle like that for inquired the boy  ive come on a splendid bunch of copper zackey replied the man you and i shall make money soon  run away to your work lad and come back when you hear the shot go off  zackey expressed a hope that the prophecy might come true and returned to his cell where he continued pounding diligentlythinking the while of rich ore and a rapid fortune  there was more reason in these thoughts than one might suppose for cornish miners experience variety of fortune  sometimes a man will labour for weeks and months in unproductive ground following up a small vein in the hope of its leading into a good lode and making so little by his hard toil that on pay day of each month he is compelled to ask his employer for subsistor a small advance of moneyto enable him to live and go on with his work  often he is obliged to give up in despair and change to a more promising part of the mine or to go to another mine altogether but not unfrequently he is rewarded for his perseverance by coming at last to a rich lode or mass or bunch of copper or tin ore out of which he will rend in a single month as much as will entitle him to thirty or forty or even a hundred pounds next pay day  such pieces of good fortune are not of rare occurrence  many of the substantial new cottages to be seen in st just at the present day have been built by miners who became suddenly fortunate in this way so that although the miner of cornwall always works hard and often suffers severe privation he works on with a wellgrounded expectation of a sudden burst of temporal sunshine in his otherwise hard lot  zackey maggot was dreaming of some such gleam of good fortune and patiently pounding away at the tamping when he heard the explosion of the blast  at the same moment a loud cry rang through the underground caverns  it was one of those terrible unmistakable cries which chill the blood and thrill the hearts of those who hear them telling of some awful catastrophe  the boy leaped up and ran swiftly towards the end of the level where he called to his companion but received no answer  the smoke which filled the place was so dense that he could not see and could scarcely breathe  he ran forward however and stumbled over the prostrate form of penrose  zackey guessed correctly what had occurred for the accident was and alas still is too common in the mines  the shot had apparently missed fire  penrose had gone forward to examine it and it exploded in his face  to lift his companion was beyond zackeys power to leave him lying in such dense smoke for any length of time would he knew ensure his suffocation so he attempted to drag him away but the man was too heavy for him  in his extremity the poor boy uttered a wild cry for help but he shouted in vain for there was no one else at work in the level  but zackey was not the boy to give way to despair or to act thoughtlessly or in wild haste in this emergency  he suddenly recollected that there was a rope somewhere about the level  he sought for and found it fastening an end of it round the body of the man under the armpits he so arranged that the knot of the loop should reach a few inches beyond his head and on this part of the loop he spread a coat which thus formed a support to the head and prevented it being dragged along the ground  while engaged in this operation the poor boy was wellnigh suffocated with smoke and had to run back once to where the air was purer in order to catch a breath or two  then returning he seized the rope passed it over his shoulder and bending forward with all his might and main dragged the man slowly but steadily along the floor of the level to a place where the air was comparatively pure  leaving him there he quickly fixed a candle in his hat and carrying another in his hand to avoid the risk of being left in darkness by an accidental stumble or gust of air zackey darted swiftly along the level and ran up the ladders at his utmost speed  panting for breath and with eyes almost starting from their sockets he rushed into the enginehouse and told the man in charge what had occurred then he dashed away to the countinghouse and gave the alarm there so that in a very few minutes a number of men descended the shaft and gathered round the prostrate miner  the doctor who had taken oliver trembaths place during his absence was soon in attendance and found that although no bones had been broken penroses face was badly injured how deep the injury extended could not at that time be ascertained but he feared that his eyes had been altogether destroyed  after the application of some cordial the unfortunate man began to revive and the first words he uttered were praise the lord evidently in reference to his life having been spared  is that you zackey he inquired after a few moments  no it is the doctor my man  do you feel much pain in your head he asked as he knelt beside him  not much there is a stunned feeling about it but little pain  youd better light a candle  there are candles burning round you said the doctor  do you not see them  there is one close to your face at this moment  penrose made no answer on hearing this but an expression of deep gravity seemed to settle on the blackened features  we must get him up as soon as possible said the doctor turning to captain dan who stood at his elbow  were all ready sir replied the captain who had quietly procured ropes and a blanket while the doctor was examining the wounds  with great labour and difficulty the injured man was half hauled half carried and pushed up the shaft and laid on the grass  is the sun shining he asked in a low voice  iss it do shine right in thee face jim said one of the miners brushing away a tear with the back of his hand  again the gravity of penroses countenance appeared to deepen but he uttered no other word so they brought an old door and laid him on it six strong men raised it gently on their shoulders and with slow steps and downcast faces they carried the wounded miner home    chapter twenty seven  indicates that we little know what great things from little things may rise  soon after this accident to james penrose the current of events at the mines was diverted from its course by several incidents which like the obstructing rocks in a rapid created some eddies and whirlpools in the lives of those personages with whom this chronicle has to do  as the beginning of a mighty inundation is ofttimes an insignificantlooking leak and as the cause of a series of great events is not unfrequently a trifling incident so the noteworthy circumstances which we have still to lay before our readers were brought about by a very small matterby a babythe baby maggot  one morning that cherubical creature opened its eyes at a much earlier hour than usual and stared at the ceiling of its fathers cottage  the sun was rising and sent its unobstructed rays through the window of maggots cottage where it danced on the ceiling as if its sole purpose in rising had been to amuse the maggot baby  if so it was preeminently successful in its attempts for the baby lay and smiled for a long time in silent ecstasy  of course we do not mean to say that the sun itself or its direct rays actually danced  no it was too dignified a luminary for that but its rays went straight at a small lookingglass which was suspended on the wall opposite to the window and this being hung so as to slope forward projected the rays obliquely into a tub of water which was destined for family washing purposes and from its gently moving surface they were transmitted to the ceiling where as aforesaid they danced to the immense delight of maggot junior  the door of the cottage had been carelessly closed the previous night when the family retired to rest and a chink of it was open through which a light draught of summer air came in  this will account for the ripple on the water which as every observant reader will note ought according to the laws of gravitation to have lain perfectly still  the inconstancy of baby maggots nature was presently exhibited in his becoming tired of the sun and the restlessness of his disposition displayed itself in his frantic efforts to get out of bed  being boxed in with a board this was not an easy matter but the urchins limbs were powerful and he finally got over the obstruction sufficiently far to lose his balance and fall with a sounding flop on the floor  it is interesting to notice how soon deceit creeps into the hearts of some children  of course the urchin fell sittingwisebabies always do so as surely as cats fall on their feet  in ordinary circumstances he would have intimated the painful mishap with a dreadful yell but on this particular occasion young maggot was bent on mischief  of what sort he probably had no idea but there must have been a latent feeling of an intention to be bad in some way or other because on reaching the ground he pursed his mouth opened his eyes very wide and looked cautiously round to make sure that the noise had awakened no one  his father he observed with a feeling of relief was absent from homenot a matter of uncommon occurrence for that worthy mans avocations often called him out at untimeous hours  mrs maggot was in bed snoring and wrinkling up her nose in consequence of a fly having perched itself obstinately on the point thereof  zackey with the red earth of the mine still streaking his manly countenance was rolledup like a ball in his own bed in a dark recess of the room and little grace maggot could be seen in the dim perspective of a closet also sound asleep in her own neat little bed with her hair streaming over the pillow and the chet reposing happily on her neck  but that easily satisfied chet had long ago had more than enough of rest  its repose was light and the sound of baby maggot falling out of bed caused it to rise yawn arch its back and tail and prepare itself for the mingled joys and torments of the opening day  observing that the urchin rose and staggered with a gleeful expression towards the door the volatile chet made a dash at him sidewise and gave him such a fright that he fell over the door step into the road  again was that tender babes deceitfulness of character displayed for instead of howling as he would have done on other occasions he exercised severe selfrestraint made light of a bruised shin and gathering himself up made off as fast as his fat legs could carry him  there was something deeply interestingworthy of the study of a philosopherin the subsequent actions of that precocious urchin  his powers in the way of walking were not much greater than those of a very tipsy man and he swayed his arms about a good deal to maintain his balance especially at the outset of the journey when he imagined that he heard the maternal voice in anger and the maternal footsteps in pursuit in every puff of wind grunt of pig or bark of earlyrising cur  his entire soul was engrossed in the one grand vital absorbing idea of escape  by degrees as distance from the paternal roof increased his fluttering spirit grew calmer and his gait more steady and the flush of victory gathered on his brow and sparkled in his eye as the conviction was pressed home upon him that for the first time in his life he was free free as the wind of heaven to go where he pleasedto do what he likedto be as bad as possible without let or hindrance  not that baby maggot had any stronger desire to be absolutely wicked than most other children of his years but having learnt from experience that the attempt to gratify any of his desires was usually checked and termed bad he naturally felt that a state of delight so intense as that to which he had at last attained must necessarily be the very quintessence of iniquity  being resolved to go through with it at all hazards he felt proportionately wild and reckless  such a state of commotion was there in his heaving bosom owing to contradictory and conflicting elements that he felt at one moment inclined to lie down and shout for joy and the next to sink into the earth with terror  time which proverbially works wonderful changes at length subdued the urchin to a condition of calm goodness and felicity that would have rejoiced his mothers heart had it only been brought on in ordinary circumstances at home  there is a piece of waste ground lying between st just and the seaa sort of common covered with heath and furzeon which the ancient britons have left their indelible mark in the shape of pits and hollows and trenches with their relative mounds and hillocks  here in the days of old our worthy but illiterate forefathers had grubbed and dug and turned up every square foot of the soil like a colony of gigantic rabbits in order to supply the precious metal of the country to the phoenicians jews and greeks  the ground on this common is so riddled with holes of all sizes and shapes utterly unguarded by any kind of fence that it requires care on the part of the pedestrian who traverses the place even in daylight hence the mothers of st just are naturally anxious that the younger members of their families should not go near the common and the younger members are as naturally anxious that they should visit it  thither in the course of timefor it was not far distantthe baby maggot naturally trended proceeding on the principle of short stages and long rests  never in his lifeso he thoughthad he seen such bright and beautiful flowers such green grass and such lovely yellow sand as that which appeared here and there at the mouths of the holes and old shafts or such a delicious balmy and sweetscented breeze as that which came off the atlantic and swept across the common  no wonder that his eyes drank in the beautiful sights for they had seen little of earth hitherto save the four walls of his fathers cottage and the dead garden wall in front of it no wonder that his nostrils dilated to receive the sweet odours for they had up to that date lived upon air which had to cross a noisome and stagnant pool of filth before it entered his fathers dwelling and no wonder that his ears thrilled to hear the carol of the birds for they had previously been accustomed chiefly to the voices of poultry and pigs and to the caterwauling of the chet  but as every joy has its alloy so our youthful travellers feelings began to be modified by a gnawing sensation of hunger as his usual hour for breakfast approached  still he wandered on manfully looking into various dark and deep holes with much interest and a good deal of awe some of the old shafts were so deep that no bottom could be seen others were partially filled up and varied from five to twenty feet in depth some were nearly perpendicular others were sloped and irregular in form but all were more or less fringed with gorse bushes in full bloom in a few cases the old pits were concealed by these bushes  it is almost unnecessary to say that baby maggots progress on that eventful morn wasunknown to himselfa series of narrow escapes from beginning to endno not exactly to the end for his last adventure could scarcely be deemed an escape  he was standing on the edge of a hole which was partially concealed by bushes  endeavouring to peer into it he lost his balance and fell forward  his ready hands grasped the gorse and received innumerable punctures which drew forth a loud cry  head foremost he went in and head foremost he went down full ten feet when a small bush caught him and lowered him gently to the ground but the spot on which he was landed was steep it sloped towards the bottom of the hole which turned inwards and became a sort of cavern  struggling to regain his footing he slipped and rolled violently to the bottom where he lay for a few minutes either stunned or too much astonished to move  then he recovered a little and began to whimper  after which he felt so much better that he arose and attempted to get out of the hole but slipped and fell back again whereupon he set up a hideous roar which continued without intermission for a quarter of an hour when he fell sound asleep and remained in happy unconsciousness for several hours  meanwhile the maggot family was as may well be believed thrown into a state of tremendous agitation  mrs maggot on making the discovery that baby had succeeded in scaling the barricade huddled on her garments and roused her progeny to assist in the search  at first she was not alarmed believing that she should certainly find the selfwilled urchin near the house perhaps in the cottage of the penroses  but when the cottages in the immediate neighbourhood had been called at and all the known places of danger round the house examined without success the poor woman became frantic with terror and roused the whole neighbourhood  every place of possible and impossible concealment was searched and at last the unhappy mother allowed the terrible thought to enter her mind that baby had actually accomplished the unheardof feat of reaching the dreaded common and was perhaps at that moment lying maimed or dead at the bottom of an ancient british shaft  immediately a body of volunteers consisting of men women and children and headed by mrs maggot hastened to the common to institute a thorough search but they searched in vain for the holes were innumerable and the one in which the baby lay was well concealed by bushes  besides the search was somewhat wildly and hastily made so that some spots were oversearched while others were almost overlooked  all that day did mrs maggot and her friends wander to and fro over the common and never since the days when phoenician galleys were moored by st michaels mount did the eyes of human beings pry so earnestly into these pits and holes  had tin been their object they could not have been more eager  evening came night drew on apace and at last the forlorn mother sat down in the centre of a furze bush and began to weep  but her friends comforted her  they urged her to go home and ave a dish o tay to strengthen her for the renewal of the search by torchlight  they assured her that the child could easily exist longer than a day without food and they reminded her that her baby was an exceptional baby a peculiar babylike its father uncommonly strong and like its mother unusually obstinate  the latter sentiment however was thought not expressed  under the influence of these assurances and persuasions mrs maggot went home and for a short time the common was deserted  now it chanced curiously enough that at this identical point of time maggot senior was enjoying a pipe and a glass of grog in a celebrated kiddleewink with his friend joe tonkin  this kiddleewink or low publichouse was known as un or aunt jillys brandyshop at bosarne it was a favourite resort of smugglers and many a gallon of spirit free of duty had been consumed on the premises  maggot and his friend were alone in the house at the time and their conversation had taken a dolorous turn for many things had occurred of late to disturb the equanimity of the friends  several ventures in the smuggling way had proved unsuccessful and the mines did not offer a tempting prospect just then  there had no doubt been one or two hopeful veins opened up and some good pitches had been wrought but these were only small successes and the luck had not fallen to either of themselves  the recent discovery of a good bunch by poor penrose had not been fully appreciated for the wounded man had as yet said nothing about it and little zackey had either forgotten all about it in the excitement of the accident or was keeping his own counsel  maggot talked gloomily about the advisability of emigration to america as he sent clouds of tobacco smoke up un jillys chimney and tonkin said he would try the mines for a short time and if things didnt improve he would go to sea  he did not however look at things in quite the same light with his friend  perhaps he was of a more hopeful disposition perhaps had met with fewer disappointments  at all events he so wrought on maggots mind that he half induced him to deny his smuggling propensities for a time and try legitimate work in the mines not that joe tonkin wanted to reform him by any means but he was himself a little out of humour with his old profession and sought to set his friend against it also  try your luck in botallack said joe tonkin knocking the ashes out of his pipe preparatory to quitting the place thats my advice to ee booy  ive half a mind to replied maggot rising if that theere cargo i run on saturday do go the way the last did ill ha done with it so i will  goodhevenin un jilly  goodhevenin an dont ee go tumblin down the owld shafts said the worthy hostess observing that her potent brandy had rendered the gait of the men unsteady  they laughed as they received the caution and walked together towards st just  lev us go see if the toobs are all safe said maggot on reaching the common  tonkin agreed and they turned aside into a narrow track which led across the waste land where the search for the baby had been so diligently carried on all that day  night had set in as we have said and the searchers had gone up to the town to partake of muchneeded refreshment and obtain torches so that the place was bleak and silent as well as dark when the friends crossed it but they knew every foot of the ground so thoroughly that there was no fear of their stumbling into old holes  maggot led the way and he walked straight to the old shaft where his hopeful son lay  there were three noteworthy points of coincidence here to which we would draw attention  it was just because this old shaft was so well concealed that maggot had chosen it as a place in which to hide his tubs of smuggled brandy it was owing to the same reason that the townspeople had failed to discover it while searching for the baby and it wasat least we think it must have beenjust because of the same reason that baby maggot had found it for that amiable child had a peculiar talent a sort of vocation for ferreting out things and places hidden and secret especially if forbidden  having succeeded in falling into the hole the urchin naturally discovered his fathers tubs  after crying himself to sleep as before mentioned and again awakening his curiosity in respect to these tubs afforded him amusement and kept him quiet for a time perhaps the fact that one of the tubs had leaked and filled the lower part of the old shaft with spirituous fumes may account for the baby continuing to keep quiet and falling into a sleep which lasted the greater part of the day at all events it is certain that he did not howl as might have been expected of him in the circumstances  towards evening however he began to move about among the tubs and to sigh and whimper in a subdued way for his stomach unused to such prolonged fasting felt very uncomfortable  when darkness came on baby maggot became alarmed but just about the time of his fathers approach the moon shone out and cast a cheering ray down the shaft which relieved his mind a little  joe said maggot in a whisper and with a serious look some one have bin here  dee think so said tonkin  iss i do the bushes are broken a bit  hush whats that  the two men paused and looked at each other with awe depicted on their faces while they listened intently but in the words of the touching old song the beating of their own hearts was all the sound they heard  it wor the wind said maggot  iss thats what it wor replied tonkin come lev us go down  the wind cant do no harm to we  but although he proposed to advance he did not move and maggot did not seem inclined to lead the way for just then something like a sigh came from below and a dark cloud passed over the moon  it is no uncommon thing to find that men who are physically brave as lions become nervous as children when anything bordering on what they deem supernatural meets them  maggot was about the most reckless man in the parish of st just and tonkin was not far behind him in the quality of courage yet these two stood there with palpitating hearts undecided what to do  ashamed of being thought afraid of anything maggot at last cleared his throat and in a husky voice saidcome then lev us go down  so saying he slid down the shaft closely followed by tonkin who was nearly as much afraid to be left alone on the bleak moor as he was to enter the old mine  now while the friends were consulting with palpitating hearts above baby maggot wideawake and trembling with terror listened with bated breath below and when the two men came scrambling down the sides of the shaft his heart seemed to fill up his breast and throat and his blood began to creep in his veins  maggot could see nothing in the gloomy interior as he advanced but baby could see his fathers dark form clearly  still no sound escaped from him for horror had bereft him of power  just then the dark cloud passed off the moon and a bright beam shone full on the upper half of the babys face as he peeped over the edge of one of the tubs  maggot saw two glaring eyeballs and felt frozen alive instantly  tonkin looking over his comrades shoulder also saw the eyes and was petrified on the spot  suddenly baby maggot found his voice and uttered a most awful yell  maggot senior found his limbs and turned to fly  so did tonkin but he slipped and fell at the first step  maggot fell over him  both rose and dashed up the shaft scraping elbows shins and knuckles as they went and followed by a torrent of hideous cries that sounded in their ears like the screaming of fiends they gained the surface and without exchanging a word fled in different directions on the wings of terror  maggot did not halt until he burst into his house and flung himself into his own chair by the chimney corner whence he gazed on what was calculated to alarm as well as to perplex him  this was the spectacle of his own wife taking tea in floods of tears and being encouraged in her difficult task by mrs penrose and a few sympathising friends  with some difficulty he got them to explain this mystery  what baby gone lost he exclaimed where away  when it was told him what had occurred maggots eyes gradually opened and his lips gradually closed until the latter produced a low whistle  i think that i do knaw where the cheeld is he said come along an ill show un to ee  so saying the wily smith assuming an air of importance and profound wisdom arose and led his wife and her friends with a large band of men who had prepared torches straight to the old shaft  going down but sternly forbidding any one to follow he speedily returned with the baby in his arms to the surprise of all and to the unutterable joy of the childs mother  in one sense however the result was disastrous  curious persons were there who could not rest until they had investigated the matter further and the tubs were not only discovered but carried off by those who had no title to them whatever  the misfortune created such a tumult of indignation in the breast of maggot that he was heard in his wrath to declare he would have nothin more to do with un but would go into the bal the next settin day  this was the commencement of that series of events which as we have stated at the beginning of this chapter were brought about by that wonderful babythe baby maggot    chapter twenty eight  describes settingday at the mine etcetera  that very evening while maggot was smoking his pipe by the fireside his son zackey referred to the bunch of copper which penrose had discovered in the mine  after a short conversation maggot senior went to the wounded man to talk about it  twas a keenly lode did ee say asked maggot after he had inquired as to the health of his friend  yes and as i shall not be able to work there again said penrose sadly i would advise you to try it  zackey is entitled to get the benefit of the discovery for he was with me at the time and but for his aid dear boy i should have been suffocated  maggot said no more on that occasion about the mine being a man of few words but after conversing a short time with the wounded man and ascertaining that no hope was held out to him of the recovery of his sight he went his way to the forge to work and meditate  settingday camebeing the first saturday in the month and no work was done on that day in botallack for the men were all above ground to have their pitches for the next month fixed and to receive their wages settingday being also pay day  some time before the business of the day commenced the miners began to assemble in considerable numbers in the neighbourhood of the accounthouse  very different was their appearance on that occasion from the rustyred fellows who were wont to toil in the dark chambers far down in the depths below the spot where they stood  their underground dresses were laid aside and they now appeared in the costume of welloff tradesmen  there was a freeandeasy swing about the movements of most of these men that must have been the result of their occupation which brings every muscle of the body into play and does notas is too much the case in some tradesovertax the powers of a certain set of muscles to the detriment of others  some there were however even among the young men whose hollow cheeks and bloodless lips accompanied with a short cough told of evil resulting from bad air and frequent chills while on the other hand a few old men were to be seen with bright eyes and ruddy cheeks which indicated constitutions of iron  not a few were mere lads whose broad shoulders and deep chests and resolute wills enabled them to claim the title and do the work of men  there were some among them both young and old who showed traces of having suffered in their dangerous employment  several were minus an eye and one or two were nearly blind owing to blastholes exploding in their faces  one man in particular a tall and very powerful fellow had a visage which was quite blue and one of his eyes was closedthe blue colour resulting from unburnt grains of powder having been blown into his flesh  he had been tattooed in fact by a summary and effective process  this mans family history was peculiar  his father also a miner had lived in a lonely cottage on a moor near st just and worked in balaswidden mine  one night he was carried home and laid at his wifes feet deadalmost dashed to pieces by a fall  not long afterwards the son was carried to the same cottage with his right eye destroyed  some time later a brother dislocated his foot twice within the year in the mine and a few months after that another brother fell from a beam descended about twentyfour feet perpendicularly where he struck the side of the mine with his head and had six or seven of his teeth knocked out glancing off to one side he fell twenty feet more on the hard rock where he was picked up insensible  this man recovered however under the careful nursing of his oft and sorely tried mother  maggot was present on this settingday with a new cap and a new blue cloth coat looking altogether a surprisingly respectable character  a good deal of undertoned chaffing commenced when he appeared  hallo exclaimed one goin to become an honest man maggot  thinkin bout it replied the smith with a goodhumoured smile  why if i didnt knaw that the old wumans alive said another id say he was agoin to get married again  never fear exclaimed a third maggots far too cute a cunger to be caught twice  i say my dear man asked another have ee bin takin a waalk pon the clifts lately  iss aw iss replied the smith with much gravity  did ee find any more daws pon clift asked the other with a leer  there was a general laugh at this but maggot replied with goodhumourno billy notook em all away last time  but im towld theres some more eggs in the nest so theell have a chance some day booy  i hope the daws aint the worse of their ducking asked billy with an expression of anxious interest  aw my dear said maggot looking very sad and shaking his head slowly didnt ee hear the noos  no not i  they did catch the noo complaint the doctor do spaik ofbronkeetis i think it isand although i did tie em up wi flannel round their necks an watergruel besides ot bottles to their feet theyre all gone dead  i mean to have em buried on monday  will ee come to the berryin billy  praps i will replied billy but see that the gravedigger do berry em deep else hell catch a blowin up like the gravedigger did in cambourne last week  what was that booy  let us hear about it billy exclaimed several voices  well this is the way of it said billy the owld gravedigger in cambourne was standin about after mittin was over areadin of the tombstones for hed got a good edjication had owld tom  his name was tomthe same man as put a straw rope to the bell which the cows did eat away so that he cudnt ring the people to mittin  well when he was studdyin the morials on the stones out comes captain rowe  he was wan o the churchwardens or somethin o that sort but i dont knaw nothin bout the church so i aint surean he calls owld tom into the vestry  now look here tom says the captain very stern they tell me thee rt gettin lazy tom an that thee do dig the graves only four fut deep  now tom i was over to st just tother day to a berryin and i see that they do dig their graves six fut or more deeper than you do that wont do tom i tell ee  whats the meanin of it  this came somewhat suddent on owld tom but he wor noways put out  well you do see capn rowe says he i do it apurpose for i do look at the thing in two lights  how so asked the captain  why the people of st just only think of the berryin but i do think of the resurrection the consekince is that they do dig too deep an afore the st just folk are well out of their graves ours will be a braave way up to heaven  the laugh with which this anecdote was received had scarcely subsided when the upper half of one of the accounthouse windows opened and the finelooking head and shoulders of old mr cornish appeared  the manager laid an open book on the windowsill and from this elevated position as from a pulpit he read out the names positions etcetera of the various pitches that were to be sett for the following month one of the mine captains stood at his elbow to give any required informationhe and his three brother captains being the men who had gone all over the mine during the previous month examined the work measured what had been done by each man or pare of men knew the capabilities of all the miners and fixed the portion that ought to be offered to each for acceptance or refusal  the men assembled in a cluster round the window and looked up while mr cornish read off as follows  john thomass pitch at back of the hundred and five  by two men  to extend from the end of tramhole four fathom west and from back of level five fathom above  for the enlightenment of the reader we may paraphrase the above sentence thus  the pitch or portion of rock wrought last month by john thomas is now offered anewin the first place to john thomas himself if he chooses to continue working it at our rate of pay or if he declines to any other man who pleases to offer for it  the pitch is in the back or roof of the level which lies one hundred and five fathoms deep  it must be wrought by two men and must be excavated lengthwise to an extent of four fathoms in a westerly direction from a spot called the tramhole  in an upward direction it may be excavated from the roof of the level to an extent of five fathoms  john thomas being present at once offered ten shillings by which he meant that knowing the labour to be undergone and the probable value of the ore that would have to be excavated he thought it worth while to continue at that piece of work or that pitch if the manager would give him ten shillings for every twenty shillings worth of mineral sent to the surface by him but the captain also knew the ground and the labour that would be required and his estimate was that eight shillings would be quite sufficient remuneration a fact which was announced by mr cornish simply uttering the words at eight shillings  put her down spose said john thomas after a moments consideration  perhaps john knew that eight shillings was really sufficient although he wanted ten  at all events he knew that it was against the rules to dispute the point at that time as it delayed business that if he did not accept the offer another man might do so and that he might not get so good a pitch if he were to change  the pitch was therefore sett to john thomas and another read offjim hockings pitch at back of the hundred and ten  by one man  to extend etcetera  wont have nothin to do with her said jim hocking  jim had evidently found the work too hard and was dissatisfied with the remuneration so he declined resolving to try his chance in a more promising part of the mine  will any one offer for this pitch inquired mr cornish  eight and six shillings were sums immediately named by men who thought the pitch looked more promising than jim did  any one offer more for this pitch asked the manager taking up a pebble from a little pile that lay at his elbow and casting it into the air  while that pebble was in its flight any one might offer for the pitch but the instant it touched the ground the bargain was held to be concluded with the last bidder  a man named oats who had been in a hesitating state of mind here exclaimed five shillings that is offered to work the pitch for five shillings on every twenty shillings worth sent to grass next instant the stone fell and the pitch was sett to oats  poor james penroses pitch was the next sett  james penroses late pitch read the manager giving the details of it in terms somewhat similar to those already sett and stating that the required pare or force to be put on it was two men and a boy  put me down for it said maggot  have you got your pare asked mr cornish  iss sur  their names  david trevarrow and my son zackey  the pitch was allocated in due form at the rate of fifteen shillings per twenty shillings worth of mineral sent upthis large sum being given because it was not known to be an unusually good pitchpenrose having been too ill to speak of his discovery since his accident and the captain having failed to notice it  when a place is poor looking a higher sum is given to the miner to induce him to work it  when it is rich a lower sum is given because he can make more out of it  thus the work went on the sums named varying according to the nature of the ground and each man saying naw or put me down or that wont do or i wont have her according to circumstances  while this was going on at the window another and perhaps more interesting scene was taking place in the office  this apartment presented a singular appearances  there was a large table in the centre of it which with every available inch of surface on a sidetable and on a board at the window was completely covered with banknotes and piles of gold silver and copper  each pile was placed on a little square piece of paper containing the accountcurrent for the month of the man or men to whom it belonged  very few men laboured singly  many worked in couples and some in bands of three five or more  so much hard cash gave the place a wealthy appearance and in truth there was a goodly sum spread out amounting to several hundreds of pounds  the piles varied very much in size and conveyed a rough outline of the financial history of the men they belonged to  some large heaps of silver with a few coppers and a pile of sovereigns more than an inch high lying on two or more fivepound notes indicated successful labour nevertheless the evidence was not absolutely conclusive because the large piles had in most cases to be divided between several men who had banded together but the little square accountpapers with a couple of crowns on them told of hard work and little pay while yonder square with two shillings in the centre of it betokened utter failure only to be excelled by another square on which lay nothing  you will probably exclaim in your heart reader what do miners sometimes work for a month and receive only two shillings or nothing as wages  ay sometimes but it is their own seeking if they do it is not forced upon them  there are three classes of minersthose who work on the surface dressing ore etcetera who are paid a weekly wage those who work on tribute and those who work at tutwork  of the first we say nothing except that they consist chiefly of balmaidens and children the former receiving about 18 shillings a month and the latter from 8 shillings to 20 shillings according to age and capacity  in regard to tributers and tutworkers we may remark that the work of both is identical in one respectnamely that of hewing picking boring and blasting the hard rock  in this matter they share equal toils and dangers but they are not subjected to the same remunerative vicissitudes  when a man works on tribute he receives so many shillings for every twenty shillings worth of ore that he raises during the month as already explained  if his pitch turns out to be rich in ore his earnings are proportionably high if it be poor he remains poor also sometimes a part of the mineral lode becomes so poor that it will not pay for working and has to be abandoned  so little as a shilling may be the result of a tributers work for a month at one time while at another time he may get a good pitch and make 100 pounds or 200 pounds in the same period  the tutman or piecework man on the other hand cuts out the rock at so much per fathom and obtains wages at the rate of from 2 pounds 10 shillings to 3 pounds a month  he can never hope to make a fortune but so long as health and strength last he may count on steady work and wages  of course there is a great deal of the work in a mine which is not directly remunerative such as sinking shafts opening up and driving or lengthening levels and sinking winzes  on such work tutmen are employed  the man who works on tribute is a speculator he who chooses tutwork is a steady labourer  the tributer experiences all the excitement of uncertainty and enjoys the pleasures of hope  he knows something too about hope deferred also can tell of hope disappointed has his wits sharpened and generally is a smart fellow the tutworker knows nothing of this his pay being safe and regular though small  many quietgoing plodding men prefer and stick to tutwork  in and about the countingroom the men who had settled the matter of their next months work were assembled  thesethe cashier having previously made all readywere paid in a prompt and businesslike manner  first there came forward a middleaged man  it was scarcely necessary for him to speak for the cashier knew every man on the mine by name and also how much was due to him and the hundreds of little square accountscurrent were so arranged that he could lay his hands on any one in an instant  nevertheless being a hearty and amiable man he generally had a word to say to every one  hows your son matthew he inquired of the middleaged man putting the square paper with its contents into his hand  hes braave sir  the doctor do say hell be about again in a week  matthew crumpled up his accountcurrentnotes gold silver copper and allin his huge brown hand and thrusting the whole into his breeches pocket said thank ee and walked away  next there came forward a young man with one eye an explosion having shut up the other one for ever  he received his money along with that of the three men who worked in the same pare with him  he crumpled it up in the same reckless way as matthew had done also thrust it into his pocket and walked off with an independent swagger  truly in the sweat not only of his brow but of every pore in his body had he earned it and he was entitled to swagger a little just then  there was little enough room or inducement to do so down in the mine  after this young man a little boy came forward saying that his faither had sent him for his money  it was observable that the boys and lads among those who presented themselves in the countingroom were as a rule hearty and hopeful with them it was as with the young in all walks of life  everything looked bright and promising  the young men were stern yet freeandeasyas though they had already found life a pretty tough battle but felt quite equal to it  and so they were every one of them  with tough sinews hard muscles and indomitable energy they were assuredly equal to any work that man could undertake and many of them having the fear of god in their hearts were fitted to endure manfully the trials of life as well  the elderly men were sedate and had careworn faces they knew what it was to suffer  many of them had carried little ones to the grave they had often seen strong men like themselves go forth in the morning hale and hearty and be carried to their homes at evening with blinded eyes or shattered limbs  life had lost its gloss to them but it had not lost its charms  there were loving hearts to work for and a glorious end for which to live or if need be to dieso although their countenances were sedate they were not sad  the old menof whom there were but two or threewere jolly old souls  they seemed to have successfully defied the tear and wear of life to have outlived its sorrows and renewed their youth  certainly they had not reached their second childhood for they stepped forth and held out their hands for their pay as steadily as the best of the young ones  when about onehalf of the number had been paid a woman in widows weeds came forward to take up the pay due to her sonher wretched harry as she styled him  all that was due was sevenandsixpence  it was inexpressibly sad to see her retire with this small sumthe last that her unsettled boy was entitled to draw from the mines  he had worked previously in the neighbouring mine wheal owles and had gone to botallack the month before  he was now off to sea leaving his mother who to some extent depended on him to look out for herself  the next who came forward was a blind man  he had worked long in the mineso long that he could find his way through the labyrinth of levels as easily in his blind state as he did formerly with his eyesight  when his eyes were destroyed in the usual way by the explosion of a hole he was only off work during the period of convalescence  afterwards he returned to his familiar haunts underground and although he could no longer labour in the old way he was quite able to work a windlass and draw up the bucket at a winze  for this he now pocketed two pounds sterling and walked off as vigorously as if he had possessed both his eyes  among others a wife appeared to claim her husbands pay and she was followed by zackey maggot who came to receive his own and penroses money  how does penrose get on inquired the cashier as he handed over the sum due  slowly sur said zackey  it is a bad case said one of the captains who sat close by the doctor thinks there is little or no chance for his eyesight  poor zackey received his pay and retired without any demonstration of his wonted buoyancy of spirit for he was fond of penrose almost as much so as he was of uncle david trevarrow  the varied fortune experienced in the mine was exhibited in one or two instances on this occasion  one man and a boy working together had in their own phraseology got a sturtthey had come unexpectedly on a piece of rich ground which yielded so much tin that at the end of the month they received 25 pounds between them  the man had been receiving subsist that is drawing advances monthly for nearly a year and having a wife and children to support had almost lost heart  it was said that he had even contemplated suicide but this little piece of good fortune enabled him to pay off his debt and left something over another man and boy had 20 pounds to receive  on the other hand one man had only 2 shillings due to him while a couple of men who had worked in poor ground found themselves 2 shillings in debt and had to ask for subsist  some time previous to this two men had discovered a bunch of copper and in the course of two months they cleared 260 pounds  at a later period a man in levant mine who was one of the wesleyan local preachers cleared 200 pounds within a year  he gave a hundred pounds to his mother and with the other hundred went off to seek his fortune in australia  after all the men had been paid those who wished for subsist or advances were desired to come forward  about a dozen of them did so and among these were representatives of all classesthe diligent and strong the old and feeble and the young  of course in mining operations as in other work the weak lazy and idle will ever be up to the lips in trouble and in need of help  but in mining the best of men may be obliged to demand assistance because when tributers work on hopefully day after day and week after week on bad ground they must have advances to enable them to perseverenot being able to subsist on air  this is no hardship the mine being at all times open to their inspection and they are allowed to select their own ground  hence the demand for subsist is not necessarily a sign of absolute but only of temporary poverty  the managers make large or small advances according to their knowledge of the men  there was a good deal of chaffing at this point in the proceedingsthe lazy men giving occasion for a slight administration of rebuke and the able men affording scope for goodhumoured pleasantry and badinage  in botallack at the present time about forty or fifty men per month find it necessary to ask for subsist  before the wages were paid several small deductions had to be made first there was sixpence to be deducted from each man for the club this club consisted of those who chose to pay sixpence a month to a fund for the temporary support of those who were damaged by accidents in the mine  a similar sum per month was deducted from each man for the doctor who was bound in consideration of this to attend the miners free of charge  in addition to this a shilling was deducted from each man to be given to the widow and family of a comrade who had died that month  at the present time from 18 pounds to 20 pounds are raised in this way when a death occurs to be given to the friends of the deceased  it should be remarked that these deductions are made with the consent of the men  any one may refuse to give to those objects but if he do so he or his will lose the benefit in the event of his disablement or death  men who are totally disabled receive a pension from the club fund  not long ago a miner blind of one eye left another mine and engaged in botallack  before his first month was out he exploded a blasthole in his face which destroyed the other eye  from that day he received a pension of 1 pound a month which will continue till his deathor at least as long as botallack shall flourishand that miner may be seen daily going through the streets of st just with his little daughter in a cart shouting pilchards fresh pilchaards breem pullock fresh pullock pilchaardsat the top of his stentorian voicea living example of the value of the club and of the principle of insurance  at length the business of the day came to a close  the wages were paid the mens work for another month was fixed the cases of difficulty and distress were heard and alleviated and then the managers and agents wound up the day by dining together in the accounthouse the most noteworthy point in the event being the fact that the dinner was eaten off plates made of pure botallack tin  once a quarter this dinner styled the accountdinner is partaken of by any of the shareholders who may wish to be present on which occasion the manager and agents lay before the company the condition and prospects of the mine and a quarterly dividend if any is paid  there is a matteroffact and spartanlike air about this feast which commands respect  the room in which it is held is uncarpeted and its walls are graced by no higher works of art than the plans and sections of the mine  the food is excellent and substantial but simple  there is abundance of it but there are no courseseither preliminary or successiveno soup or fish to annoy one who wants meat no ridiculous entremets to tantalise one who wants something solid no puddings pies or tarts to tempt men to gluttony  all set to work at the same time and enjoy their meal together which is more than can be said of most dinners  all is grandly simple like the celebrated mine on which the whole is founded  but there is one luxury at this feast which it would be unpardonable not to mentionnamely the punch  whoever tastes this beverage can never forget it  description were useless to convey an idea of it imagination were impotent to form a conception of it  taste alone will avail so that our readers must either go to cornwall to drink it or for ever remain unsatisfied  we can only remark in reference to it that it is potent as well as pleasant and that it is also dangerous being of an insinuating nature so that those who partake freely have a tendency to wish for more and are apt to dream not unreasonably but too wildly of botallack tin being transformed into silver and gold    chapter twenty nine  details among other things a deed of heroism  to work went maggot and trevarrow and zackey on their new pitch next day like true britons  indeed we question whether true britons of the ancient time ever did go to work with half the energy or perseverance of the men of the present day  those men of old were mere grubbers on the surface  they knew nothing of deep levels under the ocean  however to do them justice they made wonderfully extensive tunnels in mother earth with implements much inferior to those now in use  but be that as it may our trio went to work with a will  maggot was keen to get up as much of the rich mineral as possible during the monthknowing that he would not get the place next month on such good terms  trevarrow besides having no objections to make money when he could for its own sake was anxious to have a little to spare to james penrose whose large family found it pinching work to subsist on the poor fellows allowance from the club  as to zackey he was ready for anything where uncle davy was leader  so these three resolved to work night and day  maggot took his turn in the daytime and slept at night trevarrow slept in the daytime and worked at night while the boy worked as long as he could at whatever time suited him best  as they advanced on the lode it became larger and richer and in a day or two it assumed such proportions as to throw the fortunate workers into a state of great excitement and they tore out and blasted away the precious mineral like titans  one day about krousttime having fired two holes they came out of the end in which they wrought and sat down to lunch while the smoke was clearing away  tes a brave lode said maggot  it is responded trevarrow taking a long draught of water from the canteen  what shall us do said maggot go to grass to slaip or slaip in the bal  in the bal if you do like it said trevarrow  so it was agreed that the men should sleep in the mine on boards or on any dry part of the level in order to save the time and energy lost in ascending and descending the long ladders and thus make the most of their opportunity  it was further resolved that zackey should be sent up for dry clothes and bring them their meals regularly  trevarrow did not forget to have his bible brought to him for he was too serious a man to shut his eyes to the danger of a sudden run of good fortune and thought that the best way to guard against evil would be to devote nearly all his short periods of leisure time to the reading of the word  you may be sure that maggot afterwards laughed at him for this but he did not concern himself much about it at the time because he was usually too hungry to talk at mealtimes and too sleepy to do so after work was over  they were still busily discussing the matter of remaining in the mine all night when they heard the kibble descending the shaft near the bottom of which they sat and next moment a man came to the ground with considerable violence  why frankey is that thee booy said maggot starting up to assist him  aw dear iss im gone dead amost aw dear aw dear  why whatever brought ee here said trevarrow  the kibble sure replied the man exhibiting his knuckles which were cut and bleeding a good deal  i did come by the chain anyhow  this was indeed true  frankey as his mates called him was at that time the lander in charge of the kibbles at the surface  it was his duty to receive each kibble as it was drawn up to the mouth of the shaft full of ore empty it and send it down again  several coils of chain passing round the large drum of a great horsewindlass called by the miners a whim was the means by which the kibbles were hoisted and lowered  the chain was so arranged that one kibble was lowered by it while the other was being drawn up  frankey had emptied one of the kibbles and had given the signal to the boy attending the horse to lower away when he inadvertently stepped into the shaft  with ready presence of mind the man caught the chain and clung to it but the boy being prevented by a pile of rubbish from seeing what had occurred eased him down supposing him to be the kibble  this easing down a great number of fathoms was by no means an easy process as those know well who have seen a pair of kibbles go banging up and down a shaft  it was all that poor frankey could do to keep his head from being smashed against rocks and beams but by energetic use of arms and legs he did so and reached the bottom of the shaft without further damage than a little skin rubbed off his knees and elbows and a few cuts on his hands  the man thought so little of it indeed that he at once returned to grass by the ladderway to the unutterable surprise and no little consternation of the boy who had eased him down  the air at the end of the level in which maggot and trevarrow worked was very bad and for some time past men had been engaged in sinking a winze from the level above to connect the two and send in a supply of fresh air by creating a new channel of circulation  this winze was almost completed but one of the men employed at it had suddenly become unwell that day and no other had been appointed to the work  as it was a matter of great importance to have fresh air now that they had resolved to remain day and night in the mine for some time maggot and trevarrow determined to complete the work believing that one or two shots would do it  accordingly they mounted to the level above and were lowered one at a time to the bottom of the unfinished winze by a windlass which was turned by the man whose comrade had become unwell  for nearly two hours they laboured diligently scarce taking time to wipe the perspiration from their heated brows  at the end of that time the hole was sufficiently deep to blast so maggot called outzackey my son fetch the fuse and powder  the boy was quickly lowered with these materials and then drawn up  meanwhile maggot proceeded to charge the hole and his comrade sat down to rest  he put in the powder and tamping and asked the other to hand him the tampingbar  zackey has forgot it said trevarrow looking round  it dont matter hand me the borer  no i wont said trevarrow decidedly as he grasped the iron tool in question  ho  zackey booy throw down the tampinbar  this was done and the operation of filling the hole continued while trevarrow commented somewhat severely on his companions recklessness  thats just how the most o the reckless men in the bal do get blawd up he said theyre always picking away at the holes and tamping with iron tools why thee might as well put a lighted match down the muzzle of a loaded gun as tamp with an iron borer  come now said maggot looking up from his work with a leer it warnt that as made old kimber nearly blow hisself up last week  no but it was carelessness anyhow retorted trevarrow and lucky for him that he was a smart man else hed bin gone dead by this time  maggot soon completed the filling of the hole and then perpetrated as reckless a deed as any of his mining comrades had ever been guilty of trevarrow was preparing to ascend by the windlass intending to leave his comrade to light the fuse and come up after him  meanwhile maggot found that the fuse was too long  he discovered this after it was fixed in the hole and unobserved by his companion proceeded to cut it by means of an iron tool and a flat stone  fire was struck at the last blow by the meeting of the iron and the stone and the fuse ignited  to extinguish it was impossible to cut it in the same way without striking fire was equally so  of course there was plenty of time to ascend by the windlass but only one at a time could do so  the men knew this and looked at each other with terrible meaning in their eyes as they rushed at the bucket and shouted to the man above to haul them up  he attempted to do so but in vain  he had not strength to haul up two at once  one could escape both could not and to delay would be death to both  in this extremity david trevarrow looked at his comrade and said calmlyescape my brother a minute more and i shall be in heaven  he stepped back while he spokethe bucket went rapidly upwards and trevarrow sitting down in the bottom of the shaft covered his eyes with a piece of rock and awaited the issue  the rumbling explosion immediately followed and the shaft was filled with smoke and flame and hurling stones  one of these latter shooting upwards struck and cut the ascending miner on his forehead as he looked down to observe the fate of his selfsacrificing comrade  maggot was saved but he was of too bold and kindly a nature to remain for a moment inactive after the explosion was over  at once he descended and groping about among the debris soon found his friend alive and almost unhurt  a mass of rock had arched him overor rather the hand of god as if by miracle had delivered the christian miner  after he was got up in safety to the level above they asked him why he had been so ready to give up his life to save his friend  why said david quietly i did think upon his wife and the childn and little grace seemed to say to me take care o faitherbesides there are none to weep if i was taken away so the lord gave me grace to do it  that night there were glad and grateful hearts in maggots cottageand never in this world was a more flat and emphatic contradiction given to any statement than that which was given to david trevarrows assertionthere are none to weep if i was taken away  a short but beautiful account of the above incident will be found in a little volume of poems entitled lays from the mine the moor and the mountain written by john harris a cornish miner    chapter thirty  reveals some astonishing facts and their consequences  sorrow and trouble now began to descend upon mr thomas donnithorne like a thick cloud  reduced from a state of affluence to one bordering on absolute poverty the old mans naturally buoyant spirit almost gave way and it needed all the attentions and the cheering influence of his good wife and sweet rose ellis to keep him from going as he often halfjestingly threatened to the end of cape cornwall and jumping into the sea  its all over with me oliver said he one morning after the return of his nephew from london  a young fellow like you may face up against such difficulties but what is an old man to do  i cant begin the world over again and as for the shares i have in the various mines theyre not worth the paper theyre writ upon  but things may take a turn suggested oliver this is not the first time the mines have been in a poor condition and the price of tin low when things get very bad they are likely to get better you know  even now there seems to be some talk among the miners of an improved state of things  i met maggot yesterday and he was boasting of having found a monstrous bunch which according to him is to be the making of all our fortunes  mr donnithorne shook his head  maggots geese are always swans he said no no oliver i have lost all hope of improvement  there are so many of these deceptive mines around us just nowsome already gone down and some goingthat the public are losing confidence in us and somewhat unfairly judging that because a few among us are scoundrels we are altogether a bad lot  what do you think of mr clearemouts new mine asked oliver  i believe it to be a genuine one said the old gentleman turning a somewhat sharp glance on his nephew  why do you ask  because i doubt it replied oliver  you are too sceptical said mr donnithorne almost testily too much given to judging things at first sight  nay uncle you are unfair  had i judged of you at first sight i should have thought you a  well what a smuggling old brandyloving rascaleh and not far wrong after all  at all events said oliver laughing i have lived to form a better opinion of you than that  but in reference to clearemout i cannot shut my eyes to the fact that the work doing at the new mine is very like a sham for they have only two men and a boy working her with a captain to superintend and it is said for i made inquiries while in london that thirty thousand pounds have been called up from the shareholders and there are several highly paid directors with an officestaff in the city drawing large salaries  nonsense oliver said mr donnithorne more testily than before you know very well that things must have a beginning and that caution is necessary at first in all speculations  besides i feel convinced that mr clearemout is a most respectable man and an uncommonly clever fellow to boot  it is quite plain that you dont like himthats what prejudices you oliver  youre jealous of the impression he has made on the people here  this last remark was made jestingly but it caused the young doctor to wince having hit nearer the truth than the old gentleman had any idea of for although oliver envied not the handsome strangers popularity he was almost unknown to himself very jealous of the impression he seemed to have made on rose ellis  a feeling of shame induced him to change the subject of conversation with a laughing observation that he hoped such an unworthy motive did not influence him  now while this conversation was going on in the parlour of mr donnithornes cottage another dialogue was taking place in a small wooden erection at the end of the garden which bore the dignified name of roses bower  the parties concerned in it were george augustus clearemout and rose ellis  a day or two previous to the conversation to which we are about to draw attention the managing director had undergone a change in his sentiments and intentions  when he first saw rose he thought her an uncommonly sweet and pretty girl  a short acquaintance with her convinced him that she was even sweeter and prettier than at first he had thought her  this coupled with the discovery that her uncle was very rich and that he meant to leave a large portion of his wealth if not all of it to rose decided clearemout and he resolved to marry her  afterwards he became aware of the fact that old mr donnithorne had met with losses but he was ignorant of their extent and still deemed it worth while to carry out his intentions  george augustus had been a managing director in various ways from his earliest infancy and had never experienced much opposition to his will so that he had acquired a habit of settling in his own mind whatever he meant to do and forthwith doing it  on this occasion he resolved to sacrifice himself to rose in consideration of her prospective fortune cash being of course mr clearemouts god  great then was the managing directors surprise and astonishing the condition of his feelings when on venturing to express his wishes to rose he was kindly but firmly rejected  mr clearemout was so thunderstruckhaving construed the unsophisticated girls candour and simplicity of manner into direct encouragementthat he could make no reply but with a profound bow retired hastily from her presence went to his lodgings and sat down with his elbows on the table and his face buried in his large hands the fingers of which appeared to be crushing in his forehead as if to stifle the thoughts that burned there  after sitting thus for half an hour he suddenly rose with his face somewhat paler and his lips a little more firmly compressed than usual  it was an epoch in his existence  the man who had so often and so successfully deceived others had made the wonderful discovery that he had deceived himself  he had imagined that money was his sole object in wishing to marry rose  he now discovered that love or something like it had so much to do with his wishes that he resolved to have her without money and also without her consent  something within the man told him that roses refusal was an unalterable one  he did not think it worth while to waste time in a second attempt his plans though hastily formed required a good deal of preliminary arrangement so he commenced to carry them out with the single exclamation ill do it accompanied with a blow from his heavy fist on the table which being a weak lodginghouse one was split from end to end  but the managing director had a soul above furniture at that moment  he hastily put on his hat and strode out of the house  making good use of a good horse he paid sundry mysterious visits to various smuggling characters to all of whom he was particularly agreeable and liberal in the bestowal of portions of the thirty thousand pounds with which a too confiding public had intrusted him  among other places he went to a cottage on a moor between st just and penzance and had a confidential interview with a man named hicks who was noted for his capacity to adapt himself to circumstances when well paid without being troubled by conscientious scruples  this man had a son who had once suffered from a broken collarbone and whose ears were particularly sharp  he chanced to overhear the conversation at the interview referred to and dutifully reported the same to his mother who happened to be a great gossip and knew much about the private affairs of nearly everybody living within six miles of her  the good woman resolved to make some use of her information but mr clearemout left the cottage in ignorance of course of her resolution  having transacted these little pieces of business the managing director returned home and on the day following sought and obtained an interview with rose ellis in her bower  recollecting the subject of their last conversation rose blushed as much with indignation as confusion at being intruded upon but mr clearemout at once dispersed her angry feelings by assuring her in tones of deferential urbanity that he would not have presumed to intrude upon her but for the fact that he was about to quit cornwall without delay and he wished to talk with her for only a few minutes on business connected with mr donnithorne  there was something so manly and straightforward in his tone and manner that she could not choose but allow him to sit down beside her although she did falter out something about the propriety of talking on her uncles business affairs with mr donnithorne himself  your observation is most just said mr clearemout earnestly but you are aware that your uncles nature is a delicate sensitive one and i feel that he would shrink from proposals coming from me that he might listen to if made to him through you  i need not conceal from you miss ellis that i am acquainted with the losses which your uncle has recently sustained and no one can appreciate more keenly than i do the harshness with which the world in its ignorance of details is apt to judge of the circumstances which brought about this sad state of things i cannot help feeling deeply the kindness which has been shown me by mr donnithorne during my residence here and i would if i could show him some kindness in return  mr clearemout paused here a few moments as if to reflect  he resolved to assume that mr donnithornes losses were ruinous little imagining that in this assumption he was so very near the truth  rose felt grateful to him for the kind and delicate way in which he referred to her uncles altered circumstances  of course continued the managing director i need not say to you that his independent spirit would never permit him to accept of assistance in the form which would be most immediately beneficial to him  indeed i could not bring myself to offer money even as a loan but it happens that i have the power just now of disposing of the shares which he has taken in wheal dooem mine at a very large profit and as my hope of the success of that enterprise is very small i  very small echoed rose in surprise  you astonish me mr clearemout  did i not hear you only a few nights ago say that you had the utmost confidence in the success of your undertaking  most true replied the managing director with a smile but in the world of business a few hours work wonderful changes sometimes in ones opinion of thingswitness the vacillations and variations on changeif i may venture to allude before a lady to such an incomprehensible subject  rose felt her vigorous little spirit rise and she was about to return a smart reply in defence of womans intelligence even in business matters but the recollection of the altered relative position in which they now stood restrained her  yes continued mr clearemout with a sigh the confidence which i felt in wheal dooem has been much shaken of late and the sooner your uncle sells out the better  but would it be right said rose earnestly to sell our shares at a high profit if things be as you say  quite right replied clearemout with a bland smile of honesty i believe the mine to be a bad speculation my friend we shall suppose believes it to be a good one  believing as i do i choose to sell out believing as he does he chooses to buy in  the simplest thing in the world miss ellis  done every day with eyes open i assure you but it is not every day that a chance occurs so opportunely as the present and i felt it to be a duty to give my friend the benefit of my knowledge before quitting this placefor ever  there was something so kind and touching in the tone of the managing director that rose was quite drawn towards him and felt as if she had actually done him an unkindness in refusing him  but continued her companion i can do nothing miss ellis without your assistance  you shall have it said rose earnestly for i would do anything that a woman might venture to benefit my dear dear uncle and i feel assured that you would not ask me to do anything wrong or unwomanly  i would not indeed answered clearemout with emotion but the world is apt to misjudge in matters of delicacy  to ask you to meet me on the cliffs near priests cove close to cape cornwall tonight would appear wrong in the eyes of the world  and with justice said rose quickly with a look of mingled dignity and surprise  nevertheless this is absolutely needful if we would accomplish the object in view  a friend whom i know to be desirous of purchasing shares in the mine is to pass round the cape in his yacht this evening the idea of offering these shares to him had not occurred to me when i wrote to say that i would meet him there  he cannot come up here i know but the stroke of a pen with one of the family to witness it will be sufficient  it was a bold stroke of fancy in the managing director to put the matter in such a ridiculously unbusinesslike light but he counted much on roses ignorance  as for poor rose herself she knew not what to say or do at first but when clearemout heaved a sigh and with an expression of deep sadness on his countenance rose to take leave she allowed a generous impulse to sway her  your answer then isno said clearemout with deep pathos in his tone  now it chanced that at this critical point in the conversation oliver trembath having left the cottage walked over the grass towards a small gate near which the bower stood  he unavoidably heard the question and also the quick earnest replymy answer mr clearemout isyes i will meet you this evening on the cliff  she frankly gave him her hand as she spoke and he gallantly pressed it to his lips an act which took rose by surprise and caused her to pull it away suddenly  she then turned and ran out at the side of the bower to seek the solitude of her own apartment while clearemout left it by the other side and stood face to face with the spellbound oliver  to say that both gentlemen turned pale as their eyes met would not give an adequate idea of their appearance  olivers heart as well as his body when he heard the question and reply stood still as if he had been paralysed  this then he thought was the end of all his hopes hopes hardly admitted to himself and never revealed to rose except in unstudied looks and tones  for a few moments his face grew absolutely livid while he glared at his rival  on the other hand mr clearemout believing that the whole of his conversation had been overheard supposed that he had discovered all his villainy to one who was thoroughly able as well as willing to thwart him  for a moment he felt an almost irresistible impulse to spring on and slay his enemy his face became dark with suppressed emotion and it is quite possible that in the fury of his disappointed malice he might have attempted violencehad not oliver spoken  his voice was husky as he saidchance sirunfortunate miserable chanceled me to overhear the last few words that passed between you and  he paused unable to say more  instantly the truth flashed across clearemouts quick mind  he drew himself up boldly and the blood returned to his face as he repliedif so sir you cannot but be aware that the ladys choice is free and that your aspect and attitude towards me are unworthy of a gentleman  a wonderful influence for weal or woe ofttimes results from the selection of a phrase or a word  had clearemout charged oliver with insolence or presumption he would certainly have struck him to the ground but the words unworthy of a gentleman created a revulsion in his feelings  thought is swifter than light  he saw himself in the position of a disappointed man scowling on a successful rival who had done him no injury  thank you clearemout  your rebuke is merited he said bitterly and turning on his heel he bounded over the low stone wall of the garden and hastened away  whither he went he knew not  a fierce fire seemed to rage in his breast and burn in his brain  at first he walked at full speed but as he cleared the town he ranran as he had never run before  for the time being he was absolutely mad  over marsh and moor he sped clearing all obstacles with a bound and making straight for the lands end with no definite purpose in view for after a time he appeared to change his intention if he had any  he turned sharp to the left and ran straight to penzance never pausing in his mad career until he neared the town the few labourers he chanced to pass on the way gazed after him in surprise but he heeded not  at the cottage on the moor where he had bandaged the shoulder of the little boy a womans voice called loudly anxiously after him but he paid no attention  at last he came to a full stop and pressing both hands tightly over his forehead made a terrible effort to collect his thoughts  he was partially successful and with somewhat of his wonted composure walked rapidly into the town    chapter thirty one  describes a marred plot and tells of retributive justice  meanwhile the gossiping woman of the cottage on the moor whose grateful heart had never forgotten the little kindness done to her boy by the young doctor and who knew that the doctor loved rose ellis more surely perhaps than rose did herself went off in a state of deep anxiety to st just and by dint of diligent inquiries and piecing of things together coupled with her knowledge of clearemouts intentions came to a pretty correct conclusion as to the state of affairs  she then went to the abode of young charles tregarthen whom she knew to be olivers friend and unbosomed herself  charlie repaid her with more than thanks and almost hugged her in his gratitude for her prompt activity  and now mrs hicks said he you shall see how we will thwart this scoundrel  as for oliver trembath i cannot imagine what could take him into penzance in the wild state that you describe  of course this affair has to do with it and he evidently has learned something of this and must have misunderstood the matter else assuredly he had not been absent at such a time  but why go to penzance  however he will clear up the mystery ere long no doubt  meanwhile we shall proceed to thwart your schemes good mr clearemout  so saying charlie tregarthen set about laying his counterplans  he also as the managing director had done visited several men some of whom were miners and some smugglers and arranged a meeting that evening near cape cornwall  when evening drew on apace four separate parties converged towards priests cove  first a boat crept along shore propelled by four men and steered by jim cuttance  secondly six stout men crept stealthily down to the cove led by charlie tregarthen with maggot as his second in command  thirdly rose ellis wended her way to the rendezvous with trembling step and beating heart and fourthly george augustus clearemout moved in the same direction  but the managing director moved faster than the others having a longer way to travel for having had to pay a last visit to wheal dooem he rode thence to st just  on the way he was particularly interested in a waterwheel which worked a pump beside which a man in mining costume was seated smoking his pipe  goodevening said clearemout reining up  goodhevenin sur  what does that pump asked the managing director pointing to the wheel  that sur said the miner drawing a few whiffs from his pipe why that do pump gold out o the londoners that do  the managing director chuckled very much and said indeed  iss sur continued the miner pointing to wheal dooem an that wan theere up over hill do the same thing  the managing director chuckled much more at this and displayed his teeth largely as he nodded to the man and rode on  before his arrival at the rendezvous the boat was run ashore not far from the spot where tregarthen and his men were concealed  as soon as the men had landed charlie walked down to them alone and accosted their leader  well cuttance youre a pretty fellow to put your finger in such a dirty pie as this  cuttance had seen the approach of tregarthen with surprise and some alarm  well sur said he without any of the bold expression that usually characterised him what can a man do when hes to be well paid for the job  i do confess that i dont half like it but after all what have we got to do weth the opinions of owld aunts or uncles  if a gurl do choose to go off wi the man she likes thats no matter to we an if i be well paid for lendin a hand why shouldnt i  but it do puzzle me mr tregarthen to guess how yow did come to knaw of it  that dont signify said tregarthen sternly  do you know who the girl is  i dont knaw an i dont care said jim doggedly  what would you say if i told you it was miss rose ellis said charlie  id say thee was a liard replied cuttance  then i do tell you so  thee dont mean that exclaimed the smuggler with a blaze of amazement and wrath in his face  indeed i do  whew whistled jim then that do explain the reason why that smoothtongued feller said he would car her to the boat close veiled up for fear the men should see her  a rapid consultation was now held by the two as to the proper mode of proceeding  cuttance counselled an immediate capture of the culprit and pitching him off the end of cape cornwall but tregarthen advised that they should wait until clearemout seized his victim otherwise they could not convict him because he would deny any intention of evil against rose and pretend that some other girl who had been scared away by their impetuosity was concerned for they might depend on it hed get up a plausible story and defeat them  tregarthens plan was finally agreed to and he returned to his men and explained matters  soon afterwards the managing director appeared coming down the road  is all right he inquired of cuttance who went forward to meet him  all right sur  go down to the boat then and wait he said turning away  ere long he was joined by rose with whom he entered into conversation leading her over the cape so as to get out of sight of the men but young tregarthen crept among the rocks and never for a moment lost sight of them  he saw clearemout suddenly place a kerchief on roses mouth and despite the poor girls struggles tie it firmly so as to prevent her screaming then he threw a large shawl over her and catching her in his arms bore her swiftly towards the boat  tregarthen sprang up and confronted him  clearemout astonished and maddened by this unexpected interference shoutedstand aside sir  you have no interest in this matter or right to interfere  charlie made no reply but sprang on him like a tiger  clearemout dropped his burden and grappled with the youth who threw him in an instant big though he was for tregarthen was a practised wrestler and the managing director was not  his great strength however enabled him to get on his knees and there is no saying how the struggle might have terminated had not cuttance come forward and putting his hard hands round clearemouts throat caused that gentlemans face to grow black and his tongue and eyes to protrude  having thus induced him to submit he eased off the necklace and assisted him to rise while the men of both parties crowded round  now then boys cried jim cuttance bear a hand one and all and into the say with him  the managing director was at once knocked off his legs and borne shoulderhigh down to the beach by as many hands as could lay hold of him  here they paused  all together boysonetwoho  at the word the unfortunate man was shot by strong and willing arms into the air like a bombshell and fell into the water with a splash that was not unlike an explosion  clearemout was a good swimmer  when he came to the surface he raised himself and clearing the water from his eyes glanced round  even in that extremity the quickness and selfpossession of the man did not forsake him  he perceived at a glance that the boat which in the excitement of the capture had been left by all the men had floated off with the receding tide and now lay a short distance from the shore  at once he struck out for it  there was a shout of consternation and a rush to the waters edge  maggot shot far ahead of the others plunged into the sea and swam off  observing this and knowing well the courage and daring of the man the rest stopped on the shore to witness the result  clearemout reached the boat first but owing to exhaustion was unable to raise himself into it  maggot soon came up and grasped him by the throat both men managed to get their arms over the gunwale but in their struggle upset the boat and were separated  clearemout then made for the shore with the intention of giving himself up and maggot followed but he was not equal in swimming to the managing director whose long steady strokes easily took him beyond the reach of his pursuer  he reached the shore and stalked slowly out of the water  at the same moment maggot sank and disappeared  the consternation of his comrades was so great that in the confusion their prisoner was unheeded  some sprang into the sea and dived after maggot others swam to the boat intending to right it and get the boathooks  suddenly those who had remained on the beach observed something creep out of the sea near to some rocks a little to the right of the place where they stood  they ran towards it  hallo is that you old maggot they cried  it was indeed the valiant smith himself  how he got there no one ever knew nor could himself tell  it was conjectured that he must have become partially exhausted and after sinking had crept along the bottom to the shore  however be that as it may there he was lying with his arm lovingly round a rock and the first thing he said on looking up wasaw my dear men has any of ee got a chaw of baccy about ee  this was of course received with a shout of laughter and unlimited offers of quids while they assisted him to rise  meanwhile tregarthen was attending to rose who had swooned when clearemout dropped her  he also kept a watch over the prisoner who however showed no intention of attempting to escape but sat on a stone with his face buried in his hands  the men soon turned their attention to him again and some of the more violent were advancing to seize him with many terrible threats of further vengeance when rose ran between them and entreated them to spare him  tregarthen seconded the proposal and urged that as he had got pretty severe punishment already they should set him free  this being agreed to charlie turned to the managing director and said with a look of pity you may go sir but be assured it is not for your own sake that we let you off  you know pretty well what the result would be if we chose to deliver you up to justice we care more however for the feelings of this ladywhose name would be unavoidably and disagreeably brought before the public at the trialthan we care for your getting your merited reward  but mark me if you ever open your lips on the subject you shall not escape us  iss added jim cuttance ann remember you chucklehead that if you do write or utter wan word bout it after gettin back to london there are here twelve cornish men who will never rest till they have flayed thee alive  you need have no fear said clearemout with a bitter smile as he turned and walked away followed by a groan from the whole party  now lads said cuttance after he was gone not wan word of this must ever be breathed and well howld ee responsible david hicks for t wifes tongue dost a hear  this was agreed to by all and to the credit of these honest smugglers and of mrs hicks be it said that not a syllable about the incident was ever heard of in the parish of st just from that day to this    chapter thirty two  touches on love and on pilchard fishing  there can be no doubt that fortune favours the brave and maggot was one of those braves whom about this time she took special delight in favouring  wild and apparently reckless though he was maggot had long cherished an ambitious hope and had for some time past been laying by money for the purpose of accomplishing his object which was the procuring of a seinenet and boats for the pilchard fishery  the recent successes he had met with in botallack enabled him to achieve his aim more rapidly than he had anticipated and on the day following that in which clearemout received his deserts he went to penberth cove to see that all was in readiness for pilchards had recently appeared off the coast in small shoals  that same day oliver trembath having spent a night of misery in penzance made up his mind to return to st just and face his fate like a man but he found it so difficult to carry this resolve into effect that he diverged from the highroadas he had done on his first memorable visit to that regionand without knowing very well why sauntered in a very unenviable frame of mind towards penberth cove  old mr donnithorne possessed a pretty villa near the cove to which he was wont to migrate when mrs d felt a desire for change of air and in which he frequently entertained large parties of friends in the summer season  in his heart poor mr donnithorne had condemned this villa to the hammer but the improved appearance of things in the mines had induced him to suspend the execution of the sentence  news of the appearance of pilchards and a desire to give rose a change after her late adventure induced mr donnithorne to hire a phaeton he had recently parted with his own and drive over to penberth  arrived there he sauntered down to the cove to look after his netsfor he dabbled in pilchard fishing as well as in other mattersand rose went off to have a quiet solitary walk  thus it came to pass that she and oliver trembath suddenly met in a lonely part of the road between penberth and penzance  ah those sudden and unexpected meetings  how pleasant they are and how well every one who has had them remembers them  miss ellis exclaimed oliver in surprise  mr trembath exclaimed rose in amazement  you see reader how polite they were but you can neither see nor conceive how great was the effort made by each to conceal the tumult that agitated the breast and flushed the countenance while the tongue was thus ably controlled  it did not last long however  oliver being thrown off his guard asked a number of confused questions and rose in her somewhat irrelevant replies happened to make some reference to that villain clearemout  villain echoed oliver in undisguised amazement  the villain repeated rose with a flushed face and flashing eye  what why howreally excuse me miss ellisiithe villain clearemoutyou dont  there is no saying how many more ridiculous exclamations oliver might have made had not rose suddenly saidsurely mr trembath you have heard of his villainy  no never not a word  pray do tell me miss ellis  rose at once related the circumstances of her late adventure with much indignation in her tone and many a blush on her brow  before she had half done olivers powers of restraint gave way  then you never loved him he exclaimed  loved him sir  i do not understand  forgive me rose i meani didnt imaginethat is to sayoh  rose can it beis it possiblemy dear girl  he seized her hand at this point andbut really reader why should we go on  is it not something like a violation of good taste to be too particular here  is it not sufficient to say that old mr donnithorne came suddenly and of course unexpectedly on them at that critical juncture rendering it necessary for rose to burst away and hide her blushing face on her uncles shoulder while oliver utterly overwhelmed turned and walked we wont say fled at full speed in the direction of the cove  here he found things in a condition that was admirably suited to the state of his feelings  the fishermen of the cove were in a state of wild excitement for an enormous shoal of pilchards had been enclosed in the seinenets and maggot with his men as well as the people employed by mr donnithorne were as much over head and ears in fishing as oliver was in love  do you ask why all this excitement  we will tell you  the pilchard fishing is to the cornish fisherman what the harvest is to the husbandman but this harvest of the sea is not the result of prolonged labour care and wisdom  it comes to him in a night  it may last only a few days or weeks  sometimes it fails altogether  during these days of sunshine he must toil with unwonted energy  there is no rest for him while the season lasts if he would not miss his opportunity  the pilchard is a little fish resembling a small herring it visits the southern coasts of england in autumn and winter and the shoals are so enormous as to defy calculation or description  when they arrive on the coast huerssharpsighted menare stationed on the cliffs to direct the boatmen when to go out and where to shoot their seinenets  when these are shot millions of pilchards are often enclosed in a single net  to give an idea of the numbers of fish and the extent of the fishing in a few words we may state the fact that in 1834 one shoal of great depth and nearly a mile broad extended from hayle river to st ives a distance of two and a half miles  a seine was shot into this mass and 3600 hogsheads were carried to the curing cellars  as there are 3000 pilchards in each hogshead the catch amounted to nearly eleven million fish  the value of these might be 3 pounds a hogshead and the clear profit about 1 pound a hogshead so that it is no wonder we hear of fortunes having been made in a few hauls of the pilchard seines  at the same time losses are sometimes very heavy owing to gales arising and breaking or carrying away the nets  such facts combined with the uncertainty of the arrival or continuance of the fish on any particular part of the coast tend to induce that spirit of eager anxious excitement to which we have referred as being so congenial to oliver trembaths state of mind at the time of which we write  on the beach the young doctor found maggot and his men launching their boats and of course he lent them a hand  pilchards been seen he inquired  iss iss doctor was the smiths curt reply jump in an go long with us  oliver accepted the invitation and was rowed towards a part of the bay where the sea appeared to be boiling  the boat was a large one attended by several others of smaller dimensions  the boiling spot being reached maggot whose whole being was in a blaze of enthusiasm leaped up and seized the end of a seinenetthree hundred fathoms long by fourteen deepwhich he began to throw overboard with the utmost energy while the boat was rowed swiftly round the mass of fish  david trevarrow assisted him and in less than four minutes the whole net was in the sea  one of the other boats meanwhile had fastened another net to the first and rowing in an opposite direction from it progressed in a circular course dropping its net as it went until the two met and thus an immense shoal of pilchards were enclosed  the nets being floated on the surface with corks and their lower ends sunk to the bottom with leads the fish were thus securely imprisoned but the security was not great a gale might arise which would sweep away the whole concern or the pilchards might take a fancy to make a dash in one particular direction in the event of which they would certainly burst the net and no human power could save a single fin  in order to prevent this the men in the smaller boats rowed round the seine beat the sea with their oars hallooed and otherwise exerted themselves to keep the fish in the centre of the enclosure  meanwhile a little boat entered within the circle having a small net named a tucknet which was spread round the seine inside and gradually drawn together until the fish were raised towards the surface in a solid sweltering mass  the excitement at this point became tremendous thousands of silvery fish leaped vaulted and fluttered in a seething mass on the sea  maggot roared and yelled his orders like a stentor even mild david trevarrow lost selfcommand and shouted vociferously  hand the basket cried maggot  a large basket with a rope attached to one handle was produced maggot seized the other handle and thrust it down among the wriggling pilchards  trevarrow hauled on the rope lifted the basket out of the sea and a cataract of living silver was shot into the boat accompanied by a mighty cheer  basketful after basketful followed until the men stood legdeep in fish  hold on a bit cried maggot as with rolledup sleeves dishevelled hair and glaring eyes he threw one leg over the side of the boat the more easily to continue his work  have a care cried oliver at that moment stretching out his hand but he was too late  the excitable smith had overbalanced himself and was already head and shoulders deep down among the pilchards which sprang high over him as if in triumph  to catch him by the legs and pull him back into the boat was the work of a moment but the proceedings were not interrupted by the mishap  a laugh greeted the smith as he was turned head up and immediately he braced himself to his arduous labour with renewed energy  the boat filled it was rowed to the shore and here was received by eager and noisy men women and children by whom the precious contents were carried to the cellars or saltinghouses where they were packed in the neatest possible piles layer on layer heads and tails with a sprinkling of salt between  maggots family had followed him to penberth  mrs m was there busy as a beeso was zackey so was little grace and so was the baby  they all worked like trojans the only difference between baby maggot and the others being that while they did as much work as in them lay he undid as much as possible was in every ones way fell over and into everything including the sea and generally fulfilled his mission of mischiefmaker with credit  the chet was there too  baby maggot had decreed that it should accompany him so there it was living on pilchards and dragging out its harassed existence in the usual way what between salt food and play kicks cuffs capers and gluttony its aspect at that time was more demoniacal perhaps than that of any other chet between john o groats and the lands end  volumes would scarcely contain all that might be written about this wonderful scene but enough has been said to indicate the process whereby maggot secured and salted some hundreds of thousands of pilchards  the enclosing of the fish was the result of a few minutes work but the salting and packing were not ended for many days  the result however was that the lucky smith sent many hogsheads of pilchards the way of most cornish fishnamely to the mediterranean for consumption by roman catholics and in due course he received the proceeds to the extent of three thousand pounds  thus did maggot auspiciously begin the making of his fortunewhich was originated and finally completed by his successful mining operations at botallack  and let it be observed here that he was neither the first nor the last poor man who became prosperous and wealthy by similar means  there are men not a few now alive in cornwall who began with hammer and pick and who now can afford to drink in champagne out of a golden flagon the good old cornish toastfish tin and copper    chapter thirty three  the last  many others as well as maggot made money by the pilchards at that time all round the coast of cornwall millions of these little fish were taken salted and exported  no fewer than one thousand hogsheads were taken at st ives in the first three seinenets cast into the sea  in mounts bay fowey bay mevagissey and other fishing grounds immense quantities were caught and the total catch of the county was little if at all short of thirty thousand hogsheads  among others old mr donnithorne was so successful that his broken fortunes were almost reestablished and a small sum which our friend oliver trembath had ventured to invest in the fishing was more than quadrupled before the end of the year  but this was not all  at the next botallack accountdinner mr cornish gladdened the hearts of the adventurers by telling them that the lodes which had been promising for such a length of time had at last got the length of performance and that he had now the pleasure of announcing a large dividend which he paid there and then  a considerable share of this fell to old mr donnithorne who in the enthusiasm of the occasion observed confidentially to captain dan that he was convinced honesty was the best policy after alla sentiment which the captain heartily agreed with although he failed to detect the precise connection between it and the old gentlemans sudden influx of good fortune  but then the captain did not drink botallack punch while old mr donnithorne did which may to some extent account for the difference in their powers of vision  captain dan however possessed wonderful powers of vision in reference to the underground workings of botallack which were displayed to advantageand to the great gratification of the shareholderswhen at the request of mr cornish he stood up and gave a detailed and graphic account of the prospects of the mine telling them that the appearance of the lodes in several parts of the mine was very promising indeed and that some ground was returning a rich harvest for the labour that had been bestowed on it that in the 105 which was driving north by six men they had taken down the copper for fourteen fathoms long nearly the whole of which had turned out to be worth 100 pounds per fathom that a splice had been formed in the lode about two fathoms behind the present end which had disordered it but he was glad to say it was again improving and was at that time about fifteen inches wide of rich copper and as far as he could judge they were going through to the top part of the bunch of copper that these facts he thought were very satisfactory but that it was still more gratifying to know that the lode on the bottom of the 105 was far more valuable than that in the back that in the crowns especially in the various levels under the sea the lodes were not only promising but performing great things two men and a boy he referred to maggot trevarrow and zackey here having broken an immense quantity of copper during the last quarter which was paying splendidly  at this point mr grenfell who sat on mr cornishs right hand exclaimed hear hear and a little baldheaded man with a red nose and blue spectacles near the foot of the table echoed hear with genuine enthusiasm for he had been bordering on bankruptcy for some months past and swigged off a full glass of punch without winking  thus encouraged captain dan went on to remark that there were six men driving in wheal hazzard which statement caused a stranger who chanced to be at the dinner to observe in an undertone that he was not aware they had horses or vehicles of any kind in the mines that one crosscut was also being driven and three winzes were sinking and one riseseveral of which were opening up tin of firstrate quality while in the narrow shaft chicornish higher mine and wheal cock a great deal to the same effect was being doneall of which we leave to the imagination of the reader merely remarking that however incomprehensible these things may appear to him or her they created feelings of profound joy in the assembled guests especially in the breast of the almost bankrupt one with the bald red and blue headpiece  mr cornish afterwards congratulated the adventurers on the success of the mine and the splendid prospects which were opening up to them prospects which he had no doubt would be fully realised ere long  he referred also to the condition of the miners of the neighbourhood and alluded to the fact that the neighbouring mines wheal owles and levant were also in a flourishing condition a matter he said for which they had reason to be profoundly thankful for the distress in the district had been severe and prolonged  the managers voice deepened at this point and he spoke with pathos for he had a kindly heart and his thoughts were at the moment with many a poor miner in whose little cottages the effects of gaunt poverty could be traced in scanty furniture meagre fare and careworn brows  he remembered too that only the week before he had seen poor blind john batten carried to his grave and had heard the sobs of the bereaved widow as she attempted to tell him how the brave man had forgotten himself to the very last when he put his wasted hand on her head and said im goin to leave thee mary for a time but cheer up dear lass ill be with jesus soon an have my sight restored and look wance more pon the faces of the dear boys an pon your own sweet face too dear lass when we meet again in heaven  there was one of the miners and shareholders of botallack who did not die but who lived to enjoy the fruit of his labour and the sunshine of prosperity  james penrose recoverednot only his health but also in some degree his sight  one of his eyes had indeed been entirely destroyed by the explosion which had so nearly killed him but the other was partially restored  a long period elapsed however ere he was able to go about  then he found his circumstances so much improved that it was not necessary to resume work underground  botallack in which all his savings had been invested continued steadily to improve and from the income derived from this source alone he was enabled to live without labouring  but penrose was not the man to sit down in idleness  wesley never had a more earnest follower than this miner of st just thenceforth he devoted himself to preaching teaching and doing good as his hand found opportunity and being an active man as well as conscientious he laboured to the end of his days in the service of his lord more energetically than he had ever toiled in the mines  penrose and david trevarrow had always been staunch friends  after the accident to the former they became more closely united than before trevarrow did not give up underground work he possessed no shares in any of the mines but in common with the rest of the mining community he benefited by the sunshine of prosperity that became so bright at that period and found leisure when above ground to join his friend in his labours of love  they both agreed to make an earnest effort to convince maggot and john cock of the error of their wayswith what amount of success it is not easy to state for these worthies were made of stubborn metal that required a furnace of unusually fierce heat to melt it  however we are warranted in concluding that some good was done from the fact that both of them gave up smuggling and in various other ways showed indication of an improved state of mind  maggot especially gave a signal and unexpected proof of a softened spirit when one sunday morning as he was getting ready for chapel he said to his wife that it was high time to send that little chucklehead the baby to sunday school for he was no better than a small heathen  the baby be it observed was about six years old at the time when this speech was made and his protege the chet was a greatgrandmother with innumerable chets of her own  it is right to add that in accordance with this opinion of his father the baby was carried off to school that very morning by zackey and grace the first having grown to be a strapping youth and the other a lovely girl for whose sake there were scores of young miners in st just who would gladly have walked ten miles on their bare knees or dived head foremost into wheal hazzard shaft or jumped over the cliffs into zawn buzzangein or done any other insane act or desperate deed if by so doing they could have caused one thrill of pleasure to pass through her dear little heart  it is not necessary we should think to say that in the midst of so much sunshine oliver trembath and rose ellis thought it advisable to make hay  old mr donnithorne and his excellent wife of whose goodness and wisdom by the way he became more and more convinced every day of his life saw no objection whatever to this haymakingso the young couple were wed at the wesleyan chapel of st justcharlie tregarthen of course being groomsmanand the only vehicle in the town was hired to drive them over to penberth cove and bliss  as to george augustus clearemout esquirethat able managing director despite his ducking at st just continued to fill his chair and to fulfil his destiny in the airy little street in london where for many years he represented wheal dooem and did a too confiding public  in this work he was ably assisted by secretary jack muddle who became quite celebrated as a clear expounder and explainer of veins lodes ores crosscuts shafts levels winzes minerals metals and mines insomuch that he was regarded by many of the confiding public who frequented his office as a more thoroughly learned and scientific man than george augustus himself  it is interesting how ever to have to record the curious fact that the too confiding public changed their opinion at last on this head and came to regard secretary jack as a humbug and the managing director as a scoundrel  unfortunately this change of opinion did not take place until the whole of the too confiding public the tcp as clearemout styled them had lost large sums of money and a few of them become bankrupt  when affairs had reached this crisis one of the tcpan irascible old gentleman whose fiery nature seemed to have singed all the hair off his head leaving it completely baldwent down to cornwall in a passion to sift the thing for himself  there he found the great wheal dooem pumpengine going full swing day and night under the superintendence of one man while the vast works underground on which depended the enormous dividends promised to and expected by the tcp were carried on by another man and a boy  on making this discovery the fiery old gentleman with the denuded head left cornwallstill in a passionand exploded in the face of a meeting of the members of the tcp who immediately exploded in each others faces and appointed an indignation committee to go and explode with unexampled fury in the faces of the managing director and secretary jack  but these knowing gentlemen being aware that the explosion was coming had wisely betaken themselves to the retirement and seclusion of the continent  without troubling the reader with further particulars we may say in conclusion that the result was the stoppage of wheal dooem mining operations and the summary dismissal of the two men and the boy  at the present day the ruins of that great concern may be seen standing on the wild seacliffs of west cornwall solitary gaunt and grey with the iron bob of the pumpengine motionless and pointing up obliquely to the sky as if the giant arm of the mine were upraised to protest for ever against the villainy and the too confiding folly that had left it standing therea monument of wasted and misdirected energya caution to all speculatorsa deserted minein the language of miners a knacked bal  there are many such knacked bals in cornwall with their iron bobs horizontal depressed or raised aloft according to the attitude in which they expiredholding forth similar firm silent and perpetual protests and cautions  many wheal dooems which having accomplished their ends may now be termed wheal donems are to be seen all over the country on gorseclad hills and on bold headlands but alongside of these may be seen their venerable ancestors still alive and working subject indeed at times to fits of depression when as their indomitable and unconquerable managers will tell you the price of tin is low and subject also to seasons of revival when they are getting a little better price for tin but still working on with untiring persistency whether the price of tin be high or low  chief among these our chosen type botallack may be seen bristling on the grey cliffs of the far west with the atlantic winds and spray revelling amongst its machinery and the thunder of its stamps giving constant token that hundreds of stouthearted stronglimbed cornishmen are still hewing out tin and copper from its gloomy depths as they did in days gone by and as they will doubtless continue to do in time to comesteadily sternly manfully doing their work of sinking and extending the mine deeper down under the sod and further out under the sea  the end
