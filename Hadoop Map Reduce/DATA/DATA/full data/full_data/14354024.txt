14354024	the dynasts  by thomas hardy   an epicdrama of the war with napoleon   in three parts nineteen acts and     one hundred and thirty scenes   the time covered by the action being about ten years         and i heard sounds of insult shame and wrong           and trumpets blown for wars     preface   the spectacle here presented in the likeness of a drama is concerned with the great historical calamity or clash of peoples artificially brought about some hundred years ago  the choice of such a subject was mainly due to three accidents of locality  it chanced that the writer was familiar with a part of england that lay within hail of the wateringplace in which king george the third had his favourite summer residence during the war with the first napoleon and where he was visited by ministers and others who bore the weight of english affairs on their more or less competent shoulders at that stressful time  secondly this district being also near the coast which had echoed with rumours of invasion in their intensest form while the descent threatened was formerly animated by memories and traditions of the desperate military preparations for that contingency  thirdly the same countryside happened to include the village which was the birthplace of nelsons flagcaptain at trafalgar  when as the first published result of these accidents the trumpet major was printed more than twenty years ago i found myself in the tantalizing position of having touched the fringe of a vast international tragedy without being able through limits of plan knowledge and opportunity to enter further into its events a restriction that prevailed for many years  but the slight regard paid to english influence and action throughout the struggle by those continental writers who had dealt imaginatively with napoleons career seemed always to leave room for a new handling of the theme which should reembody the features of this influence in their true proportion and accordingly on a belated day about six years back the following drama was outlined to be taken up now and then at wide intervals ever since  it may i think claim at least a tolerable fidelity to the facts of its date as they are give in ordinary records  whenever any evidence of the words really spoken or written by the characters in their various situations was attainable as close a paraphrase has been aimed at as was compatible with the form chosen  and in all cases outside the oral tradition accessible scenery and existing relics my indebtedness for detail to the abundant pages of the historian the biographer and the journalist english and foreign has been of course continuous  it was thought proper to introduce as supernatural spectators of the terrestrial action certain impersonated abstractions or intelligences called spirits  they are intended to be taken by the reader for what they may be worth as contrivances of the fancy merely their doctrines are but tentative and are advanced with little eye to a systematized philosophy warranted to lift the burthen of the mystery of this unintelligible world  the chief thing hoped for them is that they and their utterances may have dramatic plausibility enough to procure for them in the words of coleridge that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith  the wide prevalence of the monistic theory of the universe forbade in this twentieth century the importation of divine personages from any antique mythology as readymade sources or channels of causation even in verse and excluded the celestial machinery of say paradise lost as peremptorily as that of the iliad or the eddas  and the abandonment of the masculine pronoun in allusions to the first or fundamental energy seemed a necessary and logical consequence of the long abandonment by thinkers of the anthropomorphic conception of the same  these phantasmal intelligences are divided into groups of which one only that of the pities approximates to the universal sympathy of human naturethe spectator idealized1 of the greek chorus it is impressionable and inconsistent in its views which sway hither and thither as wrought on by events  another group approximates to the passionless insight of the ages  the remainder are eclectically chosen auxiliaries whose signification may be readily discerned in point of literary form the scheme of contrasted choruses and other conventions of this external feature was shaped with a single view to the modern expression of a modern outlook and in frank divergence from classical and other dramatic precedent which ruled the ancient voicings of ancient themes  it may hardly be necessary to inform readers that in devising this chroniclepiece no attempt has been made to create that completely organic structure of action and closelywebbed development of character and motive which are demanded in a drama strictly self contained  a panoramic show like the present is a series of historical ordinates to use a term in geometry the subject is familiar to all and foreknowledge is assumed to fill in the junctions required to combine the scenes into an artistic unity  should the mental spectator be unwilling or unable to do this a historical presentment on an intermittent plan in which the dramatis personae number some hundreds exclusive of crowds and armies becomes in his individual case unsuitable  in this assumption of a completion of the action by those to whom the drama is addressed it is interesting if unnecessary to name an exemplar as old as aeschylus whose plays are as dr verrall reminds us2 scenes from stories taken as known and would be unintelligible without supplementary scenes of the imagination  readers will readily discern too that the dynasts is intended simply for mental performance and not for the stage  some critics have averred that to declare a drama3 as being not for the stage is to make an announcement whose subject and predicate cancel each other  the question seems to be an unimportant matter of terminology compositions cast in this shape were without doubt originally written for the stage only and as a consequence their nomenclature of act scene and the like was drawn directly from the vehicle of representation  but in the course of time such a shape would reveal itself to be an eminently readable one moreover by dispensing with the theatre altogether a freedom of treatment was attainable in this form that was denied where the material possibilities of stagery had to be rigorously remembered  with the careless mechanicism of human speech the technicalities of practical mumming were retained in these productions when they had ceased to be concerned with the stage at all  to say then in the present case that a writing in playshape is not to be played is merely another way of stating that such writing has been done in a form for which there chances to be no brief definition save one already in use for works that it superficially but not entirely resembles  whether mental performance alone may not eventually be the fate of all drama other than that of contemporary or frivolous life is a kindred question not without interest  the mind naturally flies to the triumphs of the hellenic and elizabethan theatre in exhibiting scenes laid far in the unapparent and asks why they should not be repeated  but the meditative world is older more invidious more nervous more quizzical than it once was and being unhappily perplexed by                   riddles of death thebes never knew   may be less ready and less able than hellas and old england were to look through the insistent and often grotesque substance at the thing signified  in respect of such plays of poesy and dream a practicable compromise may conceivably result taking the shape of a monotonic delivery of speeches with dreamy conventional gestures something in the manner traditionally maintained by the old christmas mummers the curiously hypnotizing impressiveness of whose automatic stylethat of persons who spoke by no will of their ownmay be remembered by all who ever experienced it  gauzes or screens to blur outlines might still further shut off the actual as has indeed already been done in exceptional cases  but with this branch of the subject we are not concerned here  th  september 1903

with a haughty and unwavering faith   in their own batteringrams of argument   they deemed our buoyance whelmed and sapped and sunk   to our hopes sheer bottom whence a miracle   was all could friend and float us or maybe   they are amazed at our rude disrespect   in making mockery of an english law   sprung sacred from the kings own premiers brain   i hear them snort but let them wince at will   my duty must be done shall be done quickly   by citing some few facts              an act for our defence   it weakens not defends and oversea   swoln frances despot and his myrmidons   this moment know it and can scoff thereat   our people know it toothose who can peer   behind the scenes of this poor painted show   called soldieringthe act has failed must fail   as my right honourable friend well proved   when speaking tother night whose silencing   by his right honourable vis a vis   was of the genuine governmental sort   and like the catamarans their sapience shaped   all fizzle and no harm  laughter  the act in brief   effects this much that the whole force of england   is strengthened byeleven thousand men   so sorted that the british infantry   are now eight hundred less than heretofore    in ireland where the glamouring influence   of the right honourable gentleman   prevails with magic might eleven men   have been amassed  and in the cinqueport towns   where he is held

who with his single arm will overthrow   all buonapartes legions ere their keels   have scraped one pebble of our fortless shore   such is my motion sir and such my mind    he sits down amid cheers  the candlesnuffers go round and pitt   rises  during the momentary pause before he speaks the house assumes   an attentive stillness in which can be heard the rustling of the   trees without a horn from an early coach and the voice of the watch   crying the hour     pitt    not one on this side but appreciates   those mental gems and airy pleasantries   flashed by the honourable gentleman   who shines in them by birthright  each device   of drollery he has laboured to outshape   or treasured up from others who have shaped it   displays that are the conjurings of the moment   or mellowed and matured by sleeping on   dry hoardings in his book of commonplace   stored without stint of toil through days and months   he heaps into one mass and light and fans   as fuel for his flaming eloquence   mouthed and maintained without a thought or care   if germane to the theme or not at all    now vain indeed it were should i assay   to match him in such sort  for sir alas   to use imagination as the ground   of chronicle take myth and merry tale   as texts for prophecy is not my gift   being but a person primed with simple fact   unprinked by jewelled artbut to the thing    the preparations of the enemy   doggedly bent to desolate our land   advance with a sustained activity   they are seen they are known by you and by us all   but they evince no cleareyed tentative   in furtherance of the threat whose coming off   ay years may yet postpone whereby the act   will far outstrip him and the thousands called   duly to join the ranks by its provisions   in process sure if slow will ratch the lines   of english regimentsseasoned cool resolved   to glorious length and firm prepotency   and why then should we dream of its repeal   ere profiting by its advantages   must the house listen to such wilding words   as this proposal at the very hour   when the acts gearing finds its ordered grooves   and circles into full utility   the motion of the honourable gentleman   reminds me aptly of a publican   who should when malting mixing mashings past   fermenting barrelling and spigoting   quick taste the brew and shake his sapient head   and cry in acid voice the ale is new   brew old you varlets cast this slop away  cheers    but gravely sir i would conclude tonight   and as a serious man on serious things   i now speak here i pledge myself to this   unprecedented and magnificent   as were our strivings in the previous war   our efforts in the present shall transcend them   as men will learn  such efforts are not sized   by this light measuringrule my critic here   whips from

times   wherein our lot is cast has no example   times are they fraught with peril trouble gloom   we have to mark their lourings and to face them   sir reading thus the full significance   of these big days large though my lackings be   can any hold of those who know my past   that i of all men slight our safeguarding   no by all honour nowere i convinced   that such could be the mind of members here   my sorrowing thereat would doubly shade   the shade on england now  so i do trust   all in the house will take my tendered word   and credit my deliverance here tonight   that in this vital point of watch and ward   against the threatenings from yonder coast   we stand prepared and under providence   shall fend whatever hid or open stroke   a foe may deal      he sits down amid loud ministerial cheers with symptoms of     great exhaustion     windham    the question that compels the house tonight   is not of differences in wit and wit   but if for england it be well or no   to null the newfledged act as one inept   for setting up with speed and hot effect   the red machinery of desperate war   whatever it may do or not it stands   a statesman raw experiment  if ill   shall more experiments and more be tried   in stress of jeopardy that stirs demand   for sureness of proceeding  must this house   exchange safe action based on practised lines   for yet more ventures into risks unknown   to gratify a quaint projectors whim   while enemies hang grinning round our gates   to profit by mistake               my friend who spoke   found comedy in the matter  comical   as it may be in parentage and feature   most grave and tragic in its consequence   this act may prove  we are moving thoughtlessly   we squander precious brief lifesaving time   on idle guessgames  fail the measure must   nay failed it has already and should rouse   resolve in its progenitor himself   to move for its repeal  cheers     whitbread    i rise but to subjoin a phrase or two   to those of my right honourable friend   i too am one who reads the present pinch   as passing all our risks heretofore   for why  our bold and reckless enemy   relaxing not his plans has treasured time   to mass his monstrous force on all the coigns   from which our coast is close assailable   ay even afloat his concentrations work   two vast united squadrons of his sail   move at this moment viewless on the seas   their whereabouts untraced unguessable   will not be known to us till some black blow   be dealt by them in some undreamtof quarter   to knell our rule    that we are reasonably enfenced

at sight  i firmly hold   the latter loud iniquityone task   is theirs who would inter this corpsecold act   so saidto bring to birth a substitute   sir they have none they have given no thought to one   and this their deeds incautiously disclose   their cloaked intention and most secret aim   with them the question is not how to frame   a finer trick to trounce intrusive foes   but who shall be the future ministers   to whom such trick against intrusive foes   whatever it may prove shall be entrusted   they even ask the country gentlemen   to join them in this job  but god be praised   those gentlemen are sound and of repute   their names their attainments and their blood                                ironical opposition cheers   safeguard them from an onslaught on an act   for ends so

honest man will join a reckless crew   whod overthrow their country for their gain  laughter     tierney    it is incumbent on me to declare   in the last speakers face my censure based   on grounds most clear and constitutional   an act it is that studies to create   a standing army large and permanent   which kind of force has ever been beheld   with jealouseyed disfavour in this house   it makes for sure oppression binding men   to serve for less than service proves it worth   conditioned by no hampering penalty   for these and latespoke reasons then i say   let not the act deface the statutebook   but blot it out forthwith  hear hear     fox rising amid cheers              at this late hour   after the riddling fire the act has drawn ont   my words shall hold the house the briefest while   too obvious to the most unwilling mind   it grows that the existence of this law   experience and reflection have condemned   professing to do much it makes for nothing   not only so while feeble in effect   it shows it vicious in its principle   engaging to raise men for the common weal   it sets a harmful and unequal tax   capriciously on our communities   the annals of a century fail to show   more flagrant cases of oppressiveness   than those this statute works to perpetrate   which like all bills this favoured statesman frames   and clothes with tapestries of rhetoric   disguising their real web of commonplace   though held as shaped for english bulwarking   breathes in its heart perversities of party   and instincts toward oligarchic power   galling the many to relieve the few  cheers    whatever breadth and sense of equity   inform the methods of this minister   those mitigants nearly always trace their root   to measures that his predecessors wrought   and ere his government can dare assert   superior claim to englands confidence   they owe it to their honour and good name   to furnish better proof of such a claim   than is revealed by the abortiveness   of this thing called an act for our defence    to the great gifts of its artificer   no member of this house is more disposed   to yield full recognition than am i   no man has found more reason so to do   through the long roll of disputatious years   wherein we have stood opposed   but if one single fact could counsel me   to entertain a doubt of those great gifts   and cancel faith in his capacity   that fact would be the vast imprudence shown   in staking recklessly repute like his   on such an act as he has offered us   so false in principle so poor in fruit   sir the achievements and effects thereof   have furnished not one fragile argument   which all the partiality of friendship   can kindle to consider as the mark   of a clear vigorous freedomfostering mind      he sits down amid lengthy cheering from the opposition     sheridan    my summary shall be brief and to the point   the said right honourable prime minister   has thought it proper to declare my speech   the jesting of an irresponsible   words from a person who has never read   the act he claims him urgent to repeal   such quips and qizzings as he reckons them   he implicates as gathered from long hoards   stored up with cruel care to be discharged   with sudden blaze of pyrotechnic art   on the devoted gentle shrinking head   o the right incomparable gentleman  laughter   but were my humble solemn sad oration  laughter   indeed such rattle as he rated it   is it not strange and passing precedent   that the illustrious chief of government   should have uprisen with such indecent speed   and strenuously replied  he sir knows well   that vast and luminous talents like his own   could not have been demanded to choke off   a witcraft marked by nothing more of weight   than ignorant irregularity   nec deus intersitand soandso   is a wellworn citation whose close fit   none will perceive more clearly in the fane   than its presiding deity opposite  laughter   his thunderous answer thus perforce condemns him    moreover to top all the while replying   he still thought best to leave intact the reasons   on which my blame was founded                           thus them stands   my motion unimpaired convicting clearly   of dire perversion that capacity   we formerly admired  cries of oh oh                             this minister   whose circumventions never circumvent   whose coalitions fail to coalesce   this dab at secret treaties known to all   this darling of the aristocracy    laughter oh oh cheers and cries of divide    has brought the

discovered in his cabin writing     a letter     spirit of the pities         he pens in fits with pallid restlessness        like one who sees misfortune walk the wave        and can nor face nor flee it     spirit of the years                   he indites        to his long friend the minister decres        words that go heavily     villeneuve writing    i am made the arbiter in vast designs   whereof i see black outcomes  do i this   or do i that success that loves to jilt   her anxious wooer for some careless blade   will not reward me  for if i must pen it   demoralized past prayer in the marine   bad masts bad sails bad officers bad men   we cling to naval technics long outworn   and time and opportunity do not avail me   to take up new  i have long suspected such   but till i saw my helps the spanish ships   i hoped somewhatbrest is my nominal port   yet if so calder will again attack   now reinforced by nelson or cornwallis   and shatter my whole fleet shall i admit   that my true inclination and desire   is to make cadiz straightway and not brest   alas thereby i fail the emperor   but shame the navy less                    your friend villeneuve      general lauriston enters     lauriston    admiral my missive to the emperor   which i shall speed by special courier   from ferrol this near eve runs thus and thus   gravinas ships in ferrol here at hand   embayed but by a temporary wind   are all we now await  combined with these   we sail herefrom to brest there promptly give   cornwallis battle and release ganteaume   thence all united bearing channelwards   a step that sets in motion the first wheel   in the proud project of your majesty   now to be engined to the very close   to wit that a french fleet shall enter in   and hold the channel fourandtwenty hours   such clear assurance to the emperor   that our intent is modelled on his will   i hasten to dispatch to him forthwith4     villeneuve    yes lauriston  i sign to every word      lauriston goes out  villeneuve remains at his table in reverie     spirit of the years         we may impress him under visible shapes        that seem to shed a silent circling doom        hes such an one as can be so impressed        and this much is among our privileges        well bounded as they belet us draw near him      the spirits of years and of the pities take the form of seabirds     which alight on the sternbalcony of villeneuves ship immediately     outside his cabin window  villeneuve after a while looks up and     sees the birds watching him with large piercing eyes     villeneuve    my apprehensions even outstep their cause   as though some influence smote through yonder pane      he gazes listlessly and resumes his broodings    why dared i not disclose to him my thought   as nightly worded by the whistling shrouds   that brest will never see our battled hulls   helming to north in pomp of cannonry   to take the front in this red pilgrimage   if so it were now that id screen my skin   from risks of bloody business in the brunt   my acts could scarcely wear a difference   yet i would die tomorrownot ungladly   so far removed is carcasecare from me   for no self do these apprehensions spring   but for the causeyes rotten is our marine   which while i know the emperor knows not   and the pale secret chills  though some there be   would beard contingencies and buffet all   ill not command a course so conscienceless   rather ill stand and face napoleons rage   when he shall learn what mean the ambiguous lines   that facts have forced from me     spirit of the pities to the spirit of years         o eldestborn of the unconscious cause        if such thou beest as i can fancy thee        why dost thou rack him thus  consistency        might be preserved and yet his doom remain        his olden courage is without reproach        albeit his temper trends toward gaingiving     spirit of the years         i say as i have said long heretofore        i know but narrow freedom  feelst thou not        we are in its hand as hehere as elsewhere        we do but as we may no further dare      the birds disappear and the scene is lost behind seamist      scene iii    the camp and harbour of boulogne      the english coast in the distance  near the tour dordre stands     a hut with sentinels and aides outside it is napoleons temporary     lodging when not at his headquarters at the chateau of pontde     briques two miles inland     dumb show    a courier arrives with dispatches and enters the emperors quarters   whence he emerges and goes on with other dispatches to the hut of   decres lower down  immediately after napoleon comes out from his   hut with a paper in his hand and musingly proceeds towards an   eminence commanding the channel    along the shore below are forming in a farreaching line more   than a hundred thousand infantry  on the downs in the rear of   the camps fifteen thousand cavalry are manoeuvring their   accoutrements flashing in the sun like a school of mackerel   the flotilla lies in and around the port alive with moving   figures    with his head forward and his hands behind him the emperor surveys   these animated proceedings in detail but more frequently turns his   face toward the telegraph on the cliff to the southwest erected to   signal when villeneuve and the combined squadrons shall be visible   on the west horizon    he summons one of the aides who descends to the hut of decres   decres comes out from his hut and hastens to join the emperor   dumb show ends      napoleon and decres advance to the foreground of the scene     napoleon    decres this action with sir robert calder   three weeks ago whereof we dimly heard   and clear details of which i have just unsealed   is on the whole auspicious for our plan   it seems that twenty of our ships and spains   none over eightygunned and some far less   engaged the english off cape finisterre   with fifteen vessels of a hundred each   we coolly fought and orderly as they   and but for mist we had closed with victory   two english were much mauled some spanish damaged   and calder then drew off with his two wrecks   and spains in tow we giving chase forthwith   not overtaking him our admiral   having the coast clear for his purposes   entered coruna and found order there   to open the port of brest and come on hither   thus hastes the moment when the double fleet   of villeneuve and of ganteaume should appear      he looks again towards the telegraph     decres with hesitation    and should they not appear your majesty     napoleon    not  but they will and do it early too   theres nothing hinders them  my god they must   for i have much before me when this stroke   at englands dealt  i learn from talleyrand   that austrian preparations threaten hot   while russias hostile schemes are ripening   and shortly must be metmy plan is fixed   i am prepared for each alternative   if villeneuve come i brave the british coast   convulse the land with fear tis even now   so far distraught that generals cast about   to find new modes of warfare yea design   carriages to transport their infantry   once on the english soil i hold it firm   descend on london and the while my men   salute the dome of pauls i cut the knot   of all pitts coalitions setting free   from bondage to a cold manorial caste   a people who await it      they stand and regard the chalky cliffs of england till napoleon     resumes              should it be   even that my admirals fail to keep the tryst   a thing scarce thinkable when alls reviewed   i strike this seaside camp cross germany   with these two hundred thousand seasoned men   and pause not till within viennas walls   i cry checkmate  next venice too being taken   and austrias other holdings down that way   the bourbons also driven from italy   i strike at russiaeach in turn you note   ere they can act conjoined             report to me   what has been scanned today upon the main   and on your passage down request them there   to send daru this way     decres as he withdraws    the emperor can be sanguine  scarce can i   his letters are more promising than mine   alas alas villeneuve my dear old friend   why do you pen me this at such a time    he retires reading villeneuves letter  the emperor walks up and   down till daru his private secretary joins him     napoleon    come quick daru sit down upon the grass   and write whilst i am in mind              first to villeneuve    i trust viceadmiral that before this date   your fleet has opened brest and gone  if not   these lines will greet you there  but pause not pray   waste not a moment dallying  sail away   once bring my coupled squadrons channelwards   and englands soil is ours  alls ready here   the troops alert and every store embarked   hold the nigh sea but fourandtwenty hours   and our vast end is gained              now to ganteaume    my telegraphs will have made known to you   my object and desire to be but this   that you forbid villeneuve to lose an hour   in getting fit and putting forth to sea   to profit by the fifty firstrate craft   wherewith i now am bettered  quickly weigh   and steer you for the channel with all your strength   i count upon your wellknown character   your enterprize your vigour to do this   sail hither then and we will be avenged   for centuries of despite and contumely     daru    shall a fair transcript sire be made forthwith     napoleon    this moment  and the courier will depart   and travel without pause      daru goes to his office a little lower down and the emperor     lingers on the cliffs looking through his glass      the point of view shifts across the channel the boulogne cliffs     sinking behind the waterline      scene iv    south wessex  a ridgelike down near the coast      the down commands a wide view over the english channel in front     of it including the popular royal wateringplace with the isle     of slingers and its roadstead where menofwar and frigates are     anchored  the hour is ten in the morning and the july sun glows     upon a large military encampment round about the foreground and     warms the stone fieldwalls that take the place of hedges here      artillery cavalry and infantry english and hanoverian are     drawn up for review under the duke of cumberland and officers     of the staff forming a vast military array which extends     three miles and as far as the downs are visible      in the centre by the royal standard appears king george on     horseback and his suite  in a coach drawn by six cream     coloured hanoverian horses queen charlotte sits with three     princesses in another carriage with four horses are two more     princesses  there are also present with the royal party the     lord chancellor lord mulgrave count munster and many other     luminaries of fashion and influence      the review proceeds in dumb show and the din of many bands     mingles with the cheers  the turf behind the salutingpoint     is crowded with carriages and spectators on foot     a spectator    and youve come to the sight like the king and myself  well one   fool makes many  what a mampus o folk it is here today  and what   a time we do live in between wars and wassailings the goblin o   boney and king george in flesh and blood     second spectator    yes  i wonder king george is let venture down on this coast where   he might be snapped up in a moment like a minney by a hern so near   as we be to the field of boneys vagaries  begad hes as like to   land here as anywhere  gloucester lodge could be surrounded and   george and charlotte carried off before he could put on his hat or   she her red cloak and pattens     third spectator    twould be so such joke to kidnap em as you think  look at the   frigates down there  every night they are drawn up in a line   across the mouth of the bay almost touching each other and   ashore a double line of sentinels well primed with beer and   ammunition one at the waters edge and the other on the   esplanade stretch along the whole front  then close to the   lodge a guard is mounted after eight oclock there be pickets   on all the hills at the harbour mouth is a battery of twenty   fourpounders and overright em a dozen sixpounders and   several howitzers  and next look at the size of the camp of   horse and foot up here     first spectator    everybody however was fairly gallied this week when the king went   out yachting meaning to be back for the theatre and the eight or   nine oclock came and never a sign of him  i dont know when a   did land but twas said by all that it was a foolhardy pleasure   to take     fourth spectator    hes a very obstinate and comical old gentleman and by all account   a wouldnt make port when asked to     second spectator    lard lard if a were nabbed it wouldnt make a deal of difference   we should have nobody to zing and play singlestick to and grin at   through horsecollars thats true  and nobody to sign our few   documents  but we should rub along some way goodnow     first spectator    step up on this barrow you can see better  the troopers now passing   are the york hussarsforeigners to a man except the officersthe   same regiment the two young germans belonged to who were shot four   years ago  now come the light dragoons what a time they take to   get all past  well well this day will be recorded in history     second spectator    or another soon to follow it  he gazes over the channel  theres   not a speck of an enemy upon that shiny water yet but the brest   fleet is zaid to have put to sea to act in concert with the army   crossing from boulogne and if so the french will soon be here when   god save us all  ive took to drinking neat for say i one may   as well have innerds burnt out as shot out and tis a good deal   pleasanter for the man that owns em  they say that a cannonball   knocked poor jim popples maw right up into the futtockshrouds at   the nile where a hung like a nightcap out to dry  much good to   him his obeying his old mothers wish and refusing his allowance   o rum      the bands play and the review continues till past eleven oclock     then follows a sham fight  at noon precisely the royal carriages     draw off the ground into the highway that leads down to the town     and gloucester lodge followed by other equipages in such numbers     that the road is blocked  a multitude comes after on foot     presently the vehicles manage to proceed to the wateringplace and     the troops march away to the various camps as a seamist cloaks the     perspective      scene v    the same  rainbarrows beacon egdon heath      night in midaugust of the same summer  a lofty ridge of     heathland reveals itself dimly terminating in an abrupt slope     at the summit of which are three tumuli  on the sheltered side     of the most prominent of these stands a hut of turves with a     brick chimney  in front are two ricks of fuel one of heather     and furze for quick ignition the other of wood for slow burning     something in the feel of the darkness and in the personality of     the

assume that it means to let us carry out this invasion with pleasing   slaughter so as not to disappoint my hope     semichorus i of the years aerial music         we carry out  nay but should we

wateringplace beyond the     hills stretched towards the outskirts of the heath and passes     away eastward     dumb show    moving figures and vehicles dot the surface of the road all   progressing in one direction away from the coast  in the   foreground the shapes appear as those of civilians mostly on   foot but many in gigs and tradesmens carts and on horseback   when they reach an intermediate hill some pause and look back   others enter on the next decline landwards without turning   their heads    from the opposite horizon numerous companies of volunteers in the   local uniform of red with green facings5 are moving coastwards in   companies as are also irregular bodies of pikemen without uniform   while on the upper slopes of the downs towards the shore regiments   of the line are visible with cavalry and artillery all passing   over to the coast    at a signal from the chief intelligences two phantoms of rumour enter   on the highway in the garb of countrymen     first phantom to pedestrians    wither so fast good neighbours and before breakfast too  empty   bellies be bad to vamp on     first pedestrian    hes landed westard out by abbots beach  and if you have property   youll save it and yourselves as we are doing     second pedestrian    all yesterday the firing at boulogne   was like the seven thunders heard in heaven   when the fierce angel spoke  so did he draw   fullmanned flatbottomed for the shallowest shore   dropped down to west and crossed our frontage here   seen from above they specked the watershine   as will a flight of swallows toward dim eve   descending on a smooth and loitering stream   to seek some eyots sedge     second phantom         we are sent to enlighten you and ease your soul        even now a courier canters to the port        to check the baseless scare     first pedestrian    these be inland men who i warrant ee dont know a lerret from a   lighter  lets take no heed of such comrade and hurry on     first phantom              will you not hear        that what was seen behind the midnight mist        their oarblades tossing twinkles to the moon        was but a fleet of fishingcraft belated        by reason of the vastness of their haul     first pedestrian    hey  and dye know itnow i look back to the top o rudgeway   the folk seem as come to a pause therebe this true never again   do i stir my stumps for any alarm short of the day of judgment   nine times has my rheumatical rest been broke in these last three   years by hues and cries of boney upon us  od rot the feller   now hes made a fool of me once more till my inside is like a   washtub what wi being so gallied and running so leerybut   how if you be one of the enemy sent to sow these tares so to   speak it these false tidings and coax us into a fancied safety   hey neighbours  i dont after all care for this story     second pedestrian    onwards again   if boneys come tis best to be away   and if hes not why weve a holiday      exeunt pedestrians  the spirits of rumour vanish while the scene     seems to become involved in the smoke from the beacon and slowly     disappears6     act third     scene i    boulogne  the

majesty   to send across this daybreak  but events   have proved intractable it seems of late   and hence i haste in person to report   the featless facts that just have dashed my     napoleon

ships   several ran foul of neighbours whose new hurts   being added to their innate clumsiness   gave hap the upper hand and in quick course   demoralized the whole until villeneuve   judging that calder now with nelson rode   and prescient of unparalleled disaster   if he pushed on in so disjoint a trim   bowed to the inevitable and thus perforce   leaving to other opportunity   brest and the channel scheme with vast regret   steered southward into cadiz     napoleon having risen from the table              whatis then   my scheme of years to be disdained and dashed   by this mans like a wretched moral coward   whom you must needs foist on me as one fit   for full command in pregnant enterprise     monge aside    im one too many here  let me step out   till this black squall blows

movements seen abroad   what of the country now the sessions past   what of the country eh and of the war     pitt    the thoughts i have laid before your majesty   would make for this in sum   that mr fox lord grenville and their friends   be straightway asked to join  with melville gone   with sidmouth and with buckinghamshire too   the steerage of affairs has stood of late   somewhat provisional as you sir know   with stopgap functions thrust on offices   which common weal can tolerate but awhile   so for the weighty reasons i have urged   i do repeat my most respectful hope   to win your majestys ungrudged assent   to what i have proposed     king              but nothing sure   has been more plain to all dear mr pitt   than that your own proved energy and scope   is ample without aid to carry on   our just crusade against the corsican   why then go calling fox and grenville in   such helps we need not  pray you think upont   and speak to me againweve had alarms   making us skip like crackers at our heels   that bonaparte had landed close hereby     pitt    such rumours come as regularly as harvest     king    and now he has left boulogne with all his host   was it his object to invade at all   or was his vast assemblage there a blind     pitt    undoubtedly he meant invasion sir   had fortune favoured  he may try it yet   and as i said could we but close with fox     king    but buti ask what is his object now   lord nelsons captainhardywhose old home   stands in a peaceful vale hard by us here   who came two weeks ago to see his friends   i talked to in this room a lengthy while   he says our navy still is in thick night   as to the aims by sea of bonaparte   now the boulogne attempt has fizzled out   and what he schemes afloat with spain combined   the victory lay that fortnight at spithead   and nelson since has gone aboard and sailed   yes sailed again  the royal sovereign follows   and others her  nelson was hailed and cheered   to

ahyou have heard of course  god speed him pitt     pitt    amen amen     king              i read it as a thing   of signal augury and one which bodes   heavens confidence in me and in my line   that i should rule as king in such an age   well wellso this new march of bonapartes   was unexpected forced perchance on him     pitt    it may be so your majesty it may   last noon the austrian ambassador   whom i consulted ere i posted down   assured me that his latest papers word   how general mack and eighty thousand men   have made good speed across bavaria   to wait the french and give them check at ulm   that fortressfrontiertown entrenched and walled   a place long chosen as a vantagepoint   whereon to encounter them as they outwind   from the blind shades and baffling green defiles   of the black forest worn with wayfaring   here mack will intercept his agile foe   hasting to meet the russians in bohemia   and cripple him if not annihilate    thus now sir opens out this great alliance   of russia austria england whereto i   have lent my earnest efforts through long months   and the realm gives her money ships and men   it claps a muffler round the cocks steel spurs   and leaves me sanguine on his overthrow   but thenthis coalition of resources   demands a strong and active cabinet   to aid your majestys directive hand   and thus i urge again the said additions   these brilliant intellects of the other side   who stand by fox  with us conjoined they     king    what what againin face of my sound reasons   believe me pitt you underrate yourself   you do not need such aid  the splendid feat   of banding europe in a righteous cause   that you have achieved so soon to put to shame   this wicked bombardier of dynasties   that rule by right divine goes straight to prove   we had best continue as we have begun   and call no partners to our management   to fear dilemmas horning up ahead   is not your wont  nay nay now mr pitt   i must be firm  and if you love your king   youll goad him not so rashly to embrace   this foxgrenville faction and its friends   rather than fox why give me civil war   hey what  but what besides     pitt    i say besides

in my honour  at six oclock this evening there are   to be combats at singlestick to amuse the folk four guineas   the prize for the man who breaks most heads  afterward there   is to be a grinning

that the track   of armies bearing hither from the rhine   whether in peace or strenuous invasion   should pierce the schwarzwald and through memmingen   and meet us in our front  but he must wind   and corkscrew meanly round where foot of man   can scarce find pathway stealing up to us   thiefwise by out back door  nevertheless   if english warfleets be abreast boulogne   as these deserters tell and ripe to land there   it destines bonaparte to pack him back   across the rhine again  weve but to wait   and see him go     archduke    but who shall say if these bright tales be true     mack    even then small matter your imperial highness   the russians near us daily and must soon   ay far within the eight days i have named   be operating to untie this knot   if we hold on     archduke

i am much surprised your highness much   you mark not how destructive tis to part   if we wait on for certain we should wait   in our full strength compacted undispersed   by such partition as your highness plans     schwarzenberg    theres truth in urging we should not divide   but weld more closelyyet why stay at all   methinks theres but one sure salvation left   to wit that we conjunctly march herefrom   and with much circumspection towards the tyrol   the subtle often rack their wits in vain   assay whole magazines of strategy   to shun ill loomings deemed insuperable   when simple souls by stumbling up to them   find the grim shapes but air  but let use grant   that the investing french so ring us in   as to leave not a span for such exploit   then go wethrow ourselves upon

archduke    my course is chosen  o this black campaign   which pitts alarmed dispatches pricked us to   all unforseeing  any risk for me   rather than court humiliation here      mack has risen during the latter remarks walked to the     window and looked out at the rain  he returns with an air     of embarrassment     mack to archduke    it is my privilege firmly to submit   that your imperial highness undertake   no venturous vaulting into risks unknown   assume that you sire as you have proposed   with your light regiments and the cavalry   detach yourself from us to scoop a way   by circuits northwards through the rauhe alps   and herdenheim into bohemia   reports all point that you will be attacked   enveloped borne on to capitulate   what worse can happen here   remember sire the emperor deputes me   should such a clash arise as has arisen   to exercise supreme authority   the honour of our arms our race demands   that none of your imperial highness line   be pounded prisoner by this vulgar foe   who is not france but an adventurer   imposing on that country for his gain     archduke    but it seems clear to me that loitering here   is full as like to compass our surrender   as moving hence  and ill it therefore suits   the mood of one of my high temperature   to pause inactive while await me means   of desperate cure for these so desperate ills      the archduke ferdinand goes out   a troubled silence follows     during which the gusts call into the chimney and raindrops spit     on the fire     schwarzenberg    the archduke bears him shrewdly in this course   we may as well look matters in the face   and that we are cooped and cornered is most clear   clear it is too that but a miracle   can work to loose us  i have stoutly held   that this mans three years ostentatious scheme   to fling his army on the tempting shores   of our allies the english was awell   scarce other than a trick of thimblerig   to still us into false security

 thank ee good friend  but noi havent time   i do assure younot a trice to spare   as you well will see      a few minutes later scott falls dead a bullet having pierced     his skull  immediately after a shot passes between the admiral     and the captain tearing the instep of hardys shoe and striking     away the buckle  they shake off the dust and splinters it has     scattered over them

action on     the several decks and firemen carry buckets of water hither and     thither  the killed and wounded thicken around and are being     lifted and examined by the surgeons  nelson and hardy meet again     nelson    bid still the firemen bring more bucketfuls   and dash the water into each new hole   our guns have gouged in the redoubtable   or we shall all be set ablaze together     hardy    let me once more advise entreat my lord   that you do not expose yourself so clearly   those fellows in the mizzentop up there   are peppering round you quite perceptibly     nelson    now hardy dont offend me  they cant aim   they only set their own rent sails on fire   but if they could i would not hide a button   to save ten lives like mine  i have no cause   to prize it i assure eeah look there   one of the women hitand badly too   poor wench  let some one shift her quickly down     hardy    my lord each humblest sojourner on the seas   docklabourer lame longshoreman bowed

of me   but faith i have had my day  my works nigh done   i serve all interests best by chancing it   here with the commonestah their heavy guns   are silenced every one  thank god for that     hardy    tis so  they only use their small arms now      he goes to larboard to see what is progressing on that side     between his ship and the santisima trinidad     officer to seaman    swab down these stairs  the mess of blood about   makes em so slippery that ones like to fall   in carrying the wounded men below      while captain hardy is still a little way off lord nelson turns     to walk aft when a ball from one of the muskets in the mizzen     top of the redoubtable enters his left shoulder  he falls upon     his face on the deck  hardy looks round and sees what has     happened     hardy hastily    ahwhat i feared and strove to hide i feared      he goes towards nelson who in the meantime has been lifted by     sergeantmajor secker and two seamen     nelson    hardy i think theyve done for me at last     hardy    i hope not     nelson              yes  my backbone is shot through   i have not long to live      the men proceed to carry him below              those tiller

become enveloped in smoke and the     point of view changes      scene iii    the same  on board the bucentaure      the bowsprit of the french admirals ship is stuck fast in the     sterngallery of the santisima trinidad the starboard side of     the bucentaure being shattered by shots from two english three     deckers which are pounding her on that hand  the poop is also     reduced to ruin by two other english ships that are attacking     her from behind      on the quarterdeck are admiral villeneuve the flagcaptain     magendie lieutenants daudignon fournier and others anxiously     occupied  the whole crew is in desperate action of battle and     stumbling among the dead and dying who have fallen too rapidly     to be carried below     villeneuve    we shall be crushed if matters go on thus   direct the trinidad to let her drive   that this foul tangle may be loosened clear     daudignon    it has been tried sir but she cannot move     villeneuve    then signal to the hero that she strive   once more to drop this way    magendie              we may make signs   but in the thickened air what signals marked   tis done however     villeneuve              the

hour or half ago   with dandyism raised to godlike pitch   he stalked the deck in all his jewellery   and so was hit     magendie              then fortune shows her face   we have scotched england in dispatching him  he watches   yes  he commands no more and lucas joying   has taken steps to board  look spars are laid   and his best men are mounting at his heels     villeneuve    ah godhe is too late  whence came the hurl   of heavy grape  the smoke prevents my seeing   but at brief whilesthe boarding band has fallen   fallen almost to a mantwas well assayed     magendie    thats from their temeraire whose vicious broadside   has cleared poor lucas decks     villeneuve              and lucas too   i see him no more there  his red planks show   three hundred dead if one  now for ourselves      four of the english threedeckers have gradually closed round     the bucentaure whose bowsprit still sticks fast in the gallery     of the santisima trinidad  a broadside comes from one of the     english resulting in worse havoc on the bucentaure  the main     and mizzen masts of the latter fall and the boats are beaten to     pieces  a raking fire of musketry follows from the attacking     ships to which the bucentaure heroically continues still to     keep up a reply      captain magendie falls wounded  his place is taken by lieutenant     daudignon     villeneuve    now that the fume has lessened code my biddance   upon our only mast and tell the van   at once to wear and come into the fire   aside if it be true that as he sneers success   demands of me but cool audacity   today shall leave him nothing to desire      musketry continues  daudignon falls  he is removed his post     being taken by lieutenant fournier  another crash comes and     the deck is suddenly encumbered with rigging     fournier    there goes our foremast  how for signalling now     villeneuve    to try that longer fournier is in vain   upon this haggard scorched and ravaged hulk   her decks all reeking with such gory shows   her starboard side in rents her stern nigh gone   how does she keep afloat   bucentaure o lucky good old ship   my part in you is played  ayi must go   i must tempt fate elsewhereif but a boat   can bear me through this wreckage to the van     fournier    our boats are stove in or as full of holes   as the cooks skimmer from their cursed balls      musketry  villeneuves headofstaff de prigny falls wounded     and many additional men  villeneuve glances troublously from     ship to ship of his fleet     villeneuve    how hideous are the waves so pure this dawn   redfrothed and friends and foes all mixed therein   can we in some way hail the trinidad   and get a boat from her      they attempt to distract the attention of the santisima     trinidad by shouting              impossible   amid the loud combustion of this strife   as well try holloing to the antipodes   so here i am  the bliss of nelsons end   will not be mine his full refulgent eve   becomes my midnight  well the fleets shall see   that i can yield my cause with dignity      the bucentaure strikes her flag  a boat then puts off from the     english ship conqueror and villeneuve having surrendered his     sword is taken out from the bucentaure  but being unable to     regain her own ship the boat is picked up by the mars and     the french admiral is received aboard her

warring     fleets culminating at times in loud concussions  the wounded     are lying around in rows for treatment some groaning some     silently dying some dead  the gloomy atmosphere of the low

day with us and england     hardy    well very well thank god fort my dear lord   villeneuve their admiral has this moment struck   and put himself aboard the conqueror   some fourteen of their firstrates or about   thus far weve got  the said bucentaure chief   the santa ana the redoubtable   the fougueux the santisima trinidad   san augustino san francisco aigle   and our old swiftsure too weve grappled back   to every seamans joy  but now their van   has tacked to bear round on the victory   and crush her by sheer weight of wood and brass   three of our best i am therefore calling up

all along the river that   nighta regular hot oneand uncle john was carried on board a   manofwar to fight under nelson and nobody minded uncle johns   parrot and it talked itself to death  so mr pitt killed uncle   johns parrot see it sir     second citizen    you had better have a care of this boy friend  his brain is too   precious for the common risks of cheapside  not but what he might   as well have said boney killed the parrot when he was about it   and as for nelsonwhos now sailing shinier seas than ours if   theyve rubbed her off his slate where hes gone tothe french   papers say

the french lines are heard shouts     and a wide illumination grows and strengthens but the hollows     are still mantled in fog    are these the signs of regiments out of heart   and beating backward from an enemy       he remains pondering  on the pratzen heights immediately in front     there begins a movement among the russians signifying that the plan     which involves desertion of that vantageground is about to be put     in force  noises of drunken singing arise from the russian lines at     various points elsewhere      the night shades involve the whole      scene iii    the same  the french position      shortly before dawn on the morning of the 2nd of december  a     white frost and fog still prevail in the lowlying areas but     overhead the sky is clear  a dead silence reigns      napoleon on a grey horse closely attended by berthier and     surrounded by marshals soult lannes murat and their aidesde     camp all cloaked is discernible in the gloom riding down     from the high ground before bellowitz on which they have     bivouacked to the village of puntowitz on the goldbach stream     quite near the front of the russian position of the day before     on the pratzen crest  the emperor and his companions come to     a pause look around and upward to the hills and listen     napoleon    their bivouac fires that lit the top last night   are all extinct     lannes              and hark you sire i catch   a sound which if i err not means the thing   we have hoped and hoping feared fate would not yield     napoleon    my god it surely is the tramp of horse   and jolt of cannon downward from the hill   toward our right here by the swampy lakes   that face davout  thus as i sketched they work     murat    yes  they already move upon tilnitz     napoleon    leave them alone  nor stick nor stone well stir   to interrupt them  nought that we can scheme   will help us like their own stark sightlessness   let them get down to those white lowlands there   and so far plunge in the level that no skill   when sudden vision flashes on their fault   can help them though despairstung to regain   the key to mastery held at yestereve    meantime move onward these divisions here   under the fogs kind shroud descend the slope   and cross the stream below the russian lines   there halt concealed till i send down the word      napoleon and his staff retire to the hill southeast of bellowitz     and the day dawns pallidly    tis good to get above that rimy cloak   and into cleaner air  it chilled me through      when they reach the summit they are over the fog and suddenly     the sun breaks forth to the left of pratzen illuminating the     ashhued face of napoleon and the faces of those around him     all eyes are turned first to the sun and thence to look for     the dense masses of men that had occupied the upland the night     before    murat    i see them not  the plateau seems deserted     napoleon    gone verilyah how much will you bid   an hour hence for the coign abandoned now   the battles oursit was then their rash march   downwards to tilnitz and the goldbach swamps   before dawn that we heardno hurry lannes   enjoy this sun that

the austrorussian cavalry   haste off  the victory promising today   will like a thunderclap conclude the war      the marshals with their aides gallop away towards their respective     divisions  soon the two divisions under soult are seen ascending     in close column the inclines of the pratzen height  thereupon the     heads of the russian centre columns disclose themselves breaking     the skyline of the summit from the other side in a desperate     attempt to regain the position vacated by the russian left  a     fierce struggle develops there between soults divisions and these     who

brought such fame   that it must needs be one which charms you sire     napoleon    good  now this war  it has been forced on me   just at a crisis most inopportune   when all my energies and arms

accept it likewise and withdraw his force   by daily measured march to his own realm     napoleon    for him i take your word  and pray believe   that rank ambitions are your own not mine   that

partly from his limbs last lammastide   when that despairing journey to the king   at gloucester lodge by wessex shore was made   to beg such  but relief the king refused   why want you fox

on the landing and     makes inquiries     lady hester whispering    he wills the wardenry of his affairs   to his old friend the bishop  but his words   bespeak too much anxiety for me   and underrate his services so far   that he has doubts if his high deeds deserve   such size of recognition by the state   as would award slim pensions to his kin   he had been fain to write down his intents   but the quill dropped from his unmuscled hand   now his friend tomline pens what he dictates   and gleans the lippings of his last desires      rose and lady hester turn  they see the bishop bending over     the bed with a sheet of paper on which he has previously been     writing  a little later he dips a quill and holds it within     the bedcurtain spreading the paper beneath  a thin white     hand emerges from behind the curtain and signs the paper  the     bishop beckons forward the two servants who also sign      farquhar on one side of the bed and tomline on the other are     spoken to by the dying man  the bishop afterwards withdraws     from the bed and comes to the landing where the others are     tomline    a list of his directions has been drawn   and feeling somewhat more at mental ease   he asks sir walter if he has long to live   farquhar just answered in a soothing tone   that hope still frailly breathed recovery   at this my dear friend smiled and shook his head   as if to say i can translate your words   but i reproach not friendships lullabies     rose    rest he required and rest was not for him      farquhar comes forward as they wait     farquhar    his spell of concentration on these things   determined now that long have wasted him   have left him in a numbing lethargy   from which i fear he may not rouse to strength   for speech with earth

  the emperor of france is as i say   yet bring i good assurance and declare   a medicine for all bruised europes sores     fox impatiently    well parley to the point for i confess   no new negotiation do i note   that you can open up to work such cure     gevrilliere    the sovereign remedy for an ill effect   is the extinction of its evil cause   safely and surely how to compass this

by your latesent lines   of specious import by your bland address   i have been led to prattle hopefully   with a cutthroat confessed      the head constable and the secretary enter at the same moment

so   that dignified and pensive gentleman   was a bold bravo waiting for his chance   he sketched a scheme for murdering bonaparte   eitheras in my haste i understood   by shooting from a window as he passed   or by some other wry and stealthy means   that haunt sad brains which brood on despotism   but lack the tools to justly cope therewith   on later thoughts i feel not fully sure   if in my

facing the respective banks of the stream a roundheaded doorway     richly festooned  the cumbersome erection acquires from the     current a rhythmical movement as if it were breathing and the

emperor alexandera graceful flexible man of thirty with a   courteous manner and goodnatured face  he has come out from   an inn on that side accompanied by the grand duke constantine   general bennigsen general ouwaroff prince labanoff and adjutant   general count lieven    the two barges draw towards the raft reaching the opposite sides   of it about the same time amidst discharges of cannon  each   emperor enters the door that faces him and meeting in the centre   of the pavilion they formally embrace each other  they retire   together to the screened interior the suite of each remaining in   the outer half of the pavilion    more than an hour passes while they are thus invisible  the french   officers who have observed the scene from the lodging of napoleon   walk about

unfortunate king and queen by asking them to a banquet   here     first spy    such a spirited woman will never come     second spy    we shall see  whom necessity compels needs must and she has gone   through an iliad of woes     first spy    it is this spanish business that will stagger england by god  and   now to let her know it     french subaltern looking out above    what are those townspeople talking about so earnestly i wonder  the   lingo of this place has an accent akin to english     second subaltern    no doubt because the races are both teutonic      the spies observe that they are noticed and disappear in the     crowd  the curtain drops      scene viii    the same      the midsummer sun is low and a long table in the aforeshown     apartment is laid out for a dinner among the decorations being     bunches of the seasons roses      at the vacant end of the room divided from the dining end by     foldingdoors now open there are discovered the emperor napoleon     the grandduke constantine prince henry of prussia the prince     royal of bavaria the grand duke of berg and attendant officers      enter the tsar alexander  napoleon welcomes him and the twain     move apart from the rest  bonaparte placing a chair for his     visitor and flinging himself down on another     napoleon    the comforts i can offer are not great   nor is the accommodation more than scant   that falls to me for hospitality   but as it is accept     alexander              it serves well   and to unbrace the bandages of state   is as clear air to incensestifled souls   what of the queen     napoleon              shes coming with the king   we have some quarterhour to spare or more   before their majesties are timed for us     alexander    good  i would speak of them  that she should show here   after the late events betokens much   abasement in so proud a womans heart  his voice grows tremulous   is not without a dash of painfulness   and i beseech you sire that you hold out   some soothing hope for her     napoleon              i have already   now sire to those affairs we entered on   strong friendship grown secure bids me repeat   that you have been much duped by your allies      alexander shows mortification    prussias a shuffler england a selfseeker   nobility has shone in you alone   your error grew of overgenerous dreams   and misbeliefs by dullard ministers   by treating personally we speed affairs   more in an hour than they in blundering months   between us two henceforth must stand no third   theres peril in it while englands mean ambition   still works to get us skewered by the ears   and in this view your chiefsofstaff concur     alexander    the judgment of my officers i share     napoleon    to recapitulate  nothing can greaten you   like this alliance  providence has flung   my good friend sultan selim from his throne   leaving me free in dealings with the porte   and i discern the hour as one to end   a rule that time no longer lets cohere   if i abstain its spoils will go to swell   the power of this same england our annoy   that country which enchains the trade of towns   with such bold reach as to monopolize   among the rest the whole of petersburgs   aythrough her purse friend as the lender there   shutting that purse she may incite towhat   muscovys fall its rulers murdering   her fleet at any minute can encoop   yours in the baltic in the black sea too   and keep you snug as minnows in a glass    hence we fastfellowed by our mutual foes   seaward the british germany by land   and having compassed for our common good   the turkish empires due partitioning   as comrades can conjunctly rule the world   to its own gain and our eternal fame     alexander stirred and flushed    i see vast prospects openedyet in truth   ere you sire broached these themes their outlines loomed   not seldom in my own imaginings   but with less clear a vision than endows   so great a captain statesman philosoph   as centre in yourself whom had i known   sooner by some few years months even weeks   i had been spared full many a fault of rule   now as to austria  should we call her in     napoleon    two in a bed i have slept but never three     alexander    haha  delightful  and then nextly spain     napoleon    i lighted on some letters at berlin   wherein king carlos offered to attack me   a bourbon minded thus so near as spain   is dangerous stuff  he must be seen to soon   a draft then of our treaty being penned   we will peruse it later  if king george   will not upon the terms there offered him   conclude a ready peace he can be forced   trumpet yourself as frances firm ally   and austria will fain to do the same   england left nude to such joint harassment   must shiverfall     alexander with naive enthusiasm         it is a great alliance     napoleon    would it were one in blood as well as brain   of family hopes and sweet domestic bliss     alexander    ahis it to my sister you refer     napoleon    the launching of a lineal progeny   has been much pressed upon me much of late   for reasons which i will not dwell on now   staid counsellors my brother joseph too   urge that i loose the empress by divorce   and rewive promptly for the countrys good   princesses even have been named for me   however this today is premature   and twixt ourselves alone    the queen of prussia must ere long be here   berthier escorts her  and the king too comes   shes one whom you admire     alexander reddening ingenuously              yes formerly   i haddid feel that some faint fascination   vaguely adorned her form  and to be plain   certain reports have been calumnious   and wronged an honest woman     napoleon              as i knew   but she is wearing thready why her years   must be full oneandthirty if shes one     alexander quickly    no sire  shes twentynine  if traits teach more   it means that cruel memory gnaws at her   as fair inciter to that fatal war   which broke her to the dust i do confess   since now we speak ont that this sacrifice   prussia is doomed to still disquiets me   unhappy king  when i recall the oaths   sworn him upon great fredericks sepulchre   andand my promises to his sad queen   it pricks me that his realm and revenues   should be stript down to the mere half they were     napoleon cooly    believe me tis but my regard for you   which lets me leave him that  far easier twere   to leave him none at all      he rises and goes to the window              but here they are   no its the queen alone with berthier   as i directed  then the king will follow     alexander    let me sire urge your courtesy to bestow   some gentle words on her     napoleon         ay ay i will      enter queen louisa of prussia on the arm of berthier  she     appears in majestic garments and with a smile on her lips so     that her still great beauty is impressive  but her eyes bear     traces of tears  she accepts napoleons attentions with the     stormily sad air of a wounded beauty  whilst she is being     received the king arrives  he is a plain shy honestfaced     awkward man with a wrecked and solitary look  his manner to     napoleon is nevertheless dignified and even stiff      the company move into the inner half of the room where the     tables are and the foldingdoors being shut they seat themselves     at dinner the queen taking a place between napoleon and alexander     napoleon    madame i love magnificent attire   but in the present instance can but note   that each bright knot and jewel less adorns   the brighter wearer than the wearer it     queen with a sigh    you praise one sire whom now the wanton world   has learnt to cease from praising  but such words   from such a quarter are of worth no less     napoleon    of worth as candour madame not as gauge   your reach in rarity outsoars my scope   yet do you know a troop of my hussars   that last october day nigh captured you     queen    nay  never a single frenchman did i see     napoleon    not less it was that you exposed yourself   and should have been protected  but at weimar   had you but sought me twould have bettered you     queen    i had no zeal to meet you sire alas     napoleon after a silence    and how at memel do you sport with time     queen    sport  ii pore on musty chronicles   and muse on usurpations long forgot   and other historied dramas of high wrong     napoleon    why con not annals of your own rich age   they treasure acts well fit for pondering     queen    i am reminded too much of my age   by having had to live in it  may heaven   defend me now and my wan ghost anon   from conning it again     napoleon              alas alas   too grievous this for one who is yet a queen     queen    no i have cause for vials more of grief   prussia was blind in blazoning her power   against the mage of earth   the embers of great fredericks deeds inflamed her   his glories swelled her to her ruining   too well has she been punished  emotion stops her     alexander in a low voice looking anxiously at her              say not so   you speak as all were lost  things are not thus   such desperation has unreason in it   and bleeds the hearts that crave to comfort you     napoleon to the king    i trust the treaty further pondered sire   has consolations     king curtly              i am a luckless man   and muster strength to bear my lucklessness   without vain hope of consolations now   one thing at least i trust i have shown you sire   that i provoked not this calamity   at anspach first my feud with you began   anspach my eden violated and shamed   by blushless tramplings of your legions there     napoleon    its rather late methinks to talk thus now     king with more choler    never too late for truth and plainspeaking     napoleon blandly    to your ally the tsar i must refer you   he was it and not i who tempted you   to push for war when eylau must have shown   your every profit to have lain in peace   he can indemn yes much or small and may     king with a headshake    i would make up would well make up my mind   to half my kingdoms loss could in such limb   but magdeburg not lie  dear magdeburg   place of my hearthold that i would retain     napoleon    our words take not such pattern as is wont   to grace occasions of festivity      he turns brusquely from the king  the banquet proceeds with a     more general conversation  when finished a toast is proposed     the freedom of the seas and drunk with enthusiasm     spirit sinister         another hit at england and her tubs        i hear harsh echoes from her chalky chines     spirit of the pities         o heed not england now  still read the queen        one grieves to see her spend her pretty spells        upon the man who has so injured her      they rise from table and the foldingdoors being opened they pass     into the adjoining room      here are now assembled murat talleyrand kourakin kalkreuth     berthier bessieres caulaincourt labanoff bennigsen and others     napoleon having spoken a few words here and there resumes his     conversation with queen louisa and parenthetically offers snuff     to the countess voss her ladyinwaiting  talleyrand who has     observed napoleons growing interest in the queen contrives to     get near him     talleyrand in a whisper    sire is it possible that you can bend   to let one womans fairness filch from you   all the resplendent fortune that attends   the grandest victory of your grand career      the queens quick eye observes and flashes at the whisper and     she obtains a word with the minister     queen sarcastically    i should infer dear monsieur talleyrand   only two persons in the world regret   my having come to tilsit     talleyrand              madame two   can anywho may such sad rascals be     queen    you and myself prince  gravely  yes myself and you      talleyrands face becomes impassive and he does not reply     soon the queen prepares to leave and napoleon rejoins her     napoleon taking a rose from a vase    dear queen do pray accept this little token   as souvenir of me before you go      he offers her the rose with his hand on his heart  she     hesitates but accepts it     queen impulsively with waiting tears    let magdeburg come with it sire  o yes     napoleon with sudden frigidity    it is for you to take what i can give   and i give thisno more15      she turns her head to hide her emotion and withdraws  napoleon     steps up to her and offers his arm  she takes it silently and     he perceives the tears on her cheeks  they cross towards the ante     room away from the other guests     napoleon softly    still weeping dearest lady  why is this     queen seizing his hand and pressing it    your speeches darn the tearings of your sword   between us two as man and woman now   ist even possible you question why   o why did not the greatest of the age   of future agesof the ages past   this one time win a womans worshipyea   for all her little life     napoleon gravely              know you my fair   that iay iin this deserve

napoleon returns to the room and joins talleyrand     napoleon aside to his minister    my god it was touchandgo that time talleyrand  she was within   an ace of getting over me  as she stepped into the carriage she   said in her pretty way o i have been cruelly deceived by you   and when she sank down inside not knowing i heard she burst into   sobs fit to move a statue  the devil take me if i hadnt a good   mind to stop the horses jump in give her a good kissing and   agree to all she wanted  haha well a miss is as good as a mile   had she come sooner with those sweet beseeching blue eyes

napoleons soldiery to the   number of about thirty thousand are discerned in a creeping   progress across the frontier from the french to the spanish side   the thin long columns serpentine along the roads but are sometimes   broken while at others they disappear altogether behind vertical   rocks and overhanging woods  the heavy guns and the whiteybrown   tilts of the baggagewaggons seem the largest objects in the   procession which are dragged laboriously up the incline to the   watershed their lumbering being audible as high as the clouds    simultaneously the river bidassoa in a valley to the west is   being crossed by a train of artillery and another thirty thousand   men all forming part of  the same systematic advance    along the great highway through biscay the wondering native   carters draw their sheepskinned oxteams aside to let the   regiments pass and stray groups of peaceable fieldworkers   in navarre look inquiringly at the marching and prancing   progress    time

richly furnished with paintings     vases mirrors silk hangings gilded lounges and several lutes     of rare workmanship  the hour is midnight the room being lit     by screened candelabra  in the centre at the back of the scene     is a large window heavily curtained      godoy and the queen maria luisa are dallying on a sofa  the     prince of peace is a fine handsome man in middle life with     curled hair and a mien of easy goodnature  the queen is older     but looks younger in the dim light from the lavish use of     beautifying arts  she has pronounced features dark eyes low     brows black hair bound by a jewelled bandeau and brought forward     in curls over her forehead and temples long heavy earrings an     open bodice and sleeves puffed at the shoulders  a cloak and     other

cautiously  the queen follows him     with a scared look     queen         a riot can it be     godoy    let me put these out ere they notice them   they think me at the royal palace yonder      he hastily extinguishes the candles except one taper which     he places in a recess so that the room is in shade  he then     draws back the curtains and she joins him at the window where     enclosing her with his arm he and she look out together      in front of the house a guard of hussars is stationed beyond     them spreading the plaza or square  on the other side rises in     the lamplight the white front of the royal palace  on the flank     of the palace is a wall enclosing gardens bowered alleys and     orange groves and in the wall a small door      a mixed multitude of soldiery and populace fills the space in     front of the kings palace and they shout and address each other     vehemently  during a lull in their vociferations is heard the     peaceful purl of the tagus over a cascade in the palace grounds     queen    lingering weve risked too long our chance of flight   the paris terror will repeat it here   not for myself i fear  no no for thee  she clings to him   if they should hurt you it would murder me   by heartbleedings and stabs intolerable     godoy kissing her    the first thought now is how to get you back   within the palace walls  why would you risk   to come here on a night so critical     queen passionately    i could not help itnay i would not help   rather than starve my soul i venture all   our last lovenightlast maybe of long years   why do

window  the mob is some way off the     immediate front being for the moment nearly free of loiterers and     the three muffled figures are visible crossing without hindrance     towards the door in the wall of the palace gardens  the instant     they reach it a sentinel springs up challenging them     godoy    ahnow they are doomed  my god why did she come      a parley takes place  something apparently a bribe is handed     to the sentinel and the three are allowed to slip in the queen     having obviously been unrecognized  he breathes his relief    now for the others  thenah then heaven knows      he sounds a bell and a servant enters    where is the countess of castillofiel     servant    shes looking for you prince     godoy              find her at once   ahhere she isthats wellgo

minutes godoy having taken her     down reenters and again looks out  josefas coach is moving     off with a small escort of godoys guards of honour  a sudden     yelling begins and the crowd rushes up and stops the vehicle     an altercation ensues     crowd    uncle peter it is the favourite carrying off prince fernando   stop him     josefa putting her head out of the coach    silence their

remained before the royal palace attracts the     attention of the multitude which surges back thither     crowd nearing the palace    call out the king and the prince  long live the king  he shall not   go  hola  he is gone  let us see him  he shall abandon godoy      the clamour before the royal palace still increasing a figure     emerges upon a balcony whom godoy recognizes by the lamplight     to be fernando prince of asturias  he can be seen waving his     hand  the mob grows suddenly silent     fernando in a shaken voice    citizens the king my father is in the palace with the queen

crowd    huzza  long life to the king and death to godoy      king carlos disappears from the balcony and the populace     still increasing in numbers look towards godoys mansion as     if deliberating how to attack it  godoy retreats from the     window into the room and gazing round him starts  a pale     worn but placid lady in a sombre though elegant robe stands     here in the gloom  she is thereza of bourbon the princess of     peace     princess    it is only your unhappy wife manuel  she will not hurt you     godoy shrugging his shoulders    nor with they hurt you  why

infatuated queen and   manuel godoy     duchess of rutland    then godoy escaped from aranjuez     materosa    yes by hiding in the garret  then they all threw themselves   upon napoleons protection  in his presence the queen swore   that the king was not fernandos father  altogether they form   a queer little menagerie  what will happen to them nobody knows     prince of wales    and do you wish us to send an army at once     materosa    what we most want sir are arms and ammunition  but we leave the   english ministry to cooperate in its own wise way anyhow so as   to sustain us in resenting

and many a time  ahthere is more   i know i know     napoleon kicking away a stool              there is of course that worm   time ever keeps in hand for gnawing me   the question of my dynastywhich bites   closer and closer as the years wheel on     josephine    of course its that  for nothing else could hang   my lord on tenterhooks through nights and days   or rather not the question but the tongues   that keep the question stirring  nought recked you   of thronesuccession or dynastic lines   when gloriously engaged in italy   i was your fairy then they labelled me   your lady of

sunday morning     strikes a blue army of fourteen thousand men in isolated columns     and red army of eighteen thousand in line formation drawn up in     order of battle  the blue army is a french one under junot the     other an english one under sir arthur wellesleyportion of that     recently landed      the august sun glares on the shaven faces white gaiters and     white crossbelts of the english who are to fight for their     lives while sweating under a quarterhundredweight in knapsack     and pouches and with firelocks heavy as putlogs  they occupy     a group of heights but their position is one of great danger     the land abruptly terminating two miles behind their backs in     lofty cliffs overhanging the atlantic  the french occupy the     valleys in the english front and this distinction between the     two forces strikes the eyethe red army is accompanied by scarce     any cavalry while the blue is strong in that area     dumb show    the battle is begun with alternate moves that match each other like   those of a chess opening  junot makes an oblique attack by moving   a division to his right wellesley moves several brigades to his   left to balance it    a column of six thousand french then climbs the hill against the   english centre and drives in those who are planted there  the   english artillery checks its adversaries and the infantry recover   and charge the baffled french down the slopes  meanwhile the   latters cavalry and artillery are attacking the village itself   and rushing on a few squadrons of english dragoons stationed there   cut them to pieces  a dust is raised by this ado and moans of men   and shrieks of horses are heard  close by the carnage the little   maceira stream continues to trickle unconcernedly to the sea    on the english left five thousand french infantry having ascended   to the ridge and maintained a stinging musketfire as sharply   returned are driven down by the bayonets of six english regiments   thereafter a brigade of the french the northernmost finding that   the others have pursued to the bottom and are resting after the   effort surprise them and bayonet them back to their original summit   the seesaw is continued by the recovery of the english who again   drive their assailants down    the french army pauses stultified till the columns uniting they   fall back toward the opposite hills  the english seeing that their   chance has come are about to pursue and settle the fortunes of the   day  but a messenger dispatched from a distant group is marked   riding up to the largenosed man with a telescope and an indian   sword who his staff around him has been directing the english   movements  he seems astonished at the message appears to resent   it and pauses with a gloomy look  but he sends countermands to his   generals and the pursuit ends abortively    the french retreat without further molestation by a circuitous march   into the great road to torres vedras by which they came leaving   nearly two thousand dead and wounded on the slopes they have quitted    dumb show ends and the curtain draws     act third    scene i    spain  a road near astorga      the eye of the spectator rakes the road from the interior of a     cellar which opens upon it and forms the basement of a deserted     house the roof doors and shutters of which have been pulled down     and burnt for bivouac fires  the season is the beginning of     january and the country is covered with a sticky snow  the road     itself is intermittently encumbered with heavy traffic the surface     being churned to a yellow mud that lies half kneedeep and at the     numerous holes in the track forming still deeper quagmires      in the gloom of the cellar are heaps of damp straw in which     ragged figures are lying halfburied many of the men in the     uniform of english regiments and the women and children in clouts     of all descriptions some being nearly naked  at the back of the     cellar is revealed through a burst door an inner vault where     are discernible some woodenhooped winecasks in one sticks a     gimlet and the broachingcork of another has been driven in     the wine runs into pitchers washingbasins shards chamber     vessels and other extemporized receptacles  most of the inmates     are drunk some to insensibility      so far as the characters are doing anything they are contemplating     almost incessant traffic outside passing in one direction  it     includes a medley of stragglers from the marquis of romanas     spanish forces and the retreating english army under sir john     mooreto which the concealed deserters belong     first deserter    now hes one of the eightyfirst and id gladly let that poor blade   know that weve all that man can wish for heregood wine and buxom   women  but if i do we shant have room for ourselveshey      he signifies a man limping past with neither firelock nor     knapsack  where the discarded knapsack has rubbed for weeks     against his shoulderblades the jacket and shirt are fretted     away leaving his skin exposed     second deserter    he may be the eightyfirsht or th eightysecond but what i say is   without fear of contradiction i wish to the lord i was back in old   bristol again  id sooner have a nipperkin of our own real bristol   milk than a mashtub full of this barbarian wine     third deserter    tis like thee to be ungrateful after putting away such a skinful   ont  i am as much bristol as thee but would as soon be here as   there  there aint near such willing women that are strict   respectable too there as hereabout and no open cellars as   theres many a slip in this country ill have the rest of my   allowance now      he crawls on his elbows to one of the barrels and turning on his     back lets the wine run down his throat     forth deserter to a fifth who is snoring    dont treat us to such a snoaching there mate  heres some more   coming and theyll sight us if we dont mind      enter without a straggling flock of military objects some with     fragments of shoes on others barefooted many of the latters     feet bleeding  the arms and waists of some are clutched by women     as tattered and barefooted as themselves  they pass on      the retreat continues  more of romanas spanish limp along in     disorder then enters a miscellaneous group of english cavalry     soldiers some on foot some mounted the rearmost of the latter     bestriding a shoeless foundered creature whose neck is vertebrae     and mane only  while passing it falls from exhaustion the trooper     extricates himself and pistols the animal through the head  he     and the rest pass on     first deserter a new plashing of feet being heard    heres something more in order or i am much mistaken he cranes   out yes a sergeant of the fortythird and whats left of their   second battalion  and by god not far behind i see shining helmets   tis a whole squadron of french dragoons      enter the sergeant  he has a racking cough but endeavours by     stiffening himself up to hide how it is wasting away his life     he halts and looks back till the remains of the fortythird are     abreast to the number of some three hundred about half of whom     are crippled invalids the other half being presentable and armed     soldiery     sergeant    now show yer nerve and be men  if you

the woman is found to be dead  if i didnt think   that her poor knees felt cold and only an hour ago i swore   to marry her      they remain silent  the retreat continues in the snow without     now in the form of a file of oxcarts followed by a mixed rabble     of english and spanish and mules and muleteers hired by english     officers to carry their baggage  the muleteers looking about     and seeing that the french dragoons gave been there cut the bands     which hold on the heavy packs and scamper off with their mules     a voice behind    the commanderinchief is determined to maintain discipline and   they must suffer  no more pillaging here  it is the worst case   of brutality and plunder that we have had in this wretched time      enter an english captain of hussars a lieutenant a guard of     about a dozen and three men as prisoner     captain    if they choose to draw lots only one need be made an example of   but they must be quick about it  the advanceguard of the enemy   is not far behind      the three prisoners appear to draw lots and the one on whom the     lot falls is blindfolded  exeunt the hussars behind a wall with     carbines  a volley is heard and something falls  the wretched     in the cellar shudder     fourth deserter    tis the same for us but for this heap of straw  ahmy doxy is the   only one of us who is safe and sound  he kisses the dead woman

roadside and some muddy snow scraped over     them  exeunt waggons and sergeant      an interval  more english troops pass on horses mostly shoeless     and foundered      enter sir john moore and officers  moore appears on the pale     evening light as a handsome man far on in the forties the     orbits of his dark eyes showing marks of deep anxiety  he is     talking to some of his staff with vehement emphasis and gesture     they cross the scene and go on out of sight and the squashing     of their horses hoofs in the snowy mud dies away     fifth deserter incoherently in his sleep

singing one of the officers looks around and detaching a patrol     enters the ruined house with the file of men the body of soldiers     marching on  the inmates of the cellar bury themselves in the     straw  the officer peers about and seeing no one prods the straw     with his sword     voices under the straw    oh hell  stop it  well come out  mercy  quarter      the lurkers are uncovered

if thou wilt  but others find        poesy ever lurk where pitpats poor mankind      the scene is cloaked in darkness      scene ii    the same      it is nearly midnight  the fugitives who remain in the cellar     having slept off the effects of the wine are awakened by a new     tramping of cavalry which becomes more and more persistent  it     is the french who now fill the road  the advanceguard having     passed by delabordes division lorges division merles     division and others successively cross the gloom      presently come the outlines of the imperial guard and then with     a start those in hiding realize their situation and are wide     awake  napoleon enters with his staff  he has just been overtaken     by a courier and orders those round him to halt     napoleon    let there a fire be lit ay here and now   the lines within these letters brook no pause   in mastering their purport      some of the french approach the ruined house and appropriating     what wood is still left there heap it by the roadside and set it     alight  a mixed rain and snow falls and the sputtering flames     throw a glare all round     second deserter under his voice    we be shot corpses  ay faith we be  why didnt i stick to   england and true doxology and leave foreign doxies and their   wine alone mate can ye squeeze another shardful from the   cask there for i feel my time

now     first deserter    you lie low with your picking off or he may pick off you  thank   god the babies are gone  maybe we shant be noticed if weve but   the courage to do nothing and keep hid      napoleon dismounts approaches the fire and looks around     napoleon    another of their dead horses here i see     officer    yes sire  we have counted eighteen hundred odd   from benavente hither pistoled thus   some wed to finish for them headlong haste   spared them no time for mercy to their brutes   onehalf their cavalry now tramps afoot     napoleon    and whats the tale of waggons weve picked up     officer    spanish and all abandoned some four hundred   of magazines and firelocks full ten load   and stragglers and their girls a numerous crew     napoleon    ay devilplenty those  licentious ones   these english as all canting peoples are   and prisoners     officer              seven hundred english sire   spaniards five thousand more     napoleon              tis not amiss   to keep the new year up they run away   he soliloquizes as he begins tearing open the dispatches   nor pitt nor fox displayed such blundering   as glares in this campaign  it is indeed   enlarging folly to foolhardiness   to combat france by land  but how expect   aught that can claim the name of government   from canning castlereagh and perceval   caballers allpoor sorry politicians   to whom has fallen the luck of reaping in   the harvestings of pitts bold husbandry      he unfolds a dispatch and looks for something to sit on  a cloak     is thrown over a log and he settles to reading by the firelight     the others stand round  the light crossed by the snowflakes     flickers on his unhealthy face and stoutening figure  he sinks     into the rigidity of profound thought till his features lour    so this is their reply  they have done with me   britain declines negotiating further   flouts france and russia indiscriminately   since one dethrones and keeps as prisoners   the most legitimate kingsthat means myself   the other suffers their unworthy treatment   for sordid intereststhats for alexander   and what is georgy made to say besides   pacific overtures to us are wiles   woven to unnerve the generous nations round   lately escaped the galling yoke of france   or waiting so to do  such then being seen   these tentatives must be regarded now   as finally forgone and crimson war   be faced to its fell worst unflinchingly   the devil take their lecture  what am i   that england should return such insolence      he jumps up furious and walks to and fro beside the fire     by and by cooling he sits down again    now as to hostile signs in austria   he breaks another seal and reads   ahswords to cross with her some day in spring   thinking me cornered over here in spain   she speaks without disguise the covert pact   twixt her and england owning now quite frankly   careless how works its knowledge upon me   she england germany welli can front them   that there is no sufficient force of french   between the elbe and rhine to prostrate her   let new and terrible experience   soon disillude her of  yea she may arm   the opportunity she late let slip   will not subserve her now     spirit of the pities         has he no hearthints that this austrian court        whereon his mood takes mould so masterful        is rearing naively in its nurseryroom        a future wife for him     spirit of the years              thou dost but guess it   and how should his heart know     napoleon opening and reading another dispatch              now eastward  ohe   the orient likewise looms full somberly   the turk declines pacifically to yield   what i have promised alexander  ah   as for constantinople being his prize   ill see him frozen first  his flights too high   and showing that i think so makes him cool  rises   is soult the duke dalmatia yet at hand     officer    he has arrived along the leon road   just now your majesty and only waits   the close of your perusals      enter soult who is greeted by napoleon     first deserter    good lord deliver us from all great men and take me back again to   humble life  thats marshal soult the duke of dalmatia     second deserter    the duke of damnation for our poor rear by the look ont     first deserter    yeshell make em rub their poor rears before he has done with   em  but we must overtake em tomorrow by a crosscut please god     napoleon pointing to the dispatches    heres matter enough for me duke and to spare   the ominous contents are like the threats   the ancient prophets dealt rebellious judah   austria we soon shall have upon our hands   and england still is fierce for fighting on   strange humour in a concordloving land   so now i must to paris straight away   at least to valladolid so as to stand   more apt for couriers than i do out here   in this far western corner and to mark   the veerings of these new developments   and blow a counterbreeze    then too theres lannes still sweating at the siege   of sullen zaragoza as twere hell   him i must further counsel how to close   his twice too tedious batteryyou then soult   ney is not yet i gather quite come up     soult    hes near sire on the benavente road   but some hours to the rear i reckon still     napoleon pointing to the dispatches    him ill direct to come to your support   in this pursuit and harassment of moore   wherein you take my place  youll follow up   and chase the flying english to the sea   bear hard on them the bayonet at their loins   with merles and mermets corps just gone ahead   and delabordes and heudelets here at hand   while lorges and lahoussayes picked dragoons   will follow and franceschis cavalry   to ney i am writing in case of need   he will support with marchand and mathieu   your total thus of seventy thousand odd   ten thousand horse and cannon to five score   should near annihilate this british force   and carve a triumph large in history   he bends over the fire and makes some notes rapidly   i move into astorga then turn back   though only in my person do i turn   and leave to you the destinies of spain     spirit of the years         more turning may be here than he design        in this small sudden swift turn backward he        suggests one turning from his apogee      the characters disperse the fire sinks and snowflakes and     darkness blot out all      scene iii    before coruna      the town harbour and hills at the back are viewed from an     aerial point to the north over the lighthouse known as the     tower of hercules rising at the extremity of the tongue of     land on which la coruna stands the open ocean being in the     spectators rear      in the foreground the most prominent feature is the walled old     town with its white towers and houses shaping itself aloft     over the harbour  the new town and its painted fronts show     bright below even on this cloudy winter afternoon  further     off behind the harbournow crowded with british transports     of all sizesis a series of low broken hills intersected by     hedges and stone walls      a mile behind these low inner hills is beheld a rocky chain of     outer and loftier heights that completely command the former     nothing behind them is seen but grey sky     dumb show    on the inner hills aforesaid the little english armya pathetic   fourteen thousand of foot onlyis just deploying into line hopes   division is on the left bairds to the right  paget with the   reserve is in the hollow to the left behind them and frasers   division still further back shapes out on a slight rise to the right    this harassed force now appears as if composed of quite other than   the men observed in the retreat insubordinately straggling along   like vagabonds  yet they are the same men suddenly stiffened and   grown amenable to discipline by the satisfaction of standing to the   enemy at last  they resemble a double palisade of red stakes the   only gaps being those that the melancholy necessity of scant numbers   entails here and there    over the heads of these red men is beheld on the outer hills the   twenty thousand french that have been pushed along the road at the   heels of the english by soult  they have an ominous superiority   both in position and in their abundance of cavalry and artillery   over the slender lines of english foot  the left of this background   facing hope is made up of delabordes and merles divisions while   in a deadly arc round baird from whom they are divided only by the   village of elvina are placed mermets division lahoussayes and   lorges dragoons franceschis cavalry and highest up of all a   formidable battery of eleven great guns that rake the whole british   line    it is now getting on for two oclock and a stir of activity has   lately been noticed along the french front  three columns are   discerned descending from their position the first towards the   division of sir david baird the weakest point in the english line   the next towards the centre the third towards the left  a heavy   cannonade from the battery supports this advance    the clash ensues the english being swept down in swathes by the   enemys artillery  the opponents meet face to face at the village   in the valley between them and the fight there grows furious    sir john moore is seen galloping to the front under the gloomy sky     spirit of the pities         i seem to vision in san carlos garden        that rises salient in the upper town        his name and date and doing set within        a filmy outline like a monument        which yet is but the insubstantial air     spirit of the years         read visions as conjectures not as more     when moore arrives at the front fraser and paget move to the right   where the english are most sorely pressed  a grapeshot strikes   off bairds arm  there is a little confusion and he is borne to   the rear while major napier disappears a prisoner    intelligence of these misfortunes is brought to sir john moore   he goes further forward and precedes in person the fortysecond   regiment and a battalion of the guards who with fixed bayonets   bear the enemy back moores gestures in cheering them being   notably energetic  pursuers pursued and sir john himself pass   out of sight behind the hill  dumb show ends      the point of vision descends to the immediate rear of the     english position  the early january evening has begun to spread     its shades and shouts of dismay are heard from behind the hill     over which moore and the advancing lines have vanished      straggling soldiers cross in the gloom     first straggler    hes struck by a cannonball that i know but hes not killed   that i pray god amighty     second straggler    better he were  his shoulder is knocked to a bag of splinters   as sir david was wownded sir john was anxious that the right   should not give way and went forward to keep it firm     first straggler    he didnt keep you firm howsomever     second straggler    nor you for that matter     first straggler    well twas a serious place for a man with no priminghorn and   a character to lose so i judged it best to fall to the rear by   lying down  a man cant fight by the regulations without his   priminghorn and i am none of your slovenly anyhow fighters     second straggler    nation having dropped my flitpouch i was the same  if youd   had your priminghorn and i my flints mind ye we should have   been there now  then fortywhory that we are not is the fault   o

that was his strict testament     first straggler    remember egypt  ay and i do for i was there upon my   salvation heres for back again whether or no     second straggler    but here  fortysecond remember egypt he said in the very   eye of that french battery playing through us  and the next omen   was that he was struck off his horse and fell on his back to the   ground  i remembered egypt and what had just happened too so   thorough well that i remembered the way over this wallcaptain   hardinge who was close to him jumped off his horse and he and   one in the ranks lifted him and are now bringing him along     first straggler    nevertheless heres for back again come what will  remember   egypt  hurrah      exit first straggler  second straggler ponders then suddenly     follows

bind the wound with it     moore smiles and shakes his head    theres not much checking it  then rents too gross   a dozen lives could pass that thoroughfare      enter a soldier with a blanket  they lift moore into it  during     the operation the pommel of his sword which he still wears is     accidentally thrust into the wound    ill loose the swordit bruises you sir john      he begins to unbuckle it     moore    no  let it be  one hurt more matters not   i wish it to go off the field with me     hardinge    i like the sound of that  it augurs well   for your muchhoped recovery     moore looking sadly at his wound              hardinge no   nature is nonplussed there  my shoulders gone   and this left side laid open to my lungs   theres but a brief breath now for me at most

owe much to good luck nor was it then   good fortune has been mine but bitterly mostly so   by the exhaustion of all shapes of bad   well this does not become a dying man   and others have been chastened more than i   by him who holds us in his hollowed hand    i grieve for zaragoza if as said   the siege goes sorely with her which it must   i heard when at dahagun that late day   that she

i    a road out of vienna      it is morning in early may  rain descends in torrents accompanied     by peals of thunder  the tepid downpour has caused the trees to     assume as by magic a clothing of limp green leafage and has turned     the ruts of the uneven highway into little canals      a drenched travellingchariot is passing with a meagre escort     in the interior are seated four women the archduchess maria     louisa in age about eighteen her stepmother the empress of     austria third wife of francis only four years older than the     archduchess and two ladies of the austrian court  behind come     attendant carriages bearing servants and luggage      the inmates remain for the most part silent and appear to be in a     gloomy frame of mind  from time to time they glance at the moist     spring scenes which pass without in a perspective distorted by the     raindrops that slide down the panes and by the blurring effect     of the travellers breathings  of the four the one who keeps in     the best spirits is the archduchess a fair blueeyed full     figured roundlipped maiden     maria louisa    whether the rain comes in or not i must open the window  please   allow me  she straightway opens it     empress groaning    yesopen or shut iti dont care  i am too ill to care for   anything  the carriage jolts into a hole  o woe  to think that   i am driven away from my husbands home in such a miserable   conveyance along such a road and in such weather as this  peal   of thunder  there are his guns     maria louisa    no my dear one  it cannot be his guns  they told us when we   started that he was only halfway from ratisbon hither so that he   must be nearly a hundred miles off as yet and a large army cannot   move fast     empress    he should never have been let come nearer than ratisbon  the victory   at echmuhl was fatal for us  o echmuhl echmuhl  i believe he will   overtake us before we get to buda     first ladyinwaiting    if so your majesty shall we be claimed as prisoners and marched   to paris     empress    undoubtedly  but i shouldnt much care  it would not be worse than   this i feel sodden all through me and frowzy and broken   she closes her eyes as if to doze     maria louisa    it is dreadful to see her suffer so  shutting the window  if   the roads were not so bad i should not mind  i almost wish we had   stayed though when he arrives the cannonade will be terrible     first ladyinwaiting    i wonder if he will get into vienna  will his men knock down all   the houses madam     maria louisa    if he do get in i am sure his triumph will not be for long  my   uncle the archduke charles is at his heels  i have been told many   important prophecies about bonapartes end which is fast nearing   it is asserted  it is he they say who is referred to in the   apocalypse  he is doomed to die this year at cologne in an inn   called the red crab  i dont attach too much importance to all   these predictions but o how glad i should be to see them come true     second ladyinwaiting    so should we all madam  what would become of his divorcescheme   then     maria louisa    perhaps there is nothing in that report  one can hardly believe   such gossip     second ladyinwaiting    but they say your imperial highness that he certainly has decided   to sacrifice the empress josephine and that at the meeting last   october with the emperor alexander at erfurt it was even settled   that he should marry as his second wife the grandduchess anne     maria louisa    i am sure that the empress her mother will never allow one of the   house of romanoff to marry with a bourgeois corsican  i wouldnt   if i were she     first ladyinwaiting    perhaps your highness they are not so particular in russia where   they are rather new themselves as we in austria with your ancient   dynasty are in such matters     maria louisa    perhaps not  though the empressmother is a pompous old thing as   i have been told by prince schwarzenberg who was negotiating there   last winter  my father says it would be a dreadful misfortune for   our country if they were to marry  though if we are to be exiled   i dont see how anything of that sort can matter much i hope   my father is safe      an officer of the escort rides up to the carriage window which     is opened     empress unclosing her eyes    any more misfortunes     officer    a rumour is awind your majesty   that the french host the emperor in its midst   lannes massena and bessieres in its van   advancing hither along the ratisbon road   has seized the castle and town of ebersberg   and burnt all down with frightful massacre   vast heaps of dead and wounded being consumed   so that the streets stink strong with frizzled flesh   the enemy ere this has crossed the traun   hurling brave hillers army back on us   and marches on amstettenthirty miles   less distant from vienna from before     empress    the lord show mercy to us  but o why   did not the archdukes intercept the foe     officer    his highness archduke charles your majesty   after his sore repulse bohemiawards   could not proceed with strength and speed enough   to close in junction with the archduke john   and archduke louis as was their intent   so marshall lannes swings swiftly on vienna   with oudinots and demonts might of foot   then massena and all his mounted men   and then napoleon guards cuirassiers   and the main body of the imperial force     empress    alas for poor vienna     officer              even so   your majesty has fled it none too soon      the window is shut and the procession disappears behind the     sheets of rain      scene ii    the island of lobau with wagram beyond      the northern horizon at the back of the birdseye prospect is     the high ground stretching from the bisamberg on the left to the     plateau of wagram on the right  in front of these elevations     spreads the wide plain of the marchfeld open treeless and with     scarcely a house upon it16      in the foreground the danube crosses the scene with a graceful     slowness looping itself round the numerous wooded islands therein     the largest of these immediately under the eye is the lobau     which stands like a knot in the gnarled grain represented by the     running river      on this island can be discerned closely packed an enormous dark     multitude of foot horse and artillery in french uniforms the     numbers reaching to a hundred and seventy thousand      lifting our eyes to discover what may be opposed to them we     perceive on the wagram plateau aforesaid and right and left in     front of it extended lines of austrians whitish and glittering     to the number of a hundred and forty thousand      the july afternoon turns to evening the evening to twilight     a species of simmer which pervades the living spectacle raises     expectation till the very air itself seems strained with suspense     a huge event of some kind is awaiting birth     dumb show    the first change under the cloak of night is that the tightly packed   regiments on the island are got under arms  the soldiery are like   a thicket of reeds in which every reed should be a man    a large bridge connects the island with the further shore as well   as some smaller bridges  opposite are high redoubts and ravelins   that the austrians have constructed for opposing the passage across   which the french ostentatiously set themselves to attempt by the   large bridge amid heavy cannonading    but the movement is a feint though this is not perceived by the   austrians as yet  the real movement is on the right hand of the   foreground behind a spur of the isle and out of sight of the   enemy where several large rafts and flat boats each capable of   carrying three hundred men are floated out from a screened creek    chosen battalions enter upon these which immediately begin to cross   with their burden  simultaneously from other screened nooks   secretly prepared floating bridges in sections are moved forth   joined together and defended by those who crossed on the rafts    at two oclock in the morning the thousands of cooped soldiers begin   to cross the bridges producing a scene which on such a scale was   never before witnessed in the history of war  a great discharge   from the batteries accompanies this manoeuvre arousing the austrians   to a like cannonade    the night has been obscure for summertime and there is no moon   the storm now breaks in a tempestuous downpour with lightning and   thunder  the tumult of nature mingles so fantastically with the   tumult of projectiles that flaming bombs and forked flashes cut the   air in company and the noise from the mortars alternates with the   noise from the clouds    from bridge to bridge and back again a gloomyeyed figure stalks as   it has stalked the whole night long with the restlessness of a wild   animal  plastered with mud and dribbling with rainwater it bears   no resemblance to anything dignified or official  the figure is that   of napoleon urging his multitudes over    by daylight the great mass of the men is across the water  at   six the rain ceases the mist uncovers the face of the sun which   bristles on the helmets and bayonets of the french  a hum of   amazement rises from the austrian hosts who turn staring faces   southward and perceive what has happened and the columns of   their enemies standing to arms on the same side of the stream   with themselves and preparing to turn their left wing    napoleon rides along the front of his forces which now spread out   upon the plain and are ranged in order of battle    dumb show ends and the point of view changes      scene iii    the field of wagram      the battlefield is now viewed reversely from the windows of a     mansion at wolkersdorf to the rear of the austrian position     the aspect of the windows is nearly south and the prospect includes     the plain of the marchfeld with the isled danube and lobau in the     extreme distance  ten miles to the southwest rightwards the     faint summit of the tower of st stephens vienna appears  on     the middleleft stands the compact plateau of wagram so regularly     shaped as to seem as if constructed by art  on the extreme left     the july sun has lately risen      inside the room are discovered the emperor francis and some house     hold officers in attendance with the warminister and secretaries     at a table at the back  through open doors can be seen in an outer     apartment

and wheeling moves upon our left   and on our centreprojects unforeseen   till near accomplished     francis              but i am advised   by oral message that the archduke charles   since the sharp strife last night has mended too   his earlier dispositions and has sped   strong orders to the archduke john to bring   in swiftest marches all the force he holds   and fall with heavy impact on the french   from nigh their rear     officer              tis good sire such a swoop   will raise an obstacle to their retreat   and refuge in the fastness of the isle   and show this victorygorged adventurer   that striking with a river in his rear   is not the safest tactic to be played   against an austrian front equipt like ours      the emperor francis and others scrutinize through their glasses     the positions and movements of the austrian divisions which appear     on the plain as pale masses emitting flashes from arms and helmets     under the july rays and reaching from the tower of neusiedel on     the left past wagram into the village of stammersdorf on the     right  beyond their lines are spread out the darkerhued french     almost parallel to the austrians     francis    those moving masses toward the right i deem   the forces of klenau and kollowrath   sent to support prince john of lichtenstein   i his attack that way      an interval              now that theyve gained   the right there why is not the attack begun     officer    they are beginning on the left wing sire      the emperor resumes his glass and beholds bodies of men descending     from the hills by neusiedel and crossing the russbach river towards     the frencha movement which has been going on for some time     francis turning thither    where we are weakest  it surpasses me   to understand why was our centre thinned   to pillar up our right already strong   where nought is doing while our left assault   stands illsupported       time passes in silence              yes it is so  see   the enemy strikes rossenberg in flank   compelling him to fall behind the russbach      the emperor gets excited and his face perspires  at length he     cannot watch through his glass

the guns     officer    klenau and kollowrath are pounding on   to turn the enemys left with our strong right   is after all a plan that works out well   hiller and lichtenstein conjoin therein     francis    i hear from thence appalling cannonades     officer    tis their your majesty  now we shall see   if the french read that there the danger lies     francis    i only pray that bonaparte refrain   from spying danger there till all too late     officer involuntarily after a pause    ah heaven     francis turning sharply    well well  what changes figure now     officer    they pierce

fume broke through aderklaa   but bellegarde pricking along the plain behind   has charged and driven them back disorderly   the archduke charles bounds thither as i shape   in person to support him      the emperor returns to his spyglass and they and others watch in     silence sometimes the right of their front sometimes the centre     francis              it is so   that the right attack of

leave  josephine goes to pour out the coffee     but napoleon pushes her aside and pours it out himself looking at     her in a way which causes her to sink cowering into a chair like a     frightened animal     josephine    i see my doom my friend upon your face     napoleon    you see me bored by cambaceres ball     josephine    it means divorcea thing more terrible   than carrying elsewhere the

in    champagny i have something clear to say   now on our process after the divorce   the question of the russian duchess anne   was quite inept for further toying with   the years rush on and i grow

say you sire   i reckoned that but a scurrying dream     napoleon    well so it was  but such a pretty dream   that its own charm transfixed it to a notion   that showed itself in time a sanity   which hardened in its turn to a resolve   as firm as any built by mortal mind   the emperors consent must needs be won   but i foresee no difficulty there   the young archduchess is a bright blond

why have they dallied with my tentatives   in pompous silence since the erfurt day   and austria too affords a safer hope   the young archduchess is much less a child   than is the other who caulaincourt says   will be incapable of motherhood   for six months yet or morea grave delay     champagny    your majesty appears to have trimmed your sail   for austria and no more is to be said

say you by now on this strange offer     metternich    my views remain the same your majesty   the policy of peace that i have upheld   both while in paris and of late time here   points to this step as heralding sweet balm   and bandaged veins for our late crimsoned realm     francis    agreed  as monarch i perceive therein   a happy doorway for my purposings   it seems to guarantee the hapsburg crown   a quittance of distractions such as those   that leave their shade on many a backward year   there is forsooth a suddenness about it   and it would aid us had we clearly keyed   the cryptologues of which the world has heard   between napoleon and the russian court   begun there with the selfsame motiving     metternich    i would not sire one second ponder it   it was an obvious first crude castabout   in the important reckoning of means   for his great end a strong monarchic line   the more advanced the more it profits us   for sharper then the quashing of such views   and wreck of that conjunction in the aims   of france and russia marked so much of late   as jeopardizing quiet neighbours thrones     francis    if that be so on the domestic side   there seems no bar

the emperor   imperious and determined in his rule   is easynatured in domestic life   as my long time in paris amply proved   moreover the accessories of his glory   have been and will be admirably designed   to fire the fancy of a young princess     francis    thus far you satisfy me so to close   or not to close with him is now the thing     metternich    your majesty commands the issue quite

answer straight  what would that answer be     metternich    in state affairs sire as in private life   times will arise when even the faithfullest squire   finds him unfit to jog his chieftains choice   on whom responsibility must lastly rest   and such times are preeminently sire   those wherein thought alone is not enough   to serve the head as guide  as emperor   as father both to you to

birds   that haunt out there beneath the pediment   snugly defended from the northeast wind   have lately disappeared  i sought a trace   of scattered feathers which i dread to find     metternich    they are gone i ween the way of tender flesh   at the assaults of winter want and foes     maria louisa    it is too melancholy thinking that   dont say itbut i saw the emperor here   surely he beckoned me     metternich              sure he did   your gracious highness and he has left me here   to break vast news that will make good his call     maria louisa    then do  ill listen  news from near or far      she seats herself     metternich    from farthough of such distancedwarfing might   that far may read as near eventually   but dear archduchess with your kindly leave   ill speak straight out  the emperor of the french   has sent today to make through schwarzenberg   a formal offer of his heart and hand   his honours dignities imperial throne   to you whom he admires above all

grave verdict of your destiny   home title future sphere he bids you think   not of himself but of your own desire     maria louisa reflecting    my wish is what my duty bids me wish   where a wide empires welfare is in poise   that welfare must be pondered not my will   i ask of you then chancellor metternich   straightway to beg the emperor my father   that he fulfil his duty to the realm

sinister         perhaps earth shivered at the ladys say     shade of the earth       i own hereto  when france and austria wed      my echoes are mens groans my dews are red      so i have reason for a passing dread     metternich    right nobly phrased archduchess wisely too   i will acquaint your sire the emperor   with these your views  he waits them anxiously  going     maria louisa    let me go first  it much confuses me   to thinkbut i would fain let thinking be      she goes out trembling  enter francis by another door     metternich    i was about to seek your majesty   the good archduchess luminously holds   that in this weighty question you regard   the empire  best for it is best for her     francis moved    my daughters views thereon do not surprise me   she is too staunch to pit a private whim   against the fortunes of a commonwealth   during your speech with her i have taken thought   to shape decision sagely  an assent   would yield the empire many years of peace   and leave me scope to heal those still green sores   which linger from our late unhappy moils   therefore my daughter not being disinclined   i know no basis for a negative   send then a courier prompt to paris say   the offer made for the archduchess hand   i do acceptwith this defined reserve   that no condition treaty bond attach   to such alliance save the tie itself   there are some sacrifices whose grave rites   no bargain must contaminate  this is one   this personal gift of a beloved child     metternich leaving    ill see to it this hour your majesty   and cant the words

others are seen lolling in the background some of them snoring     first member    i learn from a private letter that it was carried out in the   emperors cabinet at the tuileriesjust off the throneroom where   they all assembled in the eveningboney and the wife of his bosom   in pure white muslin from head to foot they say the kings and   queens of holland whestphalia and naples the princess pauline   and one or two more the officials present being cambaceres the   chancellor and count regnaud  quite a small party  it was over   in minutesshort and sweet like a donkeys gallop     second member    anything but sweet for her  how did she stand it     first member    serenely i believe while the emperor was making his speech   renouncing her but when it came to her turn to say she renounced   him she began sobbing mightily and was so completely choked up that   she couldnt get out a word     second member    poor old dame  i pity her by god though she had a rattling good   spell while it lasted     first member    they say he was a bit upset too at sight of her tears  but i   dare vow that was put on  fancy boney caring a curse what a woman   feels  she had learnt her speech by heart but that did not help   her regnaud had to finish it for her the ditch that overturned   her being where she was made to say that she no longer preserved   any hope of having children and that she was pleased to show her   attachment by enabling him to obtain them by another woman  she   was led off fainting  a turning of the tables considering how   madly jealous she used to make

 that we must still go on supporting her winding up with a   brilliant peroration aboutwhat were the wordsthe fiery eyes   of the british soldieroh well it was all learnt beforehand   of course     second member    i wish i had gone down  but the wind soon blew the other way     third member    then gower rapped out his amendment  that was good too by god     second member    well the war must go on  and that being the general conviction   this censure and that censure are only so many blank cartridges     third member    blank  damn me were they  gowers was a palpable hit when he said   that parliament had placed unheardof resources in the hands of the   ministers last year to make this years results to the country   worse than if they had been afforded no resources at all  every   single enterprise of theirs had been a beggarly failure     second member    anybody could have said it come to that     third member    yes because it is so true  however when he began to lay on with   such rhetoric as the treasures of the nation lavished in wasteful   thoughtlessnessthousands of our troops sacrificed wantonly in   pestilential swamps of walcheren and gave the details we know so

begin     several members    hawhawhaw     third member    then he made another point  after enumerating our frightful   failuresspain walcheren and the resthe said  but ministers   have not failed in everything  no in one thing they have been   strikingly successful  they have been successful in their attack   upon copenhagenbecause it was directed against an ally  mighty   fine wasnt it     second member    how did castlereagh stomach that     third member    he replied then  donning his air of injured innocence he proved the   honesty of his intentionsno doubt truly enough  but when he came   to walcheren nothing could be done  the case was hopeless and he   knew it and foundered  however at the division when he saw what   a majority was going out on his side he was as frisky as a child   cannings speech was grave with bits of shiny ornament stuck on   like the brass nails on a coffin sheridan says      fifth and sixth members stagger in armandarm     fifth member    the vision

slopes of the wiener     wald with its beautiful forest scenery     dumb show    a procession of enormous length composed of eighty carriages   many of them drawn by six horses and one by eightand escorted   by detachments of cuirassiers yeomanry and other cavalry is   quickening its speed along the highway from the city    the sixhorse carriages contain a multitude of court officials   ladies of the court and other austrian nobility  the eighthorse   coach contains a rosy blueeyed girl of eighteen with full red   lips round figure and pale auburn hair  she is maria louisa and   her eyes are red from recent weeping  the countess de lazansky   grand mistress of the household in the carriage with her and the   other ladies of the palace behind have a pale proud yet resigned   look as if conscious that upon their sex had been laid the burden   of paying for the peace with france  they have been played out of   vienna with french marches and the trifling incident has helped on   their sadness    the observers vision being still bent on the train of vehicles and   cavalry the point of sight is withdrawn high into the air till the   huge procession on the brown road looks no more than a file of ants   crawling along a strip of gardenmatting  the spacious terrestrial   outlook now gained shows this to be the great road across europe from   vienna to munich and from munich westerly to france    the puny concatenation of specks being exclusively watched the   surface of the earth seems to move along in an opposite direction   and in infinite variety of hill dale woodland and champaign   bridges are crossed ascents are climbed plains are galloped over   and towns are reached among them saint polten where night falls    morning shines and the royal crawl is resumed and continued through   linz where the danube is reapproached and the girl looks pleased   to see her own dear donau still  presently the tower of brannau   appears where the animated dots pause for formalities this being   the frontier and maria louisa becomes marie louise and a frenchwoman   in the charge of french officials    after many breaks and halts during which heavy rains spread their

in its midst opposite to which stands an inn the highway     passing between them  rain is still falling heavily  not a soul     is visible anywhere      enter from the west a plain lonely carriage traveling in a     direction to meet the file of coaches that we have watched  it     stops near the inn and two men muffled in cloaks alight by the     door away from the hostel and towards the church as if they     wished to avoid observation  their faces are those of napoleon     and murat his brotherinlaw  crossing the road through the mud     and rain they stand in the church porch and watch the descending     drifts     napoleon stamping an impatient tattoo    one gets more chilly in a wet march than in a dry however cold the   devil if he dont  what time do you make it now  that clock doesnt   go     murat drily looking at his watch    yes it does and it is right  if clocks were to go as fast as your   wishes just now it would be awkward for the rest of the world     napoleon chuckling goodhumouredly    how we have dished the soissons folk with their pavilions and   purple and gold hangings for bride and bridegroom to meet in and   stately ceremonial to match and their thousands looking on  here   we are where theres nobody  ha ha     murat    but why should they be dished sire  the pavilions and ceremonies   were by your own orders     napoleon    well as the time got nearer i couldnt stand the idea of dawdling   about there     murat    the soissons people will be in a deuce of a taking at being made   such fools of     napoleon     so let em  ill make it up with them somehowshe cant be far   off now if we have timed her rightly  he peers out into the rain   and listens     murat    i dont quite see how you are going to manage when she does come   do we go before her toward soissons when you have greeted her here   or follow in her rear  or what do we do     napoleon    heavens i know no more than you  trust to the moment and see what   happens  a silence  harkhere she comes  good little girl up   to time      the distant squashing in the mud of a multitude of hoofs and     wheels is succeeded by the appearance of outriders and carriages     horses and horsemen splashed with sample clays of the districts     traversed  the vehicles slow down to the inn  napoleons face     fires up and followed by murat he rushes into the rain towards

palace of the empressmother      one of the private apartments is disclosed in which the empress     mother and alexander are seated     empressmother    so one of austrian blood his pomp selects   to be his bride and bulwarknot our own   thus are you coolly shelved     alexander              me mother dear   you faith if i may say it dutifully   had all been left to me some time ere now   he would have wedded kate     empressmother              how so my son   catharine was plighted and it could not be     alexander    rather you swiftly pledged and married her   to let napoleon have no chance that way   but anne remained     empressmother              how anneso young a girl   sane nature would have cried indecency   at such a troth     alexander              time would have tinkered that   and he was welldisposed to wait awhile   but the one test he had no temper for   was the apparent slight of unresponse   accorded his impatient overtures   by our suspensive poise of policy     empressmother    a backward answer is our countrys card   the special style and mode of muscovy   we have grown great upon it my dear son   and may such practice rule our centuries through   the necks of those who rate themselves our peers   are cured of stiffness by its potency     alexander    the principle in this case anyhow   is shattered by the facts since none can doubt   your policy was counted an affront   and drove my long ally to austrias arms   with what result to us must yet be seen     empressmother    may austria win much joy of the alliance   marrying napoleon is a midnight leap   for any court in europe credit me   if ever such there were  what he may carve   upon the coming years what murderous bolt   hurl at the rocking constitutions round   on what dark planet he may land himself   in his career through space no sage can say     alexander    wellpossibly and maybe all is best   that he engrafts his lineage not on us   but honestly napoleon none the less   has been my friend and i regret the dream   and fleeting fancy of a closer tie     empressmother    ay your regrets are sentimental ever   that hell be writ no soninlaw of mine   is no regret to me  but an affront   there is no less in his evasion ont   wherein the bourgeois quality of him   veraciously peeps out  i would be sworn   he set his minions parleying with the twain   yourself and francissimultaneously   else no betrothal could have speeded so     alexander    despite the hazard of offence to one     empressmother    more than the hazard the necessity     alexander    theres no offence to me     empressmother              there should be then   i am a romanoff by marriage merely   but i do feel a rare belittlement   and loud laconic browbeating herein     alexander    no mother no  i am the tsarnot you   and i am only piqued in moderateness   marriage with france was near my hearti own it   what then  it has been otherwise ordained      a silence     empressmother    here comes dear anne  speak not of it before her      enter the grandduchess a girl of sixteen     anne    alas the news is that poor prussias queen   spirited queen louisa once so fair   is slowly dying mother  did you know     alexander betraying emotion    ahsuch i dreaded from the earlier hints   poor soulher heart was slain some time ago     anne    what do you mean by that my brother dear     empressmother    he means my child that he as usual spends   much sentiment upon the foreign fair   and hence leaves little for his folk at home     alexander    i mean anne that her countrys overthrow   let death into her heart  the tilsit days   taught me to know her well and honour her   she was a lovely woman even then   strangely the present english prince of wales   was wished to husband her  had wishes won   they might have varied europes history     anne    napoleon i have heard admired her once   how he must grieve that soon shell be no more     empressmother    napoleon and your brother loved her both      alexander shows embarrassment    but whatsoever grief be alexanders   his will be none who feels but for himself     anne    o mother how can you mistake him so   he worships her who is to be his wife   the fair archduchess marie     empressmother              simple child   as yet he has never seen her or but barely   that is a tactic suit with love to match     alexander with vainly veiled tenderness    highsouled louisawhen shall i forget   those tilsit gatherings in the longsunned june   napoleons gallantries deceived her quite   who fondly felt her pleas for magdeburg   had won him to its cause the while alas   his cynic sense but posed in cruel play     empressmother    bitterly mourned she her civilities   when time unlocked the truth that she had choked   her indignation at his former slights   and slanderous sayings for a baseless hope   and wrought no tittle for her countrys gain   i marvel why you mourn a frustrate tie   with one whose wiles could wring a woman so     alexander uneasily    i marvel also when i think of it     empressmother    dont listen to us longer dearest anne      exit anne    you will uphold my judging by and by   that as a suitor we are quit of him   and that blind austria will rue the hour   wherein she plucks for him her fairest flower      the scene shuts      scene viii    paris  the grand gallery of the louvre and the saloncarre adjoining      the view is up the middle of the gallery which is now a spectacle     of much magnificence  backed by the large paintings on the walls     are double rows on each side of brightly dressed ladies the pick     of imperial society to the number of four thousand one thousand     in each row and behind these standing up are two rows on each side     of men of privilege and fashion  officers of the imperial guard     are dotted about as marshals      temporary barriers form a wide passage up the midst leading to the     saloncarre which is seen through the opening to be fitted up as     a chapel with a gorgeous altar tall candles and cross  in front     of the altar is a platform with a canopy over it  on the platform     are two gilt chairs and a priedieu      the expectant assembly does not continuously remain in the seats     but promenades and talks the voices at times rising to a din amid     the strains of the orchestra conducted by the emperors director     of music  refreshments in profusion are handed round and the     extemporized cathedral resolves itself into a gigantic cafe of     persons of distinction under the empire

she lost her head  now it will soon be here      suddenly the heralds enter the gallery at the end towards the     tuileries the spectators ranging themselves in their places     in a moment the wedding procession of the emperor and empress     becomes visible  the civil marriage having already been performed     napoleon and marie louise advance together along the vacant pathway     towards

if the shadow of a winter     night had fallen upon it  resentful and threatening he stops the     procession and looks up and down the benches     spirit sinister    this is sound artistry of the immanent will it relieves the monotony   of so much goodhumour     napoleon to the chapelmaster    where are the cardinals  and why not here  he speaks so loud that   he is heard throughout the gallery     abbe de pradt trembling    many are present here your majesty   but some are feebled by infirmities   too common to their age and cannot come     napoleon    tell me no nonsense  half absent themselves   because they will not come  the factious fools   well be it so  but they shall flinch for it      marie louise looks frightened  the procession moves on     spirit of the pities         i seem to see the thin and headless ghost        of the yet earlier austrian here too queen        walking beside the bride with frail attempts        to pluck her by the arm     spirit of the

entrance to the saloncarre amid strains of music     the emperor and empress are received and incensed by the cardinal     grand almoners  they take their seats under the canopy and the     train of notabilities seat themselves further back the persons     inwaiting stopping behind the imperial chairs      the ceremony of the religious marriage now begins  the choir     intones a hymn the emperor and empress go to the altar remove     their gloves and make their vows     spirit ironic    the english church should return thanks for this wedding seeing   how it will purge of coarseness the picturesheets of that artistic   nation which will hardly be able to caricature the new wife as it   did poor plebeian josephine  such starched and ironed monarchists   cannot sneer at a woman of such a divinely dry and crusted line like   the hapsburgs      mass is next celebrated after which the te deum is chanted in     harmonies that whirl round the walls of the saloncarre and quiver     down the long gallery  the procession then reforms and returns     amid the flutterings and applause of the dense assembly  but     napoleons face has not lost the sombre expression which settled     on it  the pair and their train pass out by the west door and     the congregation disperses in the other direction the cloud     curtain closing over the scene as they disappear     act sixth     scene i    the lines of torres vedras      a birdseye perspective is revealed of the peninsular tract of     portuguese territory lying between the shining pool of the tagus on     the east and the whitefrilled atlantic lifting rhythmically on     the west  as thus beheld the tract features itself somewhat like a     lategothic shield the upper edge from the dexter to the sinister     chief being the lines of torres vedras stretching across from the     mouth of the zezambre on the left to alhandra on the right and     the south or base point being fort s julian  the roofs of lisbon     appear at the sinister base and in a corresponding spot on the     opposite side cape roca      it is perceived in a moment that the northern verge of this nearly     coasthemmed region is the only one through which access can be     gained to it by land and a close scrutiny of the boundary there     reveals that means are being adopted to effectually prevent such     access      from east to west along it runs a chain of defences dotted at     intervals by dozens of circular and square redoubts either made     or in the making two of the latter being of enormous size     between these stretch unclimbable escarpments stone walls and     other breastworks and in front of all a double row of abatis     formed of the limbs of trees      within the outer line of defence is a second constructed on the     same shieldshaped tract of country and is not more than a twelfth     of the length of the others  it is a continuous entrenchment of     ditches and ramparts and its objectthat of covering

the northernmost frontage undercutting easy slopes into   steep ones digging ditches piling stones felling trees dragging   them and interlacing them along the front as required    on the second breastwork which is completed only a few figures move    on the third breastwork which is fully matured and equipped minute   red sentinels creep backwards and forwards noiselessly    as time passes three reddishgrey streams of marching men loom out   to the north advancing southward along three roads towards three   diverse points in the first defence  these form the english army   entering the

on the extreme right by alhandra under hill  beside   one of the roads two or three of the soldiers are dangling from a   tree by the neck probably for plundering    the dumb show ends and the point of view sinks to the earth      scene ii    the same  outside the lines      the winter day has gloomed to a stormful evening and the road     outside the first line of defence forms the foreground of

as this  i had pictured me   the lay much nearer lisbon  little strange   lord wellington rode placid at busaco   with this behind his back  well it is hard   but that we turn them somewhere i assume

no inkling of such barriers here   a good road runs along their front it seems   which offers us advantage what a night      the tempest cries dismally about the earthworks above them as     the

better  what do you think willis     willis    none  he is done for this time     halford    well we must soften it down a little so as not to upset the queen   too much poor woman and distract the

the revel      scene vii    the same  the interior of carlton house      a central hall is disclosed radiant with constellations of     candles lamps and lanterns and decorated with flowering shrubs     an opening on the left reveals the grand councilchamber prepared     for dancing the floor being chalked with arabesques having in the     centre g iii r with a crown arms and supporters  orange     trees and rosebushes in bloom stand against the walls  on the     right hand extends a glittering vista of the supperrooms and     tables now crowded with guests  this display reaches as far as     the conservatory westward and branches into long tents on the     lawn      on a dais at the chief table laid with gold and silver plate the     prince regent sits like a lay figure in a state chair of crimson     and gold with six servants at his back  he swelters in a gorgeous     uniform of scarlet and gold lace which represents him as field     marshal and he is surrounded by a hundredandforty of his     particular friends      down the middle of this statetable runs a purling brook crossed     by quaint bridges in which gold and silver fish frisk about     between banks of moss and flowers  the whole scene is lit with     wax candles in chandeliers and in countless candelabra on the     tables      the people at the upper tables include the duchess of york looking     tired from having just received as hostess most of the ladies     present except those who have come informally louis xviii of     france the duchess of angouleme all the english royal dukes     nearly all the ordinary dukes and duchesses also the lord     chancellor of the exchequer and other ministers the lord mayor     and lady mayoress all the more fashionable of the other peers     peeresses and members of parliament generals admirals and     mayors with their wives  the ladies of position wear almost to     the extent of a uniform a nodding headdress of ostrich feathers     with diamonds and gowns of white satin embroidered in gold or     silver on which owing to the heat dribbles of wax from the     chandeliers occasionally fall      the guards bands play and attendants rush about in blue and gold     lace     spirit of the pities         the queen the regents mother sits not here        wanting too are his sisters i perceive        and it is well  with the distempered king        immured at windsor sore distraught or dying        it borders nigh on indecency        in their regard that this loud feast is kept        a thought not strange to many as i read        even of those gathered here     spirit ironic    my dear phantom and crony the gloom upon their faces is due rather   to their having borrowed those diamonds at eleven per cent than to   their loyalty to a suffering monarch  but let us test the feeling   ill spread a report      he calls up the spirit of rumour who scatters whispers through     the assemblage     a guest to his neighbour    have you heard this reportthat the king is dead     another guest    it has just reached me from the other side  can it be true     third guest    i think it probable  he has been very ill all week     prince regent    dead  then my fete is spoilt by god     sheridan    long live the king  he holds up his glass and bows to the regent     marchioness of hertford the new favourite to the regent    the news is more natural than the moment of it  it is too cruel to   you that it should happen now     prince regent    damn me though can it be true  he provisionally throws a regal   air into his countenance     duchess of york on the regents left    i hardly can believe it  this forenoon   he was reported mending     duchess of angouleme on the regents right              on this side   they are asserting that the news is false   that buonapartes child the king of rome   is dead and not your royal father sire     prince regent    thats mighty fortunate  had it been true   i should have been abused by all the world   the queen the keenest of the chorus too   though i have been postponing this pledged feast   through days and weeks in hopes the king would mend   till expectation fusted with delay   but give a dog a bad nameor a prince   so then it is newcome king of rome   who has passed or ever the world has welcomed him   call him a kingthat pompous upstarts son   beside us scions of the ancient lines     duke of bedford    i think that rumour untrue also sir  i heard it as i drove up from   woburn this evening and it was contradicted then     prince regent    drove up this evening did ye duke  why did you cut it so close     duke of bedford    well it so happened that my sheepsheering dinner was fixed for   this very day and i couldnt put it off  so i dined with them   there at one oclock discussed the sheep rushed off drove the   twoandforty miles jumped into my clothes at my house here and   reached your royal highnesss door in no very bad time     prince regent    capital capital  but pon my soul twas a close shave      soon the babbling and glittering company rise from supper and     begin promenading through the rooms and tents the regent setting     the example and mixing up and talking unceremoniously with his     guests of every degree  he and the group round him disappear into     the remoter chambers but may concentrate in the grecian hall     which forms the foreground of the scene whence a glance can be     obtained into the ballroom now filled with dancers      the band is playing the tune of the season the regency hornpipe     which is danced as a countrydance by some thirty couples so that     by the time the top couple have danced down the figure they are     quite breathless  two young lords talk desultorily as they survey     the scene     first lord    are the rumours of the king of romes death confirmed     second lord    no  but they are probably true  he was a feeble brat from the   first  i believe they had to baptize him on the day he was born   what can one expect after such presumptioncalling him the new   messiah and god knows what all  ours is the only country which   did not write fulsome poems about him  wise english the tsar   alexander said drily when he heard it     first lord    ay  the affection between that pompey and caesar has begun to cool   alexanders soreness at having his sister thrown over so cavalierly   is not salved yet     second lord    there is much beside  id lay a guinea there will be war between   russia and france before another year has flown     first lord    prinny looks a little worried tonight     second lord    yes  the queen dont like the fete being held considering the   kings condition  she and her friends say it should have been put   off altogether  but the princess of wales is not troubled that way   though she was not asked herself she went wildly off and bought her   people new gowns to come in  poor maladroit woman      another new dance of the year is started and another long line     of couples begin to foot it    thats a pretty thing they are doing now  what dye call it     first lord    speed the plough  it is just out  they are having it everywhere   the next is to be one of those foreign things in threeeight time   they call waltzes  i question if anybody is up to dancing em here   yet      speed the plough is danced to its conclusion and the band     strikes up the copenhagen waltz     spirit ironic         now for the wives  they both were tearing hither        unless reflection sped them back again        but dignity that nothing else may bend        succumbs to womans curiosity        so deem them here  messengers call them nigh      the prince regent having gone the round of the other rooms now     appears at the ballroom door and stands looking at the dancers     suddenly he turns and gazes about with a ruffled face  he sees     a tall redfaced man near himlord moira one of his friends     prince regent    damned hot here moira  hottest of all for me     moira    yes it is warm sir  hence i do not dance     prince regent    hm  what i meant was of another order   i spoke figuratively

balustrade of the gallery     moira    two figures sir  whose are they     prince regent    she is one  the fitzherbert in tother  o i am almost sure it is   i would have welcomed her but she bridled and said she wouldnt sit   down at my table as a plain mrs to please anybody  as i had sworn   that on this occasion people should sit strictly according to their   rank i wouldnt give way  why the devil did she come like this   pon my soul these women will be the death o me     moira looking cautiously up the stairs    i can see nothing of her sir nor of the princess either  there is   a crowd of idlers up there leaning over the bannisters and you may   have mistaken some others for them     prince regent    o no  they have drawn back their heads  there have been such damned   mistakes made in sending out the cards that the biggest w in london   might be here  shes watching lady hertford thats what shes doing   for all their indifference both of them are as jealous as two cats   over the tom      somebody whispers that a lady has fainted upstairs    thats maria ill swear  shes always doing it whenever i hear   of some lady fainting about upon the furniture at my presence and   sending for a glass of water i say to myself theres maria at it   again by god     spirit ironic         now let him hear their voices once again      the regent starts as he seems to hear from the stairs the tongues     of the two ladies growing louder and nearer the princess pouring     reproaches into one ear and mrs fitzherbert into the other     prince regent     od seize em moira this will drive me mad   if men of blood must mate with only one   of those dear damned deluders called the sex   why has heaven teased us with the taste for change   god i begin to loathe the whole curst show   how hot it is  get me a glass of brandy   or i shall swoon off too  now lets go out   and find some fresher air upon the lawn      exit the prince regent with lords moira and yarmouth  the band     strikes up

blackness seems now to envelope the retreating     array on the other side of the stream  the storm bursts with     thunder and lightning the river turns leaden and the scene is     blotted out by the torrents of rain      scene ii    the ford of santa marta salamanca      we are in spain on a july night of the same summer the air being     hot and heavy  in the darkness the ripple of the river tormes can     be heard over the ford which is near the foreground of the scene      against the gloomy north sky to the left lightnings flash     revealing rugged heights in that quarter  from the heights comes     to the ear the tramp of soldiery broke and irregular as by     obstacles in their descent as yet they are some distance off     on heights to the right hand on the other side of the river     glimmer the bivouac fires of the french under marmont  the     lightning quickens with rolls of thunder and a few large drops     of rain fall      a sentinel stands close to the ford and beyond him is the ford     house a shed open towards the roadway and the spectator  it is     lit by a single lantern and occupied by some halfdozen english     dragoons with a sergeant and corporal who form part of a mounted     patrol their horses being picketed at the entrance  they are     seated on a bench and appear to be waiting with some deep intent     speaking in murmurs only      the thunderstorm increases till it drowns the noise of the ford     and of the descending battalions making them seem further off     than before  the sentinel is about to retreat to the shed when     he discerns two female figures in the gloom  enter mrs dalbiac     and mrs prescott english officers wives     sentinel    where theres war theres women and where theres women theres   trouble  aloud who

infantry     draws near the ford which the downfall has made to purl more     boisterously  the twain enter the shed and the dragoons look     up inquiringly     mrs dalbiac to dragoons    the french are luckier than you are men  youll have a wet advance   across this ford but they have a dry retreat by the bridge at alba     sergeant of patrol starting from a doze    the moustachies a dry retreat

reach the ford  the storm increases     in strength the stream flows more furiously yet the columns of     foot enter it and begin crossing  the lightning is continuous     the faint lantern in the fordhouse is paled by the sheets of     fire without which flap round the bayonets of the crossing men     and reflect upon the foaming torrent     chorus of the pities aerial music         the skies fling flame on this ancient land        and drenched and drowned is the burnt blown sand        that spreads its mantle of yellowgrey        round old salmantica today        while marching men come

 at eye watches the french division under thomiere which has become     separated from the centre of the french army  round and near him     are aides and other officers in animated conjecture on marmonts     intent which appears to be a move on the ciudad rodrigo road     aforesaid under the impression that the english are about to     retreat that way      the english commander descends from where he was standing to a nook     under a wall where a meal is roughly laid out  some of his staff     are already eating there  wellington takes a few mouthfuls without     sitting down walks back

off by the aides several british     divisions advance across the french front on the greater arapeile     and elsewhere  the french shower bullets into them but an english     brigade under pack

advancing on the russian capital      we are looking east towards moscow and the army of russia which     bars the way thither  the sun of latter summer sinking behind     our backs floods the whole prospect which is mostly wild     uncultivated land with patches of birchtrees  napoleons army     has just arrived on the scene and is making its bivouac for the     night some of the later regiments not having yet come up  a     dropping fire of musketry from skirmishers ahead keeps snapping     through the air  the emperors tent stands in a ravine in the     foreground amid the squares of the old guard  aides and other     officers are chatting outside      enter napoleon who dismounts speaks to some of his suite and     disappears inside his tent  an interval follows during which the     sun dips      enter colonel fabvrier aidedecamp of marmont just arrived from     spain  an officerinwaiting goes into napoleons tent to announce     fabvrier the colonel meanwhile talking to those outside     an aide    important tidings thence i make no doubt     fabvrier    marmont repulsed on salamanca field   and wellnigh slain is the best tale i bring      a silence  a coughing heard in napoleons tent    whose rheumy throat distracts the quiet so     aide    the emperors  he is thus the livelong day      colonel fabvrier is shown into the tent  an interval  then the     husky accents of napoleon within growing louder and louder     voice of napoleon    if marmontso i gather from these lines   had let the english and the spanish be   they would have bent from salamanca back   offering no battle to our profiting   we should have been delivered this disaster   whose bruit will harm us more than aught besides   that has befallen in spain     voice of fabvrier         i fear so sire     voice of napoleon    he forced a conflict to cull laurel crowns   before king joseph should arrive to share them     voice of fabvrier    the armys ardour for your majesty   its courage its devotion to your cause   cover a myriad of the marshals sins     voice of napoleon    why gave he battle without biddance pray   from the supreme commander  heres the crime   of insubordination root of woes   the time well chosen and the battle won   the english succours there had sidled off   and their annoy in the peninsula   embarrassed us no more  behoves it me   some day to face this wellington myself   marmont too plainly is no match for him   thus he goes on to have preserved command   i would with joy have changed this early wound   for foulest mortal stroke at fall of day   one baleful moment damnified the fruit   of six weeks wise strategics whose result   had loomed so certainsatirically  well weve but his word   as to their wisdom  to define them thus   would not have struck me but for his good prompting   no matter on moskowas banks tomorrow   ill mend his faults upon the arapeile   ill see how i can treat this russian horde   which english gold has brought together here   from the four corners of the universe   adieu  youd best go now and take some rest      fabvrier reappears from the tent and goes  enter de bausset     de bausset    the box that

of murmured     talk an exclamation bursts from the emperor  in a few minutes he     appears at the tent door a valet following him bearing a picture     the emperors face shows traces of emotion     napoleon    bring out a chair for me to poise it on      reenter de bausset from the tent with a chair    they all shall see it  yes my soldiersons   must gaze upon this son of mine own house   in

cupandball     being represented as the globe  the officers standing near are     attracted round and then the officers and soldiers further back     begin running up till there is a great crowd

scene darkens and the fires of the bivouacs shine up ruddily     those of the french near at hand those of the russians in a long     line across the middistance and throwing a flapping glare into     the heavens  as the night grows stiller the balladsinging and     laughter from the french mixes with a slow singing of psalms from     their adversaries      the two multitudes lie down to sleep and all is quiet but for     the sputtering of the green wood fires which now that the human     tongues are still seem to hold a conversation of their own      scene v    the same      the prospect lightens with dawn and the sun rises red  the     spacious field of battle is now distinct its ruggedness being     bisected by the great road from smolensk to moscow which runs     centrally from

the road aforesaid intersecting it in mid     distance at the village of borodino      behind this village the russians have taken their stand in close     masses  so stand also the french who have in their centre the     shevardino redoubt beyond the kalotcha  here napoleon in his     usual gluegrey uniform white waistcoat and white leather     breeches chooses his position with berthier and other officers     of his suite     dumb show    it is six oclock and the firing of a single cannon on the french   side proclaims that the battle is beginning  there is a roll of   drums and the

irregular streets     of the city which disclose a jumble of architectural styles the     asiatic prevailing over the european  a huge triangular white     walled fortress rises above the churches and coloured domes on a     hill in the background the central feature of which is a lofty     tower with a gilded cupola the ivan tower  beneath the battlements     of this fortress the moskva river

pictures   carpets glass silver china and fashionable attire are rolling   out of the city followed by footpassengers in streams who carry   their most precious possessions on their shoulders  others bear   their sick relatives caring nothing for their goods and mothers   go laden with their infants  others drive their cows sheep and   goats causing much obstruction  some of the populace however

of hands like the babble     of waves and companies of foot run in disorder towards high ground     to behold the spectacle waving their shakos on their bayonets      the army now marches on and napoleon and his suite disappear     citywards from the hill of salutation      the day wanes ere the host has passed and dusk begins to prevail     when tidings reach the rearguard that cause dismay  they have     been sent back lip by lip from the front     spirit ironic         an anticlimax to napoleons dream     spirit of rumour         they say no governor attends with keys        to offer

blackness to the north of where the kremlin stands appears what at     first seems a lurid malignant star  it waxes larger  almost     simultaneously a northeast wind rises and the light glows and     sinks with the gusts proclaiming a fire which soon grows large     enough to irradiate the fronts of adjacent buildings and to show     that it is creeping on towards the kremlin itself the walls of     that fortress which face the flames emerging from their previous     shade      the fire can be seen breaking out also in numerous other quarters     all the conflagrations increase and become as those at first     detached group themselves together one huge furnace whence     streamers of flame reach up to the sky brighten the landscape     far around and show the houses as if it were day  the blaze     gains the kremlin and licks its walls but does not kindle it     explosions and hissings are constantly audible amid which can be     fancied cries and yells of people caught in the

raiment     some wearing rugs for warmth some quilts and curtains some even     petticoats and other womens clothing  many are delirious from     hunger and cold      but they set about doing what is a necessity for the least hope of     salvation and throw a bridge across the stream      the point of vision descends to earth close to the scene of action      scene x    the bridge of the beresina      the bridge is over the beresina at studzianka  on each side of     the river are swampy meadows now hard with frost while further     back are dense forests  ice floats down the deep black stream

and partonneaux with the rearguard who   has not yet crossed is at borissow some way below where there is   an old permanent bridge partly broken    enter with speed from the distance the russians under tchaplitz   more under tchichagoff enter the scene down the river on the left   or further bank and cross by the old bridge of borissow  but they   are too far from the new crossing to intercept the french as yet    platoff with his cossacks next appears on the stage which is to be   such a tragic one  he comes from the forest and approaches the left   bank likewise  so also does wittgenstein who strikes in between   the uncrossed victor and partonneaux  platoff thereupon descends   on the latter who surrenders with the rearguard and thus seven   thousand more are cut off from the already emaciated grand army    tchaplitz of tchichagoffs division has meanwhile got round by the   old bridge at borissow to the french side of the new one and attacks   oudinot but he is repulsed with the strength of despair  the french   lose a further five thousand in this    we now look across the river at victor and his division not yet   over and still defending the new bridges  wittgenstein descends   upon him but he holds his ground    the determined russians set up a battery of twelve cannon so as to   command the two new bridges with the confused crowd of soldiers   carriages and baggage pressing to cross  the battery discharges   into the surging multitude  more russians come up and forming a   semicircle round the bridges and the mass of french fire yet more   hotly on them

adjoining     duchess of montebello              for some long while   there has come no letter from the emperor   and paris brims with ghastly rumourings   about the far campaign  not being beloved   the town is over dull for her alone      reenter marie louise     marie louise    the king of rome is sleeping in his cot   sweetly and safe  now ladies i am going      she withdraws  her tiringwomen

ladyinwaiting rises to go into her     bedroom which adjoins that of the empress      mens voices are suddenly heard in the corridor without  the lady     inwaiting pauses with parted lips  the voices grow louder  the     ladyinwaiting screams      marie louise hastily reenters in a dressinggown thrown over her     nightclothes     marie louise    great god what altercation can that be   i had just verged on sleep when it aroused me      a thumping is heard at the door     voice of napoleon without    hola  pray let me in  unlock the door     ladyinwaiting    heavens mercy on us  what man may it be   at such and hour as this     marie louise         o it is he       the ladyinwaiting unlocks the door  napoleon enters scarcely     recognizable in a fur cloak and hood over his ears  he throws     off the cloak and discloses himself to be in the shabbiest and     muddiest attire  marie louise is agitated almost to fainting     spirit ironic         is it with fright or joy     marie louise              i scarce believe   what my sight tells me  home and in such garb      napoleon embraces her     napoleon    i have had great work in getting in my dear   they failed to recognize me at the gates   being sceptical at my poor hackneycoach   and poorer baggage  i had to show my face   in a fierce light ere they would let me pass   and even then they doubted till i spoke   what think you dear of such a tramplike spouse                                      he warms his hands at the fire   hait is much more comfortable here   than on the russian plains     marie louise timidly              you have suffered there   your face is thinner and has line in it   no marvel that they did not know you     napoleon              yes   disasters many and swift have swooped on me   since crossingughthe beresina river   i have been compelled to come incognito   ayas a fugitive and outlaw quite     marie louise    well thank heaven anyhow that you are safe   i had gone to bed and everybody almost   what now do require  some food of course      the child in the adjoining chamber begins to cry awakened by the     loud tones of napoleon     napoleon    ahthats his little voice

outstripped it on the way     marie louise    and where is the grand army     napoleon         ohthats gone     marie louise    gone  butgone where     napoleon         gone all to nothing dear     marie louise incredulously    but some six hundred thousand i saw pass   through dresden russiawards     napoleon flinging himself into a chair              well those men lie   or most of themin layers of bleaching bones   twixt here and moscow i have been subdued   but by the elements and them alone   not russia but gods sky has conquered me                     with an appalled look she sits beside him   from the sublime to the ridiculous   theres but a stepi have been saying it   all through the leagues of my long journey home   and that step has been passed in this affair   yes briefly it is quite ridiculous   whichever way you look at itha ha     marie louise simply    but those six hundred thousand throbbing throats   that cheered me deaf at dresden marching east   so full of youth and spiritsall bleached bones   ridiculous  can it be so dear to   their mothers say     napoleon with a twitch of displeasure              you scarcely understand   i meant the enterprise and not its stuff   i had no wish to fight nor alexander   but circumstance impaled us each on each   the genius who outshapes my destinies   did all the rest  had i but hit success   imperial splendour would have worn a crown   unmatched in longscrolled time well leave that now   what do they know about all this in paris     marie louse    i cannot say  black rumours fly and croak   like ravens through the streets but come to me   thinned to the vagueoccurrences in spain   breed much disquiet with these other things   marmonts defeat at salamanca field   ploughed deep into mens brows  the cafes say   your troops must clear from spain     napoleon              well see to that   ill find a way to do a better thing   though i must have another army first   three hundred thousand quite  fishes as good   swim in the sea as have come out of it   but to begin we must make sure of france   disclose ourselves to the good folk of paris   in daily outing as a family group   the type and model of domestic bliss   which by the way we are  and i intend   also to gild the dome of the invalides   in best gold leaf and on a novel pattern     marie louise    to gild the dome dear  why     napoleon              to give them something   to think about  theyll take to it like children   and argue in the cafes right and left   on its artistic pointsso theyll forget   the woes of moscow      a chamberlaininwaiting announces supper  marie louise and     napoleon go out  the room darkens and the scene closes     act second     scene i    the plain of vitoria      it is the eve of the longest day of the year also the eve of the     battle of vitoria  the english army in the peninsula and their     spanish and portuguese allies are bivouacking on the western side     of the plain about six miles from the town      on some high ground in the left middistance may be discerned the     marquis of wellingtons tent with generals hill picton ponsonby     graham and others of his staff going in and out in consultation     on the momentous event impending  near the foreground are some     hussars sitting round a fire the evening being damp their horses     are picketed behind  in the immediate front of the scene are some     troopofficers talking     first officer    this grateful rest of fourandtwenty hours   is priceless for our jaded soldiery   and we have reconnoitred largely too   so the slow day will not have slipped in vain     second officer looking towards the headquarter tent    by this time they must nearly have dotted down   the methods of our masterstroke tomorrow   i have no clear conception of its plan   even in its leading lines  what is decided     first officer    there are outshaping three supreme attacks   as i decipher  grahams on the left   to compass which he crosses the zadorra   and turns the enemys right  on our right hill   will start at once to storm the puebla crests   the chief himself with us here in the centre   will lead on by the bridges trespuentes   over the ridge there and the mendoza bridge   a little further upthats roughly it   but much and wide discretionary power   is left the generals all      the officers walk away and the stillness increases so the     conversation at the hussars bivouac a few yards further back     becomes noticeable     sergeant young19    i wonder i wonder how stourcastle is looking this summer night and   all the old folks there     second hussar    you was born there i think ive heard ye say sergeant     sergeant young    i was  and though i ought not to say it as father and mother are   living there still tis a dull place at times  now budmouthregis   was exactly to my taste when we were there with the court that   summer and the king and queen awambling about among us like the   most everyday old man and woman you ever see  yes there was plenty   going on and only a pretty step from home  altogether we had a   fine time     third hussar    you walked with a girl there for some weeks sergeant if  my memory   serves     sergeant young    i did  and a pretty girl a was  but nothing came ont  a month   afore we struck camp she married a tallowchandlers dipper of little   nicholas lane  i was a good deal upset about it at the time  but   one gets over things     second hussar    twas a low taste in the hussy come to thathowsomever i agree   about budmouth  i never had pleasanter times than when we lay there   you had a song on it sergeant in them days if i dont mistake     sergeant young    i had and have still twas made up when we left by our bandmaster   that used to conduct in front of gloucester lodge at the kings mess   every afternoon      the sergeant is silent for a minute then suddenly bursts into     melody     song budmouth dears    i         when we lay where budmouth beach is        o the girls were fresh as peaches        with their tall and tossing figures and their eyes of blue               and brown             and our hearts would ache with longing             as we paced from our singsonging        with a smart clink clink up the esplanade and down     ii              they distracted and delayed us             by the pleasant pranks they played us        and what marvel then if troopers even of regiments of renown             on whom flashed those eyes divine o             should forget the countersign o        as we tore clink clink back to camp above the town     iii              do they miss us much i wonder             now that war has swept us sunder        and we roam from where the faces smile to where the faces frown             and no more behold the features             of the fair fantastic creatures        and no more clink clink past the parlours of the town     iv              shall we once again there meet them             falter fond attempts to greet them        will the gay slingjacket20 glow again beside the muslin gown             will they archly quiz and con us             with a sideways glance upon us       while our spurs clink clink up the esplanade and down      applause from the other hussars  more songs are sung the night     gets darker the fires go out and the camp sleeps      scene ii    the same from the puebla heights      it is now day but a summer fog pervades the prospect  behind     the fog is heard the roll of bass and tenor drums and the clash     of cymbals with notes of the popular march the downfall of paris      by degrees the fog lifts and the plain is disclosed  from this     elevation gazing north the expanse looks like the palm of a     monstrous right hand a little hollowed some halfdozen miles     across wherein the ball of the thumb is roughly represented by     heights to the east on which the french centre has gathered the     mount of mars and the moon the opposite side of the palm by     the position of the english on the left or west of the plain     and the line of life by the zadorra an unfordable river running     from the town down the plain and dropping out of it through a     pass in the puebla heights to the south just beneath our point     of observationthat is to say toward the wrist of the supposed     hand  the left of the english army under graham would occupy the     mounts at the base of the fingers while the bent fingertips     might represent the cantabrian hills beyond the plain to the north     or back of the scene      from the aforesaid stony crests of puebla the white town and     church towers of vitoria can be descried on a slope to the right     rear of the field of battle  a warm rain succeeds the fog for a     short while bringing up the fragrant scents from fields vineyards     and gardens now in the full leafage of june     dumb show    all the english forces converge forwardthat is eastwardlythe   centre over the ridges the right through the pass to the south the   left down the bilbao road on the northwest the bands of the divers   regiments striking up the same quick march the downfall of paris     spirit of the years         you see the scene  and yet you see it not        what do you notice now     there immediately is shown visually the electric state of mind that   animates wellington graham hill kempt picton colville and other   responsible ones on the british side and on the french king joseph   stationary on the hill overlooking his own centre and surrounded by   a numerous staff that includes his adviser marshal jourdan with   far away in the field gazan derlon reille and other marshals   this vision resembling as a whole the interior of a beating brain   lit by phosphorescence in an instant fades back to normal     anon we see the english hussars with their flying pelisses galloping   across the zadorra on one of the trespuentes in the midst of the   field as had been planned the english lines in the foreground under   hill pushing the enemy up the slopes and far in the distance to the   left of vitoria whiffs of grey smoke followed by low rumbles show   that the left of the english army under graham is pushing on there    bridge after bridge of the halfdozen over the zadorra is crossed by   the british and wellington in the centre with picton seeing the   hill and village of arinez in front of him eastward to be weakly   held carries the regiments of the seventh and third divisions in a   quick run towards it  supported by the hussars they ultimately   fight their way to the top in a chaos of smoke flame and booming   echoes loudvoiced picton in an old blue coat and round hat   swearing as he goes    meanwhile the french who are opposed to the english right in the   foreground have been turned by hill the heights are all abandoned   and the columns fall back in a confused throng by the road to   vitoria hard pressed by the british

wreaths of laurel  the avenues     stretching away from the rotunda into the gardens charm the eyes     with their mild multitudinous lights while festoons of lamps     hang from the trees elsewhere

i told        bears in it formal declaration signed        of war by francis with his latelinked son        the emperor of france  now let us go        to leipzig city and await the blow      a chaotic gloom ensues accompanied by a rushing like that of a     mighty wind     act third     scene i    leipzig  napoleons quarters in the reudnitz suburb      the sittingroom of a private mansion  evening  a large stove     fire and candles burning  the october wind is heard without and     the leaded panes of the old windows shake mournfully     semichorus i of ironic spirits aerial music         we come and learn as times disordered dear sands run        that castlereaghs diplomacy has wiled waxed won        the beacons flash the fevered news to eyes keen bent        that austrias formal words of war are shaped sealed sent     semichorus ii         so polands three despoilers primed by bulls gross pay        to stem napoleons might he waits the weird dark day        his proffered peace declined with scorn in fell force then        they front him with yet tenscore thousand more massed men      at the back of the room caulaincourt duke of vicenza and     jouanne one of napoleons confidential secretaries are unpacking     and laying out the emperors maps and papers  in the foreground     berthier murat lauriston and several officers of napoleons     suite are holding a desultory conversation while they await his     entry  their countenances are overcast     murat    at least the scheme of marching on berlin   is now abandoned     lauriston              not without high words   he yielded and gave order prompt for leipzig   but coldness and reserve have marked his mood   towards us ever since     berthier              the march hereto   he has looked on as a retrogressive one   and that he ever holds is courting woe   to counsel it was doubtless full of risk   and heaped us with responsibilities   yet twas your missive sire that settled it to murat   how stirred he was  to leipzig or berlin   he kept repeating as he drew and drew   fantastic figures on the foolscap sheet   the one spells ruintother spells success   and which is which     murat stiffly              what better could i do   so far were the allies from sheering off   as he supposed that they had moved in march   full fanfare hither  i was dutybound   to let him know     lauriston              assuming victory here   if he should let the advantage slip him by   as on the dresden day he wrecks us all   twas damnableto ride back from the fight   inside a coach as though we had not won     caulaincourt from the back    the emperor was ill i have ground for knowing      napoleon enters     napoleon buoyantly    comrades the outlook promises us well     murat dryly    right glad are we you tongue such tidings sire   to us the stars have visaged differently   to wit we muster outside leipzig here   levies one hundred and ninety thousand strong   the enemy has mustered outside us   three hundred and fifty thousandif not more     napoleon    all that is needful is to conquer them   we are concentred here they lie aspread   which shrinks them to twohundredthousand power   though that the urgency of victory   is absolute i admit     murat              yea otherwise   the issue will be worse than moscow sire      marmont duke of ragusa wellingtons adversary in spain is     announced and enters     napoleon    ah marmont bring you in particulars     marmont    some sappers i have taken captive sire   say the allies will be at stroke with us   the morning next to tomorrowsi am come   now from the steepletop of liebenthal   where i beheld the enemys fires bespot   the horizon round with raging eyes of flame   my vanward posts too have been driven in   and i need succoursthrice ten thousand say     napoleon coldly    the enemy vexes not your vanward posts   you are mistakennow however go   cross leipzig and remain as the reserve   well gentlemen my hope herein is this   the first day to annihilate schwarzenberg   the second blucher  so shall we slip the toils   they are all madding to enmesh us in     berthier    few are our infantry to fence with theirs     napoleon cheerfully    well range them in two lines instead of three   and so we shall look stronger by onethird     berthier incredulously    can they be thus deceived sire     napoleon              can they  yes   with all my practice i can err in numbers   at least onequarter why not they onethird   anyhow tis worth trying at a pinch      augereau is suddenly announced    good  ive not seen him yet since he arrived      enter augereau    here you are then at last old augereau   you have been looked for longbut you are no more   the augereau of castiglione days     augereau    nay sire  i still should be the augereau   of glorious castiglione could you give   the boys of italy back again to me     napoleon    well let it drop only i notice round me   an atmosphere of scopeless apathy   wherein i do not share     augereau              there are reasons sire   good reasons for despondence  as i came   i learnt past question that bavaria   swerves on the very pivot of desertion   this adds some threescore thousand to our foes     napoleon irritated    that consummation long has threatened us   would that you showed the steeled fidelity   you used to show  except me all are slack   to murat why even you yourself my brotherinlaw   have been inclining to abandon me     murat vehemently    i sire  it is not so  i stand and swear   the grievous imputation is untrue   you should know better than believe these things   and well remember i have enemies   who ever wait to slander me to you     napoleon more calmly    ah yes yes  that is soand yetand yet   you have deigned to weigh the feasibility   of treating me as austria has done   but i forgive you  you are a worthy man   you feel real friendship for me  you are brave   yet i was wrong to make a king of you   if i had been content to draw the line   at viceking as with young eugene no more   as he has laboured youd have laboured too   but as full monarch you have foraged rather   for your own pot than mine      murat and the marshal are silent and look at each other with     troubled countenances  napoleon goes to the table at the back and     bends over the charts with caulaincourt dictating desultory notes     to the secretaries     spirit ironic                   a seer might say        this savours of a sad lastsupper talk        twixt his disciples and this christ of war      enter an attendant     attendant    the saxon king and queen and the princess   enter the city gates your majesty   they seek the shelter of the civic walls   against the risk of capture by allies     napoleon    ah so  my friend augustus is he near   i will be prompt to meet him when he comes   and safely quarter him  he returns to the map      an interval  the clock strikes midnight  the emperor rises     abruptly sighs and comes forward              i now retire   comrades  goodnight goodnight remember well   all must prepare to grip with gory death   in the now voidless battle  it will be   a great one and a critical one in brief   that will seal frances fate and yours and mine     all fervidly    well do our utmost by the holy heaven     napoleon    ahwhat was that  he pulls back the windowcurtain     several              it is our enemies   whose southern hosts are signalling to their north      a white rocket is beheld high in the air  it is followed by a     second and a third  there is a pause during which napoleon and     the rest wait motionless  in a minute or two from the opposite     side of the city three coloured rockets are sent up in evident     answer to the three white ones  napoleon muses and lets the     curtain drop     napoleon    yes schwarzenberg to blucher it must be   to show that they are ready  so are we      he goes out without saying more  the marshals and other officers     withdraw  the room darkens and ends the scene      scene ii    the same  the city and the battlefield      leipzig is viewed in aerial perspective from a position above the     south suburbs and reveals itself as standing in a plain with     rivers and marshes on the west north and south of it and higher     ground to the east and southeast      at this date it is somewhat in she shape of the letter d the     straight part of which is the river pleisse  except as to this     side it is surrounded by armiesthe inner horseshoe of them     being the french defending the city  the outer horseshoe being     the allies about to attack it      far over the cityas it were at the top of the dat lindenthal     we see marmont stationed to meet blucher when he arrives on that     side  to the right of him is ney and further off to the right     on heights eastward macdonald  then round the curve towards the     south in order augereau lauriston behind whom is napoleon     himself and the reserve of guards victor at wachau and     poniatowski near the pleisse river at the bottom of the d  near     him are the cavalry of kellermann and milhaud and in the same     direction murat with his covering the great avenues of approach     on the south      outside all these stands schwarzenbergs army of which opposed     to macdonald and lauriston are kleinaus austrians and zietens     prussians covered on the flank by cossacks under platoff     opposed to victor and poniatowski are meerfeldt and hessehomburgs     austrians wittgensteins russians kleists prussians guilays     austrians with lichtensteins and thielmanns light troops thus     reaching round across the elster into the morass on our near left     the lower point of the d     semichorus i of rumours aerial music         this is the combat of napoleons hope        but not of his assurance  shrunk in power        he broods beneath octobers clammy cope        while hemming hordes wax denser every hour     semichorus ii         he knows he knows that though in equal fight        he stand s heretofore the matched of none        a feeble skill is propped by numbers might        and now three hosts close round to crush out one     dumb show    the leipzig clocks imperturbably strike nine and the battle which   is to decide the fate of europe and perhaps the world begins with   three booms from the line of the allies  they are the signal for   a general cannonade of devastating intensity    so massive is the contest that we soon fail to individualize the   combatants as beings and can only observe them as amorphous drifts   clouds and waves of conscious atoms surging and rolling together   can only particularize them by race tribe and language   nationalities from the uttermost parts of asia here meet those from   the atlantic edge of europe for the first and last time  by noon   the sound becomes a loud droning uninterrupted and brevelike as   from the pedal of an organ kept continuously down     chorus of rumours         now triple battle beats about the town        and now contracts the huge elastic ring        of fighting flesh as those within go down        or spreads as those without show faltering     it becomes apparent that the french have a particular intention   the allies only a general one  that of the french is to break   through the enemys centre and surround his right  to this end   napoleon launches fresh columns and simultaneously oudinot supports   victor against eugene of wurtembergs right while on the other   side of him the cavalry of milhaud and kellerman prepares to charge   napoleons combination is successful and drives back eugene   meanwhile schwarzenberg is stuck fast useless in the marshes   between the pleisse and the elster    by three oclock the allied centre which has held out against the   assaults of the french right and left is broken through by cavalry   under murat latourmaubourg and kellermann    the bells of leipzig ring     chorus of the pities         those chimings illadvised and premature        who knows if such vast valour will endure     the austrorussians are withdrawn from the marshes by schwarzenberg   but the french cavalry also get entangled in the swamps and   simultaneously marmont is beaten at mockern    meanwhile ney to the north of leipzig having heard the battle   raging southward leaves his position to assist it  he has nearly   arrived when he hears blucher attacking at the point he came from   and sends back some of his divisions    bertrand has kept open the west road to lindenau and the rhine the   only french line of retreat    evening finds the battle a drawn one  with the nightfall three blank   shots reverberate hollowly     semichorus i of rumours         they sound to say that for this moaning night        as nature sleeps so too shall sleep the fight        neither the victor     semichorus ii                   but for france and him        halfwon is losing     chorus                   yea his hopes drop dim        since nothing less than victory today        had saved a cause whose ruin is delay     the night gets thicker and no more is seen      scene iii    the same from the tower of the pleissenburg      the tower commands a view of a great part of the battlefield     day has just dawned and citizens saucereyed from anxiety and     sleeplessness are discover watching     first citizen    the wind increased at midnight while i watched   with flapping showers and clouds that combed the moon   till dawn began outheaving this huge day   pallidlyas if scared by its own issue   this day that the allies with bonded might   have vowed to deal their felling finite blow     second citizen    so must it be  they have welded close the coop   wherein our luckless frenchmen are enjailed   with such compression that their front has shrunk   from five miles farness to but half as far   men say napoleon made resolve last night   to marshal a retreat  if so his way   is by the bridge of lindenau      they look across in the cold east light at the long straight     causeway from the ranstadt gate at the northwest corner of the     town and the lindenau bridge over the elster beyond     first citizen    last night i saw like wolfpacks hosts appear   upon the dresden road and then anon   the already stout arrays of schwarzenberg   grew stoutened more  i witnessed clearly too   just before dark the bands of bernadotte   come hemming in the north more thoroughly   the horizon glowered with a thousand fires   as the unyielding circle shut around      as it grows light they scan and define the armies     third citizen    those lying there twixt connewitz and dolitz   are the right wing of horse murat commands   next poniatowski victor and the rest   out here napoleons centre at probstheida   where he has bivouacked  those round this way   are his left wing with ney that face the north   between paunsdorf and gohlisthus you see   they are skilfully sconced within the villages   with cannon ranged in front  and every copse   dingle and grove is packed with riflemen      the heavy sky begins to clear with the full arrival of the     morning  the sun bursts out and the previously dark and gloomy     masses glitter in the rays  it is now seven oclock and with the     shining of the sun the battle is resumed      the army of bohemia to the south and east in three great columns     marches concentrically upon napoleons new and muchcontracted line     the first column of thirtyfive thousand under bennigsen the     second the central fortyfive thousand under barclay de tolly     the third twentyfive thousand under the prince of hessehomburg      an interval of suspense     first citizen    ah see  the french bend falter and fall back      another interval  then a huge rumble of artillery resounds from     the north     semichorus of rumours aerial music         now blucher has arrived and now falls to        marmont withdraws before him  bernadotte        touching bennigsen joins attack with him        and ney must needs recede  this serves as sign        to schwarzenberg to bear upon probstheida        napoleons keystone and dependence here        but for long whiles he fails to win his will      the chief being nighoutmatching might with skill     semichorus ii         ney meanwhile stung still sharplier still withdraws        nearer the town and met by new mischance        finds him forsaken by his saxon wing        fair files of thrice twelve thousand footmanry        but rallying those still true with signs and calls      he warely closes up his remnant to the walls     semichorus i         around probstheida still the conflict rolls        under napoleons eye surpassingly        like sedge before the scythe the sections fall        and bayonets slant and reek  each cannonblaze        makes the air thick with human limbs while keen        contests rage hand to hand  throats shout advance        and forms walm wallow and slack suddenly        hot ordnance split and shiver and rebound      and firelocks fouled and flintless overstrew the ground     semichorus ii         at length the allies daring tumultuously        find them inside probstheida  there is fixed        napoleons cardinal and centre hold        but need to loose it grows his gloomy fear      as night begins to brown and treacherous mists appear     chorus         then on the three fronts of this reaching field        a furious far and final cannonade        burns from two thousand mouths and shakes the plain        and hastens the sure end  towards the west        bertrand keeps open the retreatingway        along which wambling waggons since the noon        have crept in closening file  dusk draws around        the marching remnants drowse amid their talk      and worn and harrowed horses slumber as the walk      in the darkness of the distance spread cries from the maimed     animals and the wounded men  multitudes of the latter contrive to     crawl into the city until the streets are full of them  their     voices are heard calling     second citizen    they cry for water  let us go down   and do what mercy may      exeunt citizens from the tower     spirit of the pities                   a fire is lit        near to the thonberg windwheel  can it be        napoleon tarries yet  let us go see      the distant firelight becomes clearer and closer      scene iv    the same  at the thonberg windmill      by the newly lighted fire napoleon is seen walking up and down     much agitated and worn  with him are murat berthier augereau     victor and other marshals of corps that have been engaged in this     part of the fieldall perspiring muddy and fatigued     napoleon    baseness so gross i had not guessed of them   the thirty thousand false bavarians   i looked on losing not unplacidly   but these trothswearing sober saxonry   i reckoned staunch by virtue of their king   thirtyfive thousand and gone  it magnifies   a failure into a catastrophe   murat we must retreat precipitately   and not as hope had dreamed  begin it then   this very hourberthier write out the orders   let me sit down      a chair is brought out from the mill  napoleon sinks into it and     berthier stooping over the fire begins writing to the emperors     dictation the marshals looking with gloomy faces at the flaming     logs      napoleon has hardly dictated a line when he stops short  berthier     turns round and finds that he has dropt asleep     murat sullenly              far better not disturb him   hell soon enough awake      they wait muttering to one another in tones expressing weary     indifference to issues  napoleon sleeps heavily for a quarter of     and hour during which the moon rises over the field  at the end     he starts up stares around him with astonishment     napoleon              am i awake   or is this all a dreamah no  too real   and yet i have seen ere now a time like this      the dictation is resumed  while it is in progress there can be     heard between the words of napoleon the persistent cries from the     plain rising and falling like those of a vast rookery far away     intermingled with the trampling of hoofs and the rumble of wheels     the bivouac fires of the engirdling enemy glow all around except     for a small segment to the westthe track of retreat still kept     open by bertrand and already taken by the baggagewaggons      the orders for its adoption by the entire army being completed     napoleon bids adieu to his marshals and rides with berthier and     caulaincourt into leipzig  exeunt also the others     semichorus i of the pities         now as in the dream of one sick to death          there comes a narrowing room        that pens him body and limbs and breath          to wait a hideous doom     semichorus ii         so to napoleon in the hush          that holds the town and towers        through this dire night a creeping crush          seems inborne with the hours      the scene closes under a rimy mist which makes a lurid cloud of     the firelights      scene v    the same  a street near the ranstadt gate      high oldfashioned houses form the street along which from the     east of the city is streaming a confusion of waggons in hurried     exit through the gate westward upon the highroad to lindenau     lutzen and the rhine      in front of an inn called the prussian arms are some attendants     of napoleon waiting with horses     first officer    he has just come from bidding the king and queen   a long goodbye is it that they will pay   for his indulgence of their past ambition   by sharing now his ruin  much the king   did beg him to leave them to their lot   and shun the shame of capture needlessly                        he looks anxiously towards the door   i would hed haste  each minute is of price     second officer    the king will come to terms with the allies   they will not hurt him  though he has lost his all   his case is not like ours      the cheers of the approaching enemy grow louder  napoleon comes     out from the prussian arms haggard and in disordered attire     he is about to mount but perceiving the blocked state of the     street he hesitates     napoleon              god what a crowd   i shall more quickly gain the gate afoot   there is a byway somewhere i suppose      a citizen approaches out of the inn     citizen    this alley sire will speed you to the gate   i shall be honoured much to point the way     napoleon    then do good friend  to attendants  bring on the horses there   i if arrive soonest i will wait for you      the citizen shows napoleon the way into the alley     citizen    a gardens at the end your majesty   through which you pass  beyond there is a door   that opens to the elster bank unbalked      napoleon disappears into the alley  his attendants plunge amid     the traffic with the horses and thread their way down the street      another citizen comes from the door of the inn and greets the     first     first citizen

and all is lost to one to many gained        the old dynastic routine reimposing           the new dynastic structure unsustained         now every neighbouring realm is frances warder           and

    scene vi    the pyrenees  near the river nivelle      evening  the diningroom of wellingtons quarters  the table is     laid for dinner  the battle of the nivelle has just been fought      enter wellington hill beresford stewart hope clinton colborne     cole kempt with a boundup wound and other officers     wellington    it is strange that they did not hold their grand position more   tenaciously against us today  by god i dont quite see why we   should have beaten them     colborne    my impression is that they had the stiffness taken out of them by   something they had just heard of  anyhow startling news of some   kind was received by those of the eightyeighth we took in the   signalredoubt after i summoned the commandant     wellington    oh what news     colborne    i cannot say my lord  i only know that the latest number of the   imperial gazette was seen in the hands of some of them before the   capture  they had been reading the contents and were cast down     wellington    thats interesting  i wonder what the news could have been     hill    something about boneys army in saxony would be most probable   though i question if theres time yet for much to have been   decided there     beresford    well i wouldnt say that  a hell of a lot of things may have   happened there by this time     colborne    it was tantalizing but they were just able to destroy the paper   before we could prevent them     wellington    did you question them     colborne    oh yes  but they stayed sulking at being taken and would tell us   nothing pretending that they knew nothing  whether much were going   on they said or little between the army of the emperor and the   army of the allies it was none of their business to relate it so   they kept a gloomy silence for the most part     wellington    they will cheer up a bit and be more communicative when they have had   some dinner     cole    they are dining here my lord     wellington    i sent them an invitation an hour ago which they have accepted   i could do no less poor devils  theyll be here in a few minutes   see that they have plenty of madeira to whet their whistles with   it well screw them up into a better key and theyll not be so   reserved      the conversation on the days battle becomes general  enter as     guests french officers of the eightyeighth regiment now prisoners     on parole  they are welcomed by wellington and the staff and all     sit down to dinner      for some time the meal proceeds almost in silence but wine is     passed freely and both french and english officers become     talkative and merry     wellington to the french commandant    more cozy this sir thanill warrant me   you found it in that damned redoubt today     commandant    the devil if tis not monseigneur sure     wellington    so tis for us who were outside by god     commandant gloomily    no we were not at ease  alas my lord   twas more than flesh and blood could do to fight   after such paralyzing tidings came   more life may trickle out of men through thought   than through a gaping wound     wellington              your reference   bears on the news from saxony i infer     second french officer    yes on the emperors ruinous defeat   at leipzig citybrought to our startled heed   by one of the gazettes just now arrived      all the english officers stop speaking and listen eagerly     wellington    where are the emperors headquarters now     commandant    my lord there are no headquarters     wellington         no headquarters     commandant    there are no french headquarters now my lord   for there is no french army  frances fame   is fouled  and how then could we fight today   with our hearts in our shoes     wellington              why that bears out   what i but lately said it was not like   the brave men who have faced and foiled me here   so many a long year past to give away   a stubborn station quite so readily     beresford    and what messieurs ensued at leipzig then     several french officers    why sirs should we conceal it  thereupon   part of our army took the lutzen road   behind a blownup bridge  those in advance   arrived at lutzen with the emperor   the scene of our once famous victory   in such sad sort retreat was hurried on   erfurt was gained with blucher hot at heel   to cross the rhine seemed then our only hope   alas the austrians and the bavarians   faced us in hanau forest led by wrede   and deadblocked our escape     wellington         ha  did they though     second french officer    but if brave hearts were ever desperate   sir we were desperate then  we pierced them through   our loss unrecking  so by frankfurts walls   we fared to mainz and there recrossed the rhine   a funeral procession so we seemed   upon the long bridge that had rung so oft   to our victorious feet what since has coursed   we know not gentlemen  but this we know   that germany echoes no french footfall     an english officer    one sees not why it should     second french officer         well leave it so      conversation on the leipzig disaster continues till the dinner     ends  the french prisoners courteously take their leave and go     out     wellington    very good set of fellows  i could wish   they all were minewell well there was no crime   in trying to ascertain these fat events   they would have sounded soon from other tongues     hill    it looks like the first scene of act the last   for our and all mens foe     wellington              i count to meet   the allies upon the cobblestones of paris   before another halfyears suns have shone   but theres some work for us to do here yet   the dawn must find us fording the nivelle      exeunt wellington and officers  the room darkens     act fourth     scene i    the upper rhine      the view is from a vague altitude over the beautiful country     traversed by the upper rhine which stretches through it in     birdseye perspective  at this date in europes history the     stream forms the frontier between france and germany      it is the morning of new years day and the shine of the tardy     sun reaches the fronts of the beetling castles but scarcely     descends far enough to touch the wavelets of the river winding     leftwards across the manyleagued picture from schaffhausen to     coblenz     dumb show    at first nothingnot even the river itselfseems to move in the   panorama  but anon certain strange dark patches in the landscape   flexuous and ribandshaped are discerned to be moving slowly   only one movable object on earth is large enough to be conspicuous   herefrom and that is an army  the moving shapes are armies    the nearest almost beneath us is defiling across the river by a   bridge of boats near the junction of the rhine and the neckar   where the oval town of mannheim standing in the fork between the   two rivers has from here the look of a human head in a cleft   stick  martial music from many bands strikes up as the crossing   is effected and the undulating columns twinkle as if they were   scaly serpents     spirit of rumour         it is the russian host invading france     many miles to the left downstream near the little town of caube   another army is seen to be simultaneously crossing the pale current   its arms and accoutrements twinkling in like manner     spirit of rumour         thither the prussian levies too advance     turning now to the right far away by basel beyond which the   swiss mountains close the scene a still larger train of war   geared humanity two hundred thousand strong is discernible   it has already crossed the water which is much narrower here   and has advanced several miles westward where its ductile mass   of greyness and glitter is beheld parting into six columns that   march on in flexuous courses of varying direction     spirit of rumour         there glides carked austrias invading force        panting too pariswards with foot and horse        of one intention with the other twain        and wellington from the south in upper spain     all these dark and grey columns converging westward by sure   degrees advance without opposition  they glide on as if by   gravitation in fluid figures dictated by the conformation of   the country like water from a burst reservoir mostly snake   shaped but occasionally with batrachian and saurian outlines   in spite of the immensity of this human mechanism on its surface   the winter landscape wears an impassive look as if nothing were   happening    evening closes in and the dumb show is obscured      scene ii    paris  the tuileries      it is sunday just after mass and the principal officers of the     national guard are assembled in the salle des marechaux  they     stand in an attitude of suspense some with the print of sadness     on their faces some with that of perplexity      the door leading from the hall to the adjoining chapel is thrown     open  there enter from the chapel with the last notes of the     service the emperor napoleon and the empress and simultaneously     from a door opposite madame de montesquiou the governess who     carries in her arms the king of rome now a fair child between     two and three  he is clothed in a miniature uniform of the     guards themselves      madam de montesquiou brings forward the child and sets him on his     feet near his mother  napoleon with a mournful smile giving one     hand to the boy and the other to marie louise en famille leads     them forward  the guard bursts into cheers     napoleon    gentlemen of the national guard and friends   i have to leave you and before i fare   to heaven know what of personal destiny   i give into your loyal guardianship   those dearest in the world to me my wife   the empress and my son the king of rome   i go to shield your roofs and kin from foes   who have dared to pierce the fences of our land   and knowing that you house those dears of mine   i start afar in all tranquillity   stayed by my trust in your proved faithfulness                          enthusiastic cheers for the guard     officers with emotion    we proudly swear to justify the trust   and never will we see another sit   than you or yours on the great throne of france     napoleon    i ratify the empress regency   and reconfirm it on last years lines   my bother joseph stoutening her rule   as the lieutenantgeneral of the state   vex her with no divisions let regard   for property for order and for france   be chief with all  know gentlemen the allies   are drunken with success  their late advantage   they have handled wholly for their own gross gain   and made a pastime of my agony    that i go clogged with cares i sadly own   yet i go primed with hope ay in despite   of a last sorrow that has sunk upon me   the grief of hearing good and constant friends   that my own sisters consort naples king   blazons himself a backer of the allies   and marches with a neapolitan force   against our puissance under prince eugene    the varied operations to ensue   may bring the enemy largely pariswards   but suffer no alarm before long days   i will annihilate by flank and rear   those who have risen to trample on our soil   and as i have done so many and proud a time   come back to you with ringing victory   now see i personally present to you   my son and my successor ere i go      he takes the child in his arms and carries him round to the     officers severally  they are much affected and raise loud     cheers    you stand by him and her  you swear as much     officers    we do     napoleon         this you repeatyou promise it     officers    we promise  may the dynasty live for ever      their shouts which spread to the carrousel without are echoed     by the soldiers of the guard assembled there the empress is now     in tears and the emperor supports her     marie louise    such whole enthusiasm i have never known   not even from the landwehr of vienna      amid repeated protestations and farewells napoleon the empress     the king of rome madame de montesquiou etc go out in one     direction and the officers of the national guard in another      the curtain falls for an interval      when it rises again the apartment is in darkness and its atmosphere     chilly  the january nightwind howls without  two servants enter     hastily and light candles and a fire  the hands of the clock are     pointing to three      the room is hardly in order when the emperor enters equipped for     the intended journey and with him his left arm being round her     waist walks marie louise in a dressinggown  on his right arm     he carries the king of rome and in his hand a bundle of papers     count bertrand and a few members of the household follow      reaching the middle of the room he kisses the child and embraces     the empress who is tearful the child weeping likewise  napoleon     takes the papers to the fire thrusts them in and watches them     consume then burns other bundles brought by his attendants     napoleon gloomily    better to treat them thus since no one knows   what comes or into whose hands he may fall     marie louise    i have an apprehensionunexplained   that i shall never see you any more     napoleon    dismiss such fears  you may as well as not   as things are doomed to be they will be dear   if shadows must come let them come as though   the sun were due and you were trusting to it   twill teach the world it wrongs in bringing them      they embrace finally  exeunt napoleon etc  afterwards marie     louise and the child     spirit of the years         her instinct forwardly is keen in cast        and yet how limited  true it may be        they never more will meet althoughto use        the bounded prophecy i am dowered with        the screen that will maintain their severance        would pass her own believing proving it        no gaolgrille no scath of scorching war        but this persuasion pressing on her pulse        to breed aloofness and a mind averse        until his image in her soul will shape        dwarfed as a far colossus on a plain        or figurehead that smalls upon the main      the lights are extinguished and the hall is left in darkness      scene iii    the same  the apartments of the empress      a march morning verging on seven oclock throws its cheerless     stare into the private drawingroom of marie louise animating     the gilt furniture to only a feeble shine two chamberlains of     the palace are there in waiting  they look from the windows and     yawn     first chamberlain    heres a watering for spring hopes  who would have supposed when   the emperor left and appointed her regent that she and the regency   too would have to scurry after in so short a time     second chamberlain    was a course decided on last night     first chamberlain    yes  the privy council sat till long past midnight debating the   burning question whether she and the child should remain or not   some were one way some the other  she settled the matter by saying   she would go     second chamberlain    i thought it might come to that  i heard the alarm beating all night   to assemble the national guard and i am told that some volunteers   have marched out to support marmot  but they are a mere handful   what can they do      a clatter of wheels and a champing and prancing of horses is     heard outside the palace  meneval enters and divers officers     of the household  then from her bedroom at the other end marie     louise in a travelling dress and hat leading the king of rome     attired for travel likewise  she looks distracted and pale     next come the duchess of montebello lady of honour the countess     de montesquiou ladies of the palace and others all in travelling     trim     king of rome plaintively    why are we doing these strange things mamma   and what did we get up so early for     marie louise    i cannot dear explain  so many events   enlarge and make so many hours of one   that it would be too hard to tell them now     king of rome    but you know why we a setting out like this   is it because we fear our enemies     marie louise    we are not sure that we are going yet   i may be needful but dont ask me here   some time i will tell you      she sits down irresolutely and bestows recognitions on the     assembled officials with a preoccupied air     king of rome in a murmur              i like being here best   and i dont want to go i know not where     marie louise    run dear to mamma quiou and talk to her                  he goes across to madame de montesquiou   i hear that women of the royalist hope                             to the duchess of montebello   have bent them busy in their private rooms   with working white cockades these several days   yesi must go     duchess of montebello              but why yet empress dear   we may soon gain good news some messenger   hie from the emperor or king joseph hither     marie louise    king joseph i await  hes gone to eye   the outposts with the ministers of war   to learn the scope and nearness of the allies

marmont and mortier are repulsed   and that has come whose hazard he foresaw   all is arranged the treasure is awheel   and papers seals and cyphers packed therewith     officers dubiously    yet to leave paris is to court disaster     marie louise with petulance    i shall do what i say i dont know what   what shall i do      she bursts into tears and rushes into her bedroom followed by     the

have flowed forth   they feel their own bereavements so their mood   asked no deep reasoning for its geniture     napoleon    i have no remarks to make on that just now   ill think the matter over  you shall know   by noon tomorrow my definitive     ney turning to go    i trust my saying what had to be said   has not affronted you     napoleon bitterly              no but your haste   in doing it has galled me and has shown me   a heart that heaves no longer in my cause   the skilled coquetting of the government   has nearly won you from old fellowship   well till tomorrow marshal then adieu      ney goes  enter caulaincourt and macdonald    ney has got here before you and i deem   has truly told me all     caulaincourt              we thought at first   we should have had success  but fate said no   and abdication making no reserves   is sire we are convinced with all respect   the only road if you care not to risk   the empress loss of every dignity   and magnified misfortunes thrown on france     napoleon    i have heard it all and dont agree with you   my assets are not quite so beggarly   that i must close in such a shameful bond   whatdo you rate as naught that i am yet   full fifty thousand strong with augereau   and soult and suchet true and many more   i still may know to play the imperial game   as well as alexander and his friends   soyou will see  where are my mapseh where   ill trace campaigns to come  wheres my paper ink   to schedule all my generals and my means     caulaincourt    sire you have not the generals you suppose     macdonald    and if you had the mere anatomy   of a real army sire thats left to you   must yield the war  a bad example tells     napoleon    ahfrom your manner it is worse i see   than i cognize o marmont marmontyours   yours was the bad sad leadi treated him   as if he were a sondefended him   made him a marshal out of sheer affection   built as twere rock on his fidelity   forsake who may i said i still have him   child that i was i looked for faith in friends    then be it as you will  neys manner shows   that even he inclines to bourbonry   i faint to leave france thuscurtailed pared down   from her late spacious borders  of the whole   this is the keenest sword that pierces me   but alls too late my course is closed i see   ill do itnow  call in bertrand and ney   let them be witness to my finishing      in much agitation he goes to the writingtable and begins drawing     up a paper  bertrand and ney enter and behind them are seen     through the doorway the faces of constant the valet roustan the     mameluke and other servants  all wait in silence till the emperor     has done writing  he turns in his seat without looking up     napoleon reading    it having been declared by the allies   that the prime obstacle to europes peace   is frances empery by napoleon   this ruler faithful to his oath of old   renounces for himself and for his heirs   the throne of france and that of italy   because no sacrifice even of his life   is he averse to make for frances gain   and hereto do i sign  he turns to the table and signs      the marshals moved rush forward and seize his hand              mark marshals here   it is a conquering foe i covenant with   and not the traitors at the tuileries   who call themselves the government of france   caulaincourt go to paris as before   ney and macdonald too and hand in this   to alexander and to him alone      he gives the document and bids them adieu almost without speech     the marshals and others go out  napoleon continues sitting with     his chin on his chest      an interval of silence  there is then heard in the corridor a     sound of whetting  enter roustan the mameluke with a whetstone     in his belt and a sword in his hand     roustan    after this fall your majesty tis plain   you will not choose to live and knowing this   i bring to you my sword     napoleon with a nod         i see you do roustan     roustan              will you sire use it on yourself   or shall i pass it through you     napoleon coldly              neither plan   is quite expedient for the moment man     roustan    neither     napoleon              there may be in some suited time   some cleaner means of carrying out such work     roustan    sire you refuse  can you support vile life   a moment on such terms  why then i pray   dispatch me with the weapon or dismiss me   he holds the sword to napoleon who shakes his head   i live no longer under such disgrace      exit roustan haughtily  napoleon vents a sardonic laugh and     throws himself on a sofa where he by and by falls asleep  the     door is softly opened  roustan and constant peep in     constant    tonight would be as good a time to go as any  he will sleep there   for hours  i have my few francs safe and i deserve them for i have   stuck to him honourably through fourteen trying years     roustan    how many francs have you secured     constant    wellmore than you can count in one breath or even two     roustan    where     constant    in a hollow tree in the forest  and as for your reward you can   easily get the keys of that cabinet where there are more than   enough francs to equal mine  he will not have them and you may   as well take them as strangers     roustan    it is not money that i want but honour  i leave because i can   no longer stay with selfrespect     constant    and i because there is no other such valet in the temperate zone   and it is for the good of society that i should not be wasted here     roustan    well as you propose going this evening i will go with you to lend   a symmetry to the drama of our departure  would that i had served   a more sensitive master  he sleeps there quite indifferent to the   dishonour of remaining alive      napoleon shows signs of waking  constant and roustan disappear     napoleon slowly sits up     napoleon    here the scene lingers still  here linger i   things could not have gone on as they were going   i am amazed they kept their course so long   but long or short they have ended nowat last   footsteps are heard passing through the court without   hark at them leaving me  so politic rats   desert the ship thats doomed  by morrowdawn   i shall not have a man to shake my bed   or say goodmorning to     spirit of the years                   herein behold        how heavily grinds the will upon his brain        his halting hand and his unlighted eye     spirit ironic         a picture this for kings and subjects too     spirit of the pities         yet is it but napoleon who has failed        the pale pathetic peoples still plod on        through hoodwinkings to light     napoleon rousing himself              this now must close   roustan misunderstood me though his hint   serves as a fillip to a flaccid brain   how gild the sunset sky of majesty   better than by the act esteemed of yore   plutarchian heroes outstayed not their fame   and what nor brutus nor themistocles   nor cato nor mark antony survived   why why should i  sage canabis you primed me      he unlocks a case takes out a little bag containing a phial pours     from it a liquid into a glass and drinks  he then lies down and     falls asleep again      reenter constant softly with a bunch of keys in his hand  on     his way to the cabinet he turns and looks at napoleon  seeing     the glass and a strangeness in the emperor he abandons his     object rushes out and is heard calling      enter maret and bertrand     bertrand shaking the emperor    what is the matter sire  whats this youve done     napoleon with difficulty    why did you interferebut it is well   call caulaincourt  id speak with him a trice   before i pass      maret hurries out  enter ivan the physician and presently     caulaincourt              ivan renew this dose   tis a slow workman and requires a fellow   age has impaired its early promptitude      ivan shakes his head and rushes away distracted  caulaincourt     seizes napoleons hand     caulaincourt    why should you bring this cloud upon us now     napoleon    restrain your feelings  let me die in peace   my wife and son i recommend to you   give her this letter and the packet there   defend my memory and protect their lives                          they shake him  he vomits     caulaincourt    hes savedfor good or illas may betide     napoleon    godhere how difficult it is to die   how easy on the passionate battleplain      they open a window and carry him to it  he mends    fate has resolved what man could not resolve   i must live on and wait what heaven may send      macdonald and other marshals reenter  a letter is brought from     marie louise  napoleon reads it and becomes more animated    they are well and they will join me in my exile   yes i will live  the future who shall spell   my wife my son will be enough for me   and i will give my hours to chronicling   in stately words that stir futurity   the might of our unmatched accomplishments   and in the tale immortalize your names   by linking them with mine      he soon falls into a convalescent sleep  the marshals etc go     out  the room is left in darkness      scene v    bayonne  the british camp      the foreground is an elevated stretch of land dotted over in rows     with the tents of the peninsular army  on a parade immediately     beyond the tents the infantry are drawn up awaiting something     still farther back behind a brook are the french soldiery also     ranked in the same manner of reposeful expectation  in the middle     distance we see the town of bayonne standing within its zigzag     fortifications at the junction of the river adour with the nive      on the other side of the adour rises the citadel a fortified     angular structure standing detached  a large and brilliant     tricolor flag is waving indolently from a staff on the summit     the bay of biscay into which the adour flows is seen on the     left horizon as a level line      the stillness observed by the soldiery of both armies and by     everything else in the scene except the flag is at last broken     by the firing of a signalgun from a battery in the townwall     the eyes of the thousands present rivet themselves on the citadel     its waving tricolor moves down the flagstaff and disappears     the regiments unconsciously    haaaa      in a few seconds there shoots up the same staff another flagone     intended to be white but having apparently been folded away a long     time it is mildewed and dingy      from all the guns on the city fortifications a salute peals out     this is responded to by the english infantry and artillery with a     feudejoie     the regiments    hurrahhhh      the various battalions are then marched away in their respective     directions and dismissed to their tents  the bourbon standard is     hoisted everywhere beside those of england spain and portugal     the scene shuts      scene vi    a highway in the outskirts of avignon      the rhone the old city walls the rocher des doms and its     edifices appear at the back plane of the scene under the     grey light of dawn  in the foreground several postillions     and ostlers with relays of horses are waiting by the roadside     gazing northward and listening for sounds  a few loungers     have assembled     first postillion    he ought to be nigh by this time  i should say hed be very glad   to get this here isle of elba wherever it may be if words be true   that hes treated to such ghastly compliments ons way     second postillion    blastmeblue i dont care what happens to him  look at joachim   murat him thats made king of naples a man who was only in the   same line of life as ourselves born and bred in cahors out in   perigord a poor little whindling place not half as good as our   own  why should he have been lifted up to kings anointment and   we not even have had a rise in wages  thats what i say     first postillion    but now i dont find fault with that dispensation in particular   it was one of our calling that the emperor so honoured after all   when he might have anointed a tinker or a ragman or a street   womans pensioner even  who knows but that we should have been   kings too but for my crooked legs and your running polewound     second postillion    we kings  kings of the underground country then by this time if   we hadnt been too rottenfleshed to follow the drum  however ill   think over your defence and i dont mind riding a stage with him   for that matter to save him from them that mean mischief here   ive lost no sons by his battles like some others we know      enter a traveller on horseback    any tidings along the road sir of the emperor napoleon that was     traveller    tidings verily  he and his escort are threatened by the mob at   every place they come to  a returning courier i have met tells me   that at an inn a little way beyond here they have strung up his   effigy to the signpost smeared it with blood and placarded it   the doom that awaits thee  he is much delayed by such humorous   insults  i have hastened ahead to escape the uproar     second postillion    i dont know that you have escaped it  the mob has been waiting   up all night for him here     marketwoman coming up    i hope by the virgin as a called herself that therell be no   riots here  though i have not much pity for a man who could treat   his wife as he did and thats my real feeling  he might at least   have kept them both on for half a husband is better than none for   poor women  but id show mercy to him thats true rather than   have my stall upset and messes in the streets wi folks brains   and stabbings and i dont know what all     first postillion    if we can do the horsing quietly out here there will be none of   that  hell dash past the town without stopping at the inn where   they expect to waylay himhark whats this coming      an approaching cortege is heard  two couriers enter then a     carriage with napoleon and bertrand then others with the     commissioners of the powersall on the way to elba      the carriages halt and the change of horses is set about instantly     but before it is half completed bonapartes arrival gets known and     throngs of men and women armed with sticks and hammers rush out of     avignon and surround the carriages     populace    ogre of corsica  odious tyrant  down with nicholas     bertrand looking out of carriage    silence and doff your hats you illmannered devils     populace scornfully    listen to him  is that the corsican  no where is he give him up   give him up  well pitch him into the rhone      some cling to the wheels of napoleons carriage while others     more distant throw stones at it  a stone breaks the carriage     window     old woman shaking her fist    give me back my two sons murderer  give me back my children whose   flesh is rotting on the russian plains     populace    ay give us back our kinour fathers our brothers our sons   victims to your curst ambition      one of the mob seizes the carriage doorhandle and tries to     unfasten it  a valet of bonapartes seated on the box draws his     sword and threatens to cut the mans arm off  the doors of the     commissioners coaches open and sir neil campbell general     koller and count schuvaloffthe english austrian and russian     commissionersjump out and come forward     campbell    keep order citizens do you not know   that the exemperor is wayfaring   to a lone isle in the allies sworn care   who have given a pledge to europe for his safety   his fangs being drawn he is left powerless now   to do you further harm     schuvaloff              people of france   can you insult so miserable a being   he who gave laws to a cowed world stands now   at that worlds beck and asks its charity   cannot you see that merely to ignore him   is the worst ignominy to tar him with   by showing him hes no longer dangerous     old woman    how do we know the villain maynt come back   while there is life my faith theres mischief in him      enter an officer with the townguard     officer    citizens i am a zealot for the bourbons   as you well know  but wanton breach of faith   i will not brook  retire      the soldiers drive back the mob and open a passage forward  the     commissioners reenter their carriages  napoleon puts his head     out of his window for a moment  he is haggard shabbily dressed     yellowfaced and wildeyed     napoleon              i thank you captain   also your soldiery a thousand thanks   to bertrand within my god these people of avignon here   are headstrong fools like all the provencal fold   i wont go through the town     bertrand              well round it sire   and then as soon as we get past the place   you must disguise for the remainder miles     napoleon    ill mount the white cockade if they invite me   what does it matter if i do or dont   in europe all is past and over with me   yesall is lost in europe for me now     bertrand    i fear so sire     napoleon after some moments              but asia waits a man   andwho can tell     officer of guard to postillions              ahead now at full speed   and slacken not till you have slipped the town      the postillions urge the horses to a gallop and the carriages     are out of sight in a few seconds  the scene shuts      scene vii    malmaison  the empress josephines bedchamber      the walls are in white panels with gilt mouldings and the     furniture is upholstered in white silk with needleworked flowers     the long windows and the bed are similarly draped and the toilet     service is of gold  through the panes appears a broad flat lawn     adorned with vases and figures on pedestals and entirely     surrounded by treesjust now in their first fresh green under     the morning rays of whitsunday  the notes of an organ are audible     from a chapel below where the pentecostal mass is proceeding      josephine lies in the bed in an advanced stage of illness the     abbe bertrand standing beside her  two ladiesinwaiting are     seated near  by the door into the anteroom which is ajar     horeau the physicianinordinary and bourdois the consulting     physician are engaged in a low conversation     horeau    lamoureux says that leeches would have saved her   had they been used in time before i came   in that case then why did he wait for me     bourdois    such whys are now too late  she is past all hope   i doubt if aught had helped her  not disease   but heartbreak and repinings are the blasts   that wither her long bloom  soon we must tell   the queen hortense the worst and the viceroy     horeau    her death was made the easier task for grief   as i regarded more than probable   by her rash rising from a soresick bed   and donning thin and dainty may attire   to hail king frederickwilliam and the tsar   as banquetguests in the old regnant style   a womans innocent vanitybut how dire   she argued that amenities of state   compelled the effort since they had honoured her   by offering to come  i stood against it   pleaded and reasoned but to no account   poor woman what she did or did not do   was of small moment to the state by then   the emperor alexander has been kind   throughout his stay in paris  he came down   but yestereve of purpose to inquire     bourdois    wellington is in paris too i learn   after his wasted battle at toulouse     horeau    has his peninsular army come with him     bourdois    i hear they have shipped it to america   where england has another war on hand   we have armies quite sufficient here already   plenty of cooks for paris broth just now   come call we queen hortense and prince eugene      exeunt physicians  the abbe bertrand also goes out  josephine      murmurs faintly     first lady going to the bedside    i think i heard you speak your majesty     josephine    i asked what hour it wasif dawn or eve     first lady    ten in the morning madame  you forget   you asked the same but a brief while ago     josephine    did i  i thought it was so long ago   i wish to go to elba with him so much   but the allies prevented me  and why   i would not have disgraced him or themselves   i would have gone to him at fontainebleau   with my eight horses and my household train   in dignity and quitted him no more   although i am his wife no longer now   i think i should have gone in spite of them   had i not feared perversions might be sown   between him and the woman of his choice   for whom he sacrificed me     second lady              it is more   than she thought fit to do your majesty     josephine    perhaps she was influenced by her fathers ire   or diplomatic reasons told against her   and yet i was surprised she should allow   aught secondary on earth to hold her from   a husband she has outwardly at least   declared attachment to     first lady              especially   with ever one at handhis son and hers   reminding her of him     josephine              yes glad am i   i saw that child of theirs though only once   butthere was not full truthnot quite i fear   in what i told the emperor that day   he led him to me at bagatelle   that twas the happiest moment of my life   i ought not to have said it  no  forsooth   my feeling had too too much gall in it   to let truth shape like thati also said   that when my arms were round him i forgot   that i was not his mother  so spoke i   but oh mei remembered it too well   he was a lovely child in his fond prate   his fathers voice was eloquent  one might say   i am well punished for my sins against him     second lady    you have harmed no creature madame much less him     josephine    o but you dont quite know my coquetries   in our first married years nigh racked him through   i cannot think how i could wax so wicked   he begged me come to him in italy   but i liked flirting in fair paris best   and would not go  the independent spouse   at that time was myself but afterwards   i grew to be the captive he the free   always tis so the man wins finally   my faults ive ransomed to the bottom sou   if ever a woman did ill write to him   i mustagain so that he understands   yes ill write now  get me a pen and paper     first lady to second lady    tis futile  she is too far gone to write   but we must humour her      they fetch writing materials  on returning to the bed they find      her motionless  enter eugene and queen hortense  seeing the state      their mother is in they fall down on their knees by her bed      josephine recognizes them and smiles  anon she is able to speak      again     josephine faintly              i am dying dears   and do not mind itnotwithstanding that   i feel i die regretted  you both love me   and as for france i ever have desired   her welfare as you knowhave wrought all things   a womans scope could reach to forward it   and to you now who watch my ebbing here   declare i that napoleons firstchose wife   has never caused her land a needless tear   tell himthese things i have saidbear him my love   tell himi could not write      an interval  she spasmodically flings her arms over her son and     daughter lets them fall and becomes unconscious  they fetch a     lookingglass and find that her breathing has ceased  the clock     of the chateau strikes noon  the scene is veiled      scene viii    london the opera house      the house is lighted up with a blaze of wax candles and a state     performance is about to begin in honour of the allied sovereigns     now on a visit to england to celebrate the peace  peacedevices     adorn the theatre  a band can be heard in the street playing     the white cockade      an extended royal box has been formed by removing the partitions     of adjoining boxes  it is empty as yet but the other parts of     the house are crowded to excess and somewhat disorderly the     interior doors having been broken down by besiegers and many     people having obtained admission without payment  the prevalent     costume of the ladies is white satin and diamonds with a few in     lilac      the curtain rises on the first act of the opera of aristodemo     madame grassini and signor tramezzini being the leading voices     scarcely a note of the performance can be heard amid the exclamations     of persons half suffocated by the pressure      at the end of the first act there follows a divertissement  the     curtain having fallen a silence of expectation succeeds  it is     a little past ten oclock      enter the royal box the prince regent accompanied by the emperor     of russia demonstrative in manner now as always the king of     prussia with his mien of reserve and many minor royal personages     of europe  there are moderate acclamations  at their back and in     neighbouring boxes lord liverpool lord castlereagh officers in     the suite of the sovereigns interpreters and others take their     places      the curtain rises again and the performers are discovered drawn     up in line on the stage  they sing god save the king  the     sovereigns stand up bow and resume their seats amid more     applause     a voice from the gallery    prinny wheres your wife  confusion     emperor of russia to regent    to which of us is the inquiry addressed prince     prince regent    to you sire depend upontby way of compliment      the second act of the opera proceeds     emperor of russia    any later news from elba sir     prince regent    nothing more than rumours which pon my honour i can hardly   credit  one is that bonapartes valet has written to say the   exemperor is becoming imbecile and is an object of ridicule to   the inhabitants of the island     king of prussia    a blessed result sir if true  if he is not imbecile he is worse   planning how to involve europe in another way  it was a short   sighted policy to offer him a home so near as to ensure its becoming   a hotbed of intrigue and conspiracy in no long time     prince regent    the exempress marielouise hasnt joined him after all i learn   has she remained at schonbrunn since leaving france sires     emperor of russia    yes sir with her son  she must never go back to france  metternich   and her father will know better than let her do that  poor young   thing i am sorry for her all the same  she would have joined   napoleon if she had been left to herselfand i was sorry for the   other wife too  i called at malmaison a few days before she died   a charming woman  she would have gone to elba or to the devil with   him  twenty thousand people crowded down from paris to see her lying   in state last week     prince regent    pity she didnt have a child by him by god     king of prussia    i dont think the other ones child is going to trouble us much   but i wish bonaparte himself had been sent farther away     prince regent    some of our government wanted to pack him off to st helenaan   island somewhere in the atlantic or pacific or great south sea   but they were overruled  twould have been a surer game     emperor of russia    one hears strange stories of his saying and doings  some of my   people were telling me today that he says it is to austria that   he really owes his fall and that he ought to have destroyed her   when he had her in his power     prince regent    dammy sire dont ye think he owes his fall to his ambition to   humble england by rupture of the peace of amiens and trying to   invade us and wasting his strength against us in the peninsula     emperor of russia    i incline to think with the greatest deference that it was moscow   that broke him     king of prussia    the rejection of my conditions in the terms of peace at prague sires   was the turningpoint towards his downfall      enter a box on the opposite side of the house the princess of     wales attended by lady charlotte campbell sir w gell and     others  louder applause now rings through the theatre drowning     the sweet voice of the grassini in aristodemo     lady charlotte campbell    it is meant for your royal highness     princess of wales    i dont think so my dear  punchs wife is nobody when punch himself   is present     lady charlotte campbell    i feel convinced that it is by their looking this way     sir w gell    surely maam you will acknowledge their affection  otherwise we may   be hissed     princess of wales    i know my business better than to take that morsel out of my husbands   mouth  thereyou see he enjoys it  i cannot

enclosed on three sides     by mountains  the port lies towards the western righthand horn     of the concave behind it being the buildings of the town their     long white walls and rows of windows rise tier above tier on the     steep incline at the back and are intersected by narrow alleys     and flights of steps that lead up to forts on the summit      upon a rock between two of these forts stands the palace of the     mulini napoleonss residence in ferrajo  its windows command     the whole town and the port     chorus of ironic spirits aerial music         the congress of vienna sits

fought before         in paris there is discontent        medals are wrought that represent        one now unnamed  men whisper he        who once has been again will be     dumb show    under cover

a body of grenadiers of the old guard  the   faces of drouot and cambronne are revealed by the occasional fleck of   a lantern to be in command of them  they are quietly taken aboard   the brig and a number of men of different arms to the other vessels     chorus of rumours aerial music         napoleon is going        and nought will prevent him        he snatches the moment        occasion has lent him         and what is he going for        worn with wars labours        to reconquer europe        with seven hundred sabres     about eight oclock we observe that the windows of the palace of   the mulini are lighted and open and that two women sit at them   the emperors mother and the princess pauline  they wave adieux   to some one below and in a short time a little open lowwheeled   carriage drawn by the princess paulines two ponies descends   from the house to the port  the crowd exclaims the emperor   napoleon appears in his grey greatcoat and is much fatter than   when he left france  bertrand sits beside him    he quickly alights and enters the waiting boat  it is a tense   moment  as the boat rows off the sailors sing the marseillaise   and the gathered inhabitants join in  when the boat reaches the   brig its sailors join in also and shout paris or death  yet   the singing has a melancholy cadence  a gun fires as a signal   of departure  the night is warm and balmy for the season  not   a breeze is there to stir a sail and the ships are motionless     chorus of rumours         haste is salvation        and still he stays waiting        the calm plays the tyrant

napoleon remains silent on the   deck looking at the town lights whose reflections bore like augers   into the water of the bay  the sails hang flaccidly  then a feeble   breeze then a strong south wind begins to belly the sails and the   vessels move     chorus of rumours         the south wind the south wind        the south wind will save him        embaying the frigate        whose speed

vienna  the imperial palace      the forepart of the scene is the interior of a dimly lit gallery     with an openwork screen or grille on one side of it that commands     a birdseye view of the grand saloon below  at present the screen     is curtained  sounds of music and applause in the saloon ascend     into the gallery and an irradiation from the same quarter shines     up through chinks in the curtains of the grille      enter the gallery marie louise and the countess of brignole     followed by the count neipperg a handsome man of forty two with     a bandage over one eye     countess of brignole    listen your majesty  you gather all   as well as if you moved amid them there   and are advantaged with free scope to flit   the moment the scene palls     marie louise              ah my dear friend   to put it so is flowersweet of you   but a fallen empress doomed to furtive peeps   at scenes her open presence would unhinge   reads not much interest in them  yet in truth   twas gracious of my father to arrange   this glimpsehole for my curiosity   but i must write a letter ere i look   you can amuse yourself with watching them   count bring me pen and paper  i am told   madame de montesquiou has been distressed   by some alarm i write to ask its shape      neipperg spreads writing materials on a table and marie louise     sits  while she writes he stays near her  madame de brignole     goes to the screen and parts the curtains      the light of a thousand candles blazes up into her eyes from     below  the great hall is decorated in white and silver enriched     by evergreens and flowers  at the end a stage is arranged and     tableaux vivants are in progress thereon representing the history     of the house of austria in which figure the most charming women     of the court      there are present as spectators nearly all the notables who have     assembled for the congress including the emperor of austria     himself has gay wife who quite eclipses

heed from them and all   turn murmuring together     marie louise         what may be      she rises with languid curiosity and count neipperg adroitly     takes her hand and leads her forward  all three look down through     the grille     neipperg    some strange news certainly your majesty   is being discussedill run down and inquire     marie louise playfully    naystay here  we shall learn

concerned              yes so it seems   they are thunderstruck  see though the music beats   the ladies of the tableau leave their place   and mingle with the rest and quite forget   that they are in masquerade  the sovereigns show   by far the gravest mien i wonder now   if it has aught to do with me or mine   disasters mostly have to do with me     countess of brignole    those rude diplomists from england there   at your imperial fathers consternation   and russias and the king of prussias gloom   shake shoulders with hid laughter  that they call   the english sense of humour i infer   to see a jest in other peoples troubles     marie louise hiding her presages    they ever take things thus phlegmatically   the safe sea minimizes continental scare   in their regard  i wish it did in mine   but wellington laughs not as i discern     neipperg    perhaps though fun for the other english here   it means new work for him  ahnotice now   the music makes no more pretence to play   sovereigns and ministers have moved apart   and talk and leave the ladies quite aloof   even the grand duchesses and empress all   such mighty cogitations trance their minds     marie louise with more anxiety    poor ladies yea they draw into the rear   and whisper ominous words among themselves   count neippergi must ask you nowgo glean   what evil lowers  i am riddled through   with strange surmises and more strange alarms      the countess of montesquiou enters    ahwe shall learn it now  wellwhat madame     countess of montesquiou breathlessly    your majesty the emperor napoleon   has vanished from elba  wither flown   and how and why nobody says or knows     marie louise sinking into a chair    my divination pencilled on my brain   something not unlike that  the rigid mien   that mastered wellington suggested it   complicity will be ascribed to me   unwitting though i stand a pause             hell not succeed   and my fair plans for parma will be marred   and my sons future fouledi must go hence   and instantly declare to metternich   that i know nought of this and in his hands   place me unquestioningly with dumb assent   to serve the allies methinks that i was born

millions for his purse     another voice              the immediate cause   must be a negligence in watching him   the british colonel campbell should have seen   that apertures for flight were wired

outside the village of la mure is discovered  a battalion of     the fifth french royalist regiment of the line under commandant     lessard is drawn up in the middle of the road with a company of     sappers and miners comprising altogether about eight hundred men      enter to them from the south a small detachment of lancers with     an aidedecamp at their head  they ride up to within speaking

rebel bands the government forbids   come five steps further and we fire     aide              to france   and to posterity through fineless time   must you then answer for so foul a blow   against the common weal      napoleons aidedecamp and the lancers turn about and ride     back out of sight  the royalist troops wait  presently there     reappears from the same direction a small column of soldiery     representing the whole of napoleons little army shipped from     elba  it is divided into an advanceguard under colonel mallet     and two bodies behind a troop of polish lancers under colonel     jermanwski on the right side of the road and some officers     without troops on the left under major pacconi      napoleon rides in the midst of the advanceguard in the old     familiar redingote grise cocked hat and tricolor cockade     his wellknown profile keen against the hills  he is attended     by generals bertrand drouot and cambronne  when they get within     gunshot of the royalists the men are halted  napoleon dismounts     and steps forward     napoleon              direct the men   to lodge their weapons underneath the arm   points downward  i shall not require them

thought it out my friend   and value not my life as in itself   but as to france severed from whose embrace   i am dead already      he repeats the order which is carried out  there is a breathless     silence and people from the village gather round with tragic     expectations  napoleon walks on alone towards the fifth battalion     throwing open his greatcoat and revealing his uniform and the     ribbon of the legion of honour  raising his hand to his hat he     salutes     lessard         present arms      the firelocks of the royalist battalion are levelled at napoleon     napoleon still

ye   the emperor for ever  ha  huzza      they throw their arms upon the ground and rushing forward     sink down and seize napoleons knees and kiss his hands  those     who cannot get near him wave their shakos and acclaim him     passionately  bertrand drouot and cambronne come up     napoleon privately    all is accomplished bertrand  ten days more   and we are snug within the tuileries      the soldiers tear out their white cockades and trample on them     and disinter from the bottom of their knapsacks tricolors which     they set up      napoleons own men now arrive and fraternize with and embrace     the soldiers of the fifth  when the emotion has subsided     napoleon forms the whole body into a square and addresses them    soldiers i came with these few faithful ones   to save you from the bourbonstreasons tricks   ancient abuses feudal tyranny   from which i once of old delivered you   the bourbon throne is illegitimate   because not founded on the nations will   but propped up for the profit of a few   comrades is this not so     a grenadier              yes verily sire   you are the angel of the lord to us   well march with you to death or victory  shouts      at this moment a howling dog crosses in front of them with a     cockade tied to its tail  the soldiery of both sides laugh     loudly      napoleon forms both bodies of troops into one column

prince     metternich taking out a paper    the powers assembled at the congress here   owe it to their own troths and dignities   and to the furtherance of social order   to make a solemn declaration thus   by breaking the convention as to elba   napoleon bonaparte forthwith destroys   his only legal title to exist   and as a consequence has hurled himself   beyond the pale of civil intercourse   disturber of the tranquillity of the world   there can be neither peace nor truce with him   and public vengeance is his selfsought doom   signed by the plenipotentiaries     marie louise pale

the vaults of time    now what we notice front and foremost is   that this convulsion speaks not pictures not   the heart of france  it comes of artifice   from the unique and sinister influence   of a smart armygamesterupon men   who have shared his own excitements spoils and crimes   this man who calls himself most impiously   the emperor of france by grace of god   has in the scale of human character   dropt down so low that he has set at nought   all pledges stipulations guarantees   and stepped upon the only pedestal   on which he cares to standhis lawless will   indeed it is a fact scarce credible   that so mysteriously in his own breast   did this adventurer lock the scheme he planned   that his companion bertrand chief in trust   was unapprised thereof until the hour   in which the order to embark was given    i think the house will readily discern   that the wise wary trackway to be trod   by our own country in the crisis reached   must lie twixt two alternativesof war   in concert with the continental powers   or of an armed and cautionary course   sufficing for the present phase of things    whatever differences of view prevail   on the so serious and impending question   whether in point of prudent reckoning   twere better let the power set up exist   or promptly at the outset deal with it   still to all eyes it is imperative   that some mode of safeguardance be devised   and if i cannot range before the house   at this stage all the reachings of the case   i will if needful on some future day   poise these nice matters on their merits here    meanwhile i have to move   that an address unto his royal highness   be humbly offered for his gracious message   and to assure him that his faithful commons   are fully roused to the dark hazardries   to which the life and equanimity   of europe are exposed by deeds in france   in contravention of the plighted pacts   at paris in the course of yesteryear    that in a cause of such widewaked concern   it doth afford us real relief to know   that concert with his majestys allies   is being effected with no loss of time   such concert as will thoroughly provide   for europes full and long security  cheers    that we with zeal will speed such help to him   so to augment his force by sea and land   as shall empower him to set afoot   swift measures meet for its accomplishing  cheers     burdett    it seems to me almost impossible   weighing the language of the noble lord   to catch its counselwhether peace of war  hear hear   if i translate his words to signify   the high expediency of watch and ward   that we may not be taken unawares   i own concurrence but if he propose   too plunge this realm into a sea of blood   to reinstate the bourbon line in france   i should but poorly do my duty here   did i not lift my voice protestingly   against so ruinous an enterprise    sir i am old enough to call to mind   the first fierce frenzies for the selfsame end   the fruit of which was to endow this man   the object of your apprehension now   with such a might as could not be withstood   by all of banded europe till he roamed   and wrecked it wantonly on russian plains   shall then another score of scourging years   distract this land to make a bourbon king   wrongly has bonapartes late course been called   a rude incursion on the soil of france   who ever knew a sole and single man   invade a nation thirty million strong   and gain in some few days full sovereignty   against the nations willthe truth is this   the nation longed for him and has obtained him    i have beheld the agonies of war   through many a weary season seen enough   to make me hold that scarcely any goal   is worth the reaching by so red a road   no man can doubt that this napoleon stands   as emperor of france by frenchmens wills   let the french settle then their own affairs   i say we shall have nought to apprehend    much as i might advance in proof of this   ill dwell not thereon now  i am satisfied   to give the general reasons which in brief   balk my concurrence in the address proposed  cheers     ponsonby    my words will be but few for the address   constrains me to support it as it stands   so far from being the primary step to war   its sense and substance is in my regard   to leave the house to guidance by events   on the grave question of hostilities    the statements of the noble lord i hold   have not been candidly interpreted   by grafting on to them a headstrong will   as does the honourable baronet   to rob the french of buonapartes rule   and force them back to bourbon monarchism   that our free land at this abnormal time   should put her in a pose of wariness   no unwarped mind can doubt  must war revive   let it be quickly waged and quickly too   reach its effective end though tis my hope   my ardent hope that peace may be preserved     whitbread    were it that i could think as does my friend   that ambiguity of sentiment   informed the utterance of the noble lord   as oft does ambiguity of word   i might with satisfied and sure resolve   vote straight for the address  but eyeing well   the flimsy web there woven to entrap   the credence of my honourable friends   i must with all my energy contest   the wisdom of a new and hot crusade   for fixing who shall fill the throne of france    already are the seeds of mischief sown   the declaration at vienna signed   against napoleon is in my regard   abhorrent and our countrys character   defaced by our subscription to its terms   if words have any meaning it incites   to sheer assassination it proclaims   that any meeting bonaparte may slay him   and whatso language the allies now hold   in that outburst at least was war declared   the noble lord tonight would second it   would seem to urge that we full arm then wait   for just as long no longer than would serve   the preparations of the other powers   and thenpounce down on france     castlereagh         no no  not so     whitbread    good god then what are we to understand   however this denial is a gain   and my misapprehension owes its birth   entirely to that mystery of phrase   which taints all rhetoric of the noble lord    well what is urged for new aggression now   to vamp up and replace the bourbon line   the wittiest man who ever sat here21 said   that half our nations debt had been incurred   in efforts to suppress the bourbon power   the other half in efforts to restore it laughter   and i must deprecate a further plunge   for ends so futile  why since ministers   craved peace with bonaparte at chatillon   should they refuse him peace and quiet now    this brief amendment therefore i submit   to limit ministers aggressiveness   and make selfsafety all their chartering   we at the same time earnestly implore   that the prince regent graciously induce   strenuous endeavours in the cause of peace   so long as it be done consistently   with the due honour of the english crown  cheers     castlereagh    the arguments of members opposite   posit conditions which experience proves   but figments of a dreamthat honesty   truth and good faith in this same bonaparte   may be assumed and can be acted on   this of one who is loud to violate   bonds the most sacred treaties the most grave    it follows not that since this realm was won   to treat with bonaparte at chatillon   it can treat now  and as for assassination   the sentiments outspoken here tonight   are much more like to urge to desperate deeds   against the persons of our good allies   than are against napoleon statements signed   by the vienna plenipotentiaries    we are in fine too fully warranted   on moral grounds to strike at bonaparte   if we at any crisis reckon it   expedient so to do  the government   will act throughout in concert with the allies   and ministers are well within their rights   to claim that their responsibility   be not disturbed by hackneyed forms of speech oh oh   upon wars horrors and the bliss of peace   which none denies  cheers     ponsonby              i ask the noble lord   if that his meaning and pronouncement be   immediate war     castlereagh         i have not phrased it so     opposition cries    the question is unanswered      there are excited calls and the house divides  the result is     announced as thirtyseven for whitbreads amendment and against     it two hundred and twenty  the clock strikes twelve as the house     adjourns      scene vi    wessex  durnover green casterbridge      on a patch of green grass on durnover hill in the purlieus of

beaumont stands in the centre foreground of a     birdseye prospect across the belgian frontier from the french     side being close to the sambre further back in the scene which     pursues a crinkled course between high banks from maubeuge on the     left to charleroi on the right      in the shadows that muffle all objects innumerable bodies of     infantry and cavalry are discerned bivouacking in and around the     village  this mass of men forms the central column of napoleonss     army      the right column is seen at a distance on that hand also near     the frontier on the road leading towards charleroi and the     left column by solresursambre where the frontier and the river     nearly coincide      the obscurity thins and the june dawn appears     dumb show    the bivouacs of the central column become broken up and a movement   ensues rightwards on charleroi  the twelve regiments of cavalry   which are in advance move off first in half an hour more bodies   move and more in the next halfhour till by eight oclock the   whole central army is gliding on  it defiles in strands by narrow   tracks through the forest  riding impatiently on the outskirts of   the columns is marshal ney who has as yet received no command    as the day develops sight and sounds to the left and right reveal   that the two outside columns have also started and are creeping   towards the frontier abreast with the centre  that the whole forms   one great movement coordinated by one mind now becomes apparent   preceded by scouts the three columns converge    the advance through dense woods by narrow paths takes time  the   head of the middles and main column forces back some outposts and   reaches charleroi driving out the prussian general zieten  it   seizes the bridge over the sambre and blows up the gates of the   town    the point of observation now descends close to the scene    in the midst comes the emperor with the sappers of the guard   the marines and the young guard  the clatter brings the scared   inhabitants to their doors and windows  cheers arise from some   of them as napoleon passes up the steep street  just beyond the   town in front of the bellevue inn he dismounts  a chair is   brought out in which he sits and surveys the whole valley of the   sambre  the troops march past cheering him and drums roll and   bugles blow  soon the emperor is found to be asleep    when the rattle of their passing ceases the silence wakes him  his   listless eye falls upon a halfdefaced poster on a wall opposite   the declaration of the allies     napoleon reading     bonaparte destroys the only legal title on which his existence   depended he has deprived himself of the protection of the law   and has manifested to the universe that there can be neither peace   nor truce with him  the powers consequently declare that napoleon   bonaparte has placed himself without the pale of civil and social   relations and that as an enemy and disturber of the tranquillity   of the world he has rendered himself liable to public vengeance     his flesh quivers and he turns with a start as if fancying that   some one may be about to stab him in the back  then he rises   mounts and rides on    meanwhile the right column crosses the sambre without difficulty   at chatelet a little lower down the left column at marchienne a   little higher up and the three limbs combine into one vast army    as the curtain of the mist is falling the point of vision soars   again and there is afforded a brief glimpse of what is doing far   away on the other side  from all parts of europe long and sinister   black files are crawling hitherward in serpentine lines like   slowworms through grass  they are the advancing armies of the   allies  the dumb show ends      scene ii    a ballroom in brussels22      it is a june midnight at the duke and duchess of richmonds  a     band of stringed instruments shows in the background  the room     is crowded with

having also been danced the hostess calls     up the highland soldiers to show the foreign guests what a scotch     reel is like  the men put their hands on their hips and tread it     out briskly  while they stand aside and rest the hanoverian     dance is called      enter lieutenant webster adc to the prince of orange  the     prince goes apart with him and receives a dispatch  after reading     it he speaks to wellington and the two accompanied by the duke     of richmond retire into an alcove with serious faces  webster     in passing back across the ballroom exchanges a hasty word with     two of three of the guests known to him a young officer among     them and goes out     young officer to partner    the french have passed the sambre at charleroi     partner    whatdoes it mean

prepossessed and goes straight     to wellington and richmond in the alcove who by this time have     been joined by the duke of brunswick     several guests at back of room              yes you see

concern weights those responsible   who gather in the alcove  wellington   affects a cheerfulness in outward port   but cannot rout his real anxiety      the duchess of richmond goes to her husband     duchess    ought i to stop the ball  it hardly seems right to let it continue   if all be true     richmond    i have put that very question to wellington my dear  he says that   we need not hurry off the guests  the men have to assemble some   time before the officers who can stay on here a little longer   without inconvenience and he would prefer that they should not to   create a panic in the city where the friends and spies of napoleon   are all agog for some such thing which they would instantly   communicate to him to take advantage of     duchess    is it safe to stay on  should we not be thinking about getting the   children away     richmond    theres no hurry at all even if bonaparte were really sure to   enter  but hes never going to set foot in brusselsdont you   imagine it for a moment     duchess anxiously    i hope not  but i wish we had never brought them here     richmond    it is too late my dear to wish that now  dont be flurried make   the people go on dancing

fight this very day  rumours allshaped   fly round like cockchafers      suddenly there echoes in the ballroom a longdrawn metallic purl     of sound making all the company start    transcribers note there follows in musical notation five measures        for sidedrum              ahthere it is   just as i thought  they are beating the generale      the loud roll of sidedrums is taken up by other drums further     and further away till the hollow noise spreads all over the city     dismay is written on the faces of the women  the highland non     commissioned officers and privates march

silence is broken     from without by more long hollow rolling notes so near that     they thrill the windowpanes     several    tis the assemble  now then we must go      the officers bid farewell to their partners and begin leaving     in twos and threes  when they are gone the women mope and murmur     to each other by the wall and listen to the tramp of men and     slamming of doors in the

his chief of staff who is sitting     near he dictates to his secretary orders for the morrow  they     are addressed to kellermann drouot lobau gerard and other     of his marshals  soult goes out to dispatch them      the secretary resumes the reading of reports  presently marshal     ney is announced  he is heard stumbling up the stairs and enters     napoleon    ah ney why come you back  have you secured   the allimportant crosswayssafely sconced   yourself at quatrebras     ney              not sire as yet   for marching forwards i heard gunnery boom   and fearing that the prussians had engaged you   i stood at pause  just then     napoleon              my charge was this   make it impossible at any cost   that wellington and blucher should unite   as its from brussels that the english come   and from namur the prussians quatrebras   lends it alone for their forgathering   so why exists it not in your hands     ney    my reason sire was rolling from my tongue   hard on the boom of guns dim files of foot   which read to me like massing englishry   the vanguard of all wellingtons array   i halfdiscerned  so in pure wariness   i left the bachelu columns there at frasnes   and hastened back to tell you     napoleon              ney o ney   i fear you are not the man that once you were   of your so daring such a faintheart now   i have ground to know the foot that flustered you   were but a few stray groups of netherlanders   for my good spies in brussels send me cue   that up to now the english have not stirred   but cloy themselves with nightly revel there     ney bitterly    give me another opportunity   before you speak like that     napoleon              you soon will have one   but nowno more of this  i have other glooms   upon my soulthe muchdisquieting news   that bourmont has deserted to our foes   with his whole staff     ney         we can afford to let him     napoleon    it is what such betokens not their worth   that whets it love respect for me have waned   but i will right that  weve good chances still   you must return foothot to quatrebras   there kellermanns cuirassiers will promptly join you   to bear the english backward brussels way   i go on towards fleurus and ligny now   if bluchers force retreat and wellingtons   lie somnolent in brussels one day more   i gain that city sans a single shot    now friend downstairs youll find some supper ready   which you must tuck in sharply and then off   the past day has not illadvantaged us   we have stolen upon the two chiefs unawares   and in such sites that they must fight apart   now for a two hours restcomrade adieu   until tomorrow    ney         till tomorrow sire      exit ney  napoleon falls asleep and the secretary waits till     dictation shall be resumed  bussy the orderly officer comes     to the door     bussy    lettersarrived from paris  hands letters     secretary              he shall have them   the moment he awakes  these eighteen hours   hes been astride and is not what he was   much news from paris     bussy              i can only say   whats not the news  the courier has just told me   hed nothing from the empress at vienna   to bring his majesty  she writes no more     secretary    and never will again  in my regard   that birds forsook the nest for good and all     bussy    all that they hear in paris from her court   is through our spies there  one of them reports   this rumour of her that the archduke john   in taking leave to join our enemies here   said oh my poor louise i am grieved for you   and what i hope is that hell be run through   or shot or break his neck for your own good   no less than ours     napoleon waking         by he denoting me     bussy starting    just so your majesty     napoleon

it not so     bussy    he did your majesty     napoleon         hmyou may go      exit bussy  the secretary reads letters aloud in succession     he comes to the last begins it reaches a phrase and stops     abruptly    mind not  read on no doubt the usual threat   or prophecy from some mad scribe  who signs it     secretary    the subscript is the duke of enghien     napoleon starting up    bah man  a treacherous trick  a hoaxno more   is that the last     secretary         the last your majesty     napoleon    then now ill sleep  in two hours have me called     secretary    ill give the

reminder of   the duke of enghien  shall it be young compassion     spirit of the pities         what goodif that old years tells us be true        but i say naught  to ordain is not for me      thereupon a vision passes before napoleon as he lies comprising     hundreds of thousands of skeletons and corpses in various stages     of decay  they rise from his various battlefields the flesh     dropping from them and gaze reproachfully at him  his intimate     officers who have been slain he recognizes among the crowd  in     front is the duke of enghien as showman     napoleon in his sleep    why why should this reproach be dealt me now   why hold me my own master if i be   ruled by the pitiless planet of destiny      he jumps up in a sweat and puts out the last candle and the     scene is curtained by darkness      scene iv    a chamber overlooking a main street in brussels      a june sunrise the beams struggling through the windowcurtains     a canopied bed in a recess on the left  the quick notes of     brighton camp or the girl ive left behind me strike sharply     into the room from fifes and drums without  a young lady in a     dressinggown who has evidently been awaiting the sound springs     from the bed like a hare from its form undraws windowcurtains     and opens the window      columns of british soldiery are marching past from the parc     southward out of the city by the namur gate  the windows of     other houses in the street rattle open and become full of     gazers      a tap at the door  an older lady enters and comes up to the     first     younger lady turning    o mammai didnt hear you     elder lady    i was sound asleep till the thumping of the drums set me fantastically   dreaming and when i awoke i found they were real  did they wake you   too my dear     younger lady reluctantly    i didnt require waking  i hadnt slept since we came home     elder lady    that was from the excitement of the ball  there are dark rings round   your eye  the fifes and drums are now opposite and thrill the air   in the room  ahthat girl ive left behind mewhich so many   thousands of women have throbbed an accompaniment to and will again   today if ever they did     younger lady her voice faltering    it is rather cruel to say that just now mamma  there i cant look   at them after it  she turns and wipes her eyes     elder lady    i wasnt thinking of ourselvescertainly not of youhow they   press onwith those great knapsacks and firelocks and i am told   fiftysix rounds of ballcartridge and four days provisions in   those haversacks  how can they carry it all near twenty miles and   fight with it on their shoulders dont cry dear  i thought   you would get sentimental last night over somebody  i ought to   have brought you home sooner  how many dances did you have  it   was impossible for me to look after you in the excitement of the   wartidings     younger lady    only threefour     elder lady    which were they     younger lady    enrico the copenhagen waltz and the hanoverian and the   prime of life     elder lady    it was very foolish to fall in love on the strength of four dances     younger lady evasively    fall in love  who said i had fallen in love  what a funny idea     elder lady    is it now here come the highland brigade with their pipes   and their hieland laddie  how the sweethearts cling to the mens   arms  reaching forward  there are more regiments following   but look that gentleman opposite knows us  i cannot remember his   name  she bows and calls across  sir which are these     gentleman opposite    the ninetysecond  next come the fortyninth and next the forty   secondsir denis packs brigade     elder lady    thank youi think it is that gentleman we talked to at the   duchesss but i am not sure

 several hanoverian regiments   under colonel best are coming next  they pass with their bands   and colours  an interval     elder lady to daughter    here are the hussars  how much more they carry to battle than at   reviews  the hay in those great nets must encumber them  she   turns and sees that her daughter has become pale  ah now i know   he has just gone by  you exchanged signals with him you wicked   girl  how do you know what his character is or if hell ever come   back      the younger lady goes and flings herself on her face upon the     bed sobbing silently  her mother glances at her but leaves     her alone  an interval  the prancing of a group of horsemen     is heard on the cobblestones without     gentleman opposite calling    here comes the duke     elder lady to younger    you have left the window at the most important time  the duke of   wellington and his staffofficers are passing out     younger lady    i dont want to see him  i dont want to see anything any more      riding down the street comes wellington in a grey frockcoat and     small cocked hat frigid and undemonstrative accompanied by four     or five generals of his suite the deputy quartermastergeneral     de lancey lord fitzroy somerset aidedecamp and general     muffling     gentleman opposite    he is the prussian officer attached to our headquarters through whom   wellington communicates with blucher who they say is threatened by   the french at ligny at this moment      the elder lady turns to her daughter and going to the bed bends     over her while the horses tramp of wellington and his staff     clatters more faintly in the street and the music of the last     retreating band dies away towards the forest of soignes      finding her daughter is hysterical with grief she quickly draws     the windowcurtains to screen the room from the houses opposite     scene ends      scene v    the field of ligny      the same day later  a prospect of the battlefield of ligny     southward from the roof of the windmill of bussy which stands at     the centre and highest point of the prussian position about six     miles southeast of quatrebras      the ground slopes downward along the whole front of the scene to     a valley through which wanders the ligne a muddy stream bordered     by sallows  on both sides of the stream in the middle plane of     the picture stands the village of ligny composed of thatched     cottages gardens and farmhouses with stone walls the main     features such as the church churchyard and villagegreen     being on the further side of the ligne      on that side the land reascends in green wheatfields to an     elevation somewhat greater than that of the foreground reaching     away to fleurus in the righthand distance      in front on the slopes between the spectator and the village     is the first corps of the prussian army commanded by zieten its     first brigade under steinmetz occupying the most salient point     the corps under thielmann is ranged to the left and that of     pirch to the rear in reserve to zieten  in the centrefront     just under the mill blucher on a fine grey charger is intently     watching with his staff      something dark is seen to be advancing over the horizon by     fleurus about three miles off  it is the van of napoleons     army approaching to give battle      at this moment hoofs are heard clattering along a road that     passes behind the mill and there come round to the front the     duke of wellington his staffofficers and a small escort of     cavalry      wellington and blucher greet each other at the foot of the     windmill  they disappear inside and can be heard ascending     the ladders      enter on the roof wellington and blucher followed by fitzroy     somerset gneisenau muffling and others  before renewing     their conversation they peer through their glasses at the dark     movements on the horizon  wellingtons manner is deliberate     judicial almost indifferent bluchers eager and impetuous     wellington    they muster not as yet in near such strength   at quatrebras as here     blucher              tis from fleurus   they come debouching  i perforce withdrew   my forward posts of cavalry at dawn   in face of their light cannon theyll be here   i reckon soon     wellington still with glass              i clearly see his staff   and if my eyes dont lie the archone too   it is the whole imperial army prince   that weve before us  a silence  well well cope with them   what would you have me do      blucher is so absorbed in what he sees that he does not heed     gneisenau              duke this id say   events suggest to us that you come up   with all your force behind the village here   and act as our reserve     muffling              but bonaparte   pray note has redistributed his strength   in fashion that you fail to recognize   i am against your scheme     blucher lowering his glass              signs notify   napoleons plans as changed  he purports now   to strike our leftbetween sombreffe and brye   if so i have to readjust my ward     wellington    one of his two divisions that we scan   outspreading from fleurus seems bent on ligny   the other on saintamand     blucher              well i shall see   in half an hour your grace  if what i deem   be what he means von zietens corps forthwith   must stand to their positions pirch out here   henckel at ligny steinmetz at la haye     wellington    so that your excellency as i opine   i go and sling my strength on their left wing   manoeuvring to outflank em on that side     blucher    true true  our plan uncovers of itself   you bear down everything from quatrebras   along the road to frasnes     wellington              i will by god   ill bear straight on to gosselies if needs     gneisenau    your excellencies if i may be a judge   such movement will not tend to unity   it leans too largely on a peradventure   most speculative in its contingencies      a silence till the officers of the staff remark to each other     that concentration is best in any circumstances  a general     discussion ensues     blucher concludingly    we will expect you duke to our support     wellington    i must agree that in the sum its best   so be it then  if not attacked myself   ill come to younow i return with speed   to quatrebras     blucher              and i descend from here   to give close eye and thought to things below   no more can well be studied where we stand      exeunt from roof wellington blucher and the rest  they reappear     below and wellington and his suite gallop furiously away in the     direction of quatrebras  an interval     dumb show below    three reports of a cannon give the signal for the french attack   napoleons army advances down the slopes of green corn opposite   bands and voices joining in songs of victory  the french come   in three grand columns vandammes on the left the spectators   right against saintamand the most forward angle of the prussian   position  gerards in the centre bear down upon ligny  grouchys   on the french right is further back  far to the rear can be   discerned napoleon the imperial guard and milhauds cuirassiers   halted in reserve    this formidable advance is preceded by swarms of tirailleurs who   tread down the high wheat exposing their own men in the rear    amid cannonading from both sides they draw nearer to the prussians   though lanes are cut through them by the latters guns  they drive   the prussians out of ligny who however rally in the houses   churchyard and village green     spirit of the pities         i see unnatural an monster loosely jointed        with an apocalyptic beings shape        and limbs and eyes a hundred thousand strong        and fifty thousand heads which coils itself        about the buildings there     spirit of the years                   thou dost indeed        it is the monster devastation  watch     round the church they fight without quarter shooting face to face   stabbing with unfixed bayonets and braining with the butts of   muskets  the village catches fire and soon becomes a furnace   the crash of splitting timbers as doors are broken through the   curses of the fighters rise into the air with shouts of en   avant from the further side of the stream and vorwarts from   the nearer    the battle extends to the west by le hameau and saintamand la haye   and ligny becomes invisible under a shroud of smoke     voices at the base of the mill    this sun will go down bloodily for us   the english sharply sighed for by prince blucher   cannot appear  wellington words across   that hosts have set on him at quatrebras   and leave him not one bayonet to spare     the truth of this intelligence is apparent  a low dull sound heard   lately from the direction of quatrebras has increased to a roaring   cannonade  the scene abruptly closes      scene vi    the field at quatrebras      the same day  the view is southward and the straight gaunt     highway from brussels behind the spectator to charleroi over     the hills in front bisects the picture from foreground to     distance  near at hand where it is elevated and open there     crosses it obliquely at a point called les quatrebras another     road which comes from nivelle five miles to the gazers right     rear and goes to namur twenty miles ahead to the left  at a     distance of five or six miles in this latter direction it passes     near the previous scene ligny whence the booming of guns can     be continuously heard      between the crossroads in the centre of the scene and the far     horizon the ground dips into a hollow on the other side of which     the same straight road to charleroi is seen climbing the crest     and over it till out of sight  from a hill on the right hand of     the middistance a large wood the wood of bossu reaches up     nearly to the crossways which give their name to the buildings     thereat consisting of a few farmhouses and an inn      about threequarters of a mile off nearly hidden by the horizon     towards charleroi there is also a farmstead gemioncourt another     piraumont stands on an eminence a mile to the left of it and     somewhat in front of the namur road     dumb show    as this scene uncovers the battle is beheld to be raging at its   height and to have reached a keenly tragic phase  wellington has   returned from ligny and the main british and hanoverian position   held by the men who marched out of brussels in the morning under   officers who danced the previous night at the duchesss is along   the namur road to the left of the perspective and round the cross   road itself  that of the french under ney is on the crests further   back from which they are descending in imposing numbers  some   advanced columns are assailing the english left while through the   smokehazes of the middle of the field two lines of skirmishers   are seen firing at each otherthe southernmost dark blue the   northernmost dull red  time lapses till it is past four oclock     spirit of rumour         the cannonade of the french ordnancelines        has now redoubled  columns new and dense        of foot supported by fleet cavalry        straightly impinge upon the brunswick bands        that border the plantation of bossu        above some regiments of the assaulting french        a flag like midnight swims upon the air        to say no quarter may be looked for there     the brunswick soldiery much notched and torn by the french grape   shot now lie in heaps  the duke of brunswick himself desperate   to keep them steady lights his pipe and rides slowly up and down   in front of his lines previous to the charge which follows     spirit of rumour         the french have heaved them on the brunswickers        and borne them back  now comes the dukes told time        he gallops at the head of his hussars        those men of solemn and appalling guise        fullclothed in black with nodding hearsy plumes        a shining silver skull and cross of bones        set upon each to byspeak his slain sire        concordantly the expected bullet starts        and finds the living son     brunswick reels to the ground  his troops disheartened lose their   courage and give way    the french front columns and the cavalry supporting them shout   as they advance  the allies are forced back upon the english main   position  wellington is in personal peril for a time but he escapes   it by a leap of his horse    a curtain of smoke drops  an interval

fresh footfolk from the covering rye         next pires cavalry took up the charge        and so the action sways  the english left        is turned at piraumont whilst on their right        perils

uniforms coming from the direction of   wavre debouch upon the hill from the road through the wood    they are the advanceguard and two brigades of bulows corps that   have been joined there by blucher  the latter has just risen from   the bed to which he has been confined since the battle of ligny   two days back  he still looks pale and shaken by the severe fall   and trampling he endured near the end of the action    on the summit the troops halt and a discussion between blucher and   his staff ensues    the cannonade in the direction of waterloo is growing more and more   violent  blucher after looking this way and that decides to fall   upon the french right at plancenoit as soon as he can get there   which will not be yet    between this point and that the ground descends steeply to the   valley on the spectators left where there is a mudbottomed   stream the lasne the slope ascends no less abruptly on the other   side towards plancenoit  it is across this defile alone that the   prussian army can proceed thither a route of unusual difficulty   for artillery where moreover the enemy is suspected of having   placed a strong outpost during the night to intercept such an   approach    a figure goes forwardthat of major falkenhausen who is sent to   reconnoitre and they wait a tedious time the firing at waterloo   growing more tremendous  falkenhausen comes back with the welcome   news that no outpost is there    there now remains only the difficulty of the defile itself and the   attempt is made  blucher is descried riding hither and thither as   the guns
