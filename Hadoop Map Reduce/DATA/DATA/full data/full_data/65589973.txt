the measured ring of axes    preface   being forbidden to write anything at present i have collected various waifs and strays to appease the young people who clamor for more forgetting that mortal brains need rest  as many girls have asked to see what sort of tales jo march wrote at the beginning of her career i have added the barons gloves as a sample of the romantic rubbish which paid so well once upon a time if it shows them what not to write it will not have been rescued from oblivion in vain  l m alcott     contents    kittys class day   aunt kipp   psyches art   a country christmas   on picket duty   the barons gloves   my red cap   what the bells saw and said     proverb stories     kittys class day  a stitch in time saves nine   o pris pris im really going heres the invitationrough paperchapelspreadslyceum halleverything splendid and jack to take care of me  as kitty burst into the room and performed a rapturous pas seul waving the cards over her head sister priscilla looked up from her work with a smile of satisfaction on her quiet face  who invites you dear  why jack of coursedear old cousin jack nobody else ever thinks of me or cares whether i have a bit of pleasure now and then isnt he kind maynt i go and o pris what shall i wear  kitty paused suddenly as if the last allimportant question had a solemnizing effect upon both mind and body  why your white muslin silk sacque and new hat of course began pris with an air of surprise but kitty broke in impetuously  ill never wear that old muslin again its full of darns up to my knees and all out of fashion so is my sacque and as for my hat though it does well enough here it would be absurd for class day  you dont expect an entirely new suit for this occasiondo you asked pris anxiously  yes i do and ill tell you how i mean to get it ive planned everything for though i hardly dreamed of going i amused myself by thinking how i could manage if i did get invited  let us hear and pris took up her work with an air of resignation  first my dress began kitty perching herself on the arm of the sofa and entering into the subject with enthusiasm ive got the ten dollars grandpa sent me and with eight of it im going to buy lizzie kings organdie muslin she got it in paris but her aunt providentiallyno unfortunatelydied so she cant wear it and wants to get rid of it she is bigger than i am you know so there is enough for a little mantle or sacque for it isnt made up the skirt is cut off and gored with a splendid train  my dear you dont mean you are going to wear one of those absurd newfashioned dresses exclaimed pris lifting hands and eyes  i do nothing would induce me to go to class day without a train its been the desire of my heart to have one and now i will if i never have another gown to my back returned kitty with immense decision  pris shook her head and said go on as if prepared for any extravagance after that  we can make it ourselves continued kitty and trim it with the same its white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes the loveliest thing you ever saw and cant be got here so simple yet distingu√© i know youll like it next my bonnethere the solemnity of kittys face and manner was charming to behold i shall make it out of one of my new illusion undersleeves ive never worn them and the puffed part will be a plenty for a little flyaway bonnet of the latest style ive got blue ribbons to tie it with and have only to look up some daisies for the inside with my extra two dollars i shall buy my gloves and pay my faresand there i am all complete  she looked so happy so pretty and full of girlish satisfaction that sister pris couldnt bear to disturb the little plan much as she disapproved of it they were poor and every penny had to be counted there were plenty of neighbors to gossip and criticise and plenty of friends to make disagreeable remarks on any unusual extravagance pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty but kitty with the romantic eyes of seventeen and the elder sister in the kindness of her heart had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes or deny the child a harmless pleasure she sewed thoughtfully for a minute then looked up saying with the smile that always assured kitty the day was won  get your things together and we will see what can be done but remember dear that it is both bad taste and bad economy for poor people to try to ape the rich  youre a perfect angel pris so dont moralize ill run and get the dress and well begin at once for there is much to do and only two days to do it in and kitty skipped away singing lauriger horatius at the top of her voice  priscilla soon found that the girls head was completely turned by the advice and example of certain fashionable young neighbors it was in vain for pris to remonstrate and warn  just this once let me do as others do and thoroughly enjoy myself pleaded kitty and pris yielded saying to herself she shall have her wish and if she learns a lesson neither time nor money will be lost  so they snipped and sewed and planned and pieced going through all the alternations of despair and triumph worry and satisfaction which women undergo when a new suit is under way company kept coming for news of kittys expedition had flown abroad and her young friends must just run in to hear about it and ask what she was going to wear while kitty was so glad and proud to tell and show and enjoy her little triumph that many half hours were wasted and the second day found much still to do  the lovely muslin didnt hold out and kitty sacrificed the waist to the train for a train she must have or the whole thing would be an utter failure a little sacque was eked out however and when the frills were on it was ravishing as kitty said with a sigh of mingled delight and fatigue the gored skirt was a fearful job as any one who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify and before the facing even experienced pris quailed  the bonnet also was a trial for when the lace was on it was discovered that the ribbons didnt match the dress here was a catastrophe kitty frantically rummaged the house the shops the stores of her friends and rummaged in vain there was no time to send to the city and despair was about to fall on kitty when pris rescued her by quietly making one of the small sacrifices which were easy to her because her life was spent for others some one suggested a strip of blue illusionand that could be got but alas kitty had no money for the gloves were already bought pris heard the lamentations and giving up fresh ribbons for herself pulled her sister out of a slough of despond with two yards of heavenly tulle  now the daisies and oh dear me not one can i find in this povertystricken town sighed kitty prinking at the glass and fervently hoping that nothing would happen to her complexion over night  i see plenty just like those on your dress answered pris nodding toward the meadow full of young whiteweed  pris youre a treasure ill wear real ones they keep well i know and are so common i can refresh my bonnet anywhere its a splendid idea  away rushed kitty to return with an apron full of american daisies a pretty cluster was soon fastened just over the lefthand frizzle of bright hair and the little bonnet was complete  now pris tell me how i look cried kitty as she swept into the room late that afternoon in full gala costume  it would have been impossible for the primmest the sourest or the most sensible creature in the world to say that it wasnt a pretty sight the long train the big chignon the apology for a bonnet were all ridiculousno one could deny thatbut youth beauty and a happy heart made even those absurdities charming the erect young figure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress the bright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forget its size and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of the ugly bunch which disfigured the girls head the little jacket set divinely the new gloves were as immaculate as white kids could be and to crown all lizzie king in a burst of generosity lent kitty the blue and white paris sunshade which she couldnt use herself  now i could die content im perfect in all respects and i know jack wont be ashamed of me i really owe it to him to look my best you know and thats why im so particular said kitty in an apologetic tone as she began to lay away her finery  i hope you will enjoy every minute of the time deary dont forget to finish running up the facing ive basted it carefully and would do it if my head didnt ache so i really cant hold it up any longer answered pris who had worked like a disinterested bee while kitty had flown about like a distracted butterfly  go and lie down you dear kind soul and dont think of my nonsense again said kitty feeling remorseful till pris was comfortably asleep when she went to her room and revelled in her finery till bedtime so absorbed was she in learning to manage her train gracefully that she forgot the facing till very late then being worn out with work and worry she did what girls are too apt to do stuck a pin here and there and trusting to priscillas careful bastings left it as it was retiring to dream of a certain horace fletcher whose aristocratic elegance had made a deep impression upon her during the few evenings she had seen him  nothing could have been lovelier than the morning and few hearts happier than kittys as she arrayed herself with the utmost care and waited in solemn state for the carriage for muslin trains and dewy roads were incompatible and one luxury brought another  my goodness where did she get that stylish suit whispered miss smith to miss jones as kitty floated into the station with all sail set finding it impossible to resist the temptation to astonish certain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past which snubs had rankled and were now avenged  i looked everywhere for a muslin for today and couldnt find any i liked so i was forced to wear my mauve silk observed miss smith complacently settling the silvery folds of her dress  its very pretty but one ruins a silk at class day you know i thought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate this warm day a friend brought it from paris and its like one the princess of wales wore at the great flowershow this year returned kitty with the air of a young lady who had all her dresses from paris and was intimately acquainted with the royal family  those girls were entirely extinguished by this stroke and hadnt a word to say for themselves while kitty casually mentioned horace fletcher lyceum hall and cousin jack for they had only a little freshman brother to boast of and were not going to lyceum hall  as she stepped out of the cars at cambridge jack opened his honest blue eyes and indulged in a low whistle of astonishment for if there was anything he especially hated it was the trains chignons and tiny bonnets then in fashion he was very fond of kitty and prided himself on being able to show his friends a girl who was charming and yet not overdressed  she has made a regular guy of herself i wont tell her so and the dear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss and feathers but i do wish she had let her hair alone and worn that pretty hat of hers  as this thought passed through jacks mind he smiled and bowed and made his way among the crowd whispering as he drew his cousins arm through his own  why kitty youre got up regardless of expense arent you im so glad you came well have a rousing good time and you shall see all the fun  oh thank you jack do i look nice really i tried to be a credit to you and pris and i did have such a job of it ill make you laugh over it some time a carriage for me bless us how fine we are and kitty stepped in feeling that only one thing more was needed to make her cup overflow that one thing was speedily vouchsafed for before her skirts were smoothly settled jack called out in his hearty way  how are you fletcher if you are bound for chapel ill take you up  thanks goodmorning miss heath  it was all done in an instant and the next thing kitty knew she was rolling away with the elegant horace sitting opposite how little it takes to make a young girl happy a pretty dress sunshine and somebody opposite and they are blest kittys face glowed and dimpled with pleasure as she glanced about her especially when she sitting in state with two gentlemen all to herself passed those girls walking in the dust with a beardless boy she felt that she could forgive past slights and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow  both jack and fletcher had graduated the year before but still took an interest in their old haunts and patronized the fellows who were not yet through the mill at least the seniors and juniors of sophs and freshs they were sublimely unconscious greeted by frequent slaps on the shoulder and hearty how are you old fellows they piloted kitty to a seat in the chapel an excellent place but the girls satisfaction was marred by fletchers desertion and she could not see anything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet to whom he devoted himself because she was a stranger kitty said  everybody knows what goes on in the chapel after the fight and scramble are over the rustle and buzz the music the oratory and the poem during which the men cheer and the girls simper the professors yawn and the poets friends pronounce him a second longfellow then the closing flourishes the grand crush and general scattering  then the fun really begins as far as the young folks are concerned they dont mind swarming up and down stairs in a solid phalanx they can enjoy half a dozen courses of salad ice and strawberries with stout gentlemen crushing their feet anxious mammas sticking sharp elbows into their sides and absentminded tutors walking over them they can flirt vigorously in a torrid atmosphere of dinner dust and din can smile with hot coffee running down their backs small avalanches of icecream descending upon their best bonnets and sandwiches butterside down reposing on their delicate silks they know that it is a costly rapture but they carefully refrain from thinking of the morrow and energetically illustrate the yankee maxim which bids us enjoy ourselves in our early bloom  kitty did have a rousing good time for jack was devoted taking her everywhere showing her everything feeding and fanning her and festooning her train with untiring patience how many forcible expressions he mentally indulged in as he walked on that unlucky train we will not record he smiled and skipped and talked of treading on flowers in a way that would have charmed kitty if some one else had not been hovering about the daisy as fletcher called her  after he returned she neglected jack who took it coolly and was never in the way unless she wanted him for the first time in her life kitty deliberately flirted the little coquetries which are as natural to a gay young girl as her laughter were all in full play and had she gone no further no harm would have been done but excited by the example of those about her kitty tried to enact the fashionable young lady and like most novices she overdid the part quite forgetting her cousin she tossed her head twirled her fan gave affected little shrieks at college jokes and talked college slang in a way that convulsed fletcher who enjoyed the fun immensely  jack saw it all shook his head and said nothing but his face grew rather sober as he watched kitty flushed dishevelled and breathless whirling round lyceum hall on the arm of fletcher who danced divinely as all the girls agreed jack had proposed going but kitty had frowned so he fell back leaving her to listen and laugh blush and shrink a little at her partners flowery compliments and admiring glances  if she stands that long shes not the girl i took her for thought jack beginning to lose patience she doesnt look like my little kitty and somehow i dont feel half so fond and proud of her as usual i know one thing my daughters shall never be seen knocking about in that style  as if the thought suggested the act jack suddenly assumed an air of paternal authority and arresting his cousin as she was about to begin again he said in a tone she had never heard before  i promised pris to take care of you so i shall carry you off to rest and put yourself to rights after this game of romps i advise you to do the same fletcher or give your friend in the pink bonnet a turn  kitty took jacks arm pettishly but glanced over her shoulder with such an inviting smile that fletcher followed feeling very much like a top in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning as she came out kittys face cleared and assuming her sprightliest air she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect for a party of uninvited peris stood at the gate of this paradise casting longing glances at the forbidden splendors within slowly that all might see her kitty sailed down with horace the debonair in her wake and was just thinking to herself those girls wont get over this very soon i fancy when all in one moment she heard fletcher exclaim wrathfully hang the flounces she saw a very glossy black hat come skipping down the steps felt a violent twitch backward and to save herself from a fall sat down on the lower step with most undignified haste  it was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing for there was fletcher hopping wildly about with one foot nicely caught in a muslin loop and there sat kitty longing to run away and hide herself yet perfectly helpless while every one tittered miss jones and miss smith laughed shrilly and the despised little freshman completed her mortification by a feeble joke about kitty heaths new mantrap it was only an instant but it seemed an hour before fletcher freed her and snatching up the dusty beaver left her with a flushed countenance and an abrupt bow  if it hadnt been for jack kitty would have burst into tears then and there so terrible was the sense of humiliation which oppressed her for his sake she controlled herself and bundling up her torn train set her teeth stared straight before her and let him lead her in dead silence to a friends room near by there he locked the door and began to comfort her by making light of the little mishap but kitty cried so tragically that he was at his wits end till the ludicrous side of the affair struck her and she began to laugh hysterically with a vague idea that vigorous treatment was best for that feminine ailment jack was about to empty the contents of an icepitcher over her when she arrested him by exclaiming incoherently  oh dontit was so funnyhow can you laugh you cruel boyim disgraced forevertake me home to pris oh take me home to pris  i will my dear i will but first let me right you up a bit you look as if you had been hazed upon my life you do and jack laughed in spite of himself at the wretched little object before him for dust dancing and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle  that broke kittys heart and spreading her hands before her face she was about to cry again when the sad sight which met her eyes dispelled the gathering tears the new gloves were both split up the middle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down  never mind you can wash them said jack soothingly  i paid a dollar and a half for them and they cant be washed groaned kitty  oh hang the gloves i meant your hands cried jack trying to keep sober  no matter for my hands i mourn my gloves but i wont cry any more for my head aches now so i can hardly see and kitty threw off her bonnet as if even that airy trifle hurt her  seeing how pale she looked jack tenderly suggested a rest on the old sofa and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead while he got the good landlady to send her up a cup of tea as kitty rose to comply she glanced at her dress and clasping her hands exclaimed tragicallythe facing the fatal facing that made all the mischief for if id sewed it last night it wouldnt have ripped today if it hadnt ripped fletcher wouldnt have got his foot in it i shouldnt have made an object of myself he wouldnt have gone off in a rage andwho knows what might have happened  bless the whatsitsname if it has settled him cried jack he is a contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape he got you into follow his lead and dont trouble yourself about him  well he was rather absurd today i allow but he has got handsome eyes and hands and he does dance like an angel sighed kitty as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had brought destruction to her little castle in the air  handsome eyes white hands and angelic feet dont make a man wait till you can do better kit  with an odd grave look that rather startled kitty jack vanished to return presently with a comfortable cup of tea and a motherly old lady to help repair damages and soothe her by the foolish little purrings and pattings so grateful to female nerves after a flurry  ill come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree when youve had a bit of a rest said jack vibrating between door and sofa as if it wasnt easy to get away  oh i couldnt cried kitty with a shudder at the bare idea of meeting any one i cant be seen again tonight let me stay here till my train goes  i thought it had gone already said jack with an irrepressible twinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping the floor  how can you joke about it and the girls reproachful eyes filled with tears of shame i know ive been very silly jack but ive had my punishment and i dont need any more to feel that you despise me is worse than all the rest  she ended with a little sob and turned her face away to hide the trembling of her lips at that jack flushed up his eyes shone and he stooped suddenly as if to make some impetuous reply but remembering the old lady who by the by was discreetly looking out of the window he put his hands in his pockets and strolled out of the room  ive lost them both by this days folly thought kitty as mrs brown departed with the teacup i dont care for fletcher for i dare say he didnt mean half he said and i was only flattered because he is rich and handsome and the girls glorify him but i shall miss jack for ive known and loved him all my life how good hes been to me today so patient careful and kind though he must have been ashamed of me i know he didnt like my dress but he never said a word and stood by me through everything oh i wish id minded pris then he would have respected me at least i wonder if he ever will again  following a sudden impulse kitty sprang up locked the door and then proceeded to destroy all her little vanities as far as possible she smoothed out her crimps with a wet and ruthless hand fastened up her pretty hair in the simple way jack liked gave her once cherished bonnet a spiteful shake as she put it on and utterly extinguished it with a big blue veil she looped up her dress leaving no vestige of the now hateful train and did herself up uncompromisingly in the quakerish gray shawl pris had insisted on her taking for the evening then she surveyed herself with pensive satisfaction saying in the tone of one bent on resolutely mortifying the flesh  neat but not gaudy im a fright but i deserve it and its better than being a peacock  kitty had time to feel a little friendless and forlorn sitting there alone as twilight fell and amused herself by wondering if fletcher would come to inquire about her or show any further interest in her yet when the sound of a manly tramp approached she trembled lest it should be the victim of the fatal facing the door opened and with a sigh of relief she saw jack come in bearing a pair of new gloves in one hand and a great bouquet of june roses in the other  how good of you to bring me these they are more refreshing than oceans of tea you know what i like jack thank you very much cried kitty sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture  and you know what i like returned jack with an approving glance at the altered figure before him  ill never do so any more murmured kitty wondering why she felt bashful all of a sudden when it was only cousin jack  now put on your gloves dear and come out and hear the music your train doesnt go for two hours yet and you mustnt mope here all that time said jack offering his second gift  how did you know my size asked kitty putting on the gloves in a hurry for though jack had called her dear for years the little word had a new sound tonight  i guessedno i didnt i had the old ones with me they are no good now are they and too honest to lie jack tried to speak carelessly though he turned red in the dusk well knowing that the dirty little gloves were folded away in his left breastpocket at that identical moment  oh dear no these fit nicely im ready if you dont mind going with such a fright said kitty forgetting her dread of seeing people in her desire to get away from that room because for the first time in her life she wasnt at ease with jack  i think i like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly returned jack who in spite of his invitation seemed to find moping rather pleasant  you are a rainyday friend and he isnt said kitty softly as she drew him away  jacks only answer was to lay his hand on the little white glove resting so confidingly on his arm and keeping it there they roamed away into the summer twilight  something had happened to the evening and the place for both seemed suddenly endowed with uncommon beauty and interest the dingy old houses might have been fairy palaces for anything they saw to the contrary the dusty walks the trampled grass were regular elysian fields to them and the music was the music of the spheres though they found themselves right in the middle of the boom jing jing for both had made a little discoveryno not a little one the greatest and sweetest man and woman can make in the sharp twinge of jealousy which the sight of kittys flirtation with fletcher gave him and the delight he found in her after conduct jack discovered how much he loved her in the shame gratitude and half sweet half bitter emotion that filled her heart kitty felt that to her jack would never be only cousin jack any more all the vanity coquetry selfishness and illtemper of the day seemed magnified to heinous sins for now her only thought was seeing these faults he cant care for me oh i wish i was a better girl  she did not say for his sake but in the new humility the ardent wish to be all that a woman should be little kitty proved how true her love was and might have said with portia    for myself alone i would not be   ambitious in my wish but for you   i would be trebled twenty times myself   a thousand times more fair   ten thousand times more rich  all about them other pairs were wandering under the patriarchal elms enjoying music starlight balmy winds and all the luxuries of the season if the band had played    oh theres nothing half so sweet in life   as loves young dream  it is my private opinion that it would have suited the audience to a t being principally composed of elderly gentlemen with large families they had not that fine sense of the fitness of things so charming to see and tooted and banged away with waltzes and marches quite regardless of the flocks of romeos and juliets philandering all about them  under cover of a popular medley kitty overheard fletcher quizzing her for the amusement of miss pinkbonnet who was evidently making up for lost time it was feeble wit but it put the finishing stroke to kittys vanity and she dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat and clung to jack feeling that she had never valued him half enough she hoped he didnt hear the gossip going on at the other side of the tree near which they stood but he did for his hand involuntarily doubled itself up into a very dangerouslooking fist and he darted such fiery glances at the speaker that if the thing had been possible fletchers ambrosial curls would have been scorched off his head  never mind and dont get angry jack they are right about one thingthe daisies in my bonnet were real and i couldnt afford any others i dont care much only pris worked so hard to get me ready i hate to have my things made fun of  he isnt worth a thrashing so well let it pass this time said jack irefully yet privately resolving to have it out with fletcher by and by  why kitty i thought the real daisies the prettiest things about your dress dont throw them away ill wear them just to show that noodle that i prefer nature to art and jack gallantly stuck the faded posy in his buttonhole while kitty treasured up the hint so kindly given for future use  if a clock with great want of tact hadnt insisted on telling them that it was getting late kitty never would have got home for both the young people felt inclined to loiter about arm in arm through the sweet summer night forever  jack had meant to say something before she went and was immensely surprised to find the chance lost for the present he wanted to go home with her and free his mind but a neighborly old gentleman having been engaged as escort there would have been very little satisfaction in a travelling trio so he gave it up he was very silent as they walked to the station with dr dodd trudging behind them kitty thought he was tired perhaps glad to be rid of her and meekly accepted her fate but as the train approached she gave his hand an impulsive squeeze and said very gratefully  jack i cant thank you enough for your kindness to your silly little cousin but i never shall forget it and if i ever can return it in any way i will with all my heart  jack looked down at the young face almost pathetic now with weariness humility and pain yet very sweet with that new shyness in the loving eyes and stooping suddenly he kissed it whispering in a tone that made the girls heart flutter  ill tell you how you may return it with all your heart by and by goodnight my kitty  have you had a good time dear asked pris as her sister appeared an hour later  dont i look as if i had and throwing off her wraps kitty revolved slowly before her that she might behold every portion of the wreck my gown is all dust crumple and rags my bonnet perfectly limp and flat and my gloves are ruined ive broken lizzies parasol made a spectacle of myself and wasted money time and temper yet my class day isnt a failure for jack is the dearest boy in the world and im very very happy  pris looked at her a minute then opened her arms without a word and kitty forgot all her little troubles in one great joy  when miss smith and miss jones called a few days after to tell her that mr fletcher was going abroad the amiable creatures were entirely routed by finding jack there in a most unmistakable situation he blandly wished horace bon voyage and regretted that he wouldnt be there to the wedding in october kitty devoted herself to blushing beautifully and darning many rents in a short daisy muslin skirt which i intend to wear a great deal because jack likes it and so do i she said with a demure look at her lover who laughed as if that was the best joke of the season     aunt kipp  children and fools speak the truth   i   whats that sigh for polly dear im tired mother tired of working and waiting if im ever going to have any fun i want it now while i can enjoy it  you shouldnt wait another hour if i could have my way but you know how helpless i am and poor mrs snow sighed dolefully as she glanced about the dingy room and pretty mary turning her faded gown for the second time  if aunt kipp would give us the money she is always talking about instead of waiting till she dies we should be so comfortable she is a dreadful bore for she lives in such terror of dropping dead with her heartcomplaint that she doesnt take any pleasure in life herself or let any one else so the sooner she goes the better for all of us said polly in a desperate tone for things looked very black to her just then  my dear dont say that began her mother mildly shocked but a bluff little voice broke in with the forcible remark  shes everlastingly telling me never to put off till tomorrow what can be done today next time she comes ill remind her of that and ask her if she is going to die why she doesnt do it  toady youre a wicked disrespectful boy never let me hear you say such a thing again about your dear aunt kipp  she isnt dear you know we all hate her and you are more afraid of her than you are of spidersso now  the young personage whose proper name had been corrupted into toady was a small boy of ten or eleven applecheeked roundeyed and curlyheaded arrayed in wellworn gray knickerbockers profusely adorned with paint glue and shreds of cotton perched on a high stool at an isolated table in a state of chaos he was absorbed in making a boat entirely oblivious of the racking toothache which had been his excuse for staying from school as cool saucy hardhanded and softhearted a little specimen of young america was toady as you would care to see a tyrant at home a rebel at school a sworn foe to law order and aunt kipp this young person was regarded as a reprobate by all but his mother sister and sisters sweetheart van bahr lamb having been through much anguish of flesh and spirit taught that lying was a deadly sin toady rushed to the other extreme and bolted out the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth at all times and places with a startling abruptness that brought wrath and dismay upon his friends and relatives  its wicked to fib youve whipped that into me and you cant rub it out he was wont to say with vivid recollection of the past tingling in the chubby portions of his frame  mind your chips toady and take care what you say to aunt kipp or youll be as poor as a little rat all the days of your life said polly warningly  i dont want her old money and ill tell her so if she bothers me about it i shall go into business with van and take care of the whole lot so dont you preach polly returned toady with as much dignity as was compatible with a great dab of glue on the end of his snub nose  mother did aunt say anything about coming this week asked polly after a pause of intense thought over a breadth with three darns two spots and a burn  yes she wrote that she was too feeble to come at present as she had such dreadful palpitations she didnt dare stir from her room so we are quite safe for the next week at least andbless my soul there she is now  mrs snow clasped her hands with a gesture of dismay and sat as if transfixed by the spectacle of a ponderous lady in an aweinspiring bonnet who came walking slowly down the street polly gave a groan and pulled a bright ribbon from her hair toady muttered oh bother and vainly attempted to polish up his countenance with a fragmentary pockethandkerchief  nothing but salt fish for dinner wailed mrs snow as the shadow of the coming event fell upon her  van will make a fool of himself and ruin everything sighed polly glancing at the ring on her finger  i know shell kiss me she never will let a fellow alone growled toady scowling darkly  the garden gate clashed dust flew from the doormat a heavy step echoed in the hall an imperious voice called sophy and aunt kipp entered with a flourish of trumpets for toady blew a blast through his fingers which made the bows totter on her bonnet  my dear aunt im very glad to see you murmured mrs snow advancing with a smile of welcome for though as weak as water gruel she was as kindhearted a little woman as ever lived  what a fib that was said toady sotto voce  we were just saying we were afraid you wouldntbegan mary when a warning mind now polly caused her to stop short and busy herself with the newcomers bag and umbrella  i changed my mind theodore come and kiss me answered aunt kipp briefly  yesm was the plaintive reply and closing his eyes toady awaited his fate with fortitude  but the dreaded salute did not come for aunt kipp exclaimed in alarm  mercy on us has the boy got the plague  nom its paint and dirt and glue and it wont come off said toady stroking his variegated countenance with grateful admiration for the stains that saved him  go and wash this moment sir thank heaven ive got no boys cried aunt kipp as if boys were some virulent disease which she had narrowly escaped  with a hasty peck at the lips of her two elder relatives the old lady seated herself and slowly removed the awful bonnet which in shape and hue much resembled a hearse hung with black crape  im glad you are better said mary reverently receiving the funereal headgear  im not better cut in aunt kipp im worse much worse my days are numbered i stand on the brink of the tomb and may drop at any moment  toadys face was a study as he glanced up at the old ladys florid countenance down at the floor as if in search of the abovementioned brink and looked unaffectedly anxious to see her drop why dont you then was on his lips but a frown from polly restrained him and he sat himself down on the rug to contemplate the corpulent victim  have a cup of tea aunt said mrs snow  i will  lie down and rest a little suggested polly  i wont  can we do anything for you said both  take my things away and have dinner early  both departed to perform these behests and leaning back in her chair aunt kipp reposed  i say whats a bore asked toady from the rug where he sat rocking meditatively to and fro holding on by his shoestrings  its a kind of a pig very fierce and folks are afraid of em said aunt kipp whose knowledge of natural history was limited  good for polly so you are sung out the boy with the hearty childs laugh so pleasant to most ears  what do you mean sir demanded the old lady irefully poking at him with her umbrella  why polly said you were a bore explained toady with artless frankness you are fat you know and fierce sometimes and folks are afraid of you good wasnt it  very mary is a nice grateful respectful loving niece and i shant forget her she may depend on that and aunt kipp laughed grimly  may she well thats jolly now she was afraid you wouldnt give her the money so ill tell her its all right and innocent toady nodded approvingly  oh she expects some of my money does she  course she does aint you always saying youll remember us in your will because father was your favorite nephew and all that ill tell you a secret if you wont let polly know i spoke first youll find it out tonight for you d see van and she were sweethearts in a minute  sweethearts cried aunt kipp turning red in the face  yesm van settled it last week and pollys been so happy ever since mother likes it and i like it for im fond of van though i do call him baabaa because he looks like a sheep we all like it and we d all say so if we were not afraid of you mother and polly i mean of course we men dont mind but we dont want a fuss you wont make one will you now  anything more expressive of brotherly goodwill persuasive frankness and a placid consciousness of having fixed it than toadys dirty little face it would be hard to find aunt kipp eyed him so fiercely that even before she spoke a dim suspicion that something was wrong began to dawn on his tooconfiding soul  i dont like it and ill put a stop to it i wont have any ridiculous baabaas in my family if mary counts on my money to begin housekeeping with shell find herself mistaken for not one penny shall she have married or single and you may tell her so  toady was so taken aback by this explosion that he let go his shoestrings fell over with a crash and lay flat with shovel and tongs spread upon him like a pall in rushed mrs snow and polly to find the boys spirits quite quenched for once and aunt kipp in a towering passion it all came out in one overwhelming flood of words and toady fled from the storm to wander round the house a prey to the deepest remorse the meekness of that boy at dinnertime was so angelic that mrs snow would have feared speedy translation for him if she had not been very angry pollys red eyes and aunt kipps griffinesque expression of countenance weighed upon his soul so heavily that even rolypoly pudding failed to assuage his trouble and taking his mother into the chinacloset he anxiously inquired if it was all up with polly  im afraid so for aunt vows she will make a new will tomorrow and leave every penny to the charitable ragbag society sighed mrs snow  i didnt mean to do it i truly didnt i thought id just give her a hint as you say she looked all right and laughed when i told her about being a bore and i thought she liked it if she was a man id thrash her for making polly cry and toady shook his fist at aunt kipps umbrella which was an immense relief to his perturbed spirit  bless the boy i do believe he would cried mrs snow watching the little turkeycock with maternal pride you cant do that so just be careful and not make any more mischief dear  ill try mother but im always getting into scrapes with aunt kipp shes worse than measles any daysuch an old aggrawater vans coming this afternoon wont he make her pleasant again  oh dear no he will probably make things ten times worse hes so bashful and queer im afraid our last chance is gone deary and we must rub along as we have done  one sniff of emotion burst from toady and for a moment he laid his head in the knifetray overcome with disappointment and regret but scorning to yield to unmanly tears he was soon himself again thrusting his beloved jackknife with three blades and a file into pollys hand he whispered brokenly  keep it forever n ever im awful sorry then feeling that the magnitude of this sacrifice atoned for everything he went to watch for vanthe forlorn hope to which he now clung   ii   sophy im surprised at your want of judgment do you really mean to let your girl marry this lamb why the mans a fool began aunt kipp after dinner by way of opening a pleasant conversation with her relatives  dear me aunt how can you know that when you never saw him mildly returned mrs snow  ive heard of him and thats enough for me ive a deal of penetration in judging character and i tell you van bahr lamb is a fool  the amiable old lady thought this would rouse polly against whom her anger still burned hotly but polly also possessed penetration and well knowing that contradiction would delight aunt kipp she completely took the wind out of her sails by coolly remarking  i like fools  bless my heart what does the girl mean ejaculated aunt kipp  just what i say if van is a fool i prefer simpletons to wiseacres i know he is shy and awkward and does absurd things now and then but i also know that he has the kindest heart that ever was is unselfish faithful and loving that he took good care of his old parents till they died and never thought of himself while they needed him he loves me dearly will wait for me a dozen years if i say so and work all his days to make me happy hes a help and comfort to mother a good friend to toady and i love and respect and am proud of him though you do say he is a fool cried polly heartily  and you insist on marrying him demanded aunt kipp  yes i do  then i wish a carriage immediately was the somewhat irrelevant reply  why aunt you dont mean to go so soon cried mrs snow with a reproachful glance at the rebellious polly  far from it i wish to see judge banks about altering my will was the awful answer  pollys face fell her mother gave a despairing sigh toady who had hovered about the door uttered a suppressed whistle of dismay and mrs kipp looked about her with vengeful satisfaction  get the big carryall and old bob so the boy can drive and all of you come the trip will do you good  it was like aunt kipp to invite her poor relations to go and nip their own noses off as she elegantly expressed it it was a party of pleasure that just suited her for all the fun was on her side she grew affable at once was quite pressing in her invitation regretted that sophy was too busy to go praised pollys hat and professed herself quite satisfied with that dear boy for a driver the dear boy distorted his young countenance frightfully behind her back but found a balm for every wound in the delight of being commander of the expedition  the big carryall appeared and with much creaking and swaying mrs kipp was got into the back seat where the big bonnet gloomed like a thundercloud polly in a high state of indignation which only made her look ten times prettier sat in front with toady who was a sight to see as he drove off with his short legs planted against the boot his elbows squared and the big whip scientifically cracking now and then away they went leaving poor mrs snow to bewail herself dismally after she had smiled and nodded them out of sight  dont go over any bridges or railroad crossings or by any sawmills said the old lady as if the town could be suddenly remodelled to suit her taste  yesm returned toady with a crack which would have done honor to a french postilion  it was a fine day and the young people would have enjoyed the ride in spite of the breakers ahead if aunt kipp hadnt entertained the girl with a glowing account of the splendors of her own wedding and aggravated the boy by frequent pokes and directions in the art of driving of which she was of course profoundly ignorant polly couldnt restrain a tear or two in thinking of her own poor little prospects and toady was goaded to desperation  ill give her a regular shaking up itll make her hold her tongue and do her good he said to himself as a stony hill sloped temptingly before him  a sly chuck and some mysterious manoeuvre with the reins and bob started off at a brisk trot as if he objected to the old lady as much as her mischievous little nephew  hold him in keep a taut rein lord a mercy hes running away shrieked aunt kipp or tried to shriek for the bouncing and bumping jerked the words out of her mouth with ludicrous incoherency  i am holding him but he will go said toady with a wicked triumph in his eye as he glanced back at polly  the next minute the words were quite true for as he spoke two or three distracted hens flew squalling over the wall and scattered about under over and before the horse as only distracted hens could do it was too much for bobs nerves and taking matters into his own hands or feet rather he broke into a run and rattled the old lady over the stones with a velocity which left her speechless  polly laughed and toady chuckled as they caught glimpses of the awful bonnet vibrating wildly in the background and felt the frantic clutchings of the old ladys hands but both grew sober as a shrill carwhistle sounded not far off and bob as if possessed by an evil spirit turned suddenly into the road that led to the railroad crossing  that will do toady now pull up for we cant get over in time said polly glancing anxiously toward the rapidly approaching puffs of white smoke  i cant pollyi really cant cried the boy tugging with all his might and beginning to look scared  polly lent her aid but bob scarcely seemed to feel it for he had been a racer once and when his blood was up he was hard to handle his own good sense might have checked him if aunt kipp hadnt unfortunately recovered her voice at this crisis and uttered a succession of the shrillest screams that ever saluted mortal ears with a snort and a bound bob dashed straight on toward the crossing as the train appeared round the bend  let me out let me out jump jump shrieked aunt kipp thrusting her head out of the window while she fumbled madly for the doorhandle  o toady save us save us gasped polly losing her presence of mind and dropping the reins to cling to her brother with a womans instinctive faith in the stronger sex  but toady held on manfully though his arms were nearly pulled off for never say die was his motto and the plucky little lad wouldnt show fear before the women  dont howl well do it hi bob and with a savage slash of the whip an exciting cry a terrible reeling and rattling they did do it for bob cleared the track at a breakneck pace just in time for the train to sweep swiftly by behind them  aunt kipp dropped in a heap polly looked up at her brother with a look which he never forgot and toady tried to say stoutly its all right with lips that were white and dry in spite of himself  we shall smash up at the bridge he muttered as they tore through the town where every one obligingly shouted waved their hats and danced about on the sidewalks doing nothing but add to bobs fright and the partys danger but toady was wrongthey did not smash up at the bridge for before they reached the perilous spot one man had the sense to fly straight at the horses head and hold on till the momentary check enabled others to lend a hand  the instant they were safe polly like a regular heroine threw herself into the arms of her dishevelled preserver who of course was van and would have refreshed herself with hysterics if the sight of toady hadnt steadied her the boy sat as stiff and rigid as a wooden figure till they took the reins from him then all the strength seemed to go out of him and he leaned against his sister as white and trembling as she whispering with an irrepressible sob  o polly wasnt it horrid tell mother i stood by you like a man do tell her that  if any one had had time or heart to laugh they certainly would have done it when after much groping heaving and hoisting mrs kipp was extricated and restored to consciousness for a more ludicrously deplorable spectacle was seldom seen quite unhurt though much shaken the old lady insisted on believing herself to be dying and kept the town in a ferment till three doctors had pronounced her perfectly well able to go home then the perversity of her nature induced her to comply that she might have the satisfaction of dying on the way and proving herself in the right  unfortunately she did not expire but having safely arrived went to bed in high dudgeon and led polly and her mother a sad life of it for two weary days having heard of toadys gallant behavior she solemnly ordered him up to receive her blessing but the sight of aunt kipps rubicund visage surrounded by the stiff frills of an immense nightcap caused the irreverent boy to explode with laughter in his handkerchief and to be hustled away by his mother before aunt kipp discovered the true cause of his convulsed appearance  ah poor dear his feelings are too much for him he sees my doom in my face and is overcome by what you refuse to believe i shant forget that boys devotion now leave me to the meditations befitting these solemn hours  mrs snow retired and aunt kipp tried to sleep but the murmur of voices and the sound of stifled laughter in the next room disturbed her repose  they are rejoicing over my approaching end knowing that i havent changed my will mercenary creatures dont exult too soon theres time yet she muttered and presently unable to control her curiosity she crept out of bed to listen and peep through the keyhole  van bahr lamb did look rather like a sheep he had a blond curly head a long face pale mild eyes a plaintive voice and a general expression of innocent timidity strongly suggestive of animated mutton but baabaa was a trump as toady emphatically declared and though every one laughed at him every one liked him and that is more than can be said of many saints and sages he adored polly was dutifully kind to her mother and had stood by t snow jr in many an hour of tribulation with fraternal fidelity though he had long blushed sighed and cast sheeps eyes at the idol of his affections only till lately had he dared to bleat forth his passion polly loved him because she couldnt help it but she was proud and wouldnt marry till aunt kipps money was hers or at least a sure prospect of it and now even the prospect of a prospect was destroyed by that irrepressible toady they were talking of this as the old lady suspected and of course the following conversation afforded her intense satisfaction  its a shame to torment us as she does knowing how poor we are and how happy a little of her money would make us im tired of being a slave to a cruel old woman just because shes rich if it was not for mother i declare id wash my hands of her entirely and do the best i could for myself  hooray for polly i always said let her money go and be jolly without it cried toady who in his character of wounded hero reposed with a lordly air on the sofa enjoying the fragrance of the opodeldoc with which his strained wrists were bandaged  its on your account children that i bear with aunts temper as i do i dont want anything for myself but i really think she owes it to your dear father who was devoted to her while he lived to provide for his children when he couldnt after which remarkably spirited speech for her mrs snow dropped a tear and stitched away on a small trouserleg which was suffering from a complicated compound fracture  dont you worry about me mother ill take care of myself and you too remarked toady with the cheery belief in impossibilities which makes youth so charming  now van tell us what to do for things have come to such a pass that we must either break away altogether or be galleyslaves as long as aunt kipp lives said polly who was a good deal excited about the matter  well really my dear i dont know hesitated van who did know what he wanted but thought it might be selfish to urge it have you tried to soften your aunts heart he asked after a moments meditation  good gracious van she hasnt got any cried polly who firmly believed it  its hossified thoughtfully remarked toady quite unconscious of any approach to a joke till every one giggled  youve had hossification enough for one while my lad laughed van well polly if the old lady has no heart youd better let her go for people without hearts are not worth much  thats a beautiful remark van and a wise one i just wish she could hear you make it for she called you a fool said polly irefully  did she well i dont mind im used to it returned van placidly and so he was for polly called him a goose every day of her life and he enjoyed it immensely  then you think dear if we stopped worrying about aunt and her money and worked instead of waiting that we shouldnt be any poorer and might be a great deal happier than we are now asked polly making a pretty little tableau as she put her hand through vans arm and looked up at him with as much love respect and reliance as if he had been six feet tall with the face of an apollo and the manners of a chesterfield  yes my dear i do for it has troubled me a good deal to see you so badgered by that very uncomfortable old lady independence is a very nice thing and poverty isnt half as bad as this sort of slavery but you are not going to be poor nor worry about anything well just be married and take mother and toady home and be as jolly as grigs and never think of mrs k againunless she loses her fortune or gets sick or comes to grief in any way wed lend her a hand then wouldnt we polly and vans mild face was pleasant to behold as he made the kindly proposition  well wed think of it said polly trying not to relent but feeling that she was going very fast  lets do it cried toady fired with the thought of privy conspiracy and rebellion mother would be so comfortable with polly and id help van in the store when ive learned that confounded multiplication table he added with a groan and if aunt kipp comes a visiting well just say not at home and let her trot off again  it sounds very nice but aunt will be dreadfully offended and i dont wish to be ungrateful said mrs snow brightening visibly  theres no ingratitude about it cried van she might have done everything to make you love and respect and admire her and been a happy useful motherly old soul but she didnt choose to and now she must take the consequences no one cares for her because she cares for nobody her moneys the plague of her life and not a single heart will ache when she dies  poor aunt kipp said polly softly  mrs snow echoed the words and for a moment all thought pitifully of the woman whose life had given so little happiness whose age had won so little reverence and whose death would cause so little regret even toady had a kind thought for her as he broke the silence saying soberly  youd better put tails on my jackets mother then the next time we get run away with aunt kipp will have something to hold on by  it was impossible to help laughing at the recollection of the old lady clutching at the boy till he had hardly a button left and at the paternal air with which he now proposed a muchdesired change of costume as if intent on aunt kipps future accommodation  under cover of the laugh the old lady stole back to bed wide awake and with subjects enough to meditate upon now the shaking up had certainly done her good for somehow the few virtues she possessed came to the surface and the mental showerbath just received had produced a salutary change polly wouldnt have doubted her aunts possession of a heart if she could have known the pain and loneliness that made it ache as the old woman crept away and toady wouldnt have laughed if he had seen the tears on the face between the big frills as aunt kipp laid it on the pillow muttering drearily  i might have been a happy useful woman but i didnt choose to and now its too late  it was too late to be all she might have been for the work of seventy selfish years couldnt be undone in a minute but with regret rose the sincere wish to earn a little love before the end came and the old perversity gave a relish to the reformation for even while she resolved to do the just and generous thing she said to herself  they say ive got no heart ill show em that i have they dont want my money ill make em take it they turn their backs on me ill just render myself so useful and agreeable that they cant do without me   iii   aunt kipp sat bolt upright in the parlor hemming a small handkerchief adorned with a red ship surrounded by a border of green monkeys toady suspected that this elegant article of dress was intended for him and yearned to possess it so taking advantage of his mothers and pollys absence he strolled into the room and seating himself on a high hard chair folded his hands crossed his legs and asked for a story with the thirstingforknowledge air which little boys wear in the moral storybooks  now aunt kipp had one soft place in her heart though it was partially ossified as she very truly declared and toady was enshrined therein she thought there never was such a child and loved him as she had done his father before him though the rack wouldnt have forced her to confess it she scolded snubbed and predicted hed come to a bad end in public but she forgave his naughtiest pranks always brought him something when she came and privately intended to make his future comfortable with half of her fortune there was a dash and daring a generosity and integrity about the little fellow that charmed her sophy was weak and lowspirited polly pretty and headstrong and aunt kipp didnt think much of either of them but toady defied distracted and delighted her and to toady she clung as the one sunshiny thing in her sour selfish old age  when he made his demure request she looked at him and her eyes began to twinkle for the childs purpose was plainly seen in the loving glances cast upon the pictorial pockethandkerchief  a story yes ill tell you one about a little boy who had a kind oldahemgrandma she was rich and hadnt made up her mind who shed leave her money to she was fond of the boya deal fonder than he deservedfor he was as mischievous a monkey as any that ever lived in a tree with a curly tail he put pepper in her snuffboxhere toady turned scarletthe cut up her bestt frisette to make a mane for his rockinghorsetoady opened his mouth impulsively but shut it again without betraying himselfhe repeated rude things to her and called her an old aggrewaterhere toady wriggled in his chair and gave a little gasp  if you are tired i wont go on observed aunt kipp mildly  im not tired m its a very interesting story replied toady with a gravity that nearly upset the old lady  well in spite of all this that kind good forgiving grandma left that bad boy twenty thousand dollars when she died what do you think of that asked aunt kipp pausing suddenly with her sharp eye on him  ii think she was a regular dear cried toady holding on to the chair with both hands as if that climax rather took him off his legs  and what did the boy do about it continued aunt kipp curiously  he bought a velocipede and gave his sister half and paid his mothers rent and put a splendid marble cherakin over the old lady and had a jolly good time and  what in the world is a cherakin laughed aunt kipp as toady paused for breath  why dont you know its a angel crying or pointing up or flapping his wings they have them over graves and ill give you the biggest one i can find when you die but im not in a very great hurry to have you  thankee dear im in no hurry myself but toady the boy did wrong in giving his sister half she didnt deserve any and the grandma left word she wasnt to have a penny of it  really cried the boy with a troubled face  yes really if he gave her any he lost it all the old lady said so now what do you think asked aunt kipp who found it impossible to pardon pollyperhaps because she was young and pretty and much beloved  toadys eyes kindled and his red cheeks grew redder still as he cried out defiantly  i think she was a selfish pigdont you  no i dont sir and im sure that little boy wasnt such a fool as to lose the money he minded his grandmas wishes and kept it all  no he didnt roared toady tumbling off his chair in great excitement he just threw it out a winder and smashed the old cherakin all to bits  aunt kipp dropped her work with a shrill squeak for she thought the boy was dangerous as he stood before her sparring away at nothing as the only vent for his indignation  it isnt an interesting story he cried and i wont hear any more and i wont have your money if i maynt go halves with polly and ill work to earn more than that and well all be jolly together and you may give your twenty thousand to the old ragbags and so i tell you aunt kipp  why toady my boy whats the matter cried a mild voice at the door as young lamb came trotting up to the rescue  never you mind baabaa i shant do it and its a mean shame polly cant have half then she could marry you and be so happy blubbered toady running to try to hide his tears of disappointment in the coatskirts of his friend  mr lamb i suppose you are that misguided young man said aunt kipp as if it was a personal insult to herself  van bahr lamb maam if you please yes thank you murmured baabaa bowing blushing and rumpling his curly fleece in bashful trepidation  dont thank me cried the old lady im not going to give you anythingfar from it i object to you altogether what business have you to come courting my niece  because i love her maam returned van with unexpected spirit  no you dont you want her money or rather my money she depends on it but youll both be disappointed for she wont have a penny of it cried aunt kipp who in spite of her good resolutions found it impossible to be amiable all at once  im glad of it burst out van indignant at her accusation i didnt want polly for the money i always doubted if she got it and i never wished her to make herself a slave to anybody ive got enough for all if were careful and when my share of the van bahr property comes we shall live in clover  whats that what property are you talking of demanded aunt kipp pricking up her ears  the great van bahr estate maam there has been a long lawsuit about it but its nearly settled and there isnt much doubt that we shall get it i am the last of our branch and my share will be a large one  oh indeed i wish you joy said aunt kipp with sudden affability for she adored wealth like a few other persons in the world but suppose you dont get it how then  then i shall try to be contented with my salary of two thousand and make polly as happy as i can money doesnt always make people happy or agreeable i find and van looked at aunt kipp in a way that would have made her hair stand erect if she had possessed any she stared at him a moment then obeying one of the odd whims that made an irascible weathercock of her she said abruptly  if you had capital should you go into business for yourself mr lambkin  yes maam at once replied van promptly  suppose you lost the van bahr money and some one offered you a tidy little sum to start with would you take it  it would depend upon who made the offer maam said van looking more like a sheep than ever as he stood staring in blank surprise  suppose it was me wouldnt you take it asked aunt kipp blandly for the new fancy pleased her  no thank you maam said van decidedly  and why not pray cried the old lady with a shrillness that made him jump and toady back to the door precipitately  because if youll excuse my speaking plainly i think you owe anything you may have to spare to your niece mrs snow and having freed his mind van joined toady ready to fly if necessary  youre an idiot sir began aunt kipp in a rage again  thank you maam and van actually laughed and bowed in return for the compliment  hold your tongue sir snapped the old lady youre a fool and sophy is another shes no strength of mind no sense about anything and would make ducks and drakes of my money in less than no time if i gave it to her as ive thought of doing  mrs kipp you forget who you are speaking to mrs snows sons love and respect her if you dont and they wont hear anything untrue or unkind said of a good woman a devoted mother and an almost friendless widow  van wasnt a dignified man at all but as he said that with a sudden flash of his mild eyes there was something in his face and manner that daunted aunt kipp more than the small fist belligerently shaken at her from behind the sofa the poor old soul was cross and worried and ashamed of herself and being as feebleminded as sophy in many respects she suddenly burst into tears and covering her face with the gay handkerchief cried as if bent on floating the red ship in a sea of salt water without delay  im a poor lonely abused old woman she moaned with a green monkey at each eye no one loves me or minds me or thanks me when i want to help em my moneys only a worryment and a burden and i dont know what to do with it for people i dont want to leave it to ought to have it and people i do like wont take it oh deary me what shall i do what shall i do  shall i tell you maam asked van gently for though she was a very provoking old lady he pitied and wished to help her  a nod and a gurgle seemed to give consent and boldly advancing van said with blush and a stammer but a very hearty voice  i think maam if youd do the right thing with your money youd be at ease and find it saved a deal of worry all round give it to mrs snow she deserves it poor lady for shes had a hard time and done her duty faithfully dont wait till you arethat is till youwell till you in point of fact die maam give it now and enjoy the happiness it will make give it kindly let them see youre glad to do it and i am sure youll find them grateful im sure you wont be lonely any more or feel that you are not loved and thanked try it maam just try it cried van getting excited by the picture he drew and i give you my word ill do my best to respect and love you like a son maam  he knew that he was promising a great deal but for pollys sake he felt that he could make even that herculean effort aunt kipp was surprised and touched but the contrary old lady couldnt make up her mind to yield so soon and wouldnt have done it if toady hadnt taken her by storm having a truly masculine horror of tears a very tender heart under his tailless jacket and being much tumbled up and down in his own mind by the events of the week the poor little lad felt nerved to attempt any novel enterprise even that of voluntarily embracing aunt kipp first a grimy little hand came on her shoulder as she sat sniffing behind the handkerchief then peeping out she saw an applecheeked face very near her own with eyes full of pity penitence and affection and then she heard a choky little voice say earnestly  dont cry aunty im sorry i was rude please be good to mother and polly and ill love and take care of you and stand by you all my life yes illill kiss you i will by george and with one promiscuous plunge the spartan boy cast himself into her arms  that finished aunt kipp she hugged him dose and cried out with a salute that went off like a pistolshot  oh my dear my dear this is better than a dozen cherakins  when toady emerged somewhat flushed and tumbled mrs snow polly and van were looking on with faces full of wonder doubt and satisfaction to be an object of interest was agreeable to aunt kipp and as her old heart was really softened she met them with a gracious smile and extended the olivebranch generally  sophy i shall give my money to you at once and entirely only asking that youll let me stay with you when pollys gone ill do my best to be agreeable and youll bear with me because im a cranky solitary old woman and i loved your husband  mrs snow hugged her on the spot and gushed of course murmuring thanks welcomes and promises in one grateful burst  polly i forgive you i consent to your marriage and will provide your wedding finery mr lamb you are not a fool but a very excellent young man i thank you for saving my life and i wish you well with all my heart you neednt say anything im far from strong and all this agitation is shortening my life  polly and van shook her hand heartily and beamed upon each other like a pair of infatuated turtledoves with good prospects  toady you are as near an angel as a boy can be put a name to whatever you most wish for in the world and its yours said aunt kipp dramatically waving the rest away  with his short legs wide apart his hands behind him and his rosy face as round and radiant as a rising sun toady stood before the fire surveying the scene with the air of a man who has successfully carried through a difficult and dangerous undertaking and wasnt proud his face brightened then fell as he heaved a sigh and answered with a shake of his curly head  you cant give me what i want most there are three things and ive got to wait for them all  gracious me what are they cried the old lady goodnaturedly for she felt better already  a mustache a beaver and a sweetheart answered toady with his eyes fixed wistfully on baabaa who possessed all these blessings and was particularly enjoying the latter at that moment  how aunt kipp did laugh at this early budding of romance in her pet and all the rest joined her for toadys sentimental air was irresistible  you precocious chick i dare say you will have them all before we know where we are never mind deary you shall have my little watch and the silverheaded cane with a boars head on it answered the old lady in high goodhumor you neednt blush dear i dont bear malice so lets forget and forgive i shall settle things tomorrow and have a free mind you are welcome to my money and i hope i shall live to see you all enjoy it  so she did for she lived to see sophy plump cheery and carefree polly surrounded by a flock of lambkins van in possession of a generous slice of the van bahr fortune toady revelling in the objects of his desire and best of all she lived to find that it is never too late to make oneself useful happy and beloved     psyches art  handsome is that handsome does   i   once upon a time there raged in a certain city one of those fashionable epidemics which occasionally attack our youthful population it wasnt the music mania nor gymnastic convulsions nor that widespread malady croquet neither was it one of the new dances which like a tarantulabite set every one a twirling nor stage madness nor yet that american lecturing influenza which yearly sweeps over the land no it was a new disease called the art fever and it attacked the young women of the community with great violence  nothing but time could cure it and it ran its course to the dismay amusement or edification of the beholders for its victims did all manner of queer things in their delirium they begged potteries for clay drove italian plastercorkers out of their wits with unexecutable orders got neuralgia and rheumatism sketching perched on fences and trees like artistic hens and caused a rise in the price of bread paper and charcoal by their ardor in crayoning they covered canvas with the expedition of scenepainters had classes lectures receptions and exhibitions made models of each other and rendered their walls hideous with bad likenesses of all their friends their conversation ceased to be intelligible to the uninitiated and they prattled prettily of chiaro oscuro french sauce refraction of the angle of the eye seventh spinus process depth and juiciness of color tender touch and a good tone even in dress the artistic disorder was visible some cast aside crinoline altogether and stalked about with a severe simplicity of outline worthy of flaxman others flushed themselves with scarlet that no landscape which they adorned should be without some touch of turners favorite tint some were blue in every sense of the word and the heads of all were adorned with classic braids curls tied hebewise or hair dressed a la hurricane  it was found impossible to keep them safe at home and as the fever grew these harmless maniacs invaded the sacred retreats where artists of the other sex did congregate startling those anchorites with visions of largeeyed damsels bearing portfolios in hands delicately begrimed with crayon chalk and clay gliding through the corridors hitherto haunted only by shabby paletots shadowy hats and cigar smoke this irruption was borne with manly fortitude not to say cheerfulness for studio doors stood hospitably open as the fair invaders passed and studies from life were generously offered them in glimpses of picturesque gentlemen posed before easels brooding over masterpieces in a divine despair or attitudinizing upon couches as if exhausted by the soarings of genius  an atmosphere of romance began to pervade the old buildings when the girls came and nature and art took turns there were peepings and whisperings much stifled laughter and whisking in and out not to mention the accidental rencontres small services and eye telegrams which somewhat lightened the severe studies of all parties  half a dozen young victims of this malady met daily in one of the cells of a great art beehive called raphaels rooms and devoted their shining hours to modelling fancy heads gossiping the while for the poor things found the road to fame rather dull and dusty without such verbal sprinklings  psyche dean youve had an adventure i see it in your face so tell it at once for we are stupid as owls here today cried one of the sisterhood as a brighteyed girl entered with some precipitation  i dropped my portfolio and a man picked it up thats all replied psyche hurrying on her gray linen pinafore  that wont do i know something interesting happened for youve been blushing and you look brisker than usual this morning said the first speaker polishing off the massive nose of her homer  it wasnt anything began psyche a little reluctantly i was coming up in a hurry when i ran against a man coming down in a hurry my portfolio slipped and my papers went flying all about the landing of course we both laughed and begged pardon and i began to pick them up but he wouldnt let me so i held the book while he collected the sketches i saw him glance at them as he did so and that made me blush for they are wretched things you know  not a bit of it they are capital and you are a regular genius as we all agree cut in the homeric miss cutter  never tell people they are geniuses unless you wish to spoil them returned psyche severely well when the portfolio was put to rights i was going on but he fell to picking up a little bunch of violets i had dropped you know i always wear a posy into town to give me inspiration i didnt care for the dusty flowers and told him so and hurried away before any one came at the top of the stairs i peeped over the railing and there he was gathering up every one of those halfdead violets as carefully as if they had been tearoses  psyche dean you have met your fate this day exclaimed a third damsel with strawcolored tresses and a good deal of weedy shrubbery in her hat which gave an ophelialike expression to her sentimental countenance  psyche frowned and shook her head as if half sorry she had told her little story  was he handsome asked miss larkins the believer in fate  i didnt particularly observe  it was the redheaded man whom we call titian hes always on the stairs  no it wasnt his hair was brown and curly cried psyche innocently falling into the trap  like peerybingles baby when its cap was taken off quoted miss dickenson who pined to drop the last two letters of her name  was it murillo the blackeyed one asked the fair cutter for the girls had a name for all the attitudinizers and promenaders whom they oftenest met  no he had gray eyes and very fine ones they were too answered psyche adding as if to herself he looked as i imagine michael angelo might have looked when young  had he a broken nose like the great mike asked an irreverent damsel  if he had no one would mind it for his head is splendid he took his hat off so i had a fine view he isnt handsome but hell do something said psyche prophetically as she recalled the strong ambitious face which she had often observed but never mentioned before  well dear considering that you didnt particularly look at the man youve given us a very good idea of his appearance well call him michael angelo and he shall be your idol i prefer stout old rembrandt myself and larkie adores that dandified raphael said the lively cutter slapping away at homers bald pate energetically as she spoke  raphael is a dear but rubens is more to my taste now returned miss larkins he was in the hall yesterday talking with sir joshua who had his inevitable umbrella like a true englishman just as i came up the umbrella fell right before me i started back sir joshua laughed but rubens said deuce take it and caught up the umbrella giving me a nevertobeforgotten look it was perfectly thrilling  whichthe umbrella the speech or the look asked psyche who was not sentimental  ah you have no soul for art in nature and nature in art sighed the ambertressed larkins i have for i feed upon a glance a tint a curve with exquisite delight rubens is adorable as a study that lustrous eye that night of hair that sumptuous cheek are perfect he only needs a cloak lace collar and slouching hat to be the genuine thing  this isnt the genuine thing by any means what does it need said psyche looking with a despondent air at the head on her stand  many would have pronounced it a clever thing the nose was strictly greek the chin curved upward gracefully the mouth was sweetly haughty the brow classically smooth and low and the breezy hair well done but something was wanting psyche felt that and could have taken her venus by the dimpled shoulders and given her a hearty shake if that would have put strength and spirit into the lifeless face  now i am perfectly satisfied with my apollo though you all insist that it is the image of theodore smythe he says so himself and assures me it will make a sensation when we exhibit remarked miss larkins complacently caressing the ambrosial locks of her smythified phebus  what shall you do if it does not asked miss cutter with elegance  i shall feel that i have mistaken my sphere shall drop my tools veil my bust and cast myself into the arms of nature since art rejects me replied miss larkins with a tragic gesture and an expression which strongly suggested that in her eyes nature meant theodore  she must have capacious arms if she is to receive all arts rejected admirers shall i be one of them  psyche put the question to herself as she turned to work but somehow ambitious aspirations were not in a flourishing condition that morning her heart was not in tune and head and hands sympathized nothing went well for certain neglected homeduties had dogged her into town and now worried her more than dust or heat or the ceaseless clatter of tongues tom dick and harrys unmended hose persisted in dancing a spectral jig before her mental eye mothers querulous complaints spoilt the song she hummed to cheer herself and little mays wistful face put the goddess of beauty entirely out of countenance  its no use i cant work till the clay is wet again where is giovanni she asked throwing down her tools with a petulant gesture and a dejected air  he is probably playing truant in the empty upper rooms as usual i cant wait for him any longer so im doing his work myself answered miss dickenson who was tenderly winding a wet bandage round her junos face one side of which was so much plumper than the other that it looked as if the queen of olympus was being hydropathically treated for a severe fit of ague  ill go and find the little scamp a run will do me good so will a breath of air and a view of the park from the upper windows  doffing her apron psyche strolled away up an unfrequented staircase to the empty apartments which seemed to be too high even for the lovers of high art on the western side they were shady and cool and leaning from one of the windows psyche watched the feathery treetops ruffled by the balmy wind that brought spring odors from the hills lying green and sunny far away silence and solitude were such pleasant companions that the girl forgot herself till a shrill whistle disturbed her daydreams and reminded her what she came for following the sound she found the little italian errandboy busily uncovering a clay model which stood in the middle of a scantily furnished room near by  he is not here come and look it is greatly beautiful cried giovanni beckoning with an air of importance  psyche did look and speedily forgot both her errand and herself it was the figure of a man standing erect and looking straight before him with a wonderfully lifelike expression it was neither a mythological nor a historical character psyche thought and was glad of it being tired to death of gods and heroes she soon ceased to wonder what it was feeling only the indescribable charm of something higher than beauty small as her knowledge was she could see and enjoy the power visible in every part of it the accurate anatomy of the vigorous limbs the grace of the pose the strength and spirit in the countenance clay though it was a majestic figure but the spell lay in the face which while it suggested the divine was full of human truth and tenderness for pain and passion seemed to have passed over it and a humility half pathetic a courage half heroic seemed to have been born from some great loss or woe  how long she stood there psyche did not know giovanni went away unseen to fill his waterpail and in the silence she just stood and looked her eyes kindled her color rose despondency and discontent vanished and her soul was in her face for she loved beauty passionately and all that was best and truest in her did honor to the genius of the unknown worker  if i could do a thing like that id die happy she exclaimed impetuously as a feeling of despair came over her at the thought of her own poor attempts  who did it giovanni she asked still looking up at the grand face with unsatisfied eyes  paul gage  it was not the boys voice and with a start psyche turned to see her michael angelo standing in the doorway attentively observing her being too full of artless admiration to think of herself just yet she neither blushed nor apologized but looked straight at him saying heartily  you have done a wonderful piece of work and i envy you more than i can tell  the enthusiasm in her face the frankness of her manner seemed to please him for there was no affectation about either he gave her a keen kind glance out of the fine gray eyes a little bow and a grateful smile saying quietlythen my adam is not a failure in spite of his fall  psyche turned from the sculptor to his model with increased admiration in her face and earnestness in her voice as she exclaimed delighted  adam i might have known it was he o sir you have indeed succeeded for you have given that figure the power and pathos of the first man who sinned and suffered and began again  then i am satisfied that was all he said but the look he gave his work was a very eloquent one for it betrayed that he had paid the price of success in patience and privation labor and hope  what can one do to learn your secret asked the girl wistfully for there was nothing in the mans manner to disturb her selfforgetful mood but much to foster it because to the solitary worker this confiding guest was as welcome as the doves who often hopped in at his window  work and wait and meantime feed heart soul and imagination with the best food one can get he answered slowly finding it impossible to give a receipt for genius  i can work and wait a long time to gain my end but i dont know where to find the food you speak of she answered looking at him like a hungry child  i wish i could tell you but each needs different fare and each must look for it in different places  the kindly tone and the sympathizing look as well as the lines in his forehead and a few gray hairs among the brown gave psyche courage to say more  i love beauty so much that i not only want to possess it myself but to gain the power of seeing it in all things and the art of reproducing it with truth i have tried very hard to do it but something is wanting and in spite of my intense desire i never get on  as she spoke the girls eyes filled and fell in spite of herself and turning a little with sudden shamefacedness she saw lying on the table beside her among other scraps in manuscript and print the wellknown lines    i slept and dreamed that life was beauty   i woke and found that life was duty   was thy dream then a shadowy lie   toil on sad heart courageously   and thou shall find thy dream to be   a noonday light and truth to thee  she knew them at a glance had read them many times but now they came home to her with sudden force and seeing that his eye had followed hers she said in her impulsive fashion  is doing ones duty a good way to feed heart soul and imagination  as if he had caught a glimpse of what was going on in her mind paul answered emphatically  excellent for if one is good one is happy and if happy one can work well moulding character is the highest sort of sculpture and all of us should learn that art before we touch clay or marble  he spoke with the energy of a man who believed what he said and did his best to be worthy of the rich gift bestowed upon him the sight of her violets in a glass of water and giovanni staring at her with round eyes suddenly recalled psyche to a sense of the proprieties which she had been innocently outraging for the last ten minutes a sort of panic seized her she blushed deeply retreated precipitately to the door and vanished murmuring thanks and apologies as she went  did you find him i thought you had forgotten said miss dickenson now hard at work  yes i found him no i shall not forget returned psyche thinking of gage not giovanni  she stood before her work eying it intently for several minutes then with an expression of great contempt for the whole thing she suddenly tilted her cherished venus on to the floor gave the classical face a finishing crunch and put on her hat in a decisive manner saying briefly to the dismayed damsels  goodby girls i shant come any more for im going to work at home hereafter   ii   the prospect of pursuing artistic studies at home was not brilliant as one may imagine when i mention that psyches father was a painfully prosaic man wrapt in flannel so to speak for his woollen mills left him no time for anything but sleep food and newspapers mrs dean was one of those exasperating women who pervade their mansions like a domestic steamengine one week and take to their sofas the next absorbed by fidgets and footstoves shawls and lamentations there were three riotous and robust young brothers whom it is unnecessary to describe except by stating that they were boys in the broadest sense of that delightful word there was a feeble little sister whose patient suffering face demanded constant love and care to mitigate the weariness of a life of pain and last but not least by any means there were two irish ladies who with the best intentions imaginable produced a universal state of topsyturviness when left to themselves for a moment  but being very much in earnest about doing her duty not because it was her duty but as a means toward an end psyche fell to work with a will hoping to serve both masters at once so she might have done perhaps if flesh and blood had been as plastic as clay but the live models were so exacting in their demands upon her time and strength that the poor statues went to the wall sculpture and sewing calls and crayons ruskin and receiptbooks didnt work well together and poor psyche found duties and desires desperately antagonistic take a day as a sample  the washing and ironing are well over thank goodness mother quiet the boys out of the way and may comfortable so ill indulge myself in a blissful day after my own heart psyche said as she shut herself into her little studio and prepared to enjoy a few hours of hard study and happy daydreams  with a book on her lap and her own round white arm going through all manner of queer evolutions she was placidly repeating deltoides biceps triceps pronator supinator palmanis flexor carpi ulnaris  heres flexis whatyoucallums for you interrupted a voice which began in a shrill falsetto and ended in a gruff bass as a flushed dusty longlegged boy burst in with a bleeding hand obligingly extended for inspection  mercy on us harry what have you done to yourself now split your fingers with a cricketball again cried psyche as her arms went up and her book went down  i just thrashed one of the fellows because he got mad and said father was going to fail  o harry is he  of course he isnt its hard times for every one but father will pull through all right no use to try and explain it all girls cant understand business so you just tie me up and dont worry was the characteristic reply of the young man who being three years her junior of course treated the weaker vessel with lordly condescension  what a dreadful wound i hope nothing is broken for i havent studied the hand much yet and may do mischief doing it up said psyche examining the great grimy paw with tender solicitude  much good your biceps and deltoids and things do you if you cant right up a little cut like that squeaked the ungrateful hero  im not going to be a surgeon thank heaven i intend to make perfect hands and arms not mend damaged ones retorted psyche in a dignified tone somewhat marred by a great piece of courtplaster on her tongue  i should say a surgeon could improve that perfect thing if he didnt die alaughing before he began growled harry pointing with a scornful grin at a clay arm humpy with muscles all carefully developed in the wrong places  dont sneer hal for you dont know anything about it wait a few years and see if youre not proud of me  sculp away and do something then ill hurrah for your mudpies like a good one with which cheering promise the youth left having effectually disturbed his sisters peaceful mood  anxious thoughts of her father rendered biceps deltoids and things uninteresting and hoping to compose her mind she took up the old painters and went on with the story of claude lorraine she had just reached the tender scene where  calista gazed with enthusiasm while she looked like a being of heaven rather than earth my friend she cried i read in thy picture thy immortality as she spoke her head sunk upon his bosom and it was several moments before claude perceived that he supported a lifeless form  how sweet said psyche with a romantic sigh  faith and swate it is thin echoed katy whose red head had just appeared round the half opened door its gingybread im making the day miss and will i be puttin purlash or sallyrathis into it if ye plase  purlash by all means returned the girl keeping her countenance fearing to enrage katy by a laugh for the angry passions of the redhaired one rose more quickly than her bread  as she departed with alacrity to add a spoonful of starch and a pinch of whiting to her cake psyche feeling better for her story and her smile put on her bib and paper cap and fell to work on the deformed arm an hour of bliss then came a ring at the doorbell followed by biddy to announce callers and add that as the mistress was in her bed miss must go and take care of em whereat miss cast down her tools in despair threw her cap one way her bib another and went in to her guests with anything but a rapturous welcome  dinner being accomplished after much rushing up and down stairs with trays and messages for mrs dean psyche fled again to her studio ordering no one to approach under pain of a scolding all went well till going in search of something she found her little sister sitting on the floor with her cheek against the studio door  i didnt mean to be naughty sy but mother is asleep and the boys all gone so i just came to be near you its so lonely everywhere she said apologetically as she lifted up the heavy head that always ached  the boys are very thoughtless come in and stay with me you are such a mouse you wont disturb me wouldnt you like to play be a model and let me draw your arm and tell you all about the nice little bones and muscles asked psyche who had the fever very strong upon her just then  may didnt look as if the proposed amusement overwhelmed her with delight but meekly consented to be perched upon a high stool with one arm propped up by a dropsical plaster cherub while psyche drew busily feeling that duty and pleasure were being delightfully combined  cant you hold your arm still child it shakes so i cant get it right she said rather impatiently  no it will tremble cause its weak i try hard sy but there doesnt seem to be much strongness in me lately  thats better keep it so a few minutes and ill be done cried the artist forgetting that a few minutes may seem ages  my arm is so thin you can see the bunches nicelycant you  yes dear  psyche glanced up at the wasted limb and when she drew again there was a blur before her eyes for a minute  i wish i was as fat as this white boy but i get thinner every day somehow and pretty soon there wont be any of me left but my little bones said the child looking at the winged cherub with sorrowful envy  dont my darling dont say that cried psyche dropping her work with a sudden pang at her heart im a sinful selfish girl to keep you here youre weak for want of air come out and see the chickens and pick dandelions and have a good romp with the boys  the weak arms were strong enough to clasp psyches neck and the tired face brightened beautifully as the child exclaimed with grateful delight  oh id like it very much i wanted to go dreadfully but everybody is so busy all the time i dont want to play sy but just to lie on the grass with my head in your lap while you tell stories and draw me pretty things as you used to  the studio was deserted all that afternoon for psyche sat in the orchard drawing squirrels on the wall pert robins hopping by buttercups and mosses elves and angels while may lay contentedly enjoying sun and air sisterly care and the pretty things she loved so well psyche did not find the task a hard one for this time her heart was in it and if she needed any reward she surely found it for the little face on her knee lost its weary look and the peace and beauty of nature soothed her own troubled spirit cheered her heart and did her more good than hours of solitary study  finding much to her own surprise that her fancy was teeming with lovely conceits she did hope for a quiet evening but mother wanted a bit of gossip father must have his papers read to him the boys had lessons and rips and grievances to be attended to mays lullaby could not be forgotten and the maids had to be looked after lest burly cousins should be hidden in the boiler or lucifer matches among the shavings so psyches day ended leaving her very tired rather discouraged and almost heartsick with the shadow of a coming sorrow  all summer she did her best but accomplished very little as she thought yet this was the teaching she most needed and in time she came to see it in the autumn may died whispering with her arms about her sisters neck  you make me so happy sy i wouldnt mind the pain if i could stay a little longer but if i cant goodby dear goodby  her last look and word and kiss were all for psyche who felt then with grateful tears that her summer had not been wasted for the smile upon the little dead face was more to her than any marble perfection her hands could have carved  in the solemn pause which death makes in every family psyche said with the sweet selfforgetfulness of a strong yet tender nature  i must not think of myself but try to comfort them and with this resolution she gave herself heart and soul to duty never thinking of reward  a busy anxious humdrum winter for as harry said it was hard times for every one mr dean grew gray with the weight of business cares about which he never spoke mrs dean laboring under the delusion that an invalid was a necessary appendage to the family installed herself in the place the childs death left vacant and the boys needed much comforting for the poor lads never knew how much they loved the baby till the little chair stood empty all turned to sy for help and consolation and her strength seemed to increase with the demand upon it patience and cheerfulness courage and skill came at her call like good fairies who had bided their time housekeeping ceased to be hateful and peace reigned in parlor and kitchen while mrs dean shrouded in shawls read hahnemanns lesser writings on her sofa mr dean sometimes forgot his mills when a bright face came to meet him a gentle hand smoothed the wrinkles out of his anxious forehead and a daughterly heart sympathized with all his cares the boys found home very pleasant with sy always there ready to lend a hand whether it was to make fancy ties help conjugate a confounded verb pull candy or sing sweetly in the twilight when all thought of little may and grew quiet  the studio door remained locked till her brothers begged psyche to open it and make a bust of the child a flush of joy swept over her face at the request and her patient eyes grew bright and eager as a thirsty travellers might at the sight or sound of water then it faded as she shook her head saying with a regretful sigh im afraid ive lost the little skill i ever had  but she tried and with great wonder and delight discovered that she could work as she had never done before she thought the newly found power lay in her longing to see the little face again for it grew like magic under her loving hands while every tender memory sweet thought and devout hope she had ever cherished seemed to lend their aid but when it was done and welcomed with tears and smiles and praise more precious than any the world could give then psyche said within herself like one who saw light at last  he was right doing ones duty is the way to feed heart soul and imagination for if one is good one is happy and if happy one can work well   iii   she broke her head and went home to come no more was giovannis somewhat startling answer when paul asked about psyche finding that he no longer met her on the stairs or in the halls he understood what the boy meant and with an approving nod turned to his work again saying i like that if there is any power in her she has taken the right way to find it out i suspect  how she prospered he never asked for though he met her more than once that year the interviews were brief ones in street concertroom or picturegallery and she carefully avoided speaking of herself but possessing the gifted eyes which can look below the surface of things he detected in the girls face something better than beauty though each time he saw it it looked older and more thoughtful often anxious and sad  she is getting on he said to himself with a cordial satisfaction which gave his manner a friendliness as grateful to psyche as his wise reticence  adam was finished at last proved a genuine success and paul heartily enjoyed the wellearned reward for years of honest work one blithe may morning he slipped early into the artgallery where the statue now stood to look at his creation with paternal pride he was quite alone with the stately figure that shone white against the purple draperies and seemed to offer him a voiceless welcome from its marble lips he gave it one loving look and then forgot it for at the feet of his adam lay a handful of wild violets with the dew still on them a sudden smile broke over his face as he took them up with the thought she has been here and found my work good  for several moments he stood thoughtfully turning the flowers to and fro in his hands then as if deciding some question within himself he said still smiling  it is just a year since she went home she must have accomplished something in that time ill take the violets as a sign that i may go and ask her what  he knew she lived just out of the city between the river and the mills and as he left the streets behind him he found more violets blooming all along the way like flowery guides to lead him right greener grew the road balmier blew the wind and blither sang the birds as he went on enjoying his holiday with the zest of a boy until he reached a most attractive little path winding away across the fields the gate swung invitingly open and all the ground before it was blue with violets still following their guidance he took the narrow path till coming to a mossy stone beside a brook he sat down to listen to the blackbirds singing deliciously in the willows over head close by the stone half hidden in the grass lay a little book and taking it up he found it was a pocketdiary no name appeared on the flyleaf and turning the pages to find some clue to its owner he read here and there enough to give him glimpses into an innocent and earnest heart which seemed to be learning some hard lesson patiently only near the end did he find the clue in words of his own spoken long ago and a name then though longing intensely to know more he shut the little book and went on showing by his altered face that the simple record of a girls life had touched him deeply  soon an old house appeared nestling to the hillside with the river shining in the low green meadows just before it  she lives there he said with as much certainty as if the pansies by the doorstone spelt her name and knocking he asked for psyche  shes gone to town but i expect her home every minute ask the gentleman to walk in and wait katy cried a voice from above where the whisk of skirts was followed by the appearance of an inquiring eye over the banisters  the gentleman did walk in and while he waited looked about him the room though very simply furnished had a good deal of beauty in it for the pictures were few and well chosen the books such as never grow old the music lying on the wellworn piano of the sort which is never out of fashion and standing somewhat apart was one small statue in a recess full of flowers lovely in its simple grace and truth was the figure of a child looking upward as if watching the airy flight of some butterfly which had evidently escaped from the chrysalis still lying in the little hand  paul was looking at it with approving eyes when mrs dean appeared with his card in her hand three shawls on her shoulders and in her face a somewhat startled expression as if she expected some novel demonstration from the man whose genius her daughter so much admired  i hope miss psyche is well began paul with great discrimination if not originality  the delightfully commonplace remark tranquillized mrs dean at once and taking off the upper shawl with a fussy gesture she settled herself for a chat  yes thank heaven sy is well i dont know what would become of us if she wasnt it has been a hard and sorrowful year for us with mr deans business embarrassments my feeble health and mays death i dont know that you were aware of our loss sir and unaffected maternal grief gave sudden dignity to the faded fretful face of the speaker  paul murmured his regrets understanding better now the pathetic words on a certain tearstained page of the little book still in his pocket  poor dear she suffered everything and it came very hard upon sy for the child wasnt happy with any one else and almost lived in her arms continued mrs dean dropping the second shawl to get her handkerchief  miss psyche has not had much time for artstudies this year i suppose said paul hoping to arrest the shower natural as it was  how could she with two invalids the housekeeping her father and the boys to attend to no she gave that up last spring and though it was a great disappointment to her at the time she has got over it now i hope added her mother remembering as she spoke that psyche even now went about the house sometimes pale and silent with a hungry look in her eyes  i am glad to hear it though a little shadow passed over his face as paul spoke for he was too true an artist to believe that any work could be as happy as that which he loved and lived for i thought there was much promise in miss psyche and i sincerely believe that time will prove me a true prophet he said with mingled regret and hope in his voice as he glanced about the room which betrayed the tastes still cherished by the girl  im afraid ambition isnt good for women i mean the sort that makes them known by coming before the public in any way but sy deserves some reward im sure and i know shell have it for a better daughter never lived  here the third shawl was cast off as if the thought of psyche or the presence of a genial guest had touched mrs deans chilly nature with a comfortable warmth  further conversation was interrupted by the avalanche of boys which came tumbling down the front stairs as tom dick and harry shouted in a sort of chorus  sy my balloon has got away lend us a hand at catching him  sy i want a lot of paste made right off  sy ive split my jacket down the back come sew me up theres a dear  on beholding a stranger the young gentlemen suddenly lost their voices found their manners and with nods and grins took themselves away as quietly as could be expected of six clumping boots and an unlimited quantity of animal spirits in a high state of effervescence as they trooped off an unmistakable odor of burnt milk pervaded the air and the crash of china followed by an irish wail caused mrs dean to clap on her three shawls again and excuse herself in visible trepidation  paul laughed quietly to himself then turned sober and said poor psyche with a sympathetic sigh he roamed about the room impatiently till the sound of voices drew him to the window to behold the girl coming up the walk with her tired old father leaning on one arm the other loaded with baskets and bundles and her hands occupied by a remarkably ugly turtle  here we are cried a cheery voice as they entered without observing the newcomer ive done all my errands and had a lovely time there is toms gunpowder dicks fishhooks and one of professor gazzys famous turtles for harry here are your bundles mother dear and best of all heres father home in time for a good rest before dinner i went to the mill and got him  psyche spoke as if she had brought a treasure and so she had for though mr deans face usually was about as expressive as the turtles it woke and warmed with the affection which his daughter had fostered till no amount of flannel could extinguish it his big hand patted her cheek very gently as he said in a tone of fatherly love and pride  my little sy never forgets old father does she  good gracious me my dear theres such a mess in the kitchen katys burnt up the pudding put castoroil instead of olive in the salad smashed the best meatdish and heres mr gage come to dinner cried mrs dean in accents of despair as she tied up her head in a fourth shawl  oh im so glad ill go in and see him a few minutes and then ill come and attend to everything so dont worry mother  how did you find me out asked psyche as she shook hands with her guest and stood looking up at him with all the old confiding frankness in her face and manner  the violets showed me the way  she glanced at the posy in his buttonhole and smiled  yes i gave them to adam but i didnt think you would guess i enjoyed your work for an hour today and i have no words strong enough to express my admiration  there is no need of any tell me about yourself what have you been doing all this year he asked watching with genuine satisfaction the serene and sunny face before him for discontent anxiety and sadness were no longer visible there  ive been working and waiting she began  and succeeding if i may believe what i see and hear and read he said with an expressive little wave of the book as he laid it down before her  my diary i didnt know i had lost it where did you find it  by the brook where i stopped to rest the moment i saw your name i shut it up forgive me but i cant ask pardon for reading a few pages of that little gospel of patience love and selfdenial  she gave him a reproachful look and hurried the telltale book out of sight as she said with a momentary shadow on her face  it has been a hard task but i think i have learned it and am just beginning to find that my dream is a noonday light and truth to me  then you do not relinquish your hopes and lay down your tools he asked with some eagerness  never i thought at first that i could not serve two masters but in trying to be faithful to one i find i am nearer and dearer to the other my cares and duties are growing lighter every day or i have learned to bear them better and when my leisure does come i shall know how to use it for my head is full of ambitious plans and i feel that i can do something now  all the old enthusiasm shone in her eyes and a sense of power betrayed itself in voice and gesture as she spoke  i believe it he said heartily you have learned the secret as that proves  psyche looked at the childish image as he pointed to it and into her face there came a motherly expression that made it very sweet  that little sister was so dear to me i could not fail to make her lovely for i put my heart into my work the year has gone but i dont regret it though this is all i have done  you forget your three wishes i think the year has granted them  what were they  to possess beauty in yourself the power of seeing it in all things and the art of reproducing it with truth  she colored deeply under the glance which accompanied the threefold compliment and answered with grateful humility  you are very kind to say so i wish i could believe it then as if anxious to forget herself she added rather abruptly  i hear you think of giving your adam a matehave you begun yet  yes my design is finished all but the face  i should think you could image eves beauty since you have succeeded so well with adams  the features perhaps but not the expression that is the charm of feminine faces a charm so subtile that few can catch and keep it i want a truly womanly face one that shall be sweet and strong without being either weak or hard a hopeful loving earnest face with a tender touch of motherliness in it and perhaps the shadow of a grief that has softened but not saddened it  it will be hard to find a face like that  i dont expect to find it in perfection but one sometimes sees faces which suggest all this and in rare moments give glimpses of a lovely possibility  i sincerely hope you will find one then said psyche thinking of the dinner  thank you i think i have  now in order that every one may be suited we will stop here and leave our readers to finish the story as they like those who prefer the good old fashion may believe that the hero and heroine fell in love were married and lived happily ever afterward but those who can conceive of a world outside of a weddingring may believe that the friends remained faithful friends all their lives while paul won fame and fortune and psyche grew beautiful with the beauty of a serene and sunny nature happy in duties which became pleasures rich in the art which made life lovely to herself and others and brought rewards in time     a country christmas  a handful of good life is worth a bushel of learning   dear emilyi have a brilliant idea and at once hasten to share it with you three weeks ago i came up here to the wilds of vermont to visit my old aunt also to get a little quiet and distance in which to survey certain new prospects which have opened before me and to decide whether i will marry a millionnaire and become a queen of society or remain the charming miss vaughan and wait till the conquering hero comes  aunt plumy begs me to stay over christmas and i have consented as i always dread the formal dinner with which my guardian celebrates the day  my brilliant idea is this im going to make it a real oldfashioned frolic and wont you come and help me you will enjoy it immensely i am sure for aunt is a character cousin saul worth seeing and ruth a far prettier girl than any of the city rosebuds coming out this season bring leonard randal along with you to take notes for his new books then it will be fresher and truer than the last clever as it was  the air is delicious up here society amusing this old farmhouse full of treasures and your bosom friend pining to embrace you just telegraph yes or no and we will expect you on tuesday  ever yours  sophie vaughan   they will both come for they are as tired of city life and as fond of change as i am said the writer of the above as she folded her letter and went to get it posted without delay  aunt plumy was in the great kitchen making pies a jolly old soul with a face as ruddy as a winter apple a cheery voice and the kindest heart that ever beat under a gingham gown pretty ruth was chopping the mince and singing so gaily as she worked that the fourandtwenty immortal blackbirds could not have put more music into a pie than she did saul was piling wood into the big oven and sophie paused a moment on the threshold to look at him for she always enjoyed the sight of this stalwart cousin whom she likened to a norse viking with his fair hair and beard keen blue eyes and six feet of manly height with shoulders that looked broad and strong enough to bear any burden  his back was toward her but he saw her first and turned his flushed face to meet her with the sudden lighting up it always showed when she approached  ive done it aunt and now i want saul to post the letter so we can get a speedy answer  just as soon as i can hitch up cousin and saul pitched in his last log looking ready to put a girdle round the earth in less than forty minutes  well dear i aint the least mite of objection as long as it pleases you i guess we can stan it ef your city folks can i presume to say things will look kind of singlar to em but i spose thats what they come for idle folks do dreadful queer things to amuse em and aunt plumy leaned on the rollingpin to smile and nod with a shrewd twinkle of her eye as if she enjoyed the prospect as much as sophie did  i shall be afraid of em but ill try not to make you ashamed of me said ruth who loved her charming cousin even more than she admired her  no fear of that dear they will be the awkward ones and you must set them at ease by just being your simple selves and treating them as if they were everyday people nell is very nice and jolly when she drops her city ways as she must here she will enter into the spirit of the fun at once and i know youll all like her mr randal is rather the worse for too much praise and petting as successful people are apt to be so a little plain talk and rough work will do him good he is a true gentleman in spite of his airs and elegance and he will take it all in good part if you treat him like a man and not a lion  ill see to him said saul who had listened with great interest to the latter part of sophies speech evidently suspecting a lover and enjoying the idea of supplying him with a liberal amount of plain talk and rough work  ill keep em busy if thats what they need for there will be a sight to do and we cant get help easy up here our darters dont hire out much work to home till they marry and dont go gaddin round gettin their heads full of foolish notions and forgettin all the useful things their mothers taught em  aunt plumy glanced at ruth as she spoke and a sudden color in the girls cheeks proved that the words hit certain ambitious fancies of this pretty daughter of the house of basset  they shall do their parts and not be a trouble ill see to that for you certainly are the dearest aunt in the world to let me take possession of you and yours in this way cried sophie embracing the old lady with warmth  saul wished the embrace could be returned by proxy as his mothers hands were too floury to do more than hover affectionately round the delicate face that looked so fresh and young beside her wrinkled one as it could not be done he fled temptation and hitched up without delay  the three women laid their heads together in his absence and sophies plan grew apace for ruth longed to see a real novelist and a fine lady and aunt plumy having plans of her own to further said yes dear to every suggestion  great was the arranging and adorning that went on that day in the old farmhouse for sophie wanted her friends to enjoy this taste of country pleasures and knew just what additions would be indispensable to their comfort what simple ornaments would be in keeping with the rustic stage on which she meant to play the part of prima donna  next day a telegram arrived accepting the invitation for both the lady and the lion they would arrive that afternoon as little preparation was needed for this impromptu journey the novelty of which was its chief charm to these blas√© people  saul wanted to get out the double sleigh and span for he prided himself on his horses and a fall of snow came most opportunely to beautify the landscape and add a new pleasure to christmas festivities  but sophie declared that the old yellow sleigh with punch the farmhorse must be used as she wished everything to be in keeping and saul obeyed thinking he had never seen anything prettier than his cousin when she appeared in his mothers oldfashioned camlet cloak and blue silk pumpkin hood he looked remarkably well himself in his fur coat with hair and beard brushed till they shone like spun gold a fresh color in his cheek and the sparkle of amusement in his eyes while excitement gave his usually grave face the animation it needed to be handsome  away they jogged in the creaking old sleigh leaving ruth to make herself pretty with a fluttering heart and aunt plumy to dish up a late dinner fit to tempt the most fastidious appetite  she has not come for us and there is not even a stage to take us up there must be some mistake said emily herrick as she looked about the shabby little station where they were set down  that is the nevertobeforgotten face of our fair friend but the bonnet of her grandmother if my eyes do not deceive me answered randal turning to survey the couple approaching in the rear  sophie vaughan what do you mean by making such a guy of yourself exclaimed emily as she kissed the smiling face in the hood and stared at the quaint cloak  im dressed for my part and i intend to keep it up this is our host my cousin saul basset come to the sleigh at once he will see to your luggage said sophie painfully conscious of the antiquity of her array as her eyes rested on emilys pretty hat and mantle and the masculine elegance of randals wraps  they were hardly tucked in when saul appeared with a valise in one hand and a large trunk on his shoulder swinging both on to a woodsled that stood near by as easily as if they had been handbags  that is your hero is it well he looks it calm and comely taciturn and tall said emily in a tone of approbation  he should have been named samson or goliath though i believe it was the small man who slung things about and turned out the hero in the end added randal surveying the performance with interest and a touch of envy for much pen work had made his own hands as delicate as a womans  saul doesnt live in a glass house so stones wont hurt him remember sarcasm is forbidden and sincerity the order of the day you are country folks now and it will do you good to try their simple honest ways for a few days  sophie had no time to say more for saul came up and drove off with the brief remark that the baggage would be along right away  being hungry cold and tired the guests were rather silent during the short drive but aunt plumys hospitable welcome and the savory fumes of the dinner awaiting them thawed the ice and won their hearts at once  isnt it nice arent you glad you came asked sophie as she led her friends into the parlor which she had redeemed from its primness by putting bright chintz curtains to the windows hemlock boughs over the old portraits a china bowl of flowers on the table and a splendid fire on the wide hearth  it is perfectly jolly and this is the way i begin to enjoy myself answered emily sitting down upon the homemade rug whose red flannel roses bloomed in a blue list basket  if i may add a little smoke to your glorious fire it will be quite perfect wont samson join me asked randal waiting for permission cigarcase in hand  he has no small vices but you may indulge yours answered sophie from the depths of a grandmotherly chair  emily glanced up at her friend as if she caught a new tone in her voice then turned to the fire again with a wise little nod as if confiding some secret to the reflection of herself in the bright brass andiron  his delilah does not take this form i wait with interest to discover if he has one what a daisy the sister is does she ever speak asked randal trying to lounge on the haircloth sofa where he was slipping uncomfortably about  oh yes and sings like a bird you shall hear her when she gets over her shyness but no trifling mind you for it is a jealously guarded daisy and not to be picked by any idle hand said sophie warningly as she recalled ruths blushes and randals compliments at dinner  i should expect to be annihilated by the big brother if i attempted any but the sincerest admiration and respect have no fears on that score but tell us what is to follow this superb dinner an apple bee spinning match husking party or primitive pastime of some sort i have no doubt  as you are new to our ways i am going to let you rest this evening we will sit about the fire and tell stories aunt is a master hand at that and saul has reminiscences of the war that are well worth hearing if we can only get him to tell them  ah he was there was he  yes all through it and is major basset though he likes his plain name best he fought splendidly and had several wounds though only a mere boy when he earned his scars and bars im very proud of him for that and sophie looked so as she glanced at the photograph of a stripling in uniform set in the place of honor on the high mantelpiece  we must stir him up and hear these martial memories i want some new incidents and shall book all i can get if i may  here randal was interrupted by saul himself who came in with an armful of wood for the fire  anything more i can do for you cousin he asked surveying the scene with a rather wistful look  only come and sit with us and talk over war times with mr randal  when ive foddered the cattle and done my chores id be pleased to what regiment were you in asked saul looking down from his lofty height upon the slender gentleman who answered briefly  in none i was abroad at the time  sick  no busy with a novel  took four years to write it  i was obliged to travel and study before i could finish it these things take more time to work up than outsiders would believe  seems to me our war was a finer story than any you could find in europe and the best way to study it would be to fight it out if you want heroes and heroines youd have found plenty of em there  i have no doubt of it and shall be glad to atone for my seeming neglect of them by hearing about your own exploits major  randal hoped to turn the conversation gracefully but saul was not to be caught and left the room saying with a gleam of fun in his eye  i cant stop now heroes can wait pigs cant  the girls laughed at this sudden descent from the sublime to the ridiculous and randal joined them feeling his condescension had not been unobserved  as if drawn by the merry sound aunt plumy appeared and being established in the rockingchair fell to talking as easily as if she had known her guests for years  laugh away young folks thats better for digestion than any of the messes people use are you troubled with dyspepsy dear you didnt seem to take your vittles very hearty so i mistrusted you was delicate she said looking at emily whose pale cheeks and weary eyes told the story of late hours and a gay life  i havent eaten so much for years i assure you mrs basset but it was impossible to taste all your good things i am not dyspeptic thank you but a little seedy and tired for ive been working rather hard lately  be you a teacher or have you a perfessun as they call a trade nowadays asked the old lady in a tone of kindly interest which prevented a laugh at the idea of emilys being anything but a beauty and a belle the others kept their countenances with difficulty and she answered demurely  i have no trade as yet but i dare say i should be happier if i had  not a doubt ont my dear  what would you recommend maam  i should say dressmakin was rather in your line aint it your clothes is dreadful tasty and do you credit if you made em yourself and aunt plumy surveyed with feminine interest the simple elegance of the travelling dress which was the masterpiece of a french modiste  no maam i dont make my own things im too lazy it takes so much time and trouble to select them that i have only strength left to wear them  housekeepin used to be the favorite perfessun in my day it aint fashionable now but it needs a sight of trainin to be perfect in all thats required and ive an idee it would be a sight healthier and usefuller than the paintin and music and fancy work young women do nowadays  but every one wants some beauty in their lives and each one has a different sphere to fill if one can only find it  pears to me theres no call for so much art when nater is full of beauty for them that can see and love it as for spears and so on ive a notion if each of us did up our own little chores smart and thorough we neednt go wanderin round to set the world to rights thats the lords job and i presume to say he can do it without any advice of ourn  something in the homely but true words seemed to rebuke the three listeners for wasted lives and for a moment there was no sound but the crackle of the fire the brisk click of the old ladys knitting needles and ruths voice singing overhead as she made ready to join the party below  to judge by that sweet sound you have done one of your chores very beautifully mrs basset and in spite of the follies of our day succeeded in keeping one girl healthy happy and unspoiled said emily looking up into the peaceful old face with her own lovely one full of respect and envy  i do hope so for shes my ewe lamb the last of four dear little girls all the rest are in the burying ground side of father i dont expect to keep her long and dont ought to regret when i lose her for saul is the best of sons but daughters is more to mothers somehow and i always yearn over girls that is left without a broodin wing to keep em safe and warm in this world of tribulation  aunt plumy laid her hand on sophies head as she spoke with such a motherly look that both girls drew nearer and randal resolved to put her in a book without delay  presently saul returned with little ruth hanging on his arm and shyly nestling near him as he took the threecornered leathern chair in the chimney nook while she sat on a stool close by  now the circle is complete and the picture perfect dont light the lamps yet please but talk away and let me make a mental study of you i seldom find so charming a scene to paint said randal beginning to enjoy himself immensely with a true artists taste for novelty and effect  tell us about your book for we have been reading it as it comes out in the magazine and are much exercised about how its going to end began saul gallantly throwing himself into the breach for a momentary embarrassment fell upon the women at the idea of sitting for their portraits before they were ready  do you really read my poor serial up here and do me the honor to like it asked the novelist both flattered and amused for his work was of the aesthetic sort microscopic studies of character and careful pictures of modern life  sakes alive why shouldnt we cried aunt plumy we have some eddication though we aint very genteel weve got a town libry kep up by the women mostly with fairs and tea parties and so on we have all the magazines reglar and saul reads out the pieces while ruth sews and i knit my eyes bein poor our winter is long and evenins would be kinder lonesome if we didnt have novils and newspapers to cheer em up  i am very glad i can help to beguile them for you now tell me what you honestly think of my work criticism is always valuable and i should really like yours mrs basset said randal wondering what the good woman would make of the delicate analysis and worldly wisdom on which he prided himself  short work as aunt plumy soon showed him for she rather enjoyed freeing her mind at all times and decidedly resented the insinuation that country folk could not appreciate light literature as well as city people  i aint no great of a jedge about anything but natralness of books and it really does seem as if some of your men and women was dreadful uncomfortable creaters pears to me it aint wise to be always pickin ourselves to pieces and pryin into things that ought to come gradual by way of experience and the visitations of providence flowers wont blow worth a cent ef you pull em open better wait and see what they can do alone i do relish the smart sayins the odd ways of furrin parts and the sarcastic slaps at folkses weak spots but massy knows we cant live on spicecake and charlotte ruche and i do feel as if books was more sustainin ef they was full of everyday people and things like good bread and butter them that goes to the heart and aint soon forgotten is the kind i hanker for mis terrys books now and mis stowes and dickenss christmas piecesthem is real sweet and cheerin to my mind  as the blunt old lady paused it was evident she had produced a sensation for saul smiled at the fire ruth looked dismayed at this assault upon one of her idols and the young ladies were both astonished and amused at the keenness of the new critic who dared express what they had often felt randal however was quite composed and laughed goodnaturedly though secretly feeling as if a pail of cold water had been poured over him  many thanks madam you have discovered my weak point with surprising accuracy but you see i cannot help picking folks to pieces as you have expressed it that is my gift and it has its attractions as the sale of my books will testify people like the spicebread and as that is the only sort my oven will bake i must keep on in order to make my living  so rumsellers say but it aint a good trade to foller and id chop wood fore id earn my livin harmin my feller man pears to me id let my oven cool a spell and hunt up some homely happy folks to write about folks that dont borrer trouble and go lookin for holes in their neighbors coats but take their lives brave and cheerful and rememberin we are all human have pity on the weak and try to be as full of mercy patience and lovin kindness as him who made us that sort of a book would do a heap of good be real warmin and strengthening and make them that read it love the man that wrote it and remember him when he was dead and gone  i wish i could and randal meant what he said for he was as tired of his own style as a watchmaker might be of the magnifying glass through which he strains his eyes all day he knew that the heart was left out of his work and that both mind and soul were growing morbid with dwelling on the faulty absurd and metaphysical phases of life and character he often threw down his pen and vowed he would write no more but he loved ease and the books brought money readily he was accustomed to the stimulant of praise and missed it as the toper misses his wine so that which had once been a pleasure to himself and others was fast becoming a burden and a disappointment  the brief pause which followed his involuntary betrayal of discontent was broken by ruth who exclaimed with a girlish enthusiasm that overpowered girlish bashfulness  i think all the novels are splendid i hope you will write hundreds more and i shall live to read em  bravo my gentle champion i promise that i will write one more at least and have a heroine in it whom your mother will both admire and love answered randal surprised to find how grateful he was for the girls approval and how rapidly his trained fancy began to paint the background on which he hoped to copy this fresh human daisy  abashed by her involuntary outburst ruth tried to efface herself behind sauls broad shoulder and he brought the conversation back to its startingpoint by saying in a tone of the most sincere interest  speaking of the serial i am very anxious to know how your hero comes out he is a fine fellow and i cant decide whether he is going to spoil his life marrying that silly woman or do something grand and generous and not be made a fool of  upon my soul i dont know myself it is very hard to find new finales cant you suggest something major then i shall not be obliged to leave my story without an end as people complain i am rather fond of doing  well no i dont think ive anything to offer seems to me it isnt the sensational exploits that show the hero best but some great sacrifice quietly made by a common sort of man who is noble without knowing it i saw a good many such during the war and often wish i could write them down for it is surprising how much courage goodness and real piety is stowed away in common folks ready to show when the right time comes  tell us one of them and ill bless you for a hint no one knows the anguish of an authors spirit when he cant ring down the curtain on an effective tableau said randal with a glance at his friends to ask their aid in eliciting an anecdote or reminiscence  tell about the splendid fellow who held the bridge like horatius till help came up that was a thrilling story i assure you answered sophie with an inviting smile  but saul would not be his own hero and said briefly  any man can be brave when the battlefever is on him and it only takes a little physical courage to dash ahead he paused a moment with his eyes on the snowy landscape without where twilight was deepening then as if constrained by the memory that winter scene evoked he slowly continued  one of the bravest things i ever knew was done by a poor fellow who has been a hero to me ever since though i only met him that night it was after one of the big battles of that last winter and i was knocked over with a broken leg and two or three bullets here and there night was coming on snow falling and a sharp wind blew over the field where a lot of us lay dead and alive waiting for the ambulance to come and pick us up there was skirmishing going on not far off and our prospects were rather poor between frost and fire i was calculating how id manage when i found two poor chaps close by who were worse off so i braced up and did what i could for them one had an arm blown away and kept up a dreadful groaning the other was shot bad and bleeding to death for want of help but never complained he was nearest and i liked his pluck for he spoke cheerful and made me ashamed to growl such times make dreadful brutes of men if they havent something to hold on to and all three of us were most wild with pain and cold and hunger for wed fought all day fasting when we heard a rumble in the road below and saw lanterns bobbing round that meant life to us and we all tried to holler two of us were pretty faint but i managed a good yell and they heard it  room for one more hard luck old boys but we are full and must save the worst wounded first take a drink and hold on till we come back says one of them with the stretcher  heres the one to go i says pointin out my man for i saw by the light that he was hard hit  no that one hes got more chances than i or this one hes young and got a mother ill wait said the good feller touchin my arm for he d heard me mutterin to myself about this dear old lady we always want mother when we are down you know  sauls eyes turned to the beloved face with a glance of tenderest affection and aunt plumy answered with a dismal groan at the recollection of his need that night and her absence  well to be short the groaning chap was taken and my man left i was mad but there was no time for talk and the selfish one went off and left that poor feller to run his one chance i had my rifle and guessed i could hobble up to use it if need be so we settled back to wait without much hope of help everything being in a muddle and wait we did till morning for that ambulance did not come back till next day when most of us were past needing it  ill never forget that night i dream it all over again as plain as if it was real snow cold darkness hunger thirst pain and all round us cries and cursing growing less and less till at last only the wind went moaning over that meadow it was awful so lonesome helpless and seemingly godforsaken hour after hour we lay there side by side under one coat waiting to be saved or die for the wind grew strong and we grew weak  saul drew a long breath and held his hands to the fire as if he felt again the sharp suffering of that night  and the man asked emily softly as if reluctant to break the silence  he was a man in times like that men talk like brothers and show what they are lying there slowly freezing joe cummings told me about his wife and babies his old folks waiting for him all depending on him yet all ready to give him up when he was needed a plain man but honest and true and loving as a woman i soon saw that as he went on talking half to me and half to himself for sometimes he wandered a little toward the end ive read books heard sermons and seen good folks but nothing ever came so close or did me so much good as seeing this man die he had one chance and gave it cheerfully he longed for those he loved and let em go with a goodby they couldnt hear he suffered all the pains we most shrink from without a murmur and kept my heart warm while his own was growing cold its no use trying to tell that part of it but i heard prayers that night that meant something and i saw how faith could hold a soul up when everything was gone but god  saul stopped there with a sudden huskiness in his deep voice and when he went on it was in the tone of one who speaks of a dear friend  joe grew still by and by and i thought he was asleep for i felt his breath when i tucked him up and his hand held on to mine the cold sort of numbed me and i dropped off too weak and stupid to think or feel i never should have waked up if it hadnt been for joe when i came to it was morning and i thought i was dead for all i could see was that great field of white mounds like graves and a splendid sky above then i looked for joe remembering but he had put my coat back over me and lay stiff and still under the snow that covered him like a shroud all except his face a bit of my cape had blown over it and when i took it off and the sun shone on his dead face i declare to you it was so full of heavenly peace i felt as if that common man had been glorified by gods light and rewarded by gods well done thats all  no one spoke for a moment while the women wiped their eyes and saul dropped his as if to hide something softer than tears  it was very noble very touching and you how did you get off at last asked randal with real admiration and respect in his usually languid face  crawled off answered saul relapsing into his former brevity of speech  why not before and save yourself all that misery  couldnt leave joe  ah i see there were two heroes that night  dozens ive no doubt those were times that made heroes of men and women too  tell us more begged emily looking up with an expression none of her admirers ever brought to her face by their softest compliments or wiliest gossip  ive done my part its mr randals turn now and saul drew himself out of the ruddy circle of firelight as if ashamed of the prominent part he was playing  sophie and her friend had often heard randal talk for he was an accomplished raconteur but that night he exerted himself and was unusually brilliant and entertaining as if upon his mettle the bassets were charmed they sat late and were very merry for aunt plumy got up a little supper for them and her cider was as exhilarating as champagne when they parted for the night and sophie kissed her aunt emily did the same saying heartily  it seems as if id known you all my life and this is certainly the most enchanting old place that ever was  glad you like it dear but it aint all fun as youll find out tomorrow when you go to work for sophie says you must answered mrs basset as her guests trooped away rashly promising to like everything  they found it difficult to keep their word when they were called at half past six next morning their rooms were warm however and they managed to scramble down in time for breakfast guided by the fragrance of coffee and aunt plumys shrill voice singing the good old hymn    lord in the morning thou shalt hear   my voice ascending high  an open fire blazed on the hearth for the cooking was done in the leanto and the spacious sunny kitchen was kept in all its oldfashioned perfection with the wooden settle in a warm nook the tall clock behind the door copper and pewter utensils shining on the dresser old china in the corner closet and a little spinning wheel rescued from the garret by sophie to adorn the deep window full of scarlet geraniums christmas roses and white chrysanthemums  the young lady in a checked apron and mobcap greeted her friends with a dish of buckwheats in one hand and a pair of cheeks that proved she had been learning to fry these delectable cakes  you do keep it up in earnest upon my word and very becoming it is dear but wont you ruin your complexion and roughen your hands if you do so much of this new fancywork asked emily much amazed at this novel freak  i like it and really believe ive found my proper sphere at last domestic life seems so pleasant to me that i feel as if id better keep it up for the rest of my life answered sophie making a pretty picture of herself as she cut great slices of brown bread with the early sunshine touching her happy face  the charming miss vaughan in the role of a farmers wife i find it difficult to imagine and shrink from the thought of the widespread dismay such a fate will produce among her adorers added randal as he basked in the glow of the hospitable fire  she might do worse but come to breakfast and do honor to my handiwork said sophie thinking of her wornout millionnaire and rather nettled by the satiric smile on randals lips  what an appetite early rising gives one i feel equal to almost anything so let me help wash cups said emily with unusual energy when the hearty meal was over and sophie began to pick up the dishes as if it was her usual work  ruth went to the window to water the flowers and randal followed to make himself agreeable remembering her defence of him last night he was used to admiration from feminine eyes and flattery from soft lips but found something new and charming in the innocent delight which showed itself at his approach in blushes more eloquent than words and shy glances from eyes full of heroworship  i hope you are going to spare me a posy for tomorrow night since i can be fine in no other way to do honor to the dance miss sophie proposes for us he said leaning in the bay window to look down on the little girl with the devoted air he usually wore for pretty women  anything you like i should be so glad to have you wear my flowers there will be enough for all and ive nothing else to give to people who have made me as happy as cousin sophie and you answered ruth half drowning her great calla as she spoke with grateful warmth  you must make her happy by accepting the invitation to go home with her which i heard given last night a peep at the world would do you good and be a pleasant change i think  oh very pleasant but would it do me good and ruth looked up with sudden seriousness in her blue eyes as a child questions an elder eager yet wistful  why not asked randal wondering at the hesitation  i might grow discontented with things here if i saw splendid houses and fine people i am very happy now and it would break my heart to lose that happiness or ever learn to be ashamed of home  but dont you long for more pleasure new scenes and other friends than these asked the man touched by the little creatures loyalty to the things she knew and loved  very often but mother says when im ready they will come so i wait and try not to be impatient but ruths eyes looked out over the green leaves as if the longing was very strong within her to see more of the unknown world lying beyond the mountains that hemmed her in  it is natural for birds to hop out of the nest so i shall expect to see you over there before long and ask you how you enjoy your first flight said randal in a paternal tone that had a curious effect on ruth  to his surprise she laughed then blushed like one of her own roses and answered with a demure dignity that was very pretty to see  i intend to hop soon but it wont be a very long flight or very far from mother she cant spare me and nobody in the world can fill her place to me  bless the child does she think im going to make love to her thought randal much amused but quite mistaken wiser women had thought so when he assumed the caressing air with which he beguiled them into the little revelations of character he liked to use as the south wind makes flowers open their hearts to give up their odor then leaves them to carry it elsewhere the more welcome for the stolen sweetness  perhaps you are right the maternal wing is a safe shelter for confiding little souls like you miss ruth you will be as comfortable here as your flowers in this sunny window he said carelessly pinching geranium leaves and ruffling the roses till the pink petals of the largest fluttered to the floor  as if she instinctively felt and resented something in the man which his act symbolized the girl answered quietly as she went on with her work yes if the frost does not touch me or careless people spoil me too soon  before randal could reply aunt plumy approached like a maternal hen who sees her chicken in danger  saul is goin to haul wood after hes done his chores mebbe youd like to go along the view is good the roads well broke and the day uncommon fine  thanks it will be delightful i dare say politely responded the lion with a secret shudder at the idea of a rural promenade at 8 am in the winter  come on then well feed the stock and then ill show you how to yoke oxen said saul with a twinkle in his eye as he led the way when his new aide had muffled himself up as if for a polar voyage  now thats too bad of saul he did it on purpose just to please you sophie cried ruth presently and the girls ran to the window to behold randal bravely following his host with a pail of pigs food in each hand and an expression of resigned disgust upon his aristocratic face  to what base uses may we come quoted emily as they all nodded and smiled upon the victim as he looked back from the barnyard where he was clamorously welcomed by his new charges  it is rather a shock at first but it will do him good and saul wont be too hard upon him im sure said sophie going back to her work while ruth turned her best buds to the sun that they might be ready for a peaceoffering tomorrow  there was a merry clatter in the big kitchen for an hour then aunt plumy and her daughter shut themselves up in the pantry to perform some culinary rites and the young ladies went to inspect certain antique costumes laid forth in sophies room  you see em i thought it would be appropriate to the house and season to have an oldfashioned dance aunt has quantities of ancient finery stowed away for greatgrandfather basset was a fine old gentleman and his family lived in state take your choice of the crimson blue or silvergray damask ruth is to wear the worked muslin and quilted white satin skirt with that coquettish hat  being dark ill take the red and trim it up with this fine lace you must wear the blue and primrose with the distracting highheeled shoes have you any suits for the men asked emily throwing herself at once into the allabsorbing matter of costume  a claret velvet coat and vest silk stockings cocked hat and snuffbox for randal nothing large enough for saul so he must wear his uniform wont aunt plumy be superb in this plumcolored satin and immense cap  a delightful morning was spent in adapting the faded finery of the past to the blooming beauty of the present and time and tongues flew till the toot of a horn called them down to dinner  the girls were amazed to see randal come whistling up the road with his trousers tucked into his boots blue mittens on his hands and an unusual amount of energy in his whole figure as he drove the oxen while saul laughed at his vain attempts to guide the bewildered beasts  its immense the view from the hill is well worth seeing for the snow glorifies the landscape and reminds one of switzerland im going to make a sketch of it this afternoon better come and enjoy the delicious freshness young ladies  randal was eating with such an appetite that he did not see the glances the girls exchanged as they promised to go  bring home some more wintergreen i want things to be real nice and we havent enough for the kitchen said ruth dimpling with girlish delight as she imagined herself dancing under the green garlands in her grandmothers wedding gown  it was very lovely on the hill for far as the eye could reach lay the wintry landscape sparkling with the brief beauty of sunshine on virgin snow pines sighed overhead hardy birds flitted to and fro and in all the trodden spots rose the little spires of evergreen ready for its christmas duty deeper in the wood sounded the measured ring of axes the crash of falling trees while the red shirts of the men added color to the scene and a fresh wind brought the aromatic breath of newly cloven hemlock and pine  how beautiful it is i never knew before what winter woods were like did you sophie asked emily sitting on a stump to enjoy the novel pleasure at her ease  ive found out lately saul lets me come as often as i like and this fine air seems to make a new creature of me answered sophie looking about her with sparkling eyes as if this was a kingdom where she reigned supreme  something is making a new creature of you that is very evident i havent yet discovered whether it is the air or some magic herb among that green stuff you are gathering so diligently and emily laughed to see the color deepen beautifully in her friends halfaverted face  scarlet is the only wear just now i find if we are lost like babes in the woods there are plenty of redbreasts to cover us with leaves and randal joined emilys laugh with a glance at saul who had just pulled his coat off  you wanted to see this tree go down so stand from under and ill show you how its done said the farmer taking up his axe not unwilling to gratify his guests and display his manly accomplishments at the same time  it was a fine sight the stalwart man swinging his axe with magnificent strength and skill each blow sending a thrill through the stately tree till its heart was reached and it tottered to its fall never pausing for breath saul shook his yellow mane out of his eyes and hewed away while the drops stood on his forehead and his arm ached as bent on distinguishing himself as if he had been a knight tilting against his rival for his ladys favor  i dont know which to admire most the man or his muscle one doesnt often see such vigor size and comeliness in these degenerate days said randal mentally booking the fine figure in the red shirt  i think we have discovered a rough diamond i only wonder if sophie is going to try and polish it answered emily glancing at her friend who stood a little apart watching the rise and fall of the axe as intently as if her fate depended on it  down rushed the tree at last and leaving them to examine a crows nest in its branches saul went off to his men as if he found the praises of his prowess rather too much for him  randal fell to sketching the girls to their garlandmaking and for a little while the sunny woodland nook was full of lively chat and pleasant laughter for the air exhilarated them all like wine suddenly a man came running from the wood pale and anxious saying as he hastened by for help blasted tree fell on him bleed to death before the doctor comes  who who cried the startled trio  but the man ran on with some breathless reply in which only a name was audiblebasset  the deuce it is and randal dropped his pencil while the girls sprang up in dismay then with one impulse they hastened to the distant group half visible behind the fallen trees and corded wood  sophie was there first and forcing her way through the little crowd of men saw a redshirted figure on the ground crushed and bleeding and threw herself down beside it with a cry that pierced the hearts of those who heard it  in the act she saw it was not saul and covered her bewildered face as if to hide its joy a strong arm lifted her and the familiar voice said cheeringly  im all right dear poor bruce is hurt but weve sent for help better go right home and forget all about it  yes i will if i can do nothing and sophie meekly returned to her friends who stood outside the circle over which sauls head towered assuring them of his safety  hoping they had not seen her agitation she led emily away leaving randal to give what aid he could and bring them news of the poor woodchoppers state  aunt plumy produced the camphire the moment she saw sophies pale face and made her lie down while the brave old lady trudged briskly off with bandages and brandy to the scene of action on her return she brought comfortable news of the man so the little flurry blew over and was forgotten by all but sophie who remained pale and quiet all the evening tying evergreen as if her life depended on it  a good nights sleep will set her up she aint used to such things dear child and needs cossetin said aunt plumy purring over her until she was in her bed with a hot stone at her feet and a bowl of herb tea to quiet her nerves  an hour later when emily went up she peeped in to see if sophie was sleeping nicely and was surprised to find the invalid wrapped in a dressinggown writing busily  last will and testament or sudden inspiration dear how are you faint or feverish delirious or in the dumps saul looks so anxious and mrs basset hushes us all up so i came to bed leaving randal to entertain ruth  as she spoke emily saw the papers disappear in a portfolio and sophie rose with a yawn  i was writing letters but im sleepy now quite over my foolish fright thank you go and get your beauty sleep that you may dazzle the natives tomorrow  so glad good night and emily went away saying to herself something is going on and i must find out what it is before i leave sophie cant blind me  but sophie did all the next day being delightfully gay at the dinner and devoting herself to the young minister who was invited to meet the distinguished novelist and evidently being afraid of him gladly basked in the smiles of his charming neighbor a dashing sleighride occupied the afternoon and then great was the fun and excitement over the costumes  aunt plumy laughed till the tears rolled down her cheeks as the girls compressed her into the plumcolored gown with its short waist legofmutton sleeves and narrow skirt but a worked scarf hid all deficiencies and the towering cap struck awe into the soul of the most frivolous observer  keep an eye on me girls for i shall certainly split somewheres or lose my headpiece off when im trottin round what would my blessed mother say if she could see me rigged out in her best things and with a smile and a sigh the old lady departed to look after the boys and see that the supper was all right  three prettier damsels never tripped down the wide staircase than the brilliant brunette in crimson brocade the pensive blonde in blue or the rosy little bride in old muslin and white satin  a gallant court gentleman met them in the hall with a superb bow and escorted them to the parlor where grandma bassets ghost was discovered dancing with a modern major in full uniform  mutual admiration and many compliments followed till other ancient ladies and gentlemen arrived in all manner of queer costumes and the old house seemed to wake from its humdrum quietude to sudden music and merriment as if a past generation had returned to keep its christmas there  the village fiddler soon struck up the good old tunes and then the strangers saw dancing that filled them with mingled mirth and envy it was so droll yet so hearty the young men unusually awkward in their grandfathers kneebreeches flapping vests and swallowtail coats footed it bravely with the buxom girls who were the prettier for their quaintness and danced with such vigor that their high combs stood awry their furbelows waved wildly and their cheeks were as red as their breastknots or hose  it was impossible to stand still and one after the other the city folk yielded to the spell randal leading off with ruth sophie swept away by saul and emily being taken possession of by a young giant of eighteen who spun her around with a boyish impetuosity that took her breath away even aunt plumy was discovered jigging it alone in the pantry as if the music was too much for her and the plates and glasses jingled gaily on the shelves in time to money musk and fishers hornpipe  a pause came at last however and fans fluttered heated brows were wiped jokes were made lovers exchanged confidences and every nook and corner held a man and maid carrying on the sweet game which is never out of fashion there was a glitter of gold lace in the back entry and a train of blue and primrose shone in the dim light there was a richer crimson than that of the geraniums in the deep window and a dainty shoe tapped the bare floor impatiently as the brilliant black eyes looked everywhere for the court gentleman while their owner listened to the gruff prattle of an enamored boy but in the upper hall walked a little white ghost as if waiting for some shadowy companion and when a dark form appeared ran to take its arm saying in a tone of soft satisfaction  i was so afraid you wouldnt come  why did you leave me ruth answered a manly voice in a tone of surprise though the small hand slipping from the velvet coatsleeve was replaced as if it was pleasant to feel it there  a pause and then the other voice answered demurely  because i was afraid my head would be turned by the fine things you were saying  it is impossible to help saying what one feels to such an artless little creature as you are it does me good to admire anything so fresh and sweet and wont harm you  it might if  if what my daisy  i believed it and a laugh seemed to finish the broken sentence better than the words  you may ruth for i do sincerely admire the most genuine girl i have seen for a long time and walking here with you in your bridal white i was just asking myself if i should not be a happier man with a home of my own and a little wife hanging on my arm than drifting about the world as i do now with only myself to care for  i know you would and ruth spoke so earnestly that randal was both touched and startled fearing he had ventured too far in a mood of unwonted sentiment born of the romance of the hour and the sweet frankness of his companion  then you dont think it would be rash for some sweet woman to take me in hand and make me happy since fame is a failure  oh no it would be easy work if she loved you i know some oneif i only dared to tell her name  upon my soul this is cool and randal looked down wondering if the audacious lady on his arm could be shy ruth  if he had seen the malicious merriment in her eyes he would have been more humiliated still but they were modestly averted and the face under the little hat was full of a soft agitation rather dangerous even to a man of the world  she is a captivating little creature but it is too soon for anything but a mild flirtation i must delay further innocent revelations or i shall do something rash  while making this excellent resolution randal had been pressing the hand upon his arm and gently pacing down the dimly lighted hall with the sound of music in his ears ruths sweetest roses in his buttonhole and a loving little girl beside him as he thought  you shall tell me by and by when we are in town i am sure you will come and meanwhile dont forget me  i am going in the spring but i shall not be with sophie answered ruth in a whisper  with whom then i shall long to see you  with my husband i am to be married in may  the deuce you are escaped randal as he stopped short to stare at his companion sure she was not in earnest  but she was for as he looked the sound of steps coming up the back stairs made her whole face flush and brighten with the unmistakable glow of happy love and she completed randals astonishment by running into the arms of the young minister saying with an irrepressible laugh oh john why didnt you come before  the court gentleman was all right in a moment and the coolest of the three as he offered his congratulations and gracefully retired leaving the lovers to enjoy the tryst he had delayed but as he went down stairs his brows were knit and he slapped the broad railing smartly with his cocked hat as if some irritation must find vent in a more energetic way than merely saying confound the little baggage under his breath  such an amazing supper came from aunt plumys big pantry that the city guests could not eat for laughing at the queer dishes circulating through the rooms and copiously partaken of by the hearty young folks  doughnuts and cheese pie and pickles cider and tea baked beans and custards cake and cold turkey bread and butter plum pudding and french bonbons sophies contribution  may i offer you the native delicacies and share your plate both are very good but the china has run short and after such vigorous exercise as you have had you must need refreshment im sure i do said randal bowing before emily with a great blue platter laden with two doughnuts two wedges of pumpkin pie and two spoons  the smile with which she welcomed him the alacrity with which she made room beside her and seemed to enjoy the supper he brought was so soothing to his ruffled spirit that he soon began to feel that there is no friend like an old friend that it would not be difficult to name a sweet woman who would take him in hand and would make him happy if he cared to ask her and he began to think he would by and by it was so pleasant to sit in that green corner with waves of crimson brocade flowing over his feet and a fine face softening beautifully under his eyes  the supper was not romantic but the situation was and emily found that pie ambrosial food eaten with the man she loved whose eyes talked more eloquently than the tongue just then busy with a doughnut ruth kept away but glanced at them as she served her company and her own happy experience helped her to see that all was going well in that quarter saul and sophie emerged from the back entry with shining countenances but carefully avoided each other for the rest of the evening no one observed this but aunt plumy from the recesses of her pantry and she folded her hands as if well content as she murmured fervently over a pan full of crullers bless the dears now i can die happy  every one thought sophies oldfashioned dress immensely becoming and several of his former men said to saul with blunt admiration major you look tonight as you used to after wed gained a big battle  i feel as if i had answered the splendid major with eyes much brighter than his buttons and a heart under them infinitely prouder than when he was promoted on the field of honor for his waterloo was won  there was more dancing followed by games in which aunt plumy shone preeminent for the supper was off her mind and she could enjoy herself there were shouts of merriment as the blithe old lady twirled the platter hunted the squirrel and went to jerusalem like a girl of sixteen her cap in a ruinous condition and every seam of the purple dress straining like sails in a gale it was great fun but at midnight it came to an end and the young folks still bubbling over with innocent jollity went jingling away along the snowy hills unanimously pronouncing mrs bassets party the best of the season  never had such a good time in my life exclaimed sophie as the family stood together in the kitchen where the candles among the wreaths were going out and the floor was strewn with wrecks of past joy  im proper glad dear now you all go to bed and lay as late as you like tomorrow im so kinder worked up i couldnt sleep so saul and me will put things to rights without a mite of noise to disturb you and aunt plumy sent them off with a smile that was a benediction sophie thought  the dear old soul speaks as if midnight was an unheardof hour for christians to be up what would she say if she knew how we seldom go to bed till dawn in the ball season im so wide awake ive half a mind to pack a little randal must go at two he says and we shall want his escort said emily as the girls laid away their brocades in the press in sophies room  im not going aunt cant spare me and there is nothing to go for yet answered sophie beginning to take the white chrysanthemums out of her pretty hair  my dear child you will die of ennui up here very nice for a week or so but frightful for a winter we are going to be very gay and cannot get on without you cried emily dismayed at the suggestion  you will have to for im not coming i am very happy here and so tired of the frivolous life i lead in town that i have decided to try a better one and sophies mirror reflected a face full of the sweetest content  have you lost your mind experienced religion or any other dreadful thing you always were odd but this last freak is the strangest of all what will your guardian say and the world added emily in the awestricken tone of one who stood in fear of the omnipotent mrs grundy  guardy will be glad to be rid of me and i dont care that for the world cried sophie snapping her fingers with a joyful sort of recklessness which completed emilys bewilderment  but mr hammond are you going to throw away millions lose your chance of making the best match in the city and driving the girls of our set out of their wits with envy  sophie laughed at her friends despairing cry and turning round said quietly  i wrote to mr hammond last night and this evening received my reward for being an honest girl saul and i are to be married in the spring when ruth is  emily fell prone upon the bed as if the announcement was too much for her but was up again in an instant to declare with prophetic solemnity  i knew something was going on but hoped to get you away before you were lost sophie you will repent be warned and forget this sad delusion  too late for that the pang i suffered yesterday when i thought saul was dead showed me how well i loved him tonight he asked me to stay and no power in the world can part us oh emily it is all so sweet so beautiful that everything is possible and i know i shall be happy in this dear old home full of love and peace and honest hearts i only hope you may find as true and tender a man to live for as my saul  sophies face was more eloquent than her fervent words and emily beautifully illustrated the inconsistency of her sex by suddenly embracing her friend with the incoherent exclamation i think i have dear your brave saul is worth a dozen old hammonds and i do believe you are right  it is unnecessary to tell how as if drawn by the irresistible magic of sympathy ruth and her mother crept in one by one to join the midnight conference and add their smiles and tears tender hopes and proud delight to the joys of that memorable hour nor how saul unable to sleep mounted guard below and meeting randal prowling down to soothe his nerves with a surreptitious cigar found it impossible to help confiding to his attentive ear the happiness that would break bounds and overflow in unusual eloquence  peace fell upon the old house at last and all slept as if some magic herb had touched their eyelids bringing blissful dreams and a glad awakening  cant we persuade you to come with us miss sophie asked randal next day as they made their adieux  im under orders now and dare not disobey my superior officer answered sophie handing her major his driving gloves with a look which plainly showed that she had joined the great army of devoted women who enlist for life and ask no pay but love  i shall depend on being invited to your wedding then and yours too miss ruth added randal shaking hands with the little baggage as if he had quite forgiven her mockery and forgotten his own brief lapse into sentiment  before she could reply aunt plumy said in a tone of calm conviction that made them all laugh and some of them look conscious  spring is a good time for weddins and i shouldnt wonder ef there was quite a number  nor i and saul and sophie smiled at one another as they saw how carefully randal arranged emilys wraps  then with kisses thanks and all the good wishes that happy hearts could imagine the guests drove away to remember long and gratefully that pleasant country christmas     on picket duty  better late than never   what air you thinkin of phil  my wife dick  so was i aint it odd how fellers fall to thinkin of thar little women when they get a quiet spell like this  fortunate for us that we do get it and have such memories to keep us brave and honest through the trials and temptations of a life like ours  october moonlight shone clearly on the solitary tree draped with gray moss scarred by lightning and warped by wind looking like a venerable warrior whose long campaign was nearly done and underneath was posted the guard of four behind them twinkled many campfires on a distant plain before them wound a road ploughed by the passage of an army strewn with the relics of a rout on the right a sluggish river glided like a serpent stealthy sinuous and dark into a seemingly impervious jungle on the left a southern swamp filled the air with malarial damps swarms of noisome life and discordant sounds that robbed the hour of its repose the men were friends as well as comrades for though gathered from the four quarters of the union and dissimilar in education character and tastes the same spirit animated all the routine of camplife threw them much together and mutual esteem soon grew into a bond of mutual good fellowship  thorn was a massachusetts volunteer a man who seemed too early old too early embittered by some cross for though grim of countenance rough of speech cold of manner a keen observer would have soon discovered traces of a deeper warmer nature hidden behind the repellent front he turned upon the world a true new englander thoughtful acute reticent and opinionated yet earnest withal intensely patriotic and often humorous despite a touch of puritan austerity  phil the romantic chap as he was called looked his character to the life slender swarthy melancholyeyed and darklybearded with feminine features mellow voice and alternately languid or vivacious manners a child of the south in nature as in aspect ardent and proud fitfully aspiring and despairing without the native energy which moulds character and ennobles life months of discipline and devotion had done much for him and some deep experience was fast ripening the youth into a man  flint the longlimbed lumberman from the wilds of maine was a conscript who when government demanded his money or his life calculated the cost and decided that the cash would be a dead loss and the claim might be repeated whereas the conscript would get both pay and plunder out of government while taking excellent care that government got very little out of him a shrewd slowspoken selfreliant specimen was flint yet something of the fresh flavor of the backwoods lingered in him still as if nature were loath to give him up and left the mark of her motherly hand upon him as she leaves it in a dry pale lichen on the bosom of the roughest stone  dick hailed from illinois and was a comely young fellow full of dash and daring rough and rowdy generous and jolly overflowing with spirits and ready for a free fight with all the world  silence followed the last words while the friendly moon climbed up the sky each mans eye followed it and each mans heart was busy with remembrances of other eyes and hearts that might be watching and wishing as theirs watched and wished in the silence each shaped for himself that vision of home that brightens so many campfires haunts so many dreamers under canvas roofs and keeps so many turbulent natures tender by memories which often are both solace and salvation  thorn paced to and fro his rifle on his shoulder vigilant and soldierly however soft his heart might be phil leaned against the tree one hand in the breast of his blue jacket on the painted presentment of the face his fancy was picturing in the golden circle of the moon flint lounged on the sward whistling softly as he whittled at a fallen bough dick was flat on his back heels in air cigar in mouth and some hilarious notion in his mind for suddenly he broke into a laugh  what is it lad asked thorn pausing in his tramp as if willing to be drawn from the disturbing thought that made his black brows lower and his mouth look grim  thinkin of my wife and wishin she was here bless her heart set me rememberin how i see her fust and so i roared as i always do when it comes into my head  how was it come reel off a yarn and lets hear houw yeou hitched teams said flint always glad to get information concerning his neighbors if it could be cheaply done  tellin how we found our wives wouldnt be a bad game would it phil  im agreeable but lets have your romance first  devilish little of that about me or any of my doins i hate sentimental bosh as much as you hate slang and should have been a bachelor to this day if i hadnt seen kitty jest as i did you see id been too busy larkin round to get time for marryin till a couple of years ago when i did up the job doublequick as id like to do this thunderin slow one hang it all  halt a minute till i give a look for this picket isnt going to be driven in or taken while im on guard  down his beat went thorn reconnoitring river road and swamp as thoroughly as one pair of keen eyes could do it and came back satisfied but still growling like a faithful mastiff on the watch performances which he repeated at intervals till his own turn came  i didnt have to go out of my own state for a wife youd better believe began dick with a boast as usual for we raise as fine a crop of girls thar as any state in or out of the union and dont mind raisin cain with any man who denies it i was out on a gunnin tramp with joe partridge a cousin of minepoor old chap he fired his last shot at gettysburg and died game in a way he didnt dream of the day we popped off the birds together it aint right to joke that way i wont if i can help it but a feller gets awfully kind of heathenish these times dont he  settle up them scores bymeby fightin christians is scurse raound here fire away dick  well we got as hungry as hounds half a dozen mile from home and when a farmhouse hove in sight joe said he d ask for a bite and leave some of the plunder for pay i was visitin joe didnt know folks round and backed out of the beggin part of the job so he went ahead alone wed come out of the woods behind the house and while joe was foragin i took a reconnoissance the view was fustrate for the main part of it was a girl airin beds on the roof of a stoop now jest about that time havin a leisure spell id begun to think of marryin and took a look at all the girls i met with an eye to business i spose every man has some sort of an idee or pattern of the wife he wants pretty and plucky good and gay was mine but id never found it till i see kitty and as she didnt see me i had the advantage and took an extra long stare  what was her good pints hey  oh well she had a wideawake pair of eyes a bright jolly sort of a face lots of curly hair tumblin out of her net a trig little figger and a pair of the neatest feet and ankles that ever stepped pretty thinks i so far so good the way she whacked the pillers shook the blankets and pitched into the beds was a caution specially one blunderin old featherbed that wouldnt do nothin but sag round in a pigheaded sort of way that would have made most girls get mad and give up kitty didnt but just wrastled with it like a good one till she got it turned banged and spread to suit her then she plumped down in the middle of it with a sarcy little nod and chuckle to herself that tickled me mightily plucky thinks i better n better jest then an old woman came flyin out the backdoor callin kitty kitty squire partridges sons here long with a friend been gunnin want luncheon and im all in the suds do come down and see to em  where are they says kitty scrambling up her hair and settlin her gown in a jiffy as women have a knack of doin you know  mr joes in the front entry the other mans somewheres round billy says waitin till i send word whether they can stop i darsnt till id seen you for i cant do nothin im in such a mess says the old lady  so am i for i cant get in except by the entry window and hell see me says kitty gigglin at the thoughts of joe  come down the ladder theres a dear ill pull it round and keep it stiddy says the mother  oh ma dont ask me says kitty with a shiver im dreadfully scared of ladders since i broke my arm off this very one its so high it makes me dizzy jest to think of  well then ill do the best i can but i wish them boys was to jericho says the old lady with a groan for she was fat and hot had her gown pinned up and was in a fluster generally she was goin off rather huffy when kitty called out  stop ma ill come down and help you only ketch me if i tumble  she looked scared but stiddy and ill bet it took as much grit for her to do it as for one of us to face a battery it dont seem much to tell of but i wish i may be hit if it wasnt a right down dutiful and clever thing to see done when the old lady took her off at the bottom with a good motherly hug good thinks i what more do you want  a snug little property wouldnt a ben bad i reckon said flint  well she had it old skinflint though i didnt know or care about it then what a jolly row shed make if she knew i was tellin the ladder part of the story she always does when i get to it and makes believe cry with her head in my breastpocket or any such handy place till i take it out and swear ill never do so agin poor little kit i wonder what shes doin now thinkin of me ill bet  dick paused pulled his cap lower over his eyes and smoked a minute with more energy than enjoyment for his cigar was out and he did not perceive it  thats not all is it asked thorn taking a fatherly interest in the younger mans love passages  not quite fore long joe whistled and as i always take short cuts everywhar i put in at the backdoor jest as kitty come trottin out of the pantry with a big berrypie in her hand i startled her she tripped over the sill and down she come the dish flew one way the pie flopped into her lap the juice spatterin my boots and her clean gown i thought shed cry scold have hysterics or some confounded thing or other but she jest sat still a minute then looked up at me with a great blue splash on her face and went off into the goodnaturedest gale of laughin you ever heard in your life that finished me gay thinks i go in and win so i did made love hand over hand while i stayed with joe pupposed a fortnight after married her in three months and there she is a tiptop little woman with a pair of stunnin boys in her arms  out came a wellworn case and dick proudly displayed the likeness of a stout much bejewelled young woman with two staring infants on her knee in his sight the poor picture was a more perfect work of art than any of sir joshuas babybeauties or raphaels madonnas and the little story needed no better sequel than the young fathers praises of his twins the covert kiss he gave their mother when he turned as if to get a clearer light upon the face ashamed to show the tenderness that filled his honest heart he hummed kingdom coming relit his cigar and presently began to talk again  now then flint its your turn to keep guard and thorns to tell his romance come dont try to shirk it does a man good to talk of such things and were all mates here  in some cases it dont do any good to talk of such things better let em alone muttered thorn as he reluctantly sat down while flint as reluctantly departed  with a glance and gesture of real affection phil laid his hand upon his comrades knee saying in his persuasive voice old fellow it will do you good because i know you often long to speak of something that weighs upon you youve kept us steady many a time and done us no end of kindnesses why be too proud to let us give our sympathy in return if nothing more  thorns big hand closed over the slender one upon his knee and the mild expression so rarely seen upon his face passed over it as he replied  i think i could tell you almost anything if you asked me that way my boy it isnt that i am too proudand youre right about my sometimes wanting to free my mindbut its because a man of forty dont just like to open out to young fellows if there is any danger of their laughing at him though he may deserve it i guess there isnt now and ill tell you how i found my wife  dick sat up and phil drew nearer for the earnestness that was in the man dignified his plain speech and inspired an interest in his history even before it was begun looking gravely at the river and never at his hearers as if still a little shy of confidants yet grateful for the relief of words thorn began abruptly  i never hear the number eightyfour without clapping my hand to my left breast and missing my badge you know i was on the police in new york before the war and thats about all you do know yet one bitter cold night i was going my rounds for the last time when as i turned a corner i saw there was a trifle of work to be done it was a bad part of the city full of dirt and deviltry one of the streets led to a ferry and at the corner an old woman had an applestall the poor soul had dropped asleep worn out with the cold and there were her goods left with no one to watch em somebody was watching em however a girl with a ragged shawl over her head stood at the mouth of an alley close by waiting for a chance to grab something id seen her there when i went by before and mistrusted she was up to some mischief as i turned the corner she put out her hand and cribbed an apple she saw me the minute she did it but neither dropped it nor ran only stood stock still with the apple in her hand till i came up  this wont do my girl said i i never could be harsh with em poor things she laid it back and looked up at me with a miserable sort of a smile that made me put my hand in my pocket to fish for a ninepence before she spoke  i know it wont she says i didnt want to do it its so mean but im awful hungry sir  better run home and get your supper then  ive got no home  where do you live  in the street  where do you sleep  anywhere last night in the lockup and i thought id get in there again if i did that when you saw me i like to go there its warm and safe  if i dont take you there what will you do  dont know i could go over there and dance again as i used to but being sick has made me ugly so they wont have me and no one else will take me because i have been there once  i looked where she pointed and thanked the lord that they wouldnt take her it was one of those low theatres that do so much damage to the like of her there was a gambling place one side of it an eating saloon the other i was new to the work then but though id heard about hunger and homelessness often enough id never had this sort of thing nor seen that look on a girls face a white pinched face hers was with frightened tiredlooking eyes but so innocent she wasnt more than sixteen had been pretty once i saw looked sick and starved now and seemed just the most helpless hopeless little thing that ever was  you d better come to the station for tonight and well see to you tomorrow says i  thank you sir says she looking as grateful as if id asked her home i suppose i did speak kind of fatherly i aint ashamed to say i felt so seeing what a child she was nor to own that when she put her little hand in mine it hurt me to feel how thin and cold it was we passed the eatinghouse where the red lights made her face as rosy as it ought to have been there was meat and pies in the window and the poor thing stopped to look it was too much for her off came her shawl and she said in that coaxing way of hers  i wish youd let me stop at the place close by and sell this theyll give a little for it and ill get some supper ive had nothing since yesterday morning and maybe cold is easier to bear than hunger  have you nothing better than that to sell i says not quite sure that she wasnt all a humbug like so many of em she seemed to see that and looked up at me again with such innocent eyes i couldnt doubt her when she said shivering with something beside the cold  nothing but myself then the tears came and she laid her head clown on my arm sobbingkeep me oh do keep me safe somewhere  thorn choked here steadied his voice with a resolute hem but could only add one sentence more  thats how i found my wife  come dont stop thar i told the whole o mine you do the same whar did you take her howd it all come round  please tell us thorn  the gentler request was answered presently very steadily very quietly  i was always a softhearted fellow though you wouldnt think it now and when that little girl asked me to keep her safe i just did it i took her to a good woman whom i knew for i hadnt any women folks belonging to me nor any place but that to put her in she stayed there till spring working for her keep growing brighter prettier every day and fonder of me i thought if i believed in witchcraft i shouldnt think myself such a fool as i do now but i dont believe in it and to this day i cant understand how i came to do it to be sure i was a lonely man without kith or kin had never had a sweetheart in my life or been much with women since my mother died maybe thats why i was so bewitched with mary for she had little ways with her that took your fancy and made you love her whether you would or no i found her father was an honest fellow enough a fiddler in some theatre that hed taken good care of mary till he died leaving precious little but advice for her to live on shed tried to get work failed spent all she had got sick and was going to the bad as the poor souls can hardly help doing with so many ready to give them a shove its no use trying to make a bad job better so the long and short of it was i thought she loved me god knows i loved her and i married her before the year was out  show us her picture i know youve got one all the fellows have though half of em wont own up  ive only got part of one i once saved my little girl and her picture once saved me  from an inner pocket thorn produced a womans housewife carefully untied it though all its implements were missing but a little thimble and from one of its compartments took a flattened bullet and the remnants of a picture  i gave her that the first christmas after i found her she wasnt as tidy about her clothes as i liked to see and i thought if i gave her a handy thing like this shed be willing to sew but she only made one shirt for me and then got tired so i keep it like an old fool as i am yes thats the bit of lead that would have done for me if marys likeness hadnt been just where it was  youll like to show her this when you go home wont you said dick as he took up the bullet while phil examined the marred picture and thorn poised the little thimble on his big finger with a sigh  how can i when i dont know where she is and camp is all the home ive got  the words broke from him like a sudden groan when some old wound is rudely touched both of the young men started both laid back the relics they had taken up and turned their eyes from thorns face across which swept a look of shame and sorrow too significant to be misunderstood their silence assured him of their sympathy and as if that touch of friendliness unlocked his heavy heart he eased it by a full confession when he spoke again it was with the calmness of repressed emotion a calmness more touching to his mates than the most passionate outbreak the most pathetic lamentation for the coarse campphrases seemed to drop from his vocabulary more than once his softened voice grew tremulous and to the words my little girl there went a tenderness that proved how dear a place she still retained in that deep heart of his  boys ive gone so far i may as well finish and youll see im not without some cause for my stern looks and ways youll pity me and from you ill take the comfort of it its only the old storyi married her worked for her lived for her and kept my little girl like a lady i should have known that i was too old and sober for a young thing like that for the life she led before the pinch came just suited her she liked to be admired to dress and dance and make herself pretty for all the world to see not to keep house for a quiet man like me idleness wasnt good for her it bred discontent then some of her old friends whod left her in her trouble found her out when better times came round and tried to get her back again i was away all day i didnt know how things were going and she wasnt open with me afraid she said i was so grave and hated theatres so she got courage finally to tell me that she wasnt happy that she wanted to dance again and asked me if she mightnt id rather have had her ask me to put her in a fire for i did hate theatres and was bred to others think theyre no harm i do and knew it was a bad life for a girl like mine it pampers vanity and vanity is the devils help with such so i said no kindly at first sharp and stern when she kept on teasing that roused her spirit i will go she said one day not while you are my wife i answered back and neither said any more but she gave me a look i didnt think she could and i resolved to take her away from temptation before worse came of it  i didnt tell her my plan but i resigned my place spent a week or more finding and fixing a little home for her out in the wholesome country where shed be safe from theatres and disreputable friends and maybe learn to love me better when she saw how much she was to me it was coming summer and i made things look as homelike and as pretty as i could she liked flowers and i fixed a garden for her she was fond of pets and i got her a bird a kitten and a dog to play with her she fancied gay colors and tasty little matters so i filled her rooms with all the handsome things i could afford and when it was done i was as pleased as any boy thinking what happy times wed have together and how pleased shed be boys when i went to tell her and to take her to her little home she was gone  who with  with those cursed friends of her a party of them left the city just then she was wild to go she had money now and all her good looks back again they teased and tempted her i wasnt there to keep her and she went leaving a line behind to tell me that she loved the old life more than the new that my house was a prison and she hoped id let her go in peace that almost killed me but i managed to bear it for i knew most of the fault was mine but it was awful bitter to think i hadnt saved her after all  oh thorn what did you do  went straight after her found her dancing in philadelphia with paint on her cheeks trinkets on her neck and arms looking prettier than ever but the innocent eyes were gone and i couldnt see my little girl in the bold handsome woman twirling there before the footlights she saw me looked scared at first then smiled and danced on with her eyes upon me as if she said  see im happy now go away and let me be  i couldnt stand that and got out somehow people thought me mad or drunk i didnt care i only wanted to see her once in quiet and try to get her home i couldnt do it then nor afterwards by fair means and i wouldnt try force i wrote to her promised to forgive her begged her to come back or let me keep her honestly somewhere away from me but she never answered never came and i have never tried again  she wasnt worthy of you thorn you jest forgit her  i wish i could i wish i could in his voice quivered an almost passionate regret and a great sob heaved his chest as he turned his face away to hide the love and longing still so tender and so strong  dont say that dick such fidelity should make us charitable for its own sake there is always time for penitence always certainty of pardon take heart thorn you may not wait in vain and she may yet return to you  i know she will ive dreamed of it ive prayed for it every battle i come out of safe makes me surer that i was kept for that and when ive borne enough to atone for my part of the fault ill be repaid for all my patience all my pain by finding her again she knows how well i love her still and if there comes a time when she is sick and poor and all alone again then shell remember her old john then shell come home and let me take her in  hope shone in thorns melancholy eyes and longsuffering allforgiving love beautified the rough brown face as he folded his arms and bent his gray head on his breast as if the wanderer were already come  the emotion which dick scorned to show on his own account was freely manifested for another as he sniffed audibly and boylike drew his sleeve across his eyes but phil with the delicate perception of a finer nature felt that the truest kindness he could show his friend was to distract his thoughts from himself to spare him any comments and lessen the embarrassment which would surely follow such unwonted confidence  now ill relieve flint and he will give you a laugh come on hiram and tell us about your beulah  the gentleman addressed had performed his duty by sitting on a fence and righting up his pockets to beguile the tedium of his exile before his multitudinous possessions could be restored to their native sphere thorn was himself again and on his feet  stay where you are phil i like to tramp it seems like old times and i know youre tired just forget all this ive been saying and go on as before thank you boys thank you and with a grasp of the two hands extended to him he strode away along the path already worn by his own restless feet  its done him good and im glad of that but id like to see the little baggage that bewitched the poor old boy wouldnt you phil  hush heres flint  whats up naow want me tew address the meetin hey im willin only the laughs ruther aginst me ef i tell that story expect youll like it all the better

likeliest the is goin every one on em is the very moral of bewlahred hair black eyes quiet ways an a mold side the nose babys aint growed yet but i expect tew see it in a considable state o forrardness when i git hum an wouldnt miss it fer the world  the droll expression of flints face and the satisfied twang of his last words were irresistible dick and phil went off into a shout of laughter and even thorns grave lips relapsed into a smile at the vision of six little flints with their six little moles as if the act were an established ceremony the paternal head produced his pocketbook selected a worn blackandwhite paper which he spread in his broad palm and displayed with the air of a connoisseur  there thets bewlah we call it a cuttin but the proper names a sillyhoot i bleeve ive got a harnsome big degarrytype tew hum but the heft ont makes it bad tew kerry raound so i took this i dont tote it abaout inside my shirt as some dewit aint my way but i keep it in my wallet long with my other valleubles and guess i set as much store by it as ef it was all painted up and done off to kill  the sillyhoot was examined with interest and carefully stowed away again in the old brown wallet which was settled in its place with a satisfied slap then flint said briskly  naouw phil yeou close this interestin and instructive meeting and be spry fer times most up  i havent much to tell but must begin with a confession which i have often longed but never dared to make before because i am a coward  sho whos goan to bleeve that o a man who fit like a wildcat wuz offered permotion on the field and reported tew headquarters arfter his fust scrimmage try agin phil  physical courage is as plentiful as brass buttons nowadays but moral courage is a rarer virtue and im lacking in it as ill prove you think me a virginian im an alabamian by birth and was a rebel three months ago  this confession startled his hearers as he knew it would for he had kept his secret well thorn laid his hand involuntarily upon his rifle dick drew off a little and flint illustrated one of his own expressions for he gawped phil laughed that musical laugh of his and looked up at them with his dark face waking into sudden life as he went on  theres no treason in the camp for im as fierce a federalist as any of you now and you may thank a woman for it when lee made his raid into pennsylvania i was a lieutenant in thewell never mind what regiment it hasnt signalized itself since and id rather not hit my old neighbors when they are down in one of the skirmishes during our retreat i got a wound and was left for dead a kind old quaker found and took me home but though i was too weak to talk i had my senses by that time and knew what went on about me everything was in confusion even in that wellordered place no surgeon could be got at first and a flock of frightened women theed and thoud one another over me but hadnt wit enough to see that i was bleeding to death among the faces that danced before my dizzy eyes was one that seemed familiar probably because no cap surrounded it i was glad to have it bending over me to hear a steady voice say give me a bandage quick and when none was instantly forthcoming to me the young lady stripped up a little white apron she wore and stanched the wound in my shoulder i was not as badly hurt as i supposed but so wornout and faint from loss of blood they believed me to be dying and so did i when the old man took off his hat and said  friend if thee has anything to say thee had better say it for thee probably has not long to live  i thought of my little sister far away in alabama fancied she came to me and muttered amy kiss me goodby the women sobbed at that but the girl bent her sweet compassionate face to mine and kissed me on the forehead that was my wife  so you seceded from secession right away to pay for that lipservice hey  no thorn not right awayto my shame be it spoken ill tell you how it came about margaret was not old bents daughter but a massachusetts girl on a visit and a long one it proved for she couldnt go till things were quieter while she waited she helped take care of me for the good souls petted me like a baby when they found that a rebel could be a gentleman i held my tongue and behaved my best to prove my gratitude you know of course i loved margaret very soon how could i help it she was the sweetest woman i had ever seen tender frank and spirited all i had ever dreamed of and longed for i did not speak of this nor hope for a return because i knew she was a hearty unionist and thought she only tended me from pity but suddenly she decided to go home and when i ventured to wish she would stay longer she would not listen and said i must not stay i should have gone before  the words were nothing but as she uttered them the color came up beautifully over all her face and her eyes filled as they looked away from mine then i knew that she loved me and my secret broke out against my will margaret was forced to listen for i would not let her go but she seemed to harden herself against me growing colder stiller statelier as i went on and when i said in my desperate way  you should love me for we are bid to love our enemies she flashed an indignant look at me and said  i will not love what i cannot respect come to me a loyal man and see what answer i shall give you  then she went away it was the wisest thing she could have done for absence did more to change me than an ocean of tears a year of exhortations lying there i missed her every hour of the day recalled every gentle act kind word and fair example she had given me i contrasted my own belief with hers and found a new significance in the words honesty and honor and remembering her fidelity to principle was ashamed of my own treason to god and to herself education prejudice and interest are difficult things to overcome and that was the hottest fight i ever passed through for as i tell you i was a coward but love and loyalty won the day and asking no quarter the rebel surrendered  phil beaufort youre a brick cried dick with a sounding slap on his comrades shoulder  a brand snatched from the burnin hallelujah chanted flint seesawing with excitement  then you went to find your wife how where asked thorn forgetting vigilance in interest  friend bent hated war so heartily that he would have nothing to do with paroles exchanges or any martial process whatever but bade me go when and where i liked remembering to do by others as i had been done by before i was well enough to go however i managed by means of copperhead influence and returned prisoners to send a letter to my father and receive an answer you can imagine what both contained and so i found myself penniless but not poor an outcast but not alone old bent treated me like a prodigal son and put money in my purse his pretty daughters loved me for margarets sake and gave me a patriotic salute all round when i left them the humblest happiest man in pennsylvania margaret once said to me that this was the time for deeds not words that no man should stand idle but serve the good cause with head heart and hand no matter in what rank for in her eyes a private fighting for liberty was nobler than a dozen generals defending slavery i remembered that and not having influential friends to get me a commission enlisted in one of her own massachusetts regiments knowing that no act of mine would prove my sincerity like that you should have seen her face when i walked in upon her as she sat alone busied with the army work as id so often seen her sitting by my bed it showed me all she had been suffering in silence all i should have lost had i chosen darkness instead of light she hoped and feared so much she could not speak neither could i but dropped my cloak and showed her that through love of her i had become a soldier of the union how i love the coarse blue uniform for when she saw it she came to me without a word and kept her promise in a month  thunder what a harnsome woman exclaimed flint as phil opening the golden case that held his talisman showed them the beautiful beloved face of which he spoke  yes and a right noble woman too i dont deserve her but i will we parted on our weddingday for orders to be off came suddenly and she would not let me go until i had given her my name to keep we were married in the morning and at noon i had to go other women wept as we marched through the city but my brave margaret kept her tears till we were gone smiling and waving her hand to methe hand that wore the weddingringtill i was out of sight that image of her is before me day and night and day and night her last words are ringing in my ears  i give you freely do your best better a true mans widow than a traitors wife  boys ive only stood on the right side for a month ive only fought one battle earned one honor but i believe these poor achievements are an earnest of the long atonement i desire to make for fiveandtwenty years of blind transgression you say i fight well have i not cause to dare muchfor in owning many slaves i too became a slave in helping to make many freemen i liberate myself you wonder why i refused promotion have i any right to it yet are there not men who never sinned as i have done and beside whose sacrifices mine look pitifully small you tell me i have no ambition i have the highest for i desire to become gods noblest workan honest manliving to make margaret happy in a love that every hour grows worthier of her owndying to make death proud to take me  phil had risen while he spoke as if the enthusiasm of his mood lifted him into the truer manhood he aspired to attain straight and strong he stood up in the moonlight his voice deepened by unwonted energy his eye clear and steadfast his whole face ennobled by the regenerating power of this late loyalty to country wife and self and bright against the dark blue of his jacket shone the pictured face the only medal he was proud to wear  ah brave brief moment cancelling years of wrong ah fair and fatal decoration serving as a mark for a hidden foe the sharp crack of a rifle broke the stillness of the night and with those hopeful words upon his lips the young man sealed his purpose with his life     the barons gloves  or  amys romance  all is fair in love and war   i  how they were found   what a long sigh are you tired amy  yes and disappointed as well i never would have undertaken this journey if i had not thought it would be full of novelty romance and charming adventures  well we have had several adventures  bah losing ones hat in the rhine getting left at a dirty little inn and having our pockets picked are not what i call adventures i wish there were brigands in germanyit needs something of that sort to enliven its stupidity  how can you call germany stupid when you have a scene like this before you said helen with a sigh of pleasure as she looked from the balcony which overhangs the rhine at the hotel of the three kings at coblentz ehrenbreitstein towered opposite the broad river glittered below and a midsummer moon lent its enchantment to the landscape  as she spoke her companion half rose from the low chair where she lounged and showed the pretty piquant face of a young girl she seemed in a half melancholy half petulant mood and traces of recent illness were visible in the languor of her movements and the pallor of her cheeks  yes it is lovely but i want adventures and romance of some sort to make it quite perfect i dont care what if something would only happen  my dear you are out of spirits and weary now tomorrow youll be yourself again do not be ungrateful to uncle or unjust to yourself something pleasant will happen ive no doubt in fact something has happened that you may make a little romance out of perhaps for lack of a more thrilling adventure  what do you mean and amys listless face brightened  speak low there are balconies all about us and we may be overheard said helen drawing nearer after an upward glance  what is the beginning of a romance whispered amy eagerly  a pair of gloves just now as i stood here and you lay with your eyes shut these dropped from the balcony overhead now amuse yourself by weaving a romance out of them and their owner  amy seized them and stepping inside the window examined them by the candle  a gentlemans gloves scented with violets heres a little hole fretted by a ring on the third finger bless me here are the initials sp stamped on the inside with a coat of arms below what a fop to get up his gloves in this style they are exquisite though such a delicate color so little soiled and so prettily ornamented handsome hands wore these id like to see the man  helen laughed at the girls interest and was satisfied if any trifle amused her ennui  i will send them back by the kellner and in that way we may discover their owner she said  but amy arrested her on the way to the door  ive a better plan these waiters are so stupid youll get nothing out of them heres the hotel book sent up for our names let us look among the days arrivals and see who sp is he came today im sure for the man said the rooms above were just taken so we could not have them  opening the big book amy was soon intently poring over the long list of names written in many hands and many languages  ive got it here he isoh nell hes a baron isnt that charming sigismund von palsdorf dresden we must see him for i know hes handsome if he wears such distracting gloves  youd better take them up yourself then  you know i cant do that but i shall ask the man a few questions just to get an idea what sort of person the baron is then i shall change my mind and go down to dinner shall look well about me and if the baron is agreeable i shall make uncle return the gloves he will thank us and i can say ive known a real baron that will be so nice when we go home now dont be duennaish and say im silly but let me do as i like and come and dress  helen submitted and when the gong pealed through the house major erskine marched into the great salle √† manger with a comely niece on each arm the long tables were crowded and they had to run the gauntlet of many eyes as they made their way to the head of the upper table before she touched her soup amy glanced down the line of faces opposite and finding none that answered the slight description elicited from the waiter she leaned a little forward to examine those on her own side of the table some way down sat several gentlemen and as she bent to observe them one did the same and she received an admiring glance from a pair of fine black eyes somewhat abashed she busied herself with her soup but the fancy had taken possession of her and presently she whispered to helen  do you see any signs of the baron  on my left look at the hands  amy looked and saw a white shapely hand with an antique ring on the third finger its owners face was averted but as he conversed with animation the hand was in full play now emphasizing an opinion now lifting a glass or more frequently pulling at a blond beard which adorned the face of the unknown amy shook her head decidedly  i hate light men and dont think that is the baron for the gloves are a size too small for those hands lean back and look some four or five seats lower down on the right see what sort of person the dark man with the fine eyes is  helen obeyed but almost instantly bent to her plate again smiling in spite of herself  that is an englishman he stares rudely says by jove and wears no jewelry or beard  now im disappointed well keep on the watch and tell me if you make any discoveries for i will find the baron  being hungry amy devoted herself to her dinner till dessert was on the table she was languidly eating grapes while helen talked with the major when the word baron caught her ear the speakers sat at a table behind her so that she could not see them without turning quite round which was impossible but she listened eagerly to the following scrap of chat  is the baron going on tomorrow asked a gay voice in french  yes he is bound for badenbaden the season is at its height and he must make his game while the ball is rolling or it is all up with the openhanded sigismund answered a rough voice  wont his father pardon the last escapade asked a third with a laugh  no and he is right the duel was a bad affair for the man almost died and the baron barely managed to get out of the scrape through court influence when is the wedding to be  never palsdorf says there is everything but love in the bargain and he swears hell not agree to it i like that  there is much nobleness in him spite of his vagaries he will sow his wild oats and make a grand man in time by the by if we are going to the fortress we must be off give sigismund the word he is dining at the other table with power said the gay voice  take a look at the pretty english girl as you go by it will do your eyes good after the fat frauleins we have seen of late added the rough one  three gentlemen rose and as they passed amy stole a glance at them but seeing several pairs of eyes fixed on herself she turned away blushing with the not unpleasant consciousness that the pretty english girl was herself longing to see which sigismund was she ventured to look after the young men who paused behind the man with the blond beard and also touched the darkeyed gentleman on the shoulder all five went down the hall and stood talking near the door  uncle i wish to go said amy whose will was law to the amiable major up he rose and amy added as she took his arm im seized with a longing to go to badenbaden and see a little gambling you are not a wild young man so you can be trusted there  i hope so now you are a sensible little woman and well do our best to have a gay time wait an instant till i get my hat  while the major searched for the missing article the girls went on and coming to the door amy tried to open it the unwieldy foreign lock resisted her efforts and she was just giving it an impatient little shake when a voice said behind her  permit me mademoiselle at the same moment a handsome hand turned the latch the flash of a diamond shone before her and the door opened  merci monsieur she murmured turning as she went out but helen was close behind her and no one else to be seen except the massive major in the rear  did you see the baron she whispered eagerly as they went upstairs  no where was he  he opened the door for me i knew him by his hand and ring he was close to you  i did not observe him being busy gathering up my dress i thought the person was a waiter and never looked at him said helen with provoking indifference  how unfortunate uncle you are going to see the fortress we dont care for it but i want you to take these gloves and inquire for baron sigismund palsdorf he will be there with a party of gentlemen you can easily manage it men are so free and easy mind what he is like and come home in time to tell me all about it  away went the major and the cousins sat on the balcony enjoying the lovely night admiring the picturesque scene and indulging in the flights of fancy all girls love for helen in spite of her threeandtwenty years was as romantic as amy at eighteen it was past eleven when the major came and the only greeting he received was the breathless question  did you find him  i found something much better than any baron a courier ive wanted one ever since we started for two young ladies and their baggage are more than one man can do his duty by karl hoffman had such excellent testimonials from persons i know that i did not hesitate to engage him and he comes tomorrow so henceforth ive nothing to do but devote myself to you  how very provoking did you bring the gloves back asked amy still absorbed in the baron  the major tossed them to her and indulged in a hearty laugh at her girlish regrets then bade them goodnight and went away to give orders for an early start next morning  tired of talking the girls lay down in the two little white beds always found in german hotels and amy was soon continuing in sleep the romance she had begun awake she dreamed that the baron proved to be the owner of the fine eyes that he wooed and won her and they were floating down the river to the chime of weddingbells  at this rapturous climax she woke to find the air full of music and to see helen standing tall and white in the moonlight that streamed in at the open window  hush hide behind the curtains and listen its a serenade whispered helen as amy stole to her side  shrouded in the drapery they leaned and listened till the song ended then amy peeped a dark group stood below all were bareheaded and now seemed whispering together presently a single voice rose singing an exquisite little french canzonet the refrain of which was a passionate repetition of the word amie she thought she recognized the voice and the sound of her own name uttered in such ardent tones made her heart beat and her color rise for it seemed to signify that the serenade was for them as the last melodious murmur ceased there came a stifled laugh from below and something fell into the balcony neither dared stir till the sound of departing feet reassured them then creeping forward amy drew in a lovely bouquet of myrtle roses and great german forgetmenots tied with a white ribbon and addressed in a dashing hand to la belle hel√®ne  upon my life the romance has begun in earnest laughed helen as she examined the flowers you are serenaded by some unknown nightingale and i have flowers tossed up to me in the charming old style of course it is the baron amy  i hope so but whoever it is they are regular troubadours and im delighted i know the gloves will bring us fun of some kind do you take one and ill take the other and see who will find the baron first isnt it odd that they knew our names  amy the writing on this card is very like that in the big book i may be bewitched by this midsummer moonlight but it really is very like it come and see  the two charming heads bent over the card looking all the more charming for the dishevelled curls and braids that hung about them as the girls laughed and whispered together in the softly brilliant light that filled the room  you are right it is the same the men who stared so at dinner are gay students perhaps and ready for any prank dont tell uncle but let us see what will come of it i begin to enjoy myself heartily nowdont you said amy laying her glove carefully away  i enjoyed myself before but i think la belle hel√®ne gives an added relish to life amie laughed nell putting her flowers in water and then both went back to their pillows to dream delightfully till morning   ii  karl the courier   three days at least before we reach baden how tiresome it is that uncle wont go faster said amy as she tied on her hat next morning wondering as she did so if the baron would take the same boat  as adventures have begun i feel assured that they will continue to cheer the way so resign yourself and be ready for anything replied helen carefully arranging her bouquet in her travellingbasket  a tap at the door which stood half open made both look up a tall brown gentlemanly man in a gray suit with a leathern bag slung over his shoulder stood there hat in hand and meeting helens eyes bowed respectfully saying in good english but with a strong german accent  ladies the major desired me to tell you the carriage waits  why who began amy staring with her blue eyes full of wonder at the stranger  he bowed again and said simply  karl hoffman at your service mademoiselle  the courieroh yes i forgot all about it please take these things  amy began to hand him her miscellaneous collection of bags books shawls and cushions  id no idea couriers were such decent creatures whispered amy as they followed him along the hall  dont you remember the raptures mrs mortimer used to have over their italian courier and her funny description of him beautiful to behold with a night of hair eyes full of an infinite tenderness and a sumptuous cheek  both girls laughed and amy averred that karls eyes danced with merriment as he glanced over his shoulder as the silvery peal sounded behind him  hush he understands english we must be careful said helen and neither spoke again till they reached the carriage  everything was ready and as they drove away the major leaning luxuriously back exclaimed  now i begin to enjoy travelling for im no longer worried by the thought of luggage timetables trains and the everlasting perplexity of thalers kreutzers and pfenniges this man is a treasure everything is done in the best manner and his knowledge of matters is really amazing  hes a very gentlemanlylooking person said amy eying a decidedly aristocratic foot through the front window of the carriage for karl sat up beside the driver  he is a gentleman my dear many of these couriers are well born and educated but being poor prefer this business to any other as it gives them variety and often pleasant society ive had a long talk with hoffman and find him an excellent and accomplished fellow he has lost his fortune it seems through no fault of his own so being fond of a roving life turned courier for a time and we are fortunate to have secured him  but one doesnt know how to treat him said helen i dont like to address him as a servant and yet its not pleasant to order a gentleman about  oh it will be easy enough as we go on together just call him hoffman and behave as if you knew nothing about his past he begged me not to mention it but i thought youd like the romance of the thing only dont either of you run away with him as ponsonbys daughter did with her courier who wasnt a gentleman by the way  not handsome enough said amy i dont like blue eyes and black hair his manners are nice but he looks like a gipsy with his brown face and black beard doesnt he nell  not at all gipsies havent that style of face they are thin sharp and cunning in feature as in nature hoffman has large wellmoulded features and a mild manly expression which gives one confidence in him  he has a keen wicked look in his blue eyes as you will see nell i mean mischievously not malignantly wicked he likes fun im sure for he laughed about the sumptuous cheek till his own were red though he dared not show it and was as grave as an owl when we met uncle said amy smiling at the recollection  we shall go by boat to biebrich and then by rail to heidelberg we shall get in late tomorrow night but can rest a day and then on to baden here we are now make yourselves easy as i do and let karl take care of everything  and putting his hands in his pockets the major strolled about the boat while the courier made matters comfortable for the day so easily and well did he do his duty that both girls enjoyed watching him after he had established them on the shady side of the boat with campstools for their feet cushions to lean on books and bags laid commodiously at hand  as they sailed up the lovely rhine they grew more and more enthusiastic in their admiration and curiosity and finding the meagre description of the guidebooks very unsatisfactory amy begged her uncle to tell her all the legends of picturesque ruin rock and river as they passed  bless me child i know nothing but heres hoffman a german born who will tell you everything i dare say karl whats that old castle up there the young ladies want to know about it  leaning on the railing hoffman told the story so well that he was kept explaining and describing for an hour and when he went away to order lunch amy declared it was as pleasant as reading fairy tales to listen to his dramatic histories and legends  at lunch the major was charmed to find his favorite wines and dishes without any need of consulting dictionary or phrasebook beforehand or losing his temper in vain attempts to make himself understood  on reaching biebrich tired and hungry at nightfall everything was ready for them and all went to bed praising karl the courier though amy with unusual prudence added  he is a new broom now let us wait a little before we judge  all went well next day till nightfall when a most untoward accident occurred and helens adventures began in earnest the three occupied a coup√© and being weary with long sitting helen got out at one of the stations where the train paused for ten minutes a rosy sunset tempted her to the end of the platform and there she found what nearly all foreign railway stations possess a charming little garden  amy was very tired rather cross and passionately fond of flowers so when an old woman offered to pull a nosegay for the gracious lady helen gladly waited for it hoping to please the invalid twice the whistle warned her and at last she ran back but only in time to see the train move away with her uncle gesticulating wildly to the guard who shook his stupid german head and refused to see the dismayed young lady imploring him to wait for her  just as the train was vanishing from the station a man leaped from a secondclass carriage at the risk of his neck and hurried back to find helen looking pale and bewildered as well she might left alone and moneyless at night in a strange town  mademoiselle it is i rest easy we can soon go on a train passes in two hours and we can telegraph to heidelberg that they may not fear for you  oh hoffman how kind of you to stop for me what should i have done without you for uncle takes care of all the money and i have only my watch  helens usual selfpossession rather failed her in the flurry of the moment and she caught karls arm with a feminine little gesture of confidence very pleasant to see leading her to the waitingroom he ordered supper and put her into the care of the woman of the place while he went to make inquiries and dispatch the telegram in half an hour he returned finding helen refreshed and cheerful though a trace of anxiety was still visible in her watchful eyes  all goes excellently mademoiselle i have sent word to several posts along the road that we are coming by the night train so that monsieur le major will rest tranquil till we meet it is best that i give you some money lest such a mishap should again occur it is not likely so soon nevertheless here is both gold and silver with this one can make ones way everywhere now if mademoiselle will permit me to advise she will rest for an hour as we must travel till dawn i will keep guard without and watch for the train  he left her and having made herself comfortable on one of the sofas she lay watching the tall shadow pass and repass door and window as karl marched up and down the platform with the tireless tramp of a sentinel on duty a pleasant sense of security stole over her and with a smile at amys enjoyment of the adventure when it was over helen fell asleep  a faroff shriek half woke her and starting up she turned to meet the courier coming in to wake her up thundered the train every carriage apparently full of sleepy passengers and the guard in a state of sullen wrath at some delay the consequences of which would fall heaviest on him  from carriage to carriage hurried karl and his charge to be met with everywhere by the cry all full in many languages and with every aspect of inhospitality one carriage only showed two places the other seats were occupied by six students who gallantly invited the lady to enter but helen shrunk back saying  is there no other place  none mademoiselle this or remain till morning said karl  where will you go if i take this place  among the luggageanywhere it is nothing but we must decide at once  come with me im afraid to be locked in here alone said helen desperately  mademoiselle forgets i am her courier  i do not forget that you are a gentleman pray come in my uncle will thank you  i will and with a sudden brightening of the eyes a grateful glance and an air of redoubled respect hoffman followed her into the carriage  they were off at once and the thing was done before helen had time to feel anything but the relief which the protection of his presence afforded her  the young gentlemen stared at the veiled lady and her grim escort joked under their breath and looked wistfully at the suppressed cigars but behaved with exemplary politeness till sleep overpowered them and one after the other dropped off asleep to dream of their respective gretchens  helen could not sleep and for hours sat studying the unconscious faces before her the dim landscape flying past the windows or forgot herself in reveries  hoffman remained motionless and silent except when she addressed him wakeful also and assiduous in making the long night as easy as possible  it was past midnight and helens heavy eyelids were beginning to droop when suddenly there came an awful crash a pang of mortal fear then utter oblivion  as her senses returned she found herself lying in a painful position under what had been the roof of the car something heavy weighed down her lower limbs and her dizzy brain rung with a wild uproar of shrieks and groans eager voices the crash of wood and iron and the shrill whistle of the engine as it rushed away for help  through the darkness she heard the pant as of some one struggling desperately then a cry close by her followed by a strong voice exclaiming in an agony of suspense  my god will no one come  hoffman are you there cried helen groping in the gloom with a thrill of joy at the sound of a familiar voice  thank heaven you are safe lie still i will save you help is coming have no fear panted the voice with an undertone of fervent gratitude in its breathless accents  what has happened where are the rest  we have been thrown down an embankment the lads are gone for help god only knows what harm is done  karls voice died in a stifled groan and helen cried out in alarm  where are you you are hurt  not much i keep the ruins from falling in to crush us be quiet they are coming  a shout answered the faint halloo he gave as if to guide them to the spot and a moment after five of the students were swarming about the wreck intent on saving the three whose lives were still in danger  a lamp torn from some demolished carriage was held through an opening and helen saw a sight that made her blood chill in her veins across her feet crushed and bleeding lay the youngest of the students and kneeling close beside him was hoffman supporting by main strength a mass of timber which otherwise would fall and crush them all his face was ghastly pale his eyes haggard with pain and suspense and great drops stood upon his forehead but as she looked he smiled with a cheery  bear up dear lady we shall soon be out of danger now lads work with a will my strength is going fast  they did work like heroes and even in her pain and peril helen admired the skill energy and courage of the young men who an hour ago had seemed to have no ideas above pipes and beer soon hoffman was free the poor senseless youth lifted out and then as tenderly as if she were a child they raised and set her down faint but unhurt in a wide meadow already strewn with sad tokens of the wreck  karl was taken possession of as well as herself forced to rest a moment drink a cordial draught from some ones flask and be praised embraced and enthusiastically blessed by the impetuous youths  where is the boy who was hurt bring him to me i am strong now i want to help i have salts in my pocket and i can bind up his wounds said helen soon herself again  karl and helen soon brought back life and sense to the boy and never had human face looked so lovely as did helens to the anxious comrades when she looked up in the moonlight with a joyful smile and softly whispered  he is alive  for an hour terrible confusion reigned then the panic subsided a little and such of the carriages as were whole were made ready to carry away as many as possible the rest must wait till a return train could be sent for them  a struggle of course ensued for every one wished to go on and fear made many selfish the wounded the women and children were taken as far as possible and the laden train moved away leaving many anxious watchers behind  helen had refused to go and had given her place to poor conrad thereby overwhelming his brother and comrades with gratitude two went on with the wounded lad the rest remained and chivalrously devoted themselves to helen as a bodyguard  the moon shone clearly the wide field was miles from any hamlet and a desolate silence succeeded to the late uproar as the band of waiters roamed about longing for help and dawn  mademoiselle you shiver the dew falls and it is damp here we must have a fire and karl was away to a neighboring hedge intent on warming his delicate charge if he felled a forest to do it  the students rushed after him and soon returned in triumph to build a glorious fire which drew all forlorn wanderers to its hospitable circle a motley assemblage but mutual danger and discomfort produced mutual sympathy and good will and a general atmosphere of friendship pervaded the party  where is the brave hoffman asked wilhelm the blond student who being in the werther period of youth was already madly in love with helen and sat at her feet catching cold in the most romantic manner  behold me the little ones cry for hunger so i ransack the ruins and bring away my spoils eat kinder eat and be patient  as he spoke karl appeared with an odd collection of baskets bags and bottles and with a fatherly air that won all the mothers he gave the children whatever first appeared making them laugh in spite of weariness and hunger by the merry speeches which accompanied his gifts  you too need something here is your own basket with the lunch i ordered you in a sad state of confusion but still eatable see it is not bad and he deftly spread on a napkin before helen cold chicken sandwiches and fruit  his care for the little ones as well as for herself touched her and her eyes filled as she remembered that she owed her life to him and recalled the sight of his face in the overturned car  her voice trembled a little as she thanked him and the moonlight betrayed her wet eyes he fancied she was worn out with excitement and fatigue and anxious to cheer her spirits he whispered to wilhelm and his mates  sing then comrades and while away this tedious night it is hard for all to wait so long and the babies need a lullaby  the young men laughed and sang as only german students can sing making the night musical with blithe drinking songs tender lovelays battlehymns and volkslieder sweeter than any songs across the water  every heart was cheered and warmed by the magic of the music the babies fell asleep strangers grew friendly fear changed to courage and the most forlorn felt the romance of that bivouac under the summer sky  dawn was reddening the east when a welcome whistle broke up the camp every one hurried to the railway but helen paused to gather a handful of blue forgetmenots saying to hoffman who waited with her wraps on his arm  it has been a happy night in spite of the danger and discomfort i shall not soon forget it and take these as a souvenir  he smiled standing bareheaded in the chilly wind for his hat was lost his coat torn hair dishevelled and one hand carelessly bound up in his handkerchief helen saw these marks of the nights labors and perils for the first time and as soon as they were seated desired to see his hand  it is nothinga scratch a mere scratch i give you my word mademoiselle he began but wilhelm unceremoniously removed the handkerchief showing a torn and bleeding hand which must have been exquisitely painful  helen turned pale and with a reproachful glance skilfully bound it up again saying as she handed a silken scarf to wilhelm  make of that a sling please and put the poor hand in it care must be taken or harm will come of it  hoffman submitted in bashful silence as if surprised and touched by the young ladys interest she saw that and added gratefully  i do not forget that you saved my life though you seem to have done so my uncle will thank you better than i can  i already have my reward mademoiselle he returned with a respectful inclination and a look she could neither understand nor forget   iii  amys adventure   the excitement and suspense of the major and amy can be imagined when news of the accident reached them their gratitude and relief were intense when helen appeared next morning with the faithful hoffman still at his post though no longer able to disguise the fact that he was suffering from his wound  when the story had been told karl was put under the surgeons care and all remained at heidelberg for several days to rest and recover  on the afternoon of the last day the major and young ladies drove off to the castle for a farewell view helen began to sketch the great stone lions head above the grand terrace the major smoked and chatted with a party of english artists whom he had met and amy with a little lad for a guide explored the old castle to her hearts content  the sun set and twilight began to fall when helen put up her pencils and the major set off to find amy who had been appearing and disappearing in every nook and cranny of the halfruined castle  nowhere could he find her and no voice answered when he called the other visitors were gone and the place seemed deserted except by themselves and the old man who showed the ruins  becoming alarmed lest the girl had fallen somewhere or lost her way among the vaults where the famous tun lies the major called out old hans with his lantern and searched high and low  amys hat full of flowers and ferns was found in the ladys walk as the little terrace is called but no other trace appeared and helen hurried to and fro in great distress fearing all manner of dangers  meanwhile amy having explored every other part of the castle went to take another look at the tun the dwarf and the vaults  now little anderl her guide had a great fear of ghosts and legions were said to haunt the ruins after nightfall so when amy rambled on deeper and deeper into the gloom the boys courage ebbed away with every step yet he was ashamed to own his fear seeing that she had none  amy wanted to see a certain cell where a nun was said to have pined to death because she would not listen to the margrafs love the legend pleased the romantic girl and forgetful of waning daylight gathering damps and anderls reluctant service she ran on up steps and down delighted with little arched doors rusty chains on the walls glimpses of sky through shattered roofs and all manner of mysterious nooks and corners coming at last to a narrow cell with a stone table and heavy bolts on the old door she felt sure this was poor elfridas prison and called anderl to come on with his candle for the boy had lighted one for his own comfort rather than hers her call was unanswered and glancing back she saw the candle placed on the ground but no anderl  little coward he has run away she said laughing and having satisfied her curiosity turned to retrace her stepsno easy task to one ignorant of the way for vault after vault opened on both sides and no path was discernible in vain she tried to recall some landmark the gloom had deepened and nothing was clear on she hurried but found no opening and really frightened stopped at last calling the boy in a voice that woke a hundred echoes but anderl had fled home thinking the lady would find her way back and preferring to lose his kreutzers to seeing a ghost  poor amys bewilderment and alarm increased with every moments delay and hoping to come out somewhere she ran on till a misstep jostled the candle from her hand and extinguished it  left in the dark her courage deserted her and she screamed desperately like a lost child and was fast getting into a state of frantic terror when the sound of an approaching step reassured her  holding her breath she heard a quick tread drawing nearer as if guided by her cries and straining her eyes she caught the outline of a mans figure in the gloom  a sensation of intense joy rushed over her and she was about to spring forward when she remembered that as she could speak no german how could she explain her plight to the stranger if he understood neither french nor english  fear took possession of her at the thought of meeting some rough peasant or some rollicking student to whom she could make no intelligible appeal or explanation  crouching close against the wall she stood mute till the figure was very near she was in the shadow of an angle and the man paused as if looking for the person who called for help  who is lost here said a clear voice in german  amy shrunk closer to the wall fearing to speak for the voice was that of a young man and a low laugh followed the words as if the speaker found the situation amusing  mortal ghost or devil ill find it exclaimed the voice and stepping forward a hand groped for and found her  lottchen is it thou little rogue thou shalt pay dearly for leading me such a chase  as he spoke he drew the girl toward him but with a faint cry a vain effort to escape amys terror reached its climax and spent with fatigue and excitement she lost consciousness  who the deuce is it then lottchen never faints on a frolic some poor little girl lost in earnest i must get her out of this gloomy place at once and find her party afterward  lifting the slight figure in his arms the young man hurried on and soon came out through a shattered gateway into the shrubbery which surrounds the base of the castle  laying her on the grass he gently chafed her hands eying the pale pretty face meantime with the utmost solicitude  at his first glimpse of it he had started smiled and made a gesture of pleasure and surprise then gave himself entirely to the task of recovering the poor girl whom he had frightened out of her senses  very soon she looked up with dizzy eyes and clasping her hands imploringly cried in english like a bewildered child  i am lost oh take me to my uncle  i will the moment you can walk upon my soul i meant to help you when i followed but as you did not answer i fancied it was lottchen the keepers little girl pardon the fright ive caused you and let me take you to your friends  the true english accent of the words and the hearty tone of sincerity in the apology reassured amy at once and rising she said with a faint smile and a petulant tone  i was very silly but my guide ran away my candle went out i lost the path and can speak no german so i was afraid to answer you at first and then i lost my wits altogether for its rather startling to be clutched in the dark sir  indeed it is i was very thoughtless but now let me atone for it where is your uncle miss erskine asked the stranger with respectful earnestness  you know my name cried amy in her impulsive way  i have that happiness was the answer with a smile  but i dont know you sir and she peered at him trying to see his face in the darkness for the copse was thick and twilight had come on rapidly  not yet i live in hope shall we go your uncle will be uneasy  where are we asked amy glad to move on for the interview was becoming too personal even for her and the strangers manner fluttered her though she enjoyed the romance of the adventure immensely  we are in the park which surrounds the castle you were near the entrance to it from the vaults when you fainted  i wish i had kept on a little longer and not disgraced myself by such a panic  nay that is a cruel wish for then i should have lost the happiness of helping you  they had been walking side by side but were forced to pause on reaching a broken flight of steps for amy could not see the way before her  let me lead you it is steep and dark but better than going a long way round through the dew he said offering his hand  must we return by these dreadful vaults faltered amy shrinking back  it is the shortest and safest route i assure you  are you sure you know the way  quite sure i have lived here by the week together do you fear to trust me  no but it is so dark and everything is so strange to me can we get down safely i see nothing but a black pit  and amy still hesitated with an odd mixture of fear and coquetry  i brought you up in safety shall i take you down again asked the stranger with a smile flickering over his face  amy felt rather than saw it and assuming an air of dignified displeasure motioned him to proceed which he did for three steps then amy slipped and gladly caught at the arm extended to save her  without a word he took her hand and led her back through the labyrinth she had threaded in her bewilderment a dim light filled the place but with unerring steps her guide went on till they emerged into the courtyard  major erskines voice was audible giving directions to the keeper and helens figure visible as she groped among the shadows of the ruined chapel for her cousin  there are my friends now i am safe come and let them thank you cried amy in her frank childlike warmth of manner  i want no thanksforgive meadieu and hastily kissing the little hand that had lain so confidingly in his the stranger was gone  amy rushed at once to helen and when the lost lamb had been welcomed chidden and exulted over they drove home listening to the very brief account which amy gave of her adventure  naughty little gadabout how could you go and terrify me so wandering in vaults with mysterious strangers like the countess of rudolstadt you are as wet and dirty as if you had been digging a well yet you look as if you liked it said helen as she led amy into their room at the hotel  i do was the decided answer as the girl pulled a handkerchief off her head and began to examine the corners of it suddenly she uttered a cry and flew to the light exclaiming  nell nell look here the same letters sp the same coat of arms the same perfumeit was the baron  what who are you out of your mind said helen examining the large fine cambric handkerchief with its delicately stamped initials under the stags head and three stars on a heartshaped shield where did you get it she added as she inhaled the soft odor of violets shaken from its folds  amy blushed and answered shyly i didnt tell you all that happened before uncle but now i will my hat was left behind and when i recovered my wits after my fright i found this tied over my head oh nell it was very charming there in that romantic old park and going through the vaults with him and having my hand kissed at parting no one ever did that before and i like it  amy glanced at her hand as she spoke and stood staring as if struck dumb for there on her forefinger shone a ring she had never seen before  look look mine is gone and this in its place oh nell what shall i do she said looking half frightened half pleased  helen examined the ring and shook her head for it was far more valuable than the little pearl one which it replaced two tiny hands of finest gold were linked together about a diamond of great brilliancy and on the inside appeared again the initials sp  how did it happen she asked rather sternly  upon my word i dont know unless he put it on while i was stupidly fainting rude man to take advantage of me so but nell it is splendid and what shall i do about it  tell uncle find out the man and send back his things it really is absurd the manner in which german boys behave and helen frowned though she was strongly tempted to laugh at the whole thing  he was neither a german nor a boy but an english gentleman im sure began amy rather offended  but sp is a baron you know unless there are two richmonds in the field broke in helen  i forgot that never mind it deepens the mystery and after this performance im prepared for any enormity its my fate i submit said amy tragically as she waved her hand to and fro pleased with the flash of the ring  amy i think on the whole i wont speak to uncle he is quick to take offence especially where we are concerned he doesnt understand foreign ways and may get into trouble we will manage it quietly ourselves  how nell  karl is discreet we will merely say we found these things and wish to discover the owner he may know this sp and having learned his address we can send them back the man will understand and as we leave tomorrow we shall be out of the way before he can play any new prank  have in karl at once for if i wear this lovely thing long i shall not be able to let it go at all how dared the creature take such a liberty and amy pulled off the ring with an expression of great scorn  come into the salon and see what karl says to the matter let me speak or you will say too much one must be prudent before  she was going to say servants but checked herself and substituted strangers remembering gratefully how much she owed this man  hoffman came looking pale and with his hand in a sling but was as gravely devoted as ever and listened to helens brief story with serious attention  i will inquire mademoiselle and let you know at once it is easy to find persons if one has a clue may i see the handkerchief  helen showed it he glanced at the initials and laid it down with a slight smile  the coatofarms is english mademoiselle  are you sure  quite so i understand heraldry  but the initials stand for sigismund palsdorf and we know he is a german baron broke in amy forgetting prudence in eagerness  if mademoiselle knows the name and title of this gentleman it will not be hard to find him  we only fancy it is the same because of the initials i dare say it is a mistake and the man is english inquire quietly hoffman if you please as this ring is of value and i wish to restore it to its owner said helen rather sharply  i shall do so mademoiselle and with his gentlemanly bow the courier left the room  bless me whats that cried amy a moment afterward as a ringing laugh echoed through the corridora laugh so full of hearty and infectious merriment that both girls smiled involuntarily and amy peeped out to see who the blithe personage might be  an old gentleman was entering his room near by and karl was just about to descend the stairs both looked back at the girlish face peeping at them but both were quite grave and the peal of laughter remained a mystery like all the rest of it  late in the evening hoffman returned to report that a party of young englishmen had visited the castle that afternoon and had left by the evening train one of them had been named samuel peters and he doubtless was the owner of the ring  a humorous expression lurked in the couriers eye as he made his report and heard amy exclaim in a tone of disgust and comical despair  samuel peters that spoils all the romance and dims the beauty of the diamond to think that a peters should be the hero to whom i owe my safety and a samuel should leave me this token of regard  hush amy whispered helen thanks hoffman we must wait now for chance to help us   iv  a polish exile   room for one here sir said the guard as the train stopped at carlsruhe next day on its way from heidelberg to baden  the major put down his guidebook amy opened her eyes and helen removed her shawl from the opposite seat as a young man wrapped in a cloak with a green shade over his eyes and a general air of feebleness got in and sank back with a sigh of weariness or pain evidently an invalid for his face was thin and pale his dark hair cropped short and the ungloved hand attenuated and delicate as a womans a sidelong glance from under the deep shade seemed to satisfy him regarding his neighbors and drawing his cloak about him with a slight shiver he leaned into the corner and seemed to forget that he was not alone  helen and amy exchanged glances of compassionate interest for women always pity invalids especially if young comely and of the opposite sex the major took one look shrugged his shoulders and returned to his book presently a hollow cough gave helen a pretext for discovering the nationality of the newcomer  do the open windows inconvenience you sir she asked in english  no answer the question evidently unintelligible  she repeated it in french lightly touching his cloak to arrest his attention  instantly a smile broke over the handsome mouth and in the purest french he assured her that the fresh air was most agreeable and begged pardon for annoying them with his troublesome cough  not an invalid i hope sir said the major in his bluff yet kindly voice  they tell me i can have no other fate that my malady is fatal but i still hope and fight for my life it is all i have to give my country now  a stifled sigh and a sad emphasis on the last word roused the sympathy of the girls the interest of the major  he took another survey and said with a tone of satisfaction as he marked the martial carriage of the young man and caught a fiery glance of the halfhidden eyes  you are a soldier sir  i was i am nothing now but an exile for poland is in chains  the words poland and exile brought up all the pathetic stories of that unhappy country which the three listeners had ever heard and won their interest at once  you were in the late revolution perhaps asked the major giving the unhappy outbreak the most respectful name he could use  from beginning to end  oh tell us about it we felt much sympathy for you and longed to have you win cried amy with such genuine interest and pity in her tone it was impossible to resist  pressing both hands upon his breast the young man bent low with a flush of feeling on his pale cheek and answered eagerly  ah you are kind it is balm to my sore heart to hear words like these i thank you and tell you what you will it is but little that i do yet i give my life and die a long death instead of a quick brave one with my comrades  you are young to have borne a part in a revolution sir said the major who pricked up his ears like an old warhorse at the sound of battle  my friends and myself left the university at varsovie as volunteers we did our part and now all lie in their graves but three  you were wounded it seems  many times exposure privation and sorrow will finish what the russian bullets began but it is well i have no wish to see my country enslaved and i can no longer help her  let us hope that a happier future waits for you both poland loves liberty too well and has suffered too much for it to be kept long in captivity  helen spoke warmly and the young man listened with a brightening face  it is a kind prophecy i accept it and take courage god knows i need it he added low to himself  are you bound for italy said the major in a most unenglish fit of curiosity  for geneva first italy later unless montreaux is mild enough for me to winter in i go to satisfy my friends but doubt if it avails  where is montreaux asked amy  near clarens where rousseau wrote his heloise and vevay where so many english go to enjoy chillon the climate is divine for unfortunates like myself and life more cheap there than in italy  here the train stopped again and hoffman came to ask if the ladies desired anything  at the sound of his voice the young pole started looked up and exclaimed with the vivacity of a foreigner in german  by my life it is karl behold me old friend and satisfy me that it is thyself by a handshake  casimer what wind blows thee hither my boy in such sad plight replied hoffman grasping the slender hand outstretched to him  i fly from an enemy for the first time in my life and like all cowards shall be conquered in the end i wrote thee i was better but the wound in the breast reopened and nothing but a miracle will save me i go to switzerland and thou  where my master commands i serve this gentleman now  hard changes for both but with health thou art king of circumstances while iah well the good god knows best karl go thou and buy me two of those pretty baskets of grapes i will please myself by giving them to these pitying angels speak they german  one the elder but they understand not this rattle of ours  karl disappeared and helen who had understood the rapid dialogue tried to seem as unconscious as amy  say a friendly word to me at times i am so homesick and fainthearted my hoffman thanks they are almost worthy the lips that shall taste them  taking the two little osier baskets laden with yellow and purple clusters casimer offered them with a charming mixture of timidity and grace to the girls saying like a grateful boy  you give me kind words and good hopes permit that i thank you in this poor way  i drink success to poland cried helen lifting a great juicy grape to her lips like a little purple goblet hoping to hide her confusion under a playful air  the grapes went round and healths were drunk with much merriment for in travelling on the continent it is impossible for the gruffest primmest person to long resist the frank courtesy and vivacious chat of foreigners  the major was unusually social and inquisitive and while the soldiers fought their battles over again the girls listened and took notes with feminine wits on the alert to catch any personal revelations which might fall from the interesting stranger the wrongs and sufferings of poland were discussed so eloquently that both young ladies were moved to declare the most undying hatred of russia prussia and austria the most intense sympathy for poor pologne all day they travelled together and as badenbaden approached they naturally fell to talking of the gay place  uncle i must try my fortune once ive set my heart upon it and so has nell we want to know how gamblers feel and to taste the fascination of the game which draws people here from all parts of europe said amy in her halfpleading halfimperious way  you may risk one napoleon each as i foolishly promised you should when i little thought you would ever have an opportunity to remind me of my promise its not an amusement for respectable englishwomen or men either you will agree with me there monsieur and the major glanced at the pole who replied with his peculiar smile  surely yes it is great folly and waste of time and money yet i have known one man who found some good in it or rather brought good out of it i have a friend who has a mania for giving his own fortune was spent in helping needy students at the university and poor professors this displeased his father and he refused supplies except enough for his simple personal wants sigismund chafed at this and being skilful at all games as a gentleman may be in the way of amusement he resolved to play with those whose money was wasted on frivolities and give his winnings to his band of paupers  how did it succeed this odd fancy asked helen with an interested face while amy pinched her arm at the word sigismund  excellently my friend won often and as his purpose became known it caused no unkind feeling this unusual success for fortune seemed to favor his kind object  wrong nevertheless to do evil that good may come of it said the major morally  it may be so but it is not for me to censure my benefactor he has done much for my countrymen and myself and is so truly noble i can see no fault in him  what an odd name sigismund is german is it not asked amy in the most artless tone of interest  yes mademoiselle and palsdorf is a true german much courage strength and intellect with the gayety and simplicity of a boy he hates slavery of all kinds and will be free at all costs he is a good son but his father is tyrannical and asks too much sigismund will not submit to sell himself and so is in disgrace for a time  palsdorfwas not that the name of the count or baron we heard them talking of at coblentz said helen to amy with a wellfeigned air of uncertainty  yes i heard something of a duel and a broken betrothal i think the people seemed to consider the baron a wild young man so it could not have been your friend sir was amys demure reply glancing at helen with mirthful eyes as if to say how our baron haunts us  it is the same doubtless many consider him wild because he is original and dares act for himself as it is well known i may tell you the truth of the duel and the betrothal if you care to hear a little romance  casimer looked eager to defend his friend and as the girls were longing to hear the romance permission was given  in germany you know the young people are often betrothed in childhood by the parents and sometimes never meet till they are grown usually all goes well but not always for love cannot come at command sigismund was plighted when a boy of fifteen to his young cousin and then sent away to the university till of age on returning he was to travel a year or two and then marry he gladly went away and with increasing disquiet saw the time draw near when he must keep his trothplight  hum loved some one else very unfortunate to be sure said the major with a sigh  not so he only loved his liberty and pretty minna was less dear than a life of perfect freedom he went back at the appointed time saw his cousin tried to do his duty and love her found it impossible and discovering that minna loved another vowed he would never make her unhappiness as well as his own the old baron stormed but the young one was firm and would not listen to a marriage without love but pleaded for minna wished his rival success and set out again on his travels  and the duel asked the major who took less interest in love than war  that was as characteristic as the other act a son of one high in office at berlin circulated false reports of the cause of palsdorfs refusal of the alliancereports injurious to minna sigismund settled the matter in the most effectual manner by challenging and wounding the man but for court influence it would have gone hardly with my friend the storm however has blown over minna will be happy with her lover and sigismund with his liberty till he tires of it  is he handsome this hero of yours said amy feeling the ring under her glove for in spite of helens advice she insisted on wearing it that it might be at hand to return at any moment should chance again bring the baron in their way  a true german of the old type blond and blueeyed tall and strong my hero in good truthbrave and loyal tender and true was the enthusiastic answer  i hate fair men pouted amy under her breath as the major asked some question about hotels  take a new hero then nothing can be more romantic than that whispered helen glancing at the pale darkhaired figure wrapped in the military cloak opposite  i will and leave the baron to you said amy with a stifled laugh  hush here are baden and karl replied helen thankful for the interruption  all was bustle in a moment and taking leave of them with an air of reluctance the pole walked away leaving amy looking after him wistfully quite unconscious that she stood in everybodys way and that her uncle was beckoning impatiently from the carriage door  poor boy i wish he had some one to take care of him she sighed half aloud  mademoiselle the major waits and karl came up hat in hand just in time to hear her and glance after casimer with an odd expression   v  ludmilla   i wonder what that young mans name was did he mention it helen said the major pausing in his march up and down the room as if the question was suggested by the sight of the little baskets which the girls had kept  no uncle but you can easily ask hoffman replied helen  by the way karl who was the polish gentleman who came on with us asked the major a moment afterward as the courier came in with newspapers  casimer teblinski sir  a baron asked amy who was decidedly a young lady of one idea just then  no mademoiselle but of a noble family as the ski denotes for that is to polish and russian names what von is to german and de to french  i was rather interested in him where did you pick him up hoffman said the major  in paris where he was with fellowexiles  he is what he seems is heno impostor or anything of that sort one is often deceived you know  on my honor sir he is a gentleman and as brave as he is accomplished and excellent  will he die asked amy pathetically  with care he would recover i think but there is no one to nurse him so the poor lad must take his chance and trust in heaven for help  how sad i wish we were going his way so that we might do something for himat least give him the society of his friend  helen glanced at hoffman feeling that if he were not already engaged by them he would devote himself to the invalid without any thought of payment  perhaps we are you want to see the lake of geneva chillon and that neighborhood why not go now instead of later  will you uncle thats capital we need say nothing but go on and help the poor boy if we can  helen spoke like a matron of forty and looked as full of maternal kindness as if the pole were not out of his teens  the courier bowed the major laughed behind his paper and amy gave a sentimental sigh to the memory of the baron in whom her interest was failing  they only caught a glimpse of the pole that evening at the kursaal but next morning they met and he was invited to join their party for a little expedition  the major was in fine spirits and helen assumed her maternal air toward both invalids for the sound of that hollow cough always brought a shadow over her face recalling the brother she had lost  amy was particularly merry and charming and kept the whole party laughing at her comical efforts to learn polish and teach english as they drove up the mountainside to the old schloss  im not equal to mounting all those steps for a view ive seen a dozen times but pray take care of the child nell or shell get lost again as at heidelberg said the major when they had roamed about the lower part of the place for a cool seat in the courtyard and a glass of beer were more tempting than turrets and prospects to the stout gentleman  she shall not be lost i am her bodyguard it is steeppermit that i lead you mademoiselle casimer offered his hand to amy and they began their winding way as she took the hand the girl blushed and half smiled remembering the vaults and the baron  i like this better she said to herself as they climbed step by step often pausing to rest in the embrasures of the loopholes where the sun glanced in the balmy wind blew and vines peeped from without making a pretty picture of the girl as she sat with rosy color on her usually pale cheeks brown curls fluttering about her forehead laughing lips and bright eyes full of pleasant changes leaning opposite in the narrow stairway casimer had time to study the little tableau in many lights and in spite of the dark glasses to convey warm glances of admiration of which however the young coquette seemed utterly unconscious  helen came leisurely after and hoffman followed with a telescope wishing as he went that his countrywomen possessed such dainty feet as those going on before him for which masculine iniquity he will be pardoned by all who have seen the foot of a german fraulein  it was worth the long ascent that widespread landscape basking in the august glow  sitting on a fallen block of stone while casimer held a sunumbrella over her amy had raptures at her ease while helen sketched and asked questions of hoffman who stood beside her watching her progress with interest once when after repeated efforts to catch a curious effect of light and shade she uttered an impatient little exclamation karl made a gesture as if to take the pencil and show her but seemed to recollect himself and drew back with a hasty pardon mademoiselle helen glanced up and saw the expression of his face which plainly betrayed that for a moment the gentleman had forgotten he was a courier she was glad of it for it was a daily trial to her to order this man about and following the womanly impulse she smiled and offered the pencil saying simply  i felt sure you understood it please show me  he did so and a few masterly strokes gave the sketch what it needed as he bent near her to do this helen stole a glance at the grave dark face and suddenly a disturbed look dawned in the eyes fixed on the glossy black locks pushed off the couriers forehead for he had removed his hat when she spoke to him he seemed to feel that something was amiss shot a quick glance at her returned the pencil and rose erect with an almost defiant air yet something of shame in his eye as his lips moved as if to speak impetuously but not a word did he utter for helen touched her forehead significantly and said in a low tone  i am an artist let me recommend vandyke brown which is not affected by heat  hoffman looked over his shoulder at the other pair but amy was making an ivy wreath for her hat and the pole pulling sprays for the absorbing work speaking rapidly karl said with a peculiar blending of merriment humility and anxiety in his tone  mademoiselle you are quick to discover my disguise will you also be kind in concealing i have enemies as well as friends whom i desire to escape i would earn my bread unknown monsieur le major keeps my foolish secret may i hope for equal goodness from yourself  you may i do not forget that i owe my life to you nor that you are a gentleman trust me i never will betray you  thanks thanks there will come a time when i may confess the truth and be myself but not yet and his regretful tone was emphasized by an impatient gesture as if concealment was irksome  nell come down to lunch uncle is signalling as if hed gone mad no monsieur it is quite impossible you cannot reach the harebells without risking too much come away and forget that i wanted them  amy led the way and all went down more quietly than they came up especially helen and hoffman an excellent lunch waited on one of the tables in front of the old gateway and having done justice to it the major made himself comfortable with a cigar bidding the girls keep near for they must be off in half an hour hoffman went to see to the horses casimer strolled away with him and the young ladies went to gather wild flowers at the foot of the tower  not a harebell here isnt it provoking when they grow in tufts up there where one cant reach them mercy whats that run nell the old wall is coming down  both had been grubbing in a damp nook where ferns and mosses grew luxuriantly the fall of a bit of stone and a rending sound above made them fly back to the path and look up  amy covered her eyes and helen grew pale for part way down the crumbling tower clinging like a bird to the thick ivy stems hung casimer coolly gathering harebells from the clefts of the wall  hush dont cry out or speak it may startle him crazy boy let us see what he will do whispered helen  he cant go back the vines are so torn and weak and how will he get down the lower wall for you see the ivy grows up from that ledge and there is nothing below how could he do it i was only joking when i lamented that there were no knights now ready to leap into a lions den for a ladys glove returned amy half angry  in breathless silence they watched the climber till his cap was full of flowers and taking it between his teeth he rapidly swung down to the wide ledge from which there appeared to be no way of escape but a reckless leap of many feet on to the turf below  the girls stood in the shadow of an old gateway unperceived and waited anxiously what should follow  lightly folding and fastening the cap together he dropped it down and leaning forward tried to catch the top of a young birch rustling close by the wall twice he missed it the first time he frowned but the second he uttered an emphatic deuce take it  helen and amy looked at each other with a mutual smile and exclamation  he knows some english then  there was time for no morea violent rustle a boyish laugh and down swung the slender tree with the young man clinging to the top  as he landed safely helen cried bravo and amy rushed out exclaiming reproachfully yet admiringly  how could you do it and frighten us so i shall never express a wish before you again for if i wanted the moon youd rashly try to get it i know  certainement mademoiselle was the smiling reply casimer presented the flowers as if the exploit was a mere trifle  now i shall go and press them at once in uncles guidebook come and help me else you will be in mischief again and amy led the way to the major with her flowers and their giver  helen roamed into one of the ruined courts for a last look at a fountain which pleased her eye a sort of cloister ran round the court open on both sides and standing in one of these arched nooks she saw hoffman and a young girl talking animatedly the girl was pretty well dressed and seemed refusing something for which the other pleaded eagerly his arm was about her and she leaned affectionately upon him with a white hand now and then caressing his face which was full of sparkle and vivacity now they seemed about to part as helen looked for the maiden standing on tiptoe laughingly offered her blooming cheek and as karl kissed it warmly he said in german so audibly helen heard every word  farewell my ludmilla keep silent and i shall soon be with you embrace the little one and do not let him forget me  both left the place as they spoke each going a different way and helen slowly returned to her party saying to herself in a troubled tone  ludmilla and the little one are his wife and child doubtless i wonder if uncle knows that  when hoffman next appeared she could not resist looking at him but the accustomed gravity was resumed and nothing remained of the glow and brightness he had worn when with ludmilla in the cloister   vi  chateau de la tour   helen looked serious and amy indignant when their uncle joined them ready to set out by the afternoon train all having dined and rested after the mornings excursion  well little girls whats the matter now he asked paternally for the excellent man adored his nieces  helen says its not best to go on with the pole and is perfectly nonsensical uncle began amy petulantly and not very coherently  better be silly now than sorry by and by i only suggested that being interesting and amy romantic she might find this young man too charming if we see too much of him said helen  bless my soul what an idea cried the major why nell hes an invalid a catholic and a foreigner any one of which objections are enough to settle that matter little amy isnt so foolish as to be in danger of losing her heart to a person so entirely out of the question as this poor lad is she  of course not you do me justice uncle nell thinks she may pity and pet any one she likes because she is five years older than i and entirely forgets that she is a great deal more attractive than a feeble thing like me i should as soon think of losing my heart to hoffman as to the pole even if he wasnt what he is one may surely be kind to a dying man without being accused of coquetry and amy sobbed in the most heartrending manner  helen comforted her by withdrawing all objections and promising to leave the matter in the majors hands but she shook her head privately when she saw the illdisguised eagerness with which her cousin glanced up and down the platform after they were in the train and she whispered to her uncle unobserved  leave future meetings to chance and dont ask the pole in if you can help it  nonsense my dear you are as particular as your aunt the lad amuses me and you cant deny you like to nurse sick heroes was all the answer she got as the major with true masculine perversity put his head out of the window and hailed casimer as he was passing with a bow  here teblinski my good fellow dont desert us weve always a spare seat for you if you havent pleasanter quarters  with a flush of pleasure the young man came up but hesitated to accept the invitation till helen seconded it with a smile of welcome  amy was in an injured mood and shrouded in a great blue veil pensively reclined in her corner as if indifferent to everything about her but soon the cloud passed and she emerged in a radiant state of good humor which lasted unbroken until the journey ended  for two days they went on together a very happy party for the major called in hoffman to see his friend and describe the places through which they passed an arrangement very agreeable to all as karl was a favorite and every one missed him when away  at lausanne they waited while he crossed the lake to secure rooms at vevay on his return he reported that all the hotels and pensions were full but that at la tour he had secured rooms for a few weeks in a quaint old chateau on the banks of the lake  count severin is absent in egypt and the housekeeper has permission to let the apartments to transient visitors the suite of rooms i speak of were engaged to a party who are detained by sicknessthey are cheap pleasant and comfortable a salon and four bedrooms i engaged them all thinking that teblinski might like a room there till he finds lodgings at montreaux we can enter at once and i am sure the ladies will approve of the picturesque place  well done hoffman off we go without delay for i really long to rest my old bones in something like a home after this long trip said the major who always kept his little troop in light marching order  the sail across that loveliest of lakes prepared the newcomers to be charmed with all they saw and when entering by the old stone gate they were led into a large saloon quaintly furnished and opening into a terracegarden overhanging the water with chillon and the alps in sight amy declared nothing could be more perfect and helens face proved her satisfaction  an english widow and two quiet old german professors on a vacation were the only inmates besides themselves and the buxom swiss housekeeper and her maids  it was late when our party arrived and there was only time for a hasty survey of their rooms and a stroll in the garden before dinner  the great chamber with its shadowy bed dark mirrors ghostly wainscotdoors and narrow windows had not been brightened for a long time by such a charming little apparition as amy when she shook out her airy muslins smoothed her curls and assumed all manner of distracting devices for the captivation of mankind even helen though not much given to personal vanity found herself putting flowers in her hair and studying the effect of bracelets on her handsome arms as if there was some especial need of looking her best on this occasion  both were certainly great ornaments to the drawingroom that evening as the old professors agreed while they sat blinking at them like a pair of benign owls casimer surprised them by his skill in music for though forbidden to sing on account of his weak lungs he played as if inspired amy hovered about him like a moth the major cultivated the acquaintance of the plump widow and helen stood at the window enjoying the lovely night and music till something happened which destroyed her pleasure in both  the window was open and leaning from it she was watching the lake when the sound of a heavy sigh caught her ear there was no moon but through the starlight she saw a mans figure among the shrubs below sitting with bent head and hidden face in the forlorn attitude of one shut out from the music light and gayety that reigned within  it is karl she thought and was about to speak when as if startled by some sound she did not hear he rose and vanished in the gloom of the garden  poor man he thought of his wife and child perhaps sitting here alone while all the rest make merry with no care for him uncle must see to this and helen fell into a reverie till amy came to propose retiring  i meant to have seen where all these doors led but was so busy dressing i had no time so must leave it for my amusement tomorrow uncle says its a very radcliffian place how like an angel that man did play chattered amy and lulled herself to sleep by humming the last air casimer had given them  helen could not sleep for the lonely figure in the garden haunted her and she wearied herself with conjectures about hoffman and his mystery hour after hour rung from the cuckooclock in the hall but still she lay awake watching the curious shadows in the room and exciting herself with recalling the tales of german goblins with which the courier had amused them the day before  it is close and musty here with all this old tapestry and stuff about ill open the other window she thought and noiselessly slipping from amys side she threw on wrapper and slippers lighted her candle and tried to unbolt the tall diamondpaned lattice it was rusty and would not yield and giving it up she glanced about to see whence air could be admitted there were four doors in the room all low and arched with clumsy locks and heavy handles one opened into a closet one into the passage the third was locked but the fourth opened easily and lifting her light she peeped into a small octagon room full of all manner of curiosities what they were she had no time to see for her startled eyes were riveted on an object that turned her faint and cold with terror  a heavy table stood in the middle of the room and seated at it with some kind of weapon before him was a man who looked over his shoulder with a ghastly face half hidden by hair and beard and fierce black eyes as full of malignant menace as was the clinched hand holding the pistol one instant helen looked the next flung to the door bolted it and dropped into a chair trembling in every limb the noise did not wake amy and a moments thought showed helen the wisdom of keeping her in ignorance of this affair she knew the major was close by and possessing much courage she resolved to wait a little before rousing the house  hardly had she collected herself when steps were heard moving softly in the octagon room her light had gone out as she closed the door and sitting close by in the dark she heard the sound of some one breathing as he listened at the keyhole then a careful hand tried the door so noiselessly that no sleeper would have been awakened and as if to guard against a second surprise the unknown person drew two bolts across the door and stole away  safe for a time but ill not pass another night under this roof unless this is satisfactorily cleared up thought helen now feeling more angry than frightened  the last hour that struck was three and soon the summer dawn reddened the sky dressing herself helen sat by amy a sleepless guard till she woke smiling and rosy as a child saying nothing of her last nights alarm helen went down to breakfast a little paler than usual but otherwise unchanged the major never liked to be disturbed till he had broken his fast and the moment they rose from the table he exclaimed  now girls come and see the mysteries of udolpho  ill say nothing yet thought helen feeling braver by daylight yet troubled by her secret for hoffman might be a traitor and this charming chateau a den of thieves such things had been and she was in a mood to believe anything  the upper story was a perfect museum of antique relics very entertaining to examine having finished these hoffman who acted as guide led them into a little gloomy room containing a straw pallet a stone table with a loaf and pitcher on it and kneeling before a crucifix where the light from a single slit in the wall fell on him was the figure of a monk the waxen mask was lifelike the attitude effective and the cell excellently arranged amy cried out when she first saw it but a second glance reassured her and she patted the bald head approvingly as karl explained  count severin is an antiquarian and amuses himself with things of this sort in old times there really was a hermit here and this is his effigy come down these narrow stairs if you please and see the rest of the mummery  down they went and the instant helen looked about her she burst into a hysterical laugh for there sat her ruffian exactly as she saw him glaring over his shoulder with threatening eyes and one hand on the pistol they all looked at her for she was pale and her merriment unnatural so feeling she had excited curiosity she gratified it by narrating her nights adventure hoffman looked much concerned  pardon mademoiselle the door should have been bolted on this side it usually is but that room being unused it was forgotten i remembered it and having risen early crept up to make sure that you did not come upon this ugly thing unexpectedly but i was too late it seems you have suffered to my sorrow  dear nell and that was why i found you so pale and cold and quiet sitting by me when i woke guarding me faithfully as you promised you would how brave and kind you were  villain i should much like to fire your own pistols at you for this prank of yours  and casimer laughingly filliped the image on its absurdly aquiline nose  what in the name of common sense is this goblin here for demanded the major testily  there is a legend that once the owner of the chateau amused himself by decoying travellers here putting them to sleep in that room and by various devices alluring them thither here one step beyond the threshold of the door was a trap down which the unfortunates were precipitated to the dungeon at the bottom of the tower there to die and be cast into the lake through a watergate still to be seen severin keeps this flattering likeness of the rascal as he does the monk above to amuse visitors by daylight not at night mademoiselle  and hoffman looked wrathfully at the image as if he would much enjoy sending it down the trap  how ridiculous i shall not go about this place alone for fear of lighting upon some horror of this sort ive had enough come away into the garden its full of roses and we may have as many as we like  as she spoke amy involuntarily put out her hand for casimer to lead her down the steep stone steps and he pressed the little hand with a tender look which caused it to be hastily withdrawn  here are your roses pretty flower i know its meaning in english for it is the same with us to give a bud to a lady is to confess the beginning of love a half open one tells of its growth and a fullblown one is to declare ones passion do you have that custom in your land mademoiselle  he had gathered the three as he spoke and held the bud separately while looking at his companion wistfully  no we are not poetical like your people but it is a pretty fancy and amy settled her bouquet with an absorbed expression though inwardly wondering what he would do with his flowers  he stood silent a moment with a sudden flush sweeping across his face then flung all three into the lake with a gesture that made the girl start and muttered between his teeth  no no for me it is too late  she affected not to hear but making up a second bouquet she gave it to him with no touch of coquetry in compassionate eyes or gentle voice  make your room bright with these when one is ill nothing is so cheering as the sight of flowers  meantime the others had descended and gone their separate ways  as karl crossed the courtyard a little child ran to meet him with outstretched arms and a shout of satisfaction he caught it up and carried it away on his shoulder like one used to caress and be caressed by children  helen waiting at the door of the tower while the major dusted his coat saw this and said suddenly directing his attention to man and child  he seems fond of little people i wonder if he has any of his own  hoffman no my dear hes not married i asked him that when i engaged him  and he said he was not  yes hes not more than five or sixandtwenty and fond of a wandering life so what should he want of a wife and a flock of bantlings  he seems sad and sober sometimes and i fancied he might have some domestic trouble to harass him dont you think there is something peculiar about him asked helen remembering hoffmans hint that her uncle knew his wish to travel incognito and wondering if he would throw any light upon the matter but the majors face was impenetrable and his answer unsatisfactory  well i dont know every one has some worry or other and as for being peculiar all foreigners seem more or less so to us they are so unreserved and demonstrative i like hoffman more and more every day and shall be sorry when i part with him  ludmilla is his sister then or he didnt tell uncle the truth it is no concern of mine but i wish i knew thought helen anxiously and then wondered why she should care  a feeling of distrust had taken possession of her and she determined to be on the watch for the unsuspicious major would be easily duped and helen trusted more to her own quick and keen eye than to his experience she tried to show nothing of the change in her manner but hoffman perceived it and bore it with a proud patience which often touched her heart but never altered her purpose   vii  at fault   four weeks went by so rapidly that every one refused to believe it when the major stated the fact at the breakfasttable for all had enjoyed themselves so heartily that they had been unconscious of the lapse of time  you are not going away uncle cried amy with a panicstricken look  next week my dear we must be off for weve much to do yet and i promised mamma to bring you back by the end of october  never mind paris and the rest of it this is pleasanter id rather stay here  there amy checked herself and tried to hide her face behind her coffeecup for casimer looked up in a way that made her heart flutter and her cheeks burn  sorry for it amy but go we must so enjoy your last week with all your might and come again next year  it will never be again what it is now sighed amy and casimer echoed the words next year as if sadly wondering if the present year would not be his last  helen rose silently and went into the garden for of late she had fallen into the way of reading and working in the little pavilion which stood in an angle of the wall overlooking lake and mountains  a seat at the opposite end of the walk was amys haunt for she liked the sun and within a week or two something like constraint had existed between the cousins each seemed happier apart and each was intent on her own affairs helen watched over amys health but no longer offered advice or asked confidence she often looked anxious and once or twice urged the major to go as if conscious of some danger  but the worthy man seemed to have been bewitched as well as the young folks and was quite happy sitting by the plump placid widow or leisurely walking with her to the chapel on the hillside  all seemed waiting for something to break up the party and no one had the courage to do it the majors decision took every one by surprise and amy and casimer looked as if they had fallen from the clouds  the persistency with which the english lessons had gone on was amazing for amy usually tired of everything in a day or two now however she was a devoted teacher and her pupil did her great credit by the rapidity with which he caught the language it looked like pleasant play sitting among the roses day after day amy affecting to embroider while she taught casimer marching to and fro on the wide low wall below which lay the lake while he learned his lesson then standing before her to recite or lounging on the turf in frequent fits of idleness both talking and laughing a great deal and generally forgetting everything but the pleasure of being together they wrote little notes as exercisesamy in french casimer in english and each corrected the others  all very well for a time but as the notes increased the corrections decreased and at last nothing was said of ungrammatical french or comical english and the little notes were exchanged in silence  as amy took her place that day she looked forlorn and when her pupil came her only welcome was a reproachful  you are very late sir  it is fifteen of minutes yet to ten clocks was casimers reply in his best english  ten oclock and leave out of before minutes how many times must i tell you that said amy severely to cover her first mistake  ah not many times soon all goes to finish and i have none person to make this charming english go in my so stupide head  what will you do then  i jeter myself into the lake  dont be foolish im dull today and want to be cheered up suicide isnt a pleasant subject  good see here thena little plaisanteriewhat you call joke can you will to see it and he laid a little pink cockedhat note on her lap looking like a mischievous boy as he did so  mon casimer teblinski i see no joke and amy was about to tear it up when he caught it from destruction and holding it out of reach said laughing wickedly  the mon is one abbreviation of monsieur but you put no littlehow do you sayperiod at the end of him it goes now in englishmy casimer teblinski and that is of the most charming address  amy colored but had her return shot ready  dont exult that was only an oversight not a deliberate deception like that you put upon me it was very wrong and rude and i shall not forgive it  mon dieu where have i gone in sinning i am a polisson as i say each day but not a villain i swear to you say to me that which i have made of wrong and i will do penance  you told me ma drogha was the polish for my pupil and let me call you so a long time i am wiser now replied amy with great dignity  who has said stupidities to you that you doubt me and casimer assumed an injured look though his eyes danced with merriment  i heard hoffman singing a polish song to little roserl the burden of which was ma drogha ma drogha and when i asked him to translate it those two words meant my darling how dare you ungrateful creature that you are  as amy spoke halfconfusedly halfangrily casimer went down upon his knees with folded hands and penitent face exclaiming in good english  be merciful to me a sinner i was tempted and i could not resist  get up this instant and stop laughing say your lesson for this will be your last was the stern reply though amys face dimpled all over with suppressed merriment  he rose meekly but made such sad work with the verb to love that his teacher was glad to put an end to it by proposing to read her french to him it was thaddeus of warsaw a musty little translation which she had found in the house and begun for her own amusement casimer read a little seemed interested and suggested that they read it together so that he might correct her accent amy agreed and they were in the heart of the sentimental romance finding it more interesting than most modern readers for the girl had an improved thaddeus before her and the pole a fairer kinder mary beaufort  dangerous times for both but therein lay the charm for though amy said to herself each night sick catholic and a foreignerit can never be yet each morning she felt with increasing force how blank her day would be without him and casimer honorably restraining every word of love yet looked volumes and in spite of the glasses the girl felt the eloquence of the fine eyes they could not entirely conceal  today as she read he listened with his head leaning on his hand and though she never had read worse he made no correction but sat so motionless she fancied at last that he had actually fallen asleep thinking to rouse him she said in french  poor thaddeus dont you pity himalone poor sick and afraid to own his love  no i hate him the absurd imbecile with his fine boots and plumes and tragedy airs he was not to be pitied for he recovered health he found a fortune he won his marie his sufferings were nothing there was no fatal blight on him and he had time and power to conquer his misfortunes while i  casimer spoke with sudden passion and pausing abruptly turned his face away as if to hide some emotion he was too proud to show  amys heart ached and her eyes filled but her voice was sweet and steady as she said putting by the book like one weary of it  are you suffering today can we do anything for you please let us if we may  you give me all i can receive no one can help my pain yet but a time will come when something may be done for me then i will speak and to her great surprise he rose and left her without another word  she saw him no more till evening then he looked excited played stormily and would sing in defiance of danger the trouble in amys face seemed reflected in helens though not a word had passed between them she kept her eye on casimer with an intentness that worried amy and even when he was at the instrument helen stood near him as if fascinated watching the slender hands chase one another up and down the keys with untiring strength and skill  suddenly she left the room and did not return amy was so nervous by that time she could restrain herself no longer and slipping out found her cousin in their chamber poring over a glove  oh nell what is it you are so odd tonight i cant understand you the music excites me and im miserable and i want to know what has happened she said tearfully  ive found him whispered helen eagerly holding up the glove with a gesture of triumph  who asked amy blinded by her tears  the baron  wherewhen cried the girl amazed  here and now  dont take my breath away tell me quick or i shall get hysterical  casimer is sigismund palsdorf and no more a pole than i am was helens answer  amy dropped in a heap on the floor not fainting but so amazed she had neither strength nor breath left sitting by her helen rapidly went on  i had a feeling as if something was wrong and began to watch the feeling grew but i discovered nothing till today it will make you laugh it was so unromantic as i looked over uncles things when the laundress brought them this afternoon i found a collar that was not his it was marked sp and i at once felt a great desire to know who owned it the woman was waiting for her money and i asked her monsieur pologne she said for his name is too much for her she took it into his room and that was the end of it  but it may be another name the initials only a coincidence faltered amy looking frightened  no dear it isnt there is more to come little roserl came crying through the hall an hour ago and i asked what the trouble was she showed me a prettilybound prayerbook which she had taken from the poles room to play with and had been ordered by her mother to carry back i looked into it no name but the same coatofarms as the glove and the handkerchief tonight as he played i examined his hands they are peculiar and some of the peculiarities have left traces on the glove i am sure it is he for on looking back many things confirm the idea he says he is a polisson a rogue fond of jokes and clever at playing them the germans are famous for masquerading and practical jokes this is one i am sure and uncle will be terribly angry if he discovers it  but why all this concealment cried amy why play jokes on us you look so worried i know you have not told me all you know or fear  i confess i do fear that these men are political plotters as well as exiles there are many such and they make tools of rich and ignorant foreigners to further their ends uncle is rich generous and unsuspicious and i fear that while apparently serving and enjoying us they are using him  heavens it may be and that would account for the change we see in him i thought he was in love with the widow but that may be only a cloak to hide darker designs karl brought us here and i dare say it is a den of conspirators cried amy feeling as if she were getting more of an adventure than she had bargained for  dont be alarmed i am on the watch and mean to demand an explanation from uncle or take you away on my own responsibility if i can  here a maid tapped to say that tea was served  we must go down or some one will suspect trouble plead headache to excuse your paleness and ill keep people away we will manage the affair and be off as soon as possible said helen as amy followed her too bewildered to answer  casimer was not in the room the major and mrs cumberland were sipping tea side by side and the professors roaming vaguely about to leave amy in peace helen engaged them both in a lively chat and her cousin sat by the window trying to collect her thoughts some one was pacing up and down the garden hatless in the dew  amy forgot everything but the danger of such exposure to her reckless friend his cloak and hat lay on a chair she caught them up and glided unperceived from the long window  you are so imprudent i fear for you and bring your things said a timid voice as the little white figure approached the tall black one striding down the path tempestuously  you to think of me forgetful of yourself little angel of kindness why do you take such care of me cried casimer eagerly taking not only the cloak but the hands that held it  i pitied you because you were ill and lonely you do not deserve my pity but i forgive that and would not see you suffer was the reproachful answer as amy turned away  but he held her fast saying earnestly  what have i done you are angry tell me my fault and i will amend  you have deceived me  how  will you own the truth and in her eagerness to set her fears at rest amy forgot helen  i will  she could not see his face but his voice was steady and his manner earnest  tell me then is not your true name sigismund palsdorf  he started but answered instantly  it is not  you are not the baron cried amy  no i will swear it if you wish  who then are you  shall i confess  yes i entreat you  remember you command me to speak  i do who are you  your lover  the words were breathed into her ear as softly as ardently but they startled her so much she could find no reply and throwing himself down before her casimer poured out his passion with an impetuosity that held her breathless  yes i love you and i tell it vain and dishonorable as it is in one like me i try to hide it i say it cannot be i plan to go away but you keep me you are angelgood to me you take my heart you care for me teach me pity me and i can only love and die i know it is folly i ask nothing i pray to god to bless you always and i say go go before it is too late for you as now for me  yes i must goit is all wrong forgive me i have been very selfish oh forget me and be happy faltered amy feeling that her only safety was in flight  go go he cried in a heartbroken tone yet still kissed and clung to her hands till she tore them away and fled into the house  helen missed her soon after she went but could not follow for several minutes then went to their chamber and there found amy drowned in tears and terribly agitated  soon the story was told with sobs and moans and despairing lamentations fit to touch a heart of stone  i do love himoh i do but i didnt know it till he was so unhappy and now ive done this dreadful harm hell die and i cant help him see him or be anything to him oh ive been a wicked wicked girl and never can be happy any more  angry perplexed and consciencestricken for what now seemed blind and unwise submission to the major helen devoted herself to calming amy and when at last the poor brokenhearted little soul fell asleep in her arms she pondered half the night upon the still unsolved enigma of the baron sigismund   viii  more mystery   uncle can i speak to you a moment said helen very gravely as they left the breakfastroom next morning  not now my dear im busy was the hasty reply as the major shawled mrs cumberland for an early promenade  helen knit her brows irefully for this answer had been given her half a dozen times lately when she asked for an interview it was evident he wished to avoid all lectures remonstrances and explanations and it was also evident that he was in love with the widow  lovers are worse than lunatics to manage so it is vain to try to get any help from him sighed helen adding as her uncle was gallantly leading his stout divinity away into the garden amy has a bad headache and i shall stay to take care of her so we cant join your party to chillon sir we have been there once so you neednt postpone it for us  very well my dear and the major walked away looking much relieved  as helen was about to leave the salon casimer appeared a single glance at her face assured him that she knew all and instantly assuming a confiding persuasive air that was irresistible he said meekly  mademoiselle i do not deserve a word from you but it desolates me to know that i have grieved the little angel who is too dear to me for her sake pardon that i spoke my heart in spite of prudence and permit me to send her this  helen glanced from the flowers he held to his beseeching face and her own softened he looked so penitent and anxious she had not the heart to reproach him  i will forgive you and carry your gift to amy on one condition she said gravely  ah you are kind name then the condition i implore you and i will agree  tell me then on your honor as a gentleman are you not baron palsdorf  on my honor as a gentleman i swear to you i am not  are you in truth what you profess to be  i am in truth amys lover your devoted servant and a most unhappy man with but a little while to live believe this and pity me dearest mademoiselle hel√®ne  she did pity him her eyes betrayed that and her voice was very kind as she said  pardon my doubts i trust you now and wish with all my heart that it was possible to make you happy you know it is not therefore i am sure you will be wise and generous and spare amy further grief by avoiding her for the little time we stay promise me this casimer  i may see her if i am dumb do not deny me this i will not speak but i must look at my little and dear angel when she is near  he pleaded so ardently with lips and hands and eager eyes that helen could not deny him and when he had poured out his thanks she left him feeling very tender toward the unhappy young lover whose passion was so hopeless yet so warm  amy was at breakfast in her room sobbing and sipping moaning and munching for though her grief was great her appetite was good and she was in no mood to see anything comical in cracking eggshells while she bewailed her broken heart or in eating honey in the act of lamenting the bitterness of her fate  casimer would have become desperate had he seen her in the little blue wrapper with her bright hair loose on her shoulders and her pretty face wet with tears as she dropped her spoon to seize his flowersthree dewy roses one a bud one half and the other fully blown making a fragrant record and avowal of the love which she must renounce  oh my dear boy how can i give him up when he is so fond and i am all he has helen uncle must let me write or go to mamma she shall decide i cant and no one else has a right to part us sobbed amy over her roses  casimer will not marry dear he is too generous to ask such a sacrifice began helen but amy cried indignantly  it is no sacrifice im rich what do i care for his poverty  his religion hinted helen anxiously  it need not part us we can believe what we will he is good why mind whether he is catholic or protestant  but a pole amy so different in tastes habits character and beliefs it is a great risk to marry a foreigner races are so unlike  i dont care if he is a tartar a calmuck or any of the other wild tribes i love him he loves me and no one need object if i dont  but dear the great and sad objection still remainshis health he just said he had but a little while to live  amys angry eyes grew dim but she answered with soft earnestness  so much the more need of me to make that little while happy think how much he has suffered and done for others surely i may do something for him oh nell can i let him die alone and in exile when i have both heart and home to give him  helen could say no more she kissed and comforted the faithful little soul feeling all the while such sympathy and tenderness that she wondered at herself for with this interest in the love of another came a sad sense of loneliness as if she was denied the sweet experience that every woman longs to know  amy never could remain long under a cloud and seeing helens tears began to cheer both her cousin and herself  hoffman said he might live with care dont you remember and hoffman knows the case better than we let us ask him if casimer is worse you do it i cant without betraying myself  i will and helen felt grateful for any pretext to address a friendly word to karl who had looked sad of late and had been less with them since the major became absorbed in mrs cumberland  leaving amy to compose herself helen went away to find hoffman it was never difficult for he seemed to divine her wishes and appear uncalled the moment he was wanted hardly had she reached her favorite nook in the garden when he approached with letters and asked with respectful anxiety as she glanced at and threw them by with an impatient sigh  has mademoiselle any orders will the ladies drive sail or make a little expedition it is fine and mademoiselle looks as if the air would refresh her pardon that i make the suggestion  no hoffman i dont like the air of this place and intend to leave as soon as possible and helen knit her delicate dark brows with an expression of great determination switzerland is the refuge of political exiles and i hate plots and disguises i feel oppressed by some mystery and mean to solve or break away from it at once  she stopped abruptly longing to ask his help yet withheld by a sudden sense of shyness in approaching the subject though she had decided to speak to karl of the pole  can i serve you mademoiselle if so pray command me he said eagerly coming a step nearer  you can and i intend to ask your advice for there can be nothing amiss in doing so since you are a friend of casimers  i am both friend and confidant mademoiselle he answered as if anxious to let her understand that he knew all without the embarrassment of words she looked up quickly relieved yet troubled  he has told you then  everything mademoiselle pardon me if this afflicts you i am his only friend here and the poor lad sorely needed comfort  he did i am not annoyed i am glad for i know you will sustain him now i may speak freely and be equally frank please tell me if he is indeed fatally ill  it was thought so some months ago now i hope happiness cures many ills and since he has loved he has improved i always thought care would save him he is worth it  hoffman paused as if fearful of venturing too far but helen seemed to confide freely in him and said softly  ah if it were only wise to let him be happy it is so bitter to deny love  god knows it is  the exclamation broke from hoffman as if an irrepressible impulse wrung it from him  helen started and for a moment neither spoke she collected herself soonest and without turning said quietly  i have been troubled by a strong impression that casimer is not what he seems till he denied it on his honor i believed him to be baron palsdorf did he speak the truth when he said he was not  yes mademoiselle  then casimer teblinski is his real name  no answer  she turned sharply and added  for my cousins sake i must know the truth several curious coincidences make me strongly suspect that he is passing under an assumed name  not a word said hoffman but looked on the ground as motionless and expressionless as a statue  helen lost patience and in order to show how much she had discovered rapidly told the story of the gloves ring handkerchief prayerbook and collar omitting all hint of the girlish romance they had woven about these things  as she ended hoffman looked up with a curious expression in which confusion amusement admiration and annoyance seemed to contend  mademoiselle he said gravely i am about to prove to you that i feel honored by the confidence you place in me i cannot break my word but i will confess to you that casimer does not bear his own name  i knew it said helen with a flash of triumph in her eyes he is the baron and no pole you germans love masquerades and jokes this is one but i must spoil it before it is played out  pardon mademoiselle is keen but in this she is mistaken casimer is not the baron he did fight for poland and his name is known and honored there of this i solemnly assure you  she stood up and looked him straight in the face he met her eye to eye and never wavered till her own fell  she mused a few minutes entirely forgetful of herself in her eagerness to solve the mystery  hoffman stood so near that her dress touched him and the wind blew her scarf against his hand and as she thought he watched her while his eyes kindled his color rose and once he opened his lips to speak but she moved at the instant and exclaimed  i have it  now for it he muttered as if preparing for some new surprise or attack  when uncle used to talk about the polish revolution there was i remember a gallant young pole who did something brave the name just flashed on me and it clears up my doubts stanislas prakoraspand casimer is the man  helen spoke with an eager bright face as if sure of the truth now but to her surprise hoffman laughed a short irrepressible laugh full of hearty but brief merriment he sobered in a breath and with an entire change of countenance said in an embarrassed tone  pardon my rudeness mademoiselles acuteness threw me off my guard i can say nothing till released from my promise but mademoiselle may rest assured that casimer teblinski is as good and brave a man as stanislas prakora  helens eyes sparkled for in this reluctant reply she read confirmation of her suspicion and thought that amy would rejoice to learn that her lover was a hero  you are exiles but still hope and plot and never relinquish your hearts desire  never mademoiselle  you are in danger  in daily peril of losing all we most love and long for answered karl with such passion that helen found patriotism a lovely and inspiring thing  you have enemies she asked unable to control her interest and feeling the charm of these confidences  alas yes was the mournful reply as karl dropped his eyes to hide the curious expression of mirth which he could not banish from them  can you not conquer them or escape the danger they place you in  we hope to conquer we cannot escape  this accounts for your disguise and casimers false name  yes we beg that mademoiselle will pardon us the anxiety and perplexity we have caused her and hope that a time will soon arrive when we may be ourselves i fear the romantic interest with which the ladies have honored us will be much lessened but we shall still remain their most humble and devoted servants  something in his tone nettled helen and she said sharply  all this may be amusing to you but it spoils my confidence in others to know they wear masks is your name also false  i am karl hoffman as surely as the sun shines mademoiselle do not wound me by a doubt he said eagerly  and nothing more  she smiled as she spoke and glanced at his darkened skin with a shake of the head  i dare not answer that  no matter i hate titles and value people for their own worth not for their rank  helen spoke impulsively and as if carried away by her words and manner hoffman caught her hand and pressed his lips to it ardently dropped it and was gone as if fearing to trust himself a moment longer  helen stood where he left her thinking with a shy glance from her hand to the spot where he had stood  it is pleasant to have ones hand kissed as amy said poor karl his fate is almost as hard as casimers  some subtile power seemed to make the four young people shun one another carefully though all longed to be together the major appeared to share the secret disquiet that made the rest roam listlessly about till little roserl came to invite them to a f√™te in honor of the vintage all were glad to go hoping in the novelty and excitement to recover their composure  the vineyard sloped up from the chateau and on the hillside was a small plateau of level sward shadowed by a venerable oak now hung with garlands while underneath danced the chateau servants with their families to the music of a pipe played by little friedel as the gentlefolk approached the revel stopped but the major who was in an antic mood and disposed to be gracious bade friedel play on and as mrs cumberland refused his hand with a glance at her weeds the major turned to the counts buxom housekeeper and besought her to waltz with him she assented and away they went as nimbly as the best amy laughed but stopped to blush as casimer came up with an imploring glance and whispered  is it possible that i may enjoy one divine waltz with you before i go  amy gave him her hand with a glad assent and helen was left alone every one was dancing but herself and hoffman who stood near by apparently unconscious of the fact he glanced covertly at her and saw that she was beating time with foot and hand that her eyes shone her lips smiled he seemed to take courage at this for walking straight up to her he said as coolly as if a crownprince  mademoiselle may i have the honor  a flash of surprise passed over her face but there was no anger pride or hesitation in her manner as she leaned toward him with a quiet thanks monsieur  a look of triumph was in his eyes as he swept her away to dance as she had never danced before for a german waltz is full of life and spirit wonderfully captivating to english girls and german gentlemen make it a memorable experience when they please as they circled round the rustic ballroom hoffman never took his eyes off helens and as if fascinated she looked up at him half conscious that he was reading her heart as she read his he said not a word but his face grew very tender very beautiful in her sight as she forgot everything except that he had saved her life and she loved him when they paused she was breathless and pale he also and seating her he went away to bring her a glass of wine as her dizzy eyes grew clear she saw a little case at her feet and taking it up opened it a worn paper containing some faded forgetmenots and these words fell out  gathered where helen sat on the night of august 10th  there was just time to restore its contents to the case when hoffman returned saw it and looked intensely annoyed as he asked quickly  did you read the name on it  i saw only the flowers and helen colored beautifully as she spoke  and read them he asked with a look she could not meet  she was spared an answer for just then a lad came up saying as he offered a note  monsieur hoffman madame at the hotel sends you this and begs you to come at once  as he impatiently opened it the wind blew the paper into helens lap she restored it and in the act her quick eye caught the signature thine ever ludmilla  a slight shadow passed over her face leaving it very cold and quiet hoffman saw the change and smiled as if well pleased but assuming suddenly his usual manner said deferentially  will mademoiselle permit me to visit my friend for an hourshe is expecting me  go then we do not need you was the brief reply in a careless tone as if his absence was a thing of no interest to any one  thanks i shall not be long away and giving her a glance that made her turn scarlet with anger at its undisguised admiration he walked away humming gayly to himself goethes lines    maidens heart and citys wall   were made to yield were made to fall   when weve held them each their day   soldierlike we march away   ix  sp and the baron   dinner was over and the salon deserted by all but the two young ladies who sat apart apparently absorbed in novels while each was privately longing for somebody to come and with the charming inconsistency of the fair sex planning to fly if certain somebodies did appear  steps approached both buried themselves in their books both held their breath and felt their hearts flutter as they never had done before at the step of mortal man the door opened neither looked up yet each was conscious of mingled disappointment and relief when the major said in a grave tone girls ive something to tell you  we know what it is sir returned helen coolly  i beg your pardon but you dont my dear as i will prove in five minutes if you will give me your attention  the major looked as if braced up to some momentous undertaking and planting himself before the two young ladies dashed bravely into the subject  girls ive played a bold game but ive won it and will take the consequences  they will fall heaviest on you uncle said helen thinking he was about to declare his love for the widow  the major laughed shrugged his shoulders and answered stoutly  ill bear them but you are quite wrong my dear in your surmises as you will soon see helen is my ward and accountable to me alone amys mother gave her into my charge and wont reproach me for anything that has passed when i explain matters as to the lads they must take care of themselves  suddenly both girls colored fluttered and became intensely interested the majors eyes twinkled as he assumed a perfectly impassive expression and rapidly delivered himself of the following thunderbolt  girls you have been deceived and the young men you love are impostors  i thought so muttered helen grimly  oh uncle dont dont say that cried amy despairingly  its true my dears and the worst of it is i knew the truth all the time now dont have hysterics but listen and enjoy the joke as i do at coblentz when you sat in the balcony two young men overheard amy sigh for adventures and helen advise making a romance out of the gloves one of the lads had dropped they had seen you by day both admired you and being idle gay young fellows they resolved to devote their vacation to gratifying your wishes and enjoying themselves we met at the fortress i knew one of them and liked the other immensely so when they confided their scheme to me i agreed to help them carry it out as i had perfect confidence in both and thought a little adventure or two would do you good  uncle you were mad said helen and amy added tragically  you dont know what trouble has come of it  perhaps i was that remains to be proved i do know everything and fail to see any trouble so dont cry little girl briskly replied the inexplicable major well we had a merry time planning our prank one of the lads insisted on playing courier though i objected hed done it before liked the part and would have his way the other couldnt decide being younger and more in love so we left him to come into the comedy when he was ready karl did capitally as you will allow and i am much attached to him for in all respects he has been true to his word he began at coblentz the other after doing the mysterious at heidelberg appeared as an exile and made quick work with the prejudices of my wellbeloved nieceshey amy  go on who are they cried both girls breathlessly  wait a bit im not bound to expose the poor fellows to your scorn and anger no if you are going to be high and haughty to forget their love refuse to forgive their frolic and rend their hearts with reproaches better let them remain unknown  no no we will forget and forgive only speak was the command of both  you promise to be lenient and mild to let them confess their motives and to award a gentle penance for their sins  yes we promise  then come in my lads and plead for your lives  as he spoke the major threw open the door and two gentlemen entered the roomone slight and dark with brilliant black eyes the other tall and large with blond hair and beard angry bewildered and shamestricken as they were feminine curiosity overpowered all other feelings for the moment and the girls sat looking at the culprits with eager eyes full of instant recognition for though the disguise was off and neither had seen them in their true characters but once they felt no doubt and involuntarily exclaimed  karl  casimer  no young ladies the courier and exile are defunct and from their ashes rise baron sigismund palsdorf my friend and sidney power my nephew i give you one hour to settle the matter then i shall return to bestow my blessing or to banish these scapegraces forever  and having fired his last shot the major prudently retreated without waiting to see its effect  it was tremendous for it carried confusion into the fair enemys camp and gave the besiegers a momentary advantage of which they were not slow to avail themselves  for a moment the four remained mute and motionless then amy like all timid things took refuge in flight and sidney followed her into the garden glad to see the allies separated helen with the courage of her nature tried to face and repulse the foe but love was stronger than pride maiden shame overcame anger and finding it vain to meet and bear down the steady tender glance of the blue eyes fixed upon her she dropped her head into her hands and sat before him like one conquered but too proud to cry quarter her lover watched her till she hid her face then drew near knelt down before her and said with an undertone of deep feeling below the mirthful malice of his words  mademoiselle pardon me that i am a foolish baron and dare to offer you the title that you hate i have served you faithfully for a month and presumptuous as it is i ask to be allowed to serve you all my life helen say you forgive the deceit for loves sake  no you are false and forsworn how can i believe that anything is true  and helen drew away the hand of which he had taken possession  hearts dearest you trusted me in spite of my disguise trust me still and i will prove that i am neither false nor forsworn catechise me and see if i was not true in spite of all my seeming deception  you said your name was karl hoffman began helen glad to gain a little time to calm herself before the momentous question came  it is i have many and my family choose to call me sigismund was the laughing answer  ill never call you so you shall be karl the courier all your life to me cried helen still unable to meet the ardent eyes before her  good i like that well for it assures me that all my life i shall be something to you my heart what next  when i asked if you were the baron you denied it  pardon i simply said my name was hoffman you did not ask me point blank if i was the baron had you done so i think i should have confessed all for it was very hard to restrain myself this morning  no not yet i have more questions and helen warned him away as it became evident that he no longer considered restraint necessary  who is ludmilla she said sharply  my faith that is superb exclaimed the baron with a triumphant smile at her betrayal of jealousy how if she is a former love he asked with a sly look at her changing face  it would cause me no surprise i am prepared for anything  how if she is my dearest sister for whom i sent that she might welcome you and bring the greetings of my parents to their new daughter  is it indeed so  and helens eyes dimmed as the thought of parents home and love filled her heart with tenderest gratitude for she had long been an orphan  leibchen it is true tomorrow you shall see how dear you already are to them for i write often and they wait eagerly to receive you  helen felt herself going very fast and made an effort to harden her heart lest too easy victory should reward this audacious lover  i may not go i also have friends and in england we are not won in this wild way i will yet prove you false it will console me for being so duped if i can call you traitor you said casimer had fought in poland  crudest of women he did but under his own name sidney power  then he was not the brave stanislasand there is no charming casimer  yes there are bothhis and my friends in paris true poles and when we go there you shall see them  but his illness was a ruse  no he was wounded in the war and has been ill since not of a fatal malady i own his cough misled you and he has no scruples in fabling to any extent i am not to bear the burden of his sins  then the romances he told us about your charity your virtues andyour love of liberty were false said helen with a keen glance for these tales had done much to interest her in the unknown baron  sudden color rose to his forehead and for the first time his eyes fell before hersnot in shame but with a modest mans annoyance at hearing himself praised  sidney is enthusiastic in his friendship and speaks too well for me the facts are true but he doubtless glorified the simplest by his way of telling it will you forgive my follies and believe me when i promise to play and duel no more  yes  she yielded her hand now and her eyes were full of happiness yet she added wistfully  and the betrothed your cousin minnais she in truth not dear to you  very dear but less so than another for i could not learn of her in years what i learned in a day when i met you helen this was begun in jestit ends in solemn earnest for i love my liberty and i have lost it utterly and forever yet i am glad look in my face and tell me you believe it  he spoke now as seriously as fervently and with no shadow on her own helen brushed back the blond hair and looked into her lovers face truth tenderness power and candor were written there in characters that could not lie and with her heart upon her lips she answered as he drew her close  i do believe do love you sigismund meanwhile another scene was passing in the garden sidney presuming upon his cousinship took possession of amy bidding her strike but hear him of course she listened with the usual accompaniment of tears and smiles reproaches and exclamations varied by cruel exultations and coquettish commands to go away and never dare approach her again  ma drogha listen and be appeased years ago you and i played together as babies and our fond mammas vowed we should one day mate when i was a youth of fourteen and you a mite of seven i went away to india with my father and at our parting promised to come back and marry you being in a fret because you couldnt go also you haughtily declined the honor and when i offered a farewell kiss struck me with this very little hand do you remember it  not i too young for such nonsense  i do and i also remember that in my boyish way i resolved to keep my word sooner or later and ive done it  we shall see sir cried amy strongly tempted to repeat her part of the childish scene as well as her cousin but her hand was not free and he got the kiss without the blow  for eleven years we never met you forgot me and cousin sidney remained an empty name i was in india till four years ago since then ive been flying about germany and fighting in poland where i nearly got my quietus  my dear boy were you wounded  bless you yes and very proud of it i am ill show you my scars some day but never mind that now a while ago i went to england seized with a sudden desire to find my wife  i admire your patience in waiting so flattering to me you know was the sharp answer  it looks like neglect i confess but id heard reports of your flirtations and twice of your being engaged so i kept away till my work was done was it true  i never flirt sidney and i was only engaged a little bit once or twice i didnt like it and never mean to do so any more  i shall see that you dont flirt but you are very much engaged now so put on your ring and make no romances about any sp but myself  i shall wait till you clear your character im not going to care for a deceitful impostor what made you think of this prank  you did  i how  when in england i saw your picture though you were many a mile away and fell in love with it your mother told me much about you and i saw she would not frown upon my suit i begged her not to tell you i had come but let me find you and make myself known when i liked you were in switzerland and i went after you at coblentz i met sigismund and told him my case he is full of romance and when we overheard you in the balcony we were glad of the hint sigismund was with me when you came and admired helen immensely so he was wild to have a part in the frolic i let him begin and followed you unseen to heidelberg meaning to personate an artist meeting you at the castle i made a good beginning with the vaults and the ring and meant to follow it up by acting the baron you were so bent on finding him but sigismund forbade it turning over a trunk of things left there the year before i came upon my old polish uniform and decided to be a thaddeus  how well you did it wasnt it hard to act all the time asked amy wonderingly  very hard with helen she is so keen but not a bit so with you for you are such a confiding soul any one could cheat you ive betrayed myself a dozen times and you never saw it ah it was capital fun to play the forlorn exile study english and flirt with my cousin  it was very base i should think youd be devoured with remorse arent you sorry  for one thing i cropped my head lest you should know me i was proud of my curls but i sacrificed them all to you  peacock did you think that one glimpse of your black eyes and fine hair would make such an impression that i should recognize you again  i did and for that reason disfigured my head put on a mustache and assumed hideous spectacles did you never suspect my disguise amy  no helen used to say that she felt something was wrong but i never did till the other night  didnt i do that well i give you my word it was all done on the spur of the minute i meant to speak soon but had not decided how when you came out so sweetly with that confounded old cloak of which id no more need than an african has of a blanket then a scene id read in a novel came into my head and i just repeated it con amore was i very pathetic and tragical amy  i thought so then it strikes me as ridiculous now and i cant help feeling sorry that i wasted so much pity on a man who  loves you with all his heart and soul did you cry and grieve over me dear little tender thing and do you think now that i am a heartless fellow bent only on amusing myself at the expense of others its not so and you shall see how true and good and steady i can be when i have any one to love and care for me ive been alone so long its new and beautiful to be petted confided in and looked up to by an angel like you  he was in earnest now she felt it and her anger melted away like dew before the sun  poor boy you will go home with us now and let us take care of you in quiet england youll play no more pranks but go soberly to work and do something that shall make me proud to be your cousin wont you  if youll change cousin to wife ill be and do whatever you please amy when i was a poor dying catholic foreigner you loved me and would have married me in spite of everything now that im your well rich protestant cousin who adores you as that pole never could you turn cold and cruel is it because the romance is gone or because your love was only a girls fancy after all  you deceived me and i cant forget it but ill try was the soft answer to his reproaches  are you disappointed that im not a baron  a little bit  shall i be a count they gave me a title in poland a barren honor but all they had to offer poor souls in return for a little blood will you be countess zytomar and get laughed at for your pains or plain mrs power with a good old english name  neither thank you its only a girlish fancy which will soon be forgotten does the baron love helen asked amy abruptly  desperately and she  i think he will be happy she is not one to make confidantes but i know by her tenderness with me her sadness lately and something in her way of brightening when he comes that she thinks much of him and loves karl hoffman how it will be with the baron i cannot say  no fear of him he wins his way everywhere i wish i were as fortunate and the gay young gentleman heaved an artful sigh and coughed the cough that always brought such pity to the girls soft eyes  she glanced at him as he leaned pensively on the low wall looking down into the lake with the level rays of sunshine on his comely face and figure something softer than pity stole into her eye as she said anxiously  you are not really ill sidney  i have been and still need care else i may have a relapse was the reply of this treacherous youth whose constitution was as sound as a bell  amy clasped her hands as if in a transport of gratitude exclaiming fervently  what a relief it is to know that you are not doomed to  she paused with a shiver as if the word were too hard to utter and sidney turned to her with a beaming face which changed to one of mingled pain and anger as she added with a wicked glance  wear spectacles  amy youve got no heart he cried in a tone that banished her last doubt of his love and made her whisper tenderly as she clung to his arm  no dear ive given it all to you  punctual to the minute major erskine marched into the salon with mrs cumberland on his arm exclaiming as he eyed the four young people together again  now ladies is it to be paradise lost or regained for the prisoners at the bar  at this point the astonished gentleman found himself taken possession of by four excited individuals for the girls embraced and kissed him the young men wrung his hand and thanked him and all seemed bent on assuring him that they were intensely happy grateful and affectionate  from this assault he emerged flushed and breathless but beaming with satisfaction and saying paternally  bless you my children bless you i hoped and worked for this and to prove how well i practise what i preach let me present to youmy wife  as he drew forward the plump widow with a face full of smiles and tears a second rush was made and congratulations salutes exclamations and embraces were indulged in to every ones satisfaction  as the excitement subsided the major said simply  we were married yesterday at montreaux let me hope that you will prove as faithful as i have been as happy as i am as blest as i shall be i loved this lady in my youth have waited many years and am rewarded at last for love never comes too late  the falter in his cheery voice the dimness of his eyes the smile on his lips and the gesture with which he returned the pressure of the hand upon his arm told the little romance of the good majors life more eloquently than pages of fine writing and touched the hearts of those who loved him  i have been faithful for eleven years give me my reward soon wont you dear whispered sidney  dont marry me tomorrow and if mamma is willing ill think about it by and by answered amy  it is beautiful let us go and do likewise said sigismund to his betrothed  but helen anxious to turn the thoughts of all from emotions too deep for words drew from her pocket a small pearlcolored object which she gave to amy with mock solemnity as she said turning to lay her hand again in her lovers  amy our search is over you may keep the gloves i have the baron     my red cap  he who serves well need not fear to ask his wages   i   it was under a blue cap that i first saw the honest face of joe collins in the third year of the late war a maine regiment was passing through boston on its way to washington the common was all alive with troops and the spectators who clustered round them to say godspeed as the brave fellows marched away to meet danger and death for our sakes  every one was eager to do something and as the men stood at ease the people mingled freely with them offering gifts hearty grips of the hand and hopeful prophecies of victory in the end irresistibly attracted my boy tom and i drew near and soon becoming excited by the scene ravaged the fruitstands in our neighborhood for tokens of our regard mingling candy and congratulations peanuts and prayers apples and applause in one enthusiastic jumble  while tom was off on his third raid my attention was attracted by a man who stood a little apart looking as if his thoughts were far away all the men were fine stalwart fellows as maine men usually are but this one overtopped his comrades standing straight and tall as a norway pine with a face full of the mingled shrewdness sobriety and selfpossession of the typical new englander i liked the look of him and seeing that he seemed solitary even in a crowd i offered him my last apple with a word of interest the keen blue eyes met mine gratefully and the apple began to vanish in vigorous bites as we talked for no one thought of ceremony at such a time  where are you from  woolidge maam  are you glad to go  wal theres two sides to that question i calklate to do my duty and do it hearty but it is rough on a feller leavin his folks for good maybe  there was a sudden huskiness in the mans voice that was not appleskins though he tried to make believe that it was i knew a word about home would comfort him so i went on with my questions  it is very hard do you leave a family  my old mother a sick brotherand lucindy  the last word was uttered in a tone of intense regret and his brown cheek reddened as he added hastily to hide some embarrassment  you see jim went last year and got pretty well used up so i felt as if id ought to take my turn now mother was a regular old hero about it and i dropped everything and come off lucindy didnt think it was my duty and that made it awful hard i tell you  wives are less patriotic than mothers i began but he would not hear lucindy blamed and said quickly  she aint my wife yet but we calklated to be married in a month or so and it was wus for her than for me women lot so on not being disappointed i couldnt shirk and here i be when i git to work i shall be all right the first wrench is the tryin part  here he straightened his broad shoulders and turned his face toward the flags fluttering far in front as if no backward look should betray the longing of his heart for mother home and wife i liked that little glimpse of character and when tom returned with empty hands reporting that every stall was exhausted i told him to find out what the man would like best then run across the street and get it  i know without asking give us your purse and ill make him as happy as a king said the boy laughing as he looked up admiringly at our tall friend who looked down on him with an elderbrotherly air pleasant to see while tom was gone i found out joes name and business promised to write and tell his mother how finely the regiment went off and was just expressing a hope that we might meet again for i too was going to the war as nurse when the order to fall in came rolling down the ranks and the talk was over fearing tom would miss our man in the confusion i kept my eye on him till the boy came rushing up with a packet of tobacco in one hand and a good supply of cigars in the other not a romantic offering certainly but a very acceptable one as joes face proved as we scrambled these treasures into his pockets all laughing at the flurry while less fortunate comrades helped us with an eye to a share of these fragrant luxuries by and by there was just time for this a hearty shake of the big hand and a grateful goodby maam then the word was given and they were off bent on seeing the last of them tom and i took a short cut and came out on the wide street down which so many troops marched that year and mounting some high steps we watched for our man as we already called him  as the inspiring music the grand tramp drew near the old thrill went through the crowd the old cheer broke out but it was a different scene now than in the first enthusiastic hopeful days young men and ardent boys filled the ranks then brave by instinct burning with loyal zeal and blissfully unconscious of all that lay before them now the blue coats were worn by mature men some gray all grave and resolute husbands and fathers with the memory of wives and children tugging at their heartstrings homes left desolate behind them and before them the grim certainty of danger hardship and perhaps the lifelong helplessness worse than death little of the glamour of romance about the war now they saw it as it was a long hard task and here were the men to do it well even the lookerson were different now once all was wild enthusiasm and glad uproar now mens lips were set and womens smileless as they cheered fewer handkerchiefs whitened the air for wet eyes needed them and sudden lulls almost solemn in their stillness followed the acclamations of the crowd all watched with quickened breath and brave souls that living wave blue below and bright with a steely glitter above as it flowed down the street and away to distant battlefields already stained with precious blood  there he is the outside man and tallest of the lot give him a cheer auntie he sees us and remembers cried tom nearly tumbling off his perch as he waved his hat and pointed out joe collins  yes there he was looking up with a smile on his brave brown face my little nosegay in his buttonhole a suspicious bulge in the pocket close by and doubtless a comfortable quid in his mouth to cheer the weary march how like an old friend he looked though we had only met fifteen minutes ago how glad we were to be there to smile back at him and send him on his way feeling that even in a strange city there was some one to say god bless you joe we watched the tallest blue cap till it vanished and then went home in a glow of patriotismtom to long for his turn to come i to sew vigorously on the gray gown the new nurse burned to wear as soon as possible and both of us to think and speak often of poor joe collins and his lucindy all this happened long ago but it is well to recall those stirring timesto keep fresh the memory of sacrifices made for us by men like these to see to it that the debt we owe them is honestly gladly paid and while we decorate the graves of those who died to remember also those who still live to deserve our grateful care   ii   i never expected to see joe again but six months later we did meet in a washington hospital one winters night a train of ambulances had left their sad freight at our door and we were hurrying to get the poor fellows into much needed beds after a week of hunger cold and unavoidable neglect all forms of pain were in my ward that night and all borne with the pathetic patience which was a daily marvel to those who saw it  trying to bring order out of chaos i was rushing up and down the narrow aisle between the rows of rapidly filling beds and after brushing several times against a pair of the largest and muddiest boots i ever saw i paused at last to inquire why they were impeding the passageway i found they belonged to a very tall man who seemed to be already asleep or dead so white and still and utterly worn out he looked as he lay there without a coat a great patch on his forehead and the right arm rudely bundled up stooping to cover him i saw that he was unconscious and whipping out my brandybottle and salts soon brought him round for it was only exhaustion  can you eat i asked as he said thanky maam after a long draught of water and a dizzy stare  eat im starvin he answered with such a ravenous glance at a fat nurse who happened to be passing that i trembled for her and hastened to take a bowl of soup from her tray  as i fed him his gaunt weatherbeaten face had a familiar look but so many such faces had passed before me that winter i did not recall this one till the wardmaster came to put up the cards with the newcomers names above their beds my man seemed absorbed in his food but i naturally glanced at the card and there was the name joseph collins to give me an additional interest in my new patient  why joe is it really you i exclaimed pouring the last spoonful of soup down his throat so hastily that i choked him  all thats left of me wal aint this luck now gasped joe as gratefully as if that hospitalcot was a bed of roses  what is the matter a wound in the head and arm i asked feeling sure that no slight affliction had brought joe there  right arm gone shot off as slick as a whistle i tell you its a singlar kind of a feelin to see a piece of your own body go flyin away with no prospect of ever coming back again said joe trying to make light of one of the greatest misfortunes a man can suffer  that is bad but it might have been worse keep up your spirits joe and we will soon have you fitted out with a new arm almost as good as new  i guess it wont do much lumberin so that trade is done for i spose theres things lefthanded fellers can do and i must learn em as soon as possible since my fightin days are over and joe looked at his one arm with a sigh that was almost a groan helplessness is such a trial to a manly manand he was eminently so  what can i do to comfort you most joe ill send my good ben to help you to bed and will be here myself when the surgeon goes his rounds is there anything else that would make you more easy  if you could just drop a line to mother to let her know im alive it would be a sight of comfort to both of us i guess im in for a long spell of hospital and id lay easier if i knew mother and lucindy warnt frettin about me  he must have been suffering terribly but he thought of the women who loved him before himself and busy as i was i snatched a moment to send a few words of hope to the old mother then i left him layin easy though the prospect of some months of wearing pain would have daunted most men if i had needed anything to increase my regard for joe it would have been the courage with which he bore a very bad quarter of an hour with the surgeons for his arm was in a dangerous state the wound in the head feverish for want of care and a heavy cold on the lungs suggested pneumonia as an added trial to his list of ills  he will have a hard time of it but i think he will pull through as he is a temperate fellow with a splendid constitution was the doctors verdict as he left us for the next man who was past help with a bullet through his lungs  i donno as i hanker to live and be a burden if jim was able to do for mother i feel as if i wouldnt mind steppin out now im so fur along as he aint i spose i must brace up and do the best i can said joe as i wiped the drops from his forehead and tried to look as if his prospect was a bright one  you will have lucindy to help you you know and that will make things easier for all  think so pears to me i couldnt ask her to take care of three invalids for my sake she aint no folks of her own nor much means and ought to marry a man who can make things easy for her guess ill have to wait a spell longer before i say anything to lucindy about marryin now and a look of resolute resignation settled on joes haggard face as he gave up his dearest hope  i think lucindy will have something to say if she is like most women and you will find the burdens much lighter for sharing them between you dont worry about that but get well and go home as soon as you can  all right maam and joe proved himself a good soldier by obeying orders and falling asleep like a tired child as the first step toward recovery  for two months i saw joe daily and learned to like him very much he was so honest genuine and kindhearted so did his mates for he made friends with them all by sharing such small luxuries as came to him for he was a favorite and better still he made sunshine in that sad place by the brave patience with which he bore his own troubles the cheerful consolation he always gave to others a droll fellow was joe at times for under his sobriety lay much humor and i soon discovered that a visit from him was more efficacious than other cordials in cases of despondency and discontent roars of laughter sometimes greeted me as i went into his ward and joes jokes were passed round as eagerly as the waterpitcher  yet he had much to try him not only in the ills that vexed his flesh but the cares that tried his spirit and the future that lay before him full of anxieties and responsibilities which seemed so heavy now when the strong right arm that had cleared all obstacles away before was gone the letters i wrote for him and those he received told the little story very plainly for he read them to me and found much comfort in talking over his affairs as most men do when illness makes them dependent on a woman jim was evidently sick and selfish lucindy to judge from the photograph cherished so tenderly under joes pillow was a pretty weak sort of a girl with little character or courage to help poor joe with his burdens the old mother was very like her son and stood by him like a hero as he said but was evidently failing and begged him to come home as soon as he was able that she might see him comfortably settled before she must leave him her courage sustained his and the longing to see her hastened his departure as soon as it was safe to let him go for lucindys letters were always of a dismal sort and made him anxious to put his shoulder to the wheel  she always set considerble by me mother did bein the oldest and i wouldnt miss makin her last days happy not if it cost me all the arms and legs ive got said joe as he awkwardly struggled into the big boots an hour after leave to go home was given him  it was pleasant to see his comrades gather round him with such hearty adieus that his one hand must have tingled to hear the good wishes and the thanks called after him by pale creatures in their beds and to find tears in many eyes beside my own when he was gone and nothing was left of him but the empty cot the old gray wrapper and the name upon the wall  i kept that card among my other relics and hoped to meet joe again somewhere in the world he sent me one or two letters then i went home the war ended soon after time passed and the little story of my maine lumberman was laid away with many other experiences which made that part of my life a very memorable one   iii   some years later as i looked out of my window one dull november day the only cheerful thing i saw was the red cap of a messenger who was examining the slate that hung on a wall opposite my hotel a tall man with gray hair and beard one arm and a blue armycoat i always salute figuratively at least when i see that familiar blue especially if one sleeve of the coat is empty so i watched the messenger with interest as he trudged away on some new errand wishing he had a better day and a thicker pair of boots he was an unusually large wellmade man and reminded me of a fine building going to ruin before its time for the broad shoulders were bent there was a stiffness about the long legs suggestive of wounds or rheumatism and the curly hair looked as if snow had fallen on it too soon sitting at work in my window i fell into the way of watching my red cap as i called him with more interest than i did the fat doves on the roof opposite or the pert sparrows hopping in the mud below i liked the steady way in which he plodded on through fair weather or foul as if intent on doing well the one small service he had found to do i liked his cheerful whistle as he stood waiting for a job under the porch of the public building where his slate hung watching the luxurious carriages roll by and the welltodo gentlemen who daily passed him to their comfortable homes with a steady patient sort of face as if wondering at the inequalities of fortune yet neither melancholy nor morose over the small share of prosperity which had fallen to his lot  i often planned to give him a job that i might see him nearer but i had few errands and little bob the hallboy depended on doing those so the winter was nearly over before i found out that my red cap was an old friend  a parcel came for me one day and bidding the man wait for an answer i sat down to write it while the messenger stood just inside the door like a sentinel on duty when i looked up to give my note and directions i found the man staring at me with a beaming yet bashful face as he nodded saying heartily  i mistrusted it was you maam soons i see the name on the bundle and i guess i aint wrong its a number of years sence we met and you dont remember joe collins as well as he does you i reckon  why how you have changed ive been seeing you every day all winter and never knew you i said shaking hands with my old patient and very glad to see him  nigh on to twenty years makes considable of a change in folks specially if they have a pretty hard row to hoe  sit down and warm yourself while you tell me all about it there is no hurry for this answer and ill pay for your time  joe laughed as if that was a good joke and sat down as if the fire was quite as welcome as the friend  how are they all at home i asked as he sat turning his cap round not quite knowing where to begin  i havent got any home nor any folks neither and the melancholy words banished the brightness from his rough face like a cloud mother died soon after i got back suddin but she was ready and i was there so she was happy jim lived a number of years and was a sight of care poor feller but we managed to rub along though we had to sell the farm for i couldnt do much with one arm and doctors bills right along stiddy take a heap of money he was as comfortable as he could be and when he was gone it wasnt no great matter for there was only me and i dont mind roughin it  but lucindy where was she i asked very naturally  oh she married another man long ago couldnt expect her to take me and my misfortins shes doin well i hear and thats a comfort anyway  there was a look on joes face a tone in joes voice as he spoke that plainly showed how much he had needed comfort when left to bear his misfortunes all alone but he made no complaint uttered no reproach and loyally excused lucindys desertion with a simple sort of dignity that made it impossible to express pity or condemnation  how came you here joe i asked making a sudden leap from past to present  i had to scratch for a livin and cant do much so after tryin a number of things i found this my old wounds pester me a good deal and rheumatism is bad winters but while my legs hold out i can git on a man cant set down and starve so i keep waggin as long as i can when i cant do no more i spose theres almshouse and hospital ready for me  that is a dismal prospect joe there ought to be a comfortable place for such as you to spend your last days in i am sure you have earned it  wal it does seem ruther hard on us when weve give all we had and give it free and hearty to be left to knock about in our old age but theres so many poor folks to be took care of we dont get much of a chance for we aint the beggin sort said joe with a wistful look at the wintry world outside as if it would be better to lie quiet under the snow than to drag out his last painful years friendless and forgotten in some refuge of the poor  some kind people have been talking of a home for soldiers and i hope the plan will be carried out it will take time but if it comes to pass you shall be one of the first men to enter that home joe if i can get you there  that sounds mighty cheerin and comfortable thanky maam idleness is dreadful tryin to me and id rather wear out than rust out so i guess i can weather it a spell longer but it will be pleasant to look forrard to a snug harbor bymeby i feel a sight better just hearin tell about it he certainly looked so faint as the hope was for the melancholy eyes brightened as if they already saw a happier refuge in the future than almshouse hospital or grave and when he trudged away upon my errand he went as briskly as if every step took him nearer to the promised home  after that day it was all up with bob for i told my neighbors joes story and we kept him trotting busily adding little gifts and taking the sort of interest in him that comforted the lonely fellow and made him feel that he had not outlived his usefulness i never looked out when he was at his post that he did not smile back at me i never passed him in the street that the red cap was not touched with a military flourish and when any of us beckoned to him no twinge of rheumatism was too sharp to keep him from hurrying to do our errands as if he had mercurys winged feet  now and then he came in for a chat and always asked how the soldiers home was prospering expressing his opinion that boston was the charitablest city under the sun and he was sure he and his mates would be took care of somehow  when we parted in the spring i told him things looked hopeful bade him be ready for a good long rest as soon as the hospitable doors were open and left him nodding cheerfully   iv   but in the autumn i looked in vain for joe the slate was in its old place and a messenger came and went on his beat but a strange face was under the red cap and this man had two arms and one eye i asked for collins but the newcomer had only a vague idea that he was dead and the same answer was given me at headquarters though none of the busy people seemed to know when or where he died so i mourned for joe and felt that it was very hard he could not have lived to enjoy the promised refuge for relying upon the charity that never fails the home was an actual fact now just beginning its beneficent career people were waking up to this duty money was coming in meetings were being held and already a few poor fellows were in the refuge feeling themselves no longer paupers but invalid soldiers honorably supported by the state they had served talking it over one day with a friend who spent her life working for the associated charities she said  by the way there is a man boarding with one of my poor women who ought to be got into the home if he will go i dont know much about him except that he was in the army has been very ill with rheumatic fever and is friendless i asked mrs flanagin how she managed to keep him and she said she had help while he was sick and now he is able to hobble about he takes care of the children so she is able to go out to work he wont go to his own town because there is nothing for him there but the almshouse and he dreads a hospital so struggles along trying to earn his bread tending babies with his one arm a sad case and in your line i wish youd look into it  that sounds like my joe one arm and all ill go and see him ive a weakness for soldiers sick or well  i went and never shall forget the pathetic little tableau i saw as i opened mrs flanagins dingy door for she was out and no one heard my tap the room was redolent of suds and in a grove of damp clothes hung on lines sat a man with a crying baby laid across his lap while he fed three small children standing at his knee with bread and molasses how he managed with one arm to keep the baby from squirming on to the floor the plate from upsetting and to feed the hungry urchins who stood in a row with open mouths like young birds was past my comprehension but he did trotting baby gently dealing out sweet morsels patiently and whistling to himself as if to beguile his labors cheerfully  the broad back the long legs the faded coat the low whistle were all familiar and dodging a wet sheet i faced the man to find it was indeed my joe a mere shadow of his former self after months of suffering that had crippled him for life but brave and patient still trying to help himself and not ask aid though brought so low  for an instant i could not speak to him and encumbered with baby dish spoon and children he could only stare at me with a sudden brightening of the altered face that made it full of welcome before a word was uttered  they told me you were dead and i only heard of you by accident not knowing i should find my old friend alive but not well im afraid  there aint much left of me but bones and pain maam im powerful glad to see you all the same dust off a chair patsey and let the lady set down you go in the corner and take turns lickin the dish while i see company said joe disbanding his small troop and shouldering the baby as if presenting arms in honor of his guest  why didnt you let me know how sick you were and how came they to think you dead i asked as he festooned the wet linen out of the way and prepared to enjoy himself as best he could  i did send once when things was at the wust but you hadnt got back and then somehow i thought i was goin to be mustered out for good and so wouldnt trouble nobody but my orders aint come yet and i am doing the fust thing that come along it aint much but the good soul stood by me and i aint ashamed to pay my debts this way sence i cant do it in no other and joe cradled the chubby baby in his one arm as tenderly as if it had been his own though little biddy was not an inviting infant  that is very beautiful and right joe and i honor you for it but you were not meant to tend babies so sing your last lullabies and be ready to go to the home as soon as i can get you there  really maam i used to lay and kind of dream about it when i couldnt stir without yellin out but i never thought it would ever come to happen i see a piece in the paper describing it and it sounded dreadful nice shouldnt wonder if i found some of my mates there they were a good lot and deservin of all that could be done for em said joe trotting the baby briskly as if the prospect excited him as well it might for the change from that damp nursery to the comfortable quarters prepared for him would be like going from purgatory to paradise  i dont wonder you dont get well living in such a place joe you should have gone home to woolwich and let your friends help you i said feeling provoked with him for hiding himself  no maam he answered with a look i never shall forget it was so full of mingled patience pride and pain i havent a relation in the world but a couple of poor old aunts and they couldnt do anything for me as for asking help of folks i used to know i couldnt do it and if you think id go to lucindy though she is wal off you dont know joe collins id die fust if she was poor and i rich id do for her like a brother but i couldnt ask no favors of her not if i begged my vittles in the street or starved i forgive but i dont forgit in a hurry and the woman that stood by me when i was down is the woman i believe in and can take my bread from without shame hooray for biddy flanagin god bless her and as if to find a vent for the emotion that filled his eyes with grateful tears joe led off the cheer which the children shrilly echoed and i joined heartily  i shall come for you in a few days so cuddle the baby and make much of the children before you part it wont take you long to pack up will it i asked as we subsided with a general laugh  i reckon not as i dont own any clothes but what i set in except a couple of old shirts and them socks my hats stoppin up the winder and my old coat is my bedcover im awful shabby maam and thats one reason i dont go out more i can hobble some but i aint got used to bein a scarecrow yet and joe glanced from the hose without heels that hung on the line to the ragged suit he wore with a resigned expression that made me long to rush out and buy up half the contents of oak hall on the spot  curbing this wild impulse i presently departed with promises of speedy transportation for joe and unlimited oranges to assuage the pangs of parting for the young flanagins who escorted me to the door while joe waved the baby like a triumphal banner till i got round the corner  there was such a beautiful absence of red tape about the new institution that it only needed a word in the right ear to set things going and then with a long pull a strong pull and a pull all together joe collins was taken up and safely landed in the home he so much needed and so well deserved  a happier man or a more grateful one it would be hard to find and if a visitor wants an enthusiastic guide about the place joe is the one to take for all is comfort sunshine and goodwill to him and he unconsciously shows how great the need of this refuge is as he hobbles about on his lame feet pointing out its beauties conveniences and delights with his one arm while his face shines and his voice quavers a little as he says gratefully  the state dont forget us you see and this is a home wuth havin long life to it     what the bells saw and said  written in 1867  bells ring others to church but go not in themselves   no one saw the spirits of the bells up there in the old steeple at midnight on christmas eve six quaint figures each wrapped in a shadowy cloak and wearing a bellshaped cap all were grayheaded for they were among the oldest bellspirits of the city and the light of other days shone in their thoughtful eyes silently they sat looking down on the snowcovered roofs glittering in the moonlight and the quiet streets deserted by all but the watchmen on their chilly rounds and such poor souls as wandered shelterless in the winter night presently one of the spirits said in a tone which low as it was filled the belfry with reverberating echoes  well brothers are your reports ready of the year that now lies dying  all bowed their heads and one of the oldest answered in a sonorous voice  my report isnt all i could wish you know i look down on the commercial part of our city and have fine opportunities for seeing what goes on there its my business to watch the business men and upon my word im heartily ashamed of them sometimes during the war they did nobly giving their time and money their sons and selves to the good cause and i was proud of them but now too many of them have fallen back into the old ways and their motto seems to be every one for himself and the devil take the hindmost cheating lying and stealing are hard words and i dont mean to apply them to all who swarm about below there like ants on an anthillthey have other names for these things but im oldfashioned and use plain words theres a deal too much dishonesty in the world and business seems to have become a game of hazard in which luck not labor wins the prize when i was young men were years making moderate fortunes and were satisfied with them they built them on sure foundations knew how to enjoy them while they lived and to leave a good name behind them when they died  now its anything for money health happiness honor life itself are flung down on that great gamingtable and they forget everything else in the excitement of success or the desperation of defeat nobody seems satisfied either for those who win have little time or taste to enjoy their prosperity and those who lose have little courage or patience to support them in adversity they dont even fail as they used to in my day when a merchant found himself embarrassed he didnt ruin others in order to save himself but honestly confessed the truth gave up everything and began again but nowadays after all manner of dishonorable shifts there comes a grand crash many suffer but by some hocuspocus the merchant saves enough to retire upon and live comfortably here or abroad its very evident that honor and honesty dont mean now what they used to mean in the days of old may higginson and lawrence  they preach below here and very well too sometimes for i often slide down the rope to peep and listen during service but bless you they dont seem to lay either sermon psalm or prayer to heart for while the minister is doing his best the congregation tired with the breathless hurry of the week sleep peacefully calculate their chances for the morrow or wonder which of their neighbors will lose or win in the great game dont tell me ive seen them do it and if i dared id have startled every soul of them with a rousing peal ah they dont dream whose eye is on them they never guess what secrets the telegraph wires tell as the messages fly by and little know what a report i give to the winds of heaven as i ring out above them morning noon and night and the old spirit shook his head till the tassel on his cap jangled like a little bell  there are some however whom i love and honor he said in a benignant tone who honestly earn their bread who deserve all the success that comes to them and always keep a warm corner in their noble hearts for those less blest than they these are the men who serve the city in times of peace save it in times of war deserve the highest honors in its gift and leave behind them a record that keeps their memories green for such an one we lately tolled a knell my brothers and as our united voices pealed over the city in all grateful hearts sweeter and more solemn than any chime rung the words that made him so beloved  treat our dead boys tenderly and send them home to me  he ceased and all the spirits reverently uncovered their gray heads as a strain of music floated up from the sleeping city and died among the stars  like yours my report is not satisfactory in all respects began the second spirit who wore a very pointed cap and a finely ornamented cloak but though his dress was fresh and youthful his face was old and he had nodded several times during his brothers speech my greatest affliction during the past year has been the terrible extravagance which prevails my post as you know is at the court end of the city and i see all the fashionable vices and follies it is a marvel to me how so many of these immortal creatures with such opportunities for usefulness selfimprovement and genuine happiness can be content to go round and round in one narrow circle of unprofitable and unsatisfactory pursuits i do my best to warn them sunday after sunday i chime in their ears the beautiful old hymns that sweetly chide or cheer the hearts that truly listen and believe sunday after sunday i look down on them as they pass in hoping to see that my words have not fallen upon deaf ears and sunday after sunday they listen to words that should teach them much yet seem to go by them like the wind they are told to love their neighbor yet too many hate him because he possesses more of this worlds goods or honors than they they are told that a rich man cannot enter the kingdom of heaven yet they go on laying up perishable wealth and though often warned that moth and rust will corrupt they fail to believe it till the worm that destroys enters and mars their own chapel of ease being a spirit i see below external splendor and find much poverty of heart and soul under the velvet and the ermine which should cover rich and royal natures our city saints walk abroad in threadbare suits and under quiet bonnets shine the eyes that make sunshine in the shady places often as i watch the glittering procession passing to and fro below me i wonder if with all our progress there is today as much real piety as in the times when our fathers poorly clad with weapon in one hand and bible in the other came weary distances to worship in the wilderness with fervent faith unquenched by danger suffering and solitude  yet in spite of my faultfinding i love my children as i call them for all are not butterflies many find wealth no temptation to forgetfulness of duty or hardness of heart many give freely of their abundance pity the poor comfort the afflicted and make our city loved and honored in other lands as in our own they have their cares losses and heartaches as well as the poor it isnt all sunshine with them and they learn poor souls that    into each life some rain must fall   some days must be dark and dreary  but ive hopes of them and lately they have had a teacher so genial so gifted so wellbeloved that all who listen to him must be better for the lessons of charity goodwill and cheerfulness which he brings home to them by the magic of tears and smiles we know him we love him we always remember him as the year comes round and the blithest song our brazen tongues utter is a christmas carol to the father of the chimes  as the spirit spoke his voice grew cheery his old face shone and in a burst of hearty enthusiasm he flung up his cap and cheered like a boy so did the others and as the fairy shout echoed through the belfry a troop of shadowy figures with faces lovely or grotesque tragical or gay sailed by on the wings of the wintry wind and waved their hands to the spirits of the bells  as the excitement subsided and the spirits reseated themselves looking ten years younger for that burst another spoke a venerable brother in a dingy mantle with a tuneful voice and eyes that seemed to have grown sad with looking on much misery  he loves the poor the man weve just hurrahed for and he makes others love and remember them bless him said the spirit i hope hell touch the hearts of those who listen to him here and beguile them to open their hands to my unhappy children over yonder if i could set some of the forlorn souls in my parish beside the happier creatures who weep over imaginary woes as they are painted by his eloquent lips that brilliant scene would be better than any sermon day and night i look down on lives as full of sin selfsacrifice and suffering as any in those famous books day and night i try to comfort the poor by my cheery voice and to make their wants known by proclaiming them with all my might but people seem to be so intent on business pleasure or home duties that they have no time to hear and answer my appeal theres a deal of charity in this good city and when the people do wake up they work with a will but i cant help thinking that if some of the money lavished on luxuries was spent on necessaries for the poor there would be fewer tragedies like that which ended yesterday its a short story easy to tell though long and hard to live listen to it  down yonder in the garret of one of the squalid houses at the foot of my tower a little girl has lived for a year fighting silently and singlehanded a good fight against poverty and sin i saw her when she first came a hopeful cheerful bravehearted little soul alone yet not afraid she used to sit all day sewing at her window and her lamp burnt far into the night for she was very poor and all she earned would barely give her food and shelter i watched her feed the doves who seemed to be her only friends she never forgot them and daily gave them the few crumbs that fell from her meagre table but there was no kind hand to feed and foster the little human dove and so she starved  for a while she worked bravely but the poor three dollars a week would not clothe and feed and warm her though the things her busy fingers made sold for enough to keep her comfortably if she had received it i saw the pretty color fade from her cheeks her eyes grew hollow her voice lost its cheery ring her step its elasticity and her face began to wear the haggard anxious look that made its youth doubly pathetic her poor little gowns grew shabby her shawl so thin she shivered when the pitiless wind smote her and her feet were almost bare rain and snow beat on the patient little figure going to and fro each morning with hope and courage faintly shining each evening with the shadow of despair gathering darker round her it was a hard time for all desperately hard for her and in her poverty sin and pleasure tempted her she resisted but as another bitter winter came she feared that in her misery she might yield for body and soul were weakened now by the long struggle she knew not where to turn for help there seemed to be no place for her at any safe and happy fireside lifes hard aspect daunted her and she turned to death saying confidingly take me while im innocent and not afraid to go  i saw it all i saw how she sold everything that would bring money and paid her little debts to the utmost penny how she set her poor room in order for the last time how she tenderly bade the doves goodby and lay down on her bed to die at nine oclock last night as my bell rang over the city i tried to tell what was going on in the garret where the light was dying out so fast i cried to them with all my strength  kind souls below there a fellowcreature is perishing for lack of charity oh help her before it is too late mothers with little daughters on your knees stretch out your hands and take her in happy women in the safe shelter of home think of her desolation rich men who grind the faces of the poor remember that this soul will one day be required of you dear lord let not this little sparrow fall to the ground help christian men and women in the name of him whose birthday blessed the world  ah me i rang and clashed and cried in vain the passersby only said as they hurried home laden with christmas cheer the old bell is merry tonight as it should be at this blithe season bless it  as the clocks struck ten the poor child lay down saying as she drank the last bitter draught life could give her its very cold but soon i shall not feel it and with her quiet eyes fixed on the cross that glimmered in the moonlight above me she lay waiting for the sleep that needs no lullaby  as the clock struck eleven pain and poverty for her were over it was bitter cold but she no longer felt it she lay serenely sleeping with tired heart and hands at rest forever as the clocks struck twelve the dear lord remembered her and with fatherly hand led her into the home where there is room for all today i rung her knell and though my heart was heavy yet my soul was glad for in spite of all her human woe and weakness i am sure that little girl will keep a joyful christmas up in heaven  in the silence which the spirits for a moment kept a breath of softer air than any from the snowy world below swept through the steeple and seemed to whisper yes  avast there fond as i am of salt water i dont like this kind cried the breezy voice of the fourth spirit who had a tiny ship instead of a tassel on his cap and who wiped his wet eyes with the sleeve of his rough blue cloak it wont take me long to spin my yarn for things are pretty taut and shipshape aboard our craft captain taylor is an experienced sailor and has brought many a ship safely into port in spite of wind and tide and the devils own whirlpools and hurricanes if you want to see earnestness come aboard some sunday when the captains on the quarterdeck and take an observation no danger of falling asleep there no more than there is up aloft when the stormy winds do blow consciences get raked fore and aft sins are blown clean out of the water false colors are hauled down and true ones run up to the masthead and many an immortal soul is warned to steer off in time from the pirates rocks and quicksands of temptation hes a regular revolving light is the captaina beacon always burning and saying plainly here are lifeboats ready to put off in all weathers and bring the shipwrecked into quiet waters he comes but seldom now being laid up in the home dock tranquilly waiting till his turn comes to go out with the tide and safely ride at anchor in the great harbor of the lord our crew varies a good deal some of em have rather rough voyages and come into port pretty well battered landsharks fall foul of a good many and do a deal of damage but most of em carry brave and tender hearts under the blue jackets for their rough nurse the sea manages to keep something of the child alive in the grayest old tar that makes the world his picturebook we try to supply em with lifepreservers while at sea and make em feel sure of a hearty welcome when ashore and i believe the year 67 will sail away into eternity with a satisfactory cargo brother northend made me pipe my eye so ill make him laugh to pay for it by telling a clerical joke i heard the other day bellows didnt make it though he might have done so as hes a connection of ours and knows how to use his tongue as well as any of us speaking of the bells of a certain town a reverend gentleman affirmed that each bell uttered an appropriate remark so plainly that the words were audible to all the baptist bell cried briskly come up and be dipped come up and be dipped the episcopal bell slowly said apostolic succession apostolic succession the orthodox bell solemnly pronounced eternal damnation eternal damnation and the methodist shouted invitingly room for all room for all  as the spirit imitated the various calls as only a jovial bellsprite could the others gave him a chime of laughter and vowed they would each adopt some tuneful summons which should reach human ears and draw human feet more willingly to church  faith brother youve kept your word and got the laugh out of us cried a stout sleek spirit with a kindly face and a row of little saints round his cap and a rosary at his side its very well we are doing this year the cathedral is full the flock increasing and the true faith holding its own entirely ye may shake your heads if you will and fear therell be trouble but i doubt it weve warm hearts of our own and the best of us dont forget that when we were starving americathe saints bless the jewelsent us bread when we were dying for lack of work america opened her arms and took us in and now helps us to build churches homes and schools by giving us a share of the riches all men work for and win its a generous nation ye are and a brave one and we showed our gratitude by fighting for ye in the day of trouble and giving ye our phil and many another broth of a boy the land is wide enough for us both and while we work and fight and grow together each may learn something from the other im free to confess that your religion looks a bit cold and hard to me even here in the good city where each man may ride his own hobby to death and hoot at his neighbors as much as he will you seem to keep your piety shut up all the week in your bare white churches and only let it out on sundays just a trifle musty with disuse you set your rich warm and soft to the fore and leave the poor shivering at the door you give your people bare walls to look upon commonplace music to listen to dull sermons to put them asleep and then wonder why they stay away or take no interest when they come  we leave our doors open day and night our lamps are always burning and we may come into our fathers house at any hour we let rich and poor kneel together all being equal there with us abroad youll see prince and peasant side by side schoolboy and bishop marketwoman and noble lady saint and sinner praying to the holy mary whose motherly arms are open to high and low we make our churches inviting with immortal music pictures by the worlds great masters and rites that are splendid symbols of the faith we hold call it mummery if ye like but let me ask you why so many of your sheep stray into our fold its because they miss the warmth the hearty the maternal tenderness which all souls love and long for and fail to find in your stern puritanical belief by saint peter ive seen many a lukewarm worshipper who for years has nodded in your cushioned pews wake and glow with something akin to genuine piety while kneeling on the stone pavement of one of our cathedrals with raphaels angels before his eyes with strains of magnificent music in his ears and all about him in shapes of power or beauty the saints and martyrs who have saved the world and whose presence inspires him to follow their divine example its not complaining of ye i am but just reminding ye that men are but children after all and need more tempting to virtue than they do to vice which last comes easy to em since the fall do your best in your own ways to get the poor souls into bliss and good luck to ye but remember theres room in the holy mother church for all and when your own priests send ye to the divil come straight to us and well take ye in  a truly catholic welcome bull and all said the sixth spirit who in spite of his oldfashioned garments had a youthful face earnest fearless eyes and an energetic voice that woke the echoes with its vigorous tones ive a hopeful report brothers for the reforms of the day are wheeling into rank and marching on the war isnt over nor rebeldom conquered yet but the old guard has been up and at em through the year there has been some hard fighting rivers of ink have flowed and the washington dawdlers have signalized themselves by a masterly inactivity the political campaign has been an anxious one some of the leaders have deserted some been mustered out some have fallen gallantly and as yet have received no monuments but at the grand review the cross of the legion of honor will surely shine on many a brave breast that won no decoration but its virtue here for the worlds fanatics make heavens heroes poets say  the flock of nightingales that flew south during the winter of our discontent are all at home again some here and some in heaven but the music of their womanly heroism still lingers in the nations memory and makes a tender minorchord in the battlehymn of freedom  the reform in literature isnt as vigorous as i could wish but a sharp attack of mental and moral dyspepsia will soon teach our people that french confectionery and the bad pastry of wood bracdon yates  co is not the best diet for the rising generation  speaking of the rising generation reminds me of the schools they are doing well they always are and we are justly proud of them there may be a slight tendency toward placing too much value upon booklearning too little upon home culture our girls are acknowledged to be uncommonly pretty witty and wise but some of us wish they had more health and less excitement more domestic accomplishments and fewer ologies and isms and were contented with simple pleasures and the oldfashioned virtues and not quite so fond of the fast frivolous life that makes them old so soon i am fond of our girls and boys i love to ring for their christenings and marriages to toll proudly for the brave lads in blue and tenderly for the innocent creatures whose seats are empty under my old roof i want to see them anxious to make young america a model of virtue strength and beauty and i believe they will in time  there have been some important revivals in religion for the world wont stand still and we must keep pace or be left behind to fossilize a free nation must have a religion broad enough to embrace all mankind deep enough to fathom and fill the human soul high enough to reach the source of all love and wisdom and pure enough to satisfy the wisest and the best alarm bells have been rung anathemas pronounced and christians forgetful of their creed have abused one another heartily but the truth always triumphs in the end and whoever sincerely believes works and waits for it by whatever name he calls it will surely find his own faith blessed to him in proportion to his charity for the faith of others  but lookthe first red streaks of dawn are in the east our vigil is over and we must fly home to welcome in the holidays before we part join with me brothers in resolving that through the coming year we will with all our hearts and tongues    ring out the old ring in the new   ring out the false ring in the true   ring in the valiant man and free   ring in the christ that is to be  then hand in hand the spirits of the bells floated away singing in the hush of dawn the sweet song the stars sung over bethlehempeace on earth good will to men
