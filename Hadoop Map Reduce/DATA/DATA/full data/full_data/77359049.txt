fortunes of the man lay slumbering in prophetic light in characters a child might scan so bright and gone forth utterly oh stern wordnevermore    the stars of those two gentle eyes     10 will shine no more on earth quenched are the hopes that had their birth as we watched them slowly rise stars of a mothers fate and she would read them oer and oer pondering as she sate over their dear astrology which she had conned and conned before deeming she needs must read aright     19 what was writ so passing bright and yet alas she knew not why her voice would falter in its song and tears would slide from out her eye silent as they were doing wrong oh stern wordnevermore    the tongue that scarce had learned to claim an entrance to a mothers heart by that dear talisman a mothers name sleeps all forgetful of its art i loved to see the infant soul     30 how mighty in the weakness of its untutored meekness peep timidly from out its nest his lips the while fluttering with halffledged words or hushing to a smile that more than words expressed when his glad mother on him stole and snatched him to her breast oh thoughts were brooding in those eyes     40 that would have soared like strongwinged birds far far into the skies gladding the earth with song and gushing harmonies had he but tarried with us long oh stern wordnevermore    how peacefully they rest crossfolded there upon his little breast those small white hands that neer were still before     50 but ever sported with his mothers hair or the plain cross that on her breast she wore her heart no more will beat to feel the touch of that soft palm that ever seemed a new surprise sending glad thoughts up to her eyes to bless him with their holy calm sweet thoughts they made her eyes as sweet how quiet are the hands that wove those pleasant bands but that they do not rise and sink      61 with his calm breathing i should think that he were dropped asleep alas too deep too deep is this his slumber time scarce can number the years ere he shall wake again oh may we see his eyelids open then oh stern wordnevermore    as the airy gossamere      70 floating in the sunlight clear whereer it toucheth clingeth tightly bound glossy leal or stump unsightly so from his spirit wandered out tendrils spreading all about knitting all things to its thrall with a perfect love of all oh stern wordnevermore    he did but float a little way adown the stream of time      80 with dreamy eyes watching the ripples play or hearkening their fairy chime his slender sail neer felt the gale he did but float a little way and putting to the shore while yet t was early day went calmly on his way to dwell with us no more no jarring did he feel      90 no grating on his shallops keel a strip of silver sand mingled the waters with the land where he was seen no more oh stern wordnevermore    full short his journey was no dust of earth unto his sandals clave the weary weight that old men must he bore not to the grave he seemed a cherub who had lost his way      100 and wandered hither so his stay with us was short and t was most meet that he should be no delver in earths clod nor need to pause and cleanse his feet to stand before his god oh blest wordevermore    the sirens    the sea is lonely the sea is dreary the sea is restless and uneasy thou seekest quiet thou art weary wandering thou knowest not whither our little isle is green and breezy come and rest thee oh come hither come to this peaceful home of ours     where evermore the low westwind creeps panting up the shore      9 to be at rest among the flowers full of rest the green moss lifts   as the dark waves of the sea draw in and out of rocky rifts   calling solemnly to thee with voices deep and hollow     to the shore   follow oh follow   to be at rest forevermore       forevermore  look how the gray old ocean      20 from the depth of his heart rejoices heaving with a gentle motion when he hears our restful voices list how he sings in an undertone chiming with our melody and all sweet sounds of earth and air melt into one low voice alone that murmurs over the weary sea and seems to sing from everywhere here mayst thou harbor peacefully     30 here mayst thou rest from the aching oar   turn thy curved prow ashore and in our green isle rest forevermore       forevermore and echo half wakes in the wooded hill   and to her heart so calm and deep   murmurs over in her sleep doubtfully pausing and murmuring still       evermore     thus on lifes weary sea      40     heareth the marinere     voices sweet from far and near     ever singing low and clear     ever singing longingly    is it not better here to be than to be toiling late and soon in the dreary night to see nothing but the bloodred moon go up and down into the sea or in the loneliness of day      50   to see the still seals only solemnly lift their faces gray   making it yet more lonely is it not better than to hear only the sliding of the wave beneath the plank and feel so near a cold and lonely grave a restless grave where thou shalt lie even in death unquietly look down beneath thy waveworn bark      60   lean over the side and see the leaden eye of the sidelong shark     upturnèd patiently   ever waiting there for thee look down and see those shapeless forms   which ever keep their dreamless sleep   far down within the gloomy deep and only stir themselves in storms rising like islands from beneath and snorting through the angry spray      70 as the frail vessel perisheth in the whirls of their unwieldy play   look down look down upon the seaweed slimy and dark that waves its arms so lank and brown     beckoning for thee look down beneath thy waveworn bark     into the cold depth of the sea   look down look down     thus on lifes lonely sea      80     heareth the marinere     voices sad from far and near     ever singing full of fear     ever singing drearfully    here all is pleasant as a dream the wind scarce shaketh down the dew the green grass floweth like a stream     into the oceans blue       listen oh listen here is a gush of many streams   a song of many birds      91 and every wish and longing seems lulled to a numbered flow of words       listen oh listen here ever hum the golden bees underneath fullblossomed trees at once with glowing fruit and flowers crowned so smooth the sand the yellow sand that thy keel will not grate as it touches the land all around with a slumberous sound     100 the singing waves slide up the strand and there where the smooth wet pebbles be the waters gurgle longingly as if they fain would seek the shore to be at rest from the ceaseless roar to be at rest forevermore         forevermore     thus on lifes gloomy sea     heareth the marinere     voices sweet from far and near     110     ever singing in his ear     here is rest and peace for thee    irenÉ    hers is a spirit deep and crystalclear calmly beneath her earnest face it lies free without boldness meek without a fear quicker to look than speak its sympathies far down into her large and patient eyes i gaze deepdrinking of the infinite as in the midwatch of a clear still night i look into the fathomless blue skies    so circled lives she with loves holy light that from the shade of self she walketh free     10 the garden of her soul still keepeth she an eden where the snake did never enter she hath a natural wise sincerity a simple truthfulness and these have lent her a dignity as moveless as the centre so that no influence of our earth can stir her steadfast courage nor can take away the holy peacefulness which night and day unto her queenly soul doth minister    most gentle is she her large charity     20 an all unwitting childlike gift in her not freer is to give than meek to bear and though herself not unacquaint with care hath in her heart wide room for all that be her heart that hath no secrets of its own but open is as eglantine full blown cloudless forever is her brow serene speaking calm hope and trust within her whence welleth a noiseless spring of patience that keepeth all her life so fresh so green     30 and full of holiness that every look the greatness of her womans soul revealing unto me bringeth blessing and a feeling as when i read in gods own holy book    a graciousness in giving that doth make the smallst gift greatest and a sense most meek of worthiness that doth not fear to take from others but which always fears to speak its thanks in utterance for the givers sake the deep religion of a thankful heart      40 which rests instinctively in heavens clear law with a full peace that never can depart from its own steadfastnessa holy awe for holy thingsnot those which men call holy but such as are revealèd to the eyes of a true womans soul bent down and lowly before the face of daily mysteries a love that blossoms soon but ripens slowly to the full goldenness of fruitful prime enduring with a firmness that defies      50 all shallow tricks of circumstance and time by a sure insight knowing where to cling and where it clingeth never withering these are irenés dowry which no fate can shake from their serene deepbuilded state    inseeing sympathy is hers which chasteneth no less than loveth scorning to be bound with fear of blame and yet which ever hasteneth to pour the balm of kind looks on the wound if they be wounds which such sweet teaching makes      60 giving itself a pang for others sakes no want of faith that chills with sidelong eye hath she no jealousy no levite pride that passeth by upon the other side for in her soul there never dwelt a lie right from the hand of god her spirit came unstained and she hath neer forgotten whence it came nor wandered far from thence but laboreth to keep her still the same near to her place of birth that she may not      70 soil her white raiment with an earthly spot    yet sets she not her soul so steadily above that she forgets her ties to earth but her whole thought would almost seem to be how to make glad one lowly human hearth for with a gentle courage she doth strive in thought and word and feeling so to live as to make earth next heaven and her heart herein doth show its most exceeding worth that bearing in our frailty her just part       80 she hath not shrunk from evils of this life but hath gone calmly forth into the strife and all its sins and sorrows hath withstood with lofty strength of patient womanhood for this i love her great soul more than all that being bound like us with earthly thrall she walks so bright and heavenlike therein too wise too meek too womanly to sin    like a lone star through riven stormclouds seen by sailors tempesttost upon the sea                              90 telling of rest and peaceful heavens nigh unto my soul her starlike soul hath been her sight as full of hope and calm to me for she unto herself hath builded high a home serene wherein to lay her head earths noblest thing a woman perfected    serenade  from the closeshut windows gleams no spark the night is chilly the night is dark the poplars shiver the pinetrees moan my hair by the autumn breeze is blown under thy window i sing alone alone alone ah woe alone  the darkness is pressing coldly around the windows shake with a lonely sound the stars are hid and the night is drear the heart of silence throbs in thine ear in thy chamber thou sittest alone alone alone ah woe alone  the world is happy the world is wide kind hearts are beating on every side ah why should we lie so coldly curled alone in the shell of this great world why should we any more be alone alone alone ah woe alone  oh tis a bitter and dreary word the saddest by mans ear ever heard we each are young we each have a heart why stand we ever coldly apart must we forever then be alone alone alone ah woe alone    with a pressed flower  this little blossom from afar hath come from other lands to thine for once its white and drooping star could see its shadow in the rhine  perchance some fairhaired german maid hath plucked one from the selfsame stalk and numbered over half afraid its petals in her evening walk  he loves me loves me not she cries he loves me more than earth or heaven and then glad tears have filled her eyes to find the number was uneven  and thou must count its petals well because it is a gift from me and the last one of all shall tell something ive often told to thee  but here at home where we were born thou wilt find blossoms just as true downbending every summer morn with freshness of new england dew  for nature ever kind to love hath granted them the same sweet tongue whether with german skies above or here our granite rocks among    the beggar  a beggar through the world am i from place to place i wander by fill up my pilgrims scrip for me for christs sweet sake and charity  a little of thy steadfastness bounded with leafy gracefulness old oak give me that the worlds blasts may round me blow and i yield gently to and fro while my stouthearted trunk below and firmset roots unshaken be  some of thy stern unyielding might enduring still through day and night rude tempestshock and withering blight that i may keep at bay the changeful april sky of chance and the strong tide of circumstance give me old granite gray  some of thy pensiveness serene some of thy neverdying green put in this scrip of mine that griefs may fall like snowflakes light and deck me in a robe of white ready to be an angel bright o sweetly mournful pine  a little of thy merriment of thy sparkling light content give me my cheerful brook that i may still be full of glee and gladsomeness whereer i be though fickle fate hath prisoned me in some neglected nook  ye have been very kind and good to me since ive been in the wood ye have gone nigh to fill my heart but goodby kind friends every one ive far to go ere set of sun of all good things i would have part the day was high ere i could start and so my journeys scarce begun  heaven help me how could i forget to beg of thee dear violet some of thy modesty that blossoms here as well unseen as if before the world thoudst been oh give to strengthen me    my love  not as all other women are is she that to my soul is dear her glorious fancies come from far beneath the silver eveningstar and yet her heart is ever near  great feelings hath she of her own which lesser souls may never know god giveth them to her alone and sweet they are as any tone wherewith the wind may choose to blow  yet in herself she dwelleth not although no home were half so fair no simplest duty is forgot life hath no dim and lowly spot that doth not in her sunshine share  she doeth little kindnesses which most leave undone or despise for naught that sets one heart at ease and giveth happiness or peace is lowesteemèd in her eyes  she hath no scorn of common things and though she seem of other birth round us her heart intwines and clings and patiently she folds her wings to tread the humble paths of earth  blessing she is god made her so and deeds of weekday holiness fall from her noiseless as the snow nor hath she ever chanced to know that aught were easier than to bless  she is most fair and thereunto her life doth rightly harmonize feeling or thought that was not true neer made less beautiful the blue unclouded heaven of her eyes  she is a woman one in whom the springtime of her childish years hath never lost its fresh perfume though knowing well that life hath room for many blights and many tears  i love her with a love as still as a broad rivers peaceful might which by high tower and lowly mill seems following its own wayward will and yet doth ever flow aright  and on its full deep breast serene like quiet isles my duties lie it flows around them and between and makes them fresh and fair and green sweet homes wherein to live and die    summer storm      untremulous in the river clear toward the skys image hangs the imaged bridge     so still the air that i can hear the slender clarion of the unseen midge   out of the stillness with a gathering creep like rising wind in leaves which now decreases now lulls now swells and all the while increases   the huddling trample of a drove of sheep tilts the loose planks and then as gradually ceases   in dust on the other side lifes emblem deep            10 a confused noise between two silences finding at last in dust precarious peace on the wide marsh the purpleblossomed grasses   soak up the sunshine sleeps the brimming tide save when the wedgeshaped wake in silence passes   of some slow waterrat whose sinuous glide wavers the sedges emerald shade from side to side  but up the west like a rockshivered surge   climbs a great cloud edged with sunwhitened spray huge whirls of foam boil toppling oer its verge           20   and falling still it seems and yet it climbs alway      suddenly all the sky is hid     as with the shutting of a lid one by one great drops are falling       doubtful and slow down the pane they are crookedly crawling   and the wind breathes low slowly the circles widen on the river   widen and mingle one and all here and there the slenderer flowers shiver               30   struck by an icy raindrops fall  now on the hills i hear the thunder mutter     the wind is gathering in the west the upturned leaves first whiten and flutter     then droop to a fitful rest up from the stream with sluggish flap   struggles the gull and floats away nearer and nearer rolls the thunderclap   we shall not see the sun go down today now leaps the wind on the sleepy marsh                        40   and tramples the grass with terrified feet the startled river turns leaden and harsh   you can hear the quick heart of the tempest beat      look look that livid flash and instantly follows the rattling thunder as if some cloudcrag split asunder     fell splintering with a ruinous crash on the earth which crouches in silence under   and now a solid gray wall of rain shuts off the landscape mile by mile                      50   for a breaths space i see the blue wood again and ere the next heartbeat the windhurled pile   that seemed but now a league aloof   bursts crackling oer the sunparched roof against the windows the storm comes dashing through tattered foliage the hail tears crashing     the blue lightning flashes     the rapid hail clashes   the white waves are tumbling     and in one baffled roar                               60   like the toothless sea mumbling     a rockbristled shore   the thunder is rumbling   and crashing and crumbling will silence return nevermore      hush still as death     the tempest holds his breath   as from a sudden will the rain stops short but from the eaves you see it drop and hear it from the leaves               70   all is so bodingly still     again now now again plashes the rain in heavy gouts   the crinkled lightning   seems ever brightening     and loud and long     again the thunder shouts           his battlesong         one quivering flash         one wildering crash                                80     followed by silence dead and dull          as if the cloud let go         leapt bodily below to whelm the earth in one mad overthrow         and then a total lull          gone gone so soon     no more my halfdazed fancy there     can shape a giant in the air     no more i see his streaming hair   the writhing portent of his form                      90         the pale and quiet moon     makes her calm forehead bare   and the last fragments of the storm like shattered rigging from a fight at sea silent and few are drifting over me    love  true love is but a humble lowborn thing and hath its food served up in earthen ware it is a thing to walk with hand in hand through the everydayness of this workday world baring its tender feet to every flint yet letting not one heartbeat go astray from beautys law of plainness and content a simple fireside thing whose quiet smile can warm earths poorest hovel to a home which when our autumn cometh as it must and life in the chill wind shivers bare and leafless shall still be blest with indiansummer youth in bleak november and with thankful heart smile on its ample stores of garnered fruit as full of sunshine to our aged eyes as when it nursed the blossoms of our spring such is true love which steals into the heart with feet as silent as the lightsome dawn that kisses smooth the rough brows of the dark and hath its will through blissful gentleness not like a rocket which with passionate glare whirs suddenly up then bursts and leaves the night painfully quivering on the dazèd eyes a love that gives and takes that seeth faults not with flawseeking eyes like needle points but lovingkindly ever looks them down with the oercoming faith that still forgives a love that shall be new and fresh each hour as is the sunsets golden mystery or the sweet coming of the eveningstar alike and yet most unlike every day and seeming ever best and fairest now a love that doth not kneel for what it seeks but faces truth and beauty as their peer showing its worthiness of noble thoughts by a clear sense of inward nobleness a love that in its object findeth not all grace and beauty and enough to sate its thirst of blessing but in all of good found there sees but the heavenimplanted types of good and beauty in the soul of man and traces in the simplest heart that beats a familylikeness to its chosen one that claims of it the rights of brotherhood for love is blind but with the fleshly eye that so its inner sight may be more clear and outward shows of beauty only so are needful at the first as is a hand to guide and to uphold an infants steps fine natures need them not their earnest look pierces the bodys mask of thin disguise and beauty ever is to them revealed behind the unshapeliest meanest lump of clay with arms outstretched and eager face ablaze yearning to be but understood and loved    to perdita singing  thy voice is like a fountain   leaping up in clear moonshine silver silver ever mounting         ever sinking         without thinking   to that brimful heart of thine every sad and happy feeling thou hast had in bygone years through thy lips comes stealing stealing         clear and low     10 all thy smiles and all thy tears   in thy voice awaken   and sweetness wove of joy and woe     from their teaching it hath taken feeling and music move together like a swan and shadow ever floating on a skyblue river in a day of cloudless weather  it hath caught a touch of sadness         yet it is not sad     20 it hath tones of clearest gladness         yet it is not glad a dim sweet twilight voice it is   where todays accustomed blue is overgrayed with memories   with starry feelings quivered through    thy voice is like a fountain leaping up in sunshine bright   and i never weary counting its clear droppings lone and single     30 or when in one full gush they mingle   shooting in melodious light    thine is music such as yields   feelings of old brooks and fields   and around this pentup room   sheds a woodland free perfume     oh thus forever sing to me         oh thus forever the green bright grass of childhood bring to me      39   flowing like an emerald river   and the bright blue skies above   oh sing them back as fresh as ever   into the bosom of my love   the sunshine and the merriment   the unsought evergreen content     of that never cold time   the joy that like a clear breeze went     through and through the old time   peace sits within thine eyes   with white hands crossed in joyful rest     50 while through thy lips and face arise the melodies from out thy breast       she sits and sings       with folded wings       and white arms crost   weep not for bygone things       they are not lost the beauty which the summer time oer thine opening spirit shed the forest oracles sublime                       60 that filled thy soul with joyous dread the scent of every smallest flower that made thy heart sweet for an hour yea every holy influence flowing to thee thou knewest not whence in thine eyes today is seen fresh as it hath ever been promptings of nature beckonings sweet whatever led thy childish feet still will linger unawares                      70 the guiders of thy silver hairs every look and every word which thou givest forth today tell of the singing of the bird whose music stilled thy boyish play  thy voice is like a fountain twinkling up in sharp starlight when the moon behind the mountain dims the low east with faintest white       ever darkling     80       ever sparkling     we know not if tis dark or bright but when the great moon hath rolled round   and suddenslow its solemn power grows from behind its black clearedgèd bound   no spot of dark the fountain keepeth   but swift as opening eyelids leapeth   into a waving silver flower    the moon    my soul was like the sea   before the moon was made moaning in vague immensity   of its own strength afraid   unresful and unstaid through every rift it foamed in vain   about its earthly prison seeking some unknown thing in pain and sinking restless back again   for yet no moon had risen its only voice a vast dumb moan   of utterless anguish speaking it lay unhopefully alone   and lived but in an aimless seeking  so was my soul but when twas full   of unrest to oerloading a voice of something beautiful   whispered a dim foreboding and yet so soft so sweet so low it had not more of joy than woe  and as the sea doth oft lie still   making its waters meet as if by an unconscious will   for the moons silver feet so lay my soul within mine eyes when thou its guardian moon didst rise  and now howeer its waves above   may toss and seem uneaseful one strong eternal law of love   with guidance sure and peaceful as calm and natural as breath moves its great deeps through life and death    remembered music  a fragment  thickrushing like an ocean vast   of bisons the far prairie shaking the notes crowd heavily and fast as surfs one plunging while the last   draws seaward from its foamy breaking  or in low murmurs they began   rising and rising momently as oer a harp Æolian a fitful breeze until they ran   up to a sudden ecstasy  and then like minutedrops of rain   ringing in water silvery they lingering dropped and dropped again till it was almost like a pain   to listen when the next would be    song  to ml  a lily thou wast when i saw thee first   a lilybud not opened quite   that hourly grew more pure and white by morning and noontide and evening nursed   in all of nature thou hadst thy share     thou wast waited on     by the wind and sun   the rain and the dew for thee took care   it seemed thou never couldst be more fair  a lily thou wast when i saw thee first   a lilybud but oh how strange   how full of wonder was the change when ripe with all sweetness thy full bloom burst   how did the tears to my glad eyes start     when the womanflower     reached its blossoming hour and i saw the warm deeps of thy golden heart  glad death may pluck thee but never before   the gold dust of thy bloom divine   hath dropped from thy heart into mine to quicken its faint germs of heavenly lore for no breeze comes nigh thee but carries away     some impulses bright     of fragrance and light which fall upon souls that are lone and astray to plant fruitful hopes of the flower of day    allegra  i would more natures were like thine   that never casts a glance before thou hebe who thy hearts bright wine   so lavishly to all dost pour that we who drink forget to pine   and can but dream of bliss in store  thou canst not see a shade in life   with sunward instinct thou dost rise and leaving clouds below at strife   gazest undazzled at the skies with all their blazing splendors rife   a songful lark with eagles eyes  thou wast some foundling whom the hours   nursed laughing with the milk of mirth some influence more gay than ours   hath ruled thy nature from its birth as if thy natal stars were flowers   that shook their seeds round thee on earth  and thou to lull thine infant rest   wast cradled like an indian child all pleasant winds from south and west   with lullabies thine ears beguiled rocking thee in thine orioles nest   till nature looked at thee and smiled  thine every fancy seems to borrow   a sunlight from thy childish years making a golden cloud of sorrow   a hopelit rainbow out of tears thy heart is certain of tomorrow   though yond today it never peers  i would more natures were like thine   so innocently wild and free whose sad thoughts even leap and shine   like sunny wavelets in the sea making us mindless of the brine   in gazing on the brilliancy    the fountain  into the sunshine   full of the light leaping and flashing   from morn till night  into the moonlight   whiter than snow waving so flowerlike   when the winds blow  into the starlight   rushing in spray happy at midnight   happy by day  ever in motion   blithesome and cheery still climbing heavenward   never aweary  glad of all weathers   still seeming best upward or downward   motion thy rest  full of a nature   nothing can tame changed every moment   ever the same  ceaseless aspiring   ceaseless content darkness or sunshine   thy element  glorious fountain   let my heart be fresh changeful constant   upward like thee    ode  i  in the old days of awe and keeneyed wonder   the poets song with bloodwarm truth was rife he saw the mysteries which circle under   the outward shell and skin of daily life nothing to him were fleeting time and fashion   his soul was led by the eternal law there was in him no hope of fame no passion   but with calm godlike eyes he only saw he did not sigh oer heroes dead and buried   chiefmourner at the golden ages hearse     10 nor deem that souls whom charon grim had ferried   alone were fitting themes of epic verse he could believe the promise of tomorrow   and feel the wondrous meaning of today he had a deeper faith in holy sorrow   than the worlds seeming loss could take away to know the heart of all things was his duty   all things did sing to him to make him wise and with a sorrowful and conquering beauty   the soul of all looked grandly from his eyes     20 he gazed on all within him and without him   he watched the flowing of times steady tide and shapes of glory floated all about him   and whispered to him and he prophesied than all men he more fearless was and freer   and all his brethren cried with one accord behold the holy man behold the seer   him who hath spoken with the unseen lord he to his heart with large embrace had taken   the universal sorrow of mankind                 30 and from that root a shelter never shaken   the tree of wisdom grew with sturdy rind he could interpret well the wondrous voices   which to the calm and silent spirit come he knew that the one soul no more rejoices   in the stars anthem than the insects hum he in his heart was ever meek and humble   and yet with kingly pomp his numbers ran as he foresaw how all things false should crumble   before the free uplifted soul of man           40 and when he was made full to overflowing   with all the loveliness of heaven and earth out rushed his song like molten iron glowing   to show god sitting by the humblest hearth with calmest courage he was ever ready   to teach that action was the truth of thought and with strong arm and purpose firm and steady   an anchor for the drifting world he wrought so did he make the meanest man partaker   of all his brothergods unto him gave            50 all souls did reverence him and name him maker   and when he died heaped temples on his grave and still his deathless words of light are swimming   serene throughout the great deep infinite of human soul unwaning and undimming   to cheer and guide the mariner at night   ii  but now the poet is an empty rhymer   who lies with idle elbow on the grass and fits his singing like a cunning timer   to all mens prides and fancies as they pass      60 not his the song which in its metre holy   chimes with the music of the eternal stars humbling the tyrant lifting up the lowly   and sending sun through the souls prisonbars maker no moreoh no unmaker rather   for he unmakes who doth not all put forth the power given freely by our loving father   to show the bodys dross the spirits worth awake great spirit of the ages olden   shiver the mists that hide thy starry lyre      70 and let mans soul be yet again beholden   to thee for wings to soar to her desire oh prophesy no more tomorrows splendor   be no more shamefaced to speak out for truth lay on her altar all the gushings tender   the hope the fire the loving faith of youth oh prophesy no more the makers coming   say not his onward footsteps thou canst hear in the dim void like to the awful humming   of the great wings of some newlighted sphere     80 oh prophesy no more but be the poet   this longing was but granted unto thee that when all beauty thou couldst feel and know it   that beauty in its highest thou shouldst be o thou who moanest tost with sealike longings   who dimly hearest voices call on thee whose soul is overfilled with mighty throngings   of love and fear and glorious agony thou of the toilstrung hands and iron sinews   and soul by mother earth with freedom fed      90 in whom the herospirit yet continues   the old free nature is not chained or dead arouse let thy soul break in musicthunder   let loose the ocean that is in thee pent pour forth thy hope thy fear thy love thy wonder   and tell the age what all its signs have meant whereer thy wildered crowd of brethren jostles   whereer there lingers but a shadow of wrong there still is need of martyrs and apostles   there still are texts for neverdying song     100 from age to age mans still aspiring spirit   finds wider scope and sees with clearer eyes and thou in larger measure dost inherit   what made thy great forerunners free and wise sit thou enthronèd where the poets mountain   above the thunder lifts its silent peak and roll thy songs down like a gathering fountain   they all may drink and find the rest they seek sing there shall silence grow in earth and heaven   a silence of deep awe and wondering            110 for listening gladly bend the angels even   to hear a mortal like an angel sing   iii  among the toilworn poor my soul is seeking   for who shall bring the makers name to light to be the voice of that almighty speaking   which every age demands to do it right proprieties our silken bards environ   he who would be the tongue of this wide land must string his harp with chords of sturdy iron   and strike it with a toilimbrownèd hand      120 one who hath dwelt with nature well attended   who hath learnt wisdom from her mystic books whose soul with all her countless lives hath blended   so that all beauty awes us in his looks who not with bodys waste his soul hath pampered   who as the clear northwestern wind is free who walks with forms observances unhampered   and follows the one will obediently whose eyes like windows on a breezy summit   control a lovely prospect every way      130 who doth not sound gods sea with earthly plummet   and find a bottom still of worthless clay who heeds not how the lower gusts are working   knowing that one sure wind blows on above and sees beneath the foulest faces lurking   one godbuilt shrine of reverence and love who sees all stars that wheel their shining marches   around the centre fixed of destiny where the encircling soul serene oerarches   the moving globe of being like a sky      140 who feels that god and heavens great deeps are nearer   him to whose heart his fellowman is nigh who doth not hold his souls own freedom dearer   than that of all his brethren low or high who to the right can feel himself the truer   for being gently patient with the wrong who sees a brother in the evildoer   and finds in love the heartsblood of his song this this is he for whom the world is waiting   to sing the beatings of its mighty heart      150 too long hath it been patient with the grating   of scrannelpipes and heard it misnamed art to him the smiling soul of man shall listen   laying awhile its crown of thorns aside and once again in every eye shall glisten   the glory of a nature satisfied his verse shall have a great commanding motion   heaving and swelling with a melody learnt of the sky the river and the ocean   and all the pure majestic things that be      160 awake then thou we pine for thy great presence   to make us feel the soul once more sublime we are of far too infinite an essence   to rest contented with the lies of time speak out and lo a hush of deepest wonder   shall sink oer all this manyvoicèd scene as when a sudden burst of rattling thunder   shatters the blueness of a sky serene    the fatherland  where is the true mans fatherland   is it where he by chance is born   doth not the yearning spirit scorn in such scant borders to be spanned oh yes his fatherland must be as the blue heaven wide and free  is it alone where freedom is   where god is god and man is man   doth he not claim a broader span for the souls love of home than this oh yes his fatherland must be as the blue heaven wide and free  whereer a human heart doth wear   joys myrtlewreath or sorrows gyves   whereer a human spirit strives after a life more true and fair there is the true mans birthplace grand his is a worldwide fatherland  whereer a single slave doth pine   whereer one man may help another   thank god for such a birthright brother that spot of earth is thine and mine there is the true mans birthplace grand his is a worldwide fatherland    the forlorn  the night is dark the stinging sleet   swept by the bitter gusts of air drives whistling down the lonely street   and glazes on the pavement bare  the streetlamps flare and struggle dim   through the gray sleetclouds as they pass or governed by a boisterous whim   drop down and rustle on the glass  one poor heartbroken outcast girl   faces the eastwinds searching flaws and as about her heart they whirl   her tattered cloak more tightly draws  the flat brick walls look cold and bleak   her bare feet to the sidewalk freeze yet dares she not a shelter seek   though faint with hunger and disease  the sharp storm cuts her forehead bare   and piercing through her garments thin beats on her shrunken breast and there   makes colder the cold heart within  she lingers where a ruddy glow   streams outward through an open shutter adding more bitterness to woe   more loneliness to desertion utter  one half the cold she had not felt   until she saw this gush of light spread warmly forth and seem to melt   its slow way through the deadening night  she hears a womans voice within   singing sweet words her childhood knew and years of misery and sin   furl off and leave her heaven blue  her freezing heart like one who sinks   outwearied in the drifting snow drowses to deadly sleep and thinks   no longer of its hopeless woe  old fields and clear blue summer days   old meadows green with grass and trees that shimmer through the trembling haze   and whiten in the western breeze  old faces all the friendly past   rises within her heart again and sunshine from her childhood cast   makes summer of the icy rain  enhaloed by a mild warm glow   from mans humanity apart she hears old footsteps wandering slow   through the lone chambers of the heart  outside the porch before the door   her cheek upon the cold hard stone she lies no longer foul and poor   no longer dreary and alone  next morning something heavily   against the opening door did weigh and there from sin and sorrow free   a woman on the threshold lay  a smile upon the wan lips told   that she had found a calm release and that from out the want and cold   the song had borne her soul in peace  for whom the heart of man shuts out   sometimes the heart of god takes in and fences them all round about   with silence mid the worlds loud din  and one of his great charities   is music and it doth not scorn to close the lids upon the eyes   of the polluted and forlorn  far was she from her childhoods home   farther in guilt had wandered thence yet thither it had bid her come   to die in maiden innocence    midnight  the moon shines white and silent   on the mist which like a tide of some enchanted ocean   oer the wide marsh doth glide spreading its ghostlike billows   silently far and wide  a vague and starry magic   makes all things mysteries and lures the earths dumb spirit   up to the longing skies i seem to hear dim whispers   and tremulous replies  the fireflies oer the meadow   in pulses come and go the elmtrees heavy shadow   weighs on the grass below and faintly from the distance   the dreaming cock doth crow  all things look strange and mystic   the very bushes swell and take wild shapes and motions   as if beneath a spell they seem not the same lilacs   from childhood known so well  the snow of deepest silence   oer everything doth fall so beautiful and quiet   and yet so like a pall as if all life were ended   and rest were come to all  o wild and wondrous midnight   there is a might in thee to make the charmèd body   almost like spirit be and give it some faint glimpses   of immortality    a prayer  god do not let my loved one die   but rather wait until the time that i am grown in purity   enough to enter thy pure clime then take me i will gladly go so that my love remain below  oh let her stay she is by birth   what i through death must learn to be we need her more on our poor earth   than thou canst need in heaven with thee she hath her wings already i must burst this earthshell ere i fly  then god take me we shall be near   more near than ever each to each her angel ears will find more clear   my heavenly than my earthly speech and still as i draw nigh to thee her soul and mine shall closer be    the heritage  the rich mans son inherits lands   and piles of brick and stone and gold and he inherits soft white hands   and tender flesh that fears the cold   nor dares to wear a garment old a heritage it seems to me one scarce would wish to hold in fee  the rich mans son inherits cares   the bank may break the factory burn a breath may burst his bubble shares   and soft white hands could hardly earn   a living that would serve his turn a heritage it seems to me one scarce would wish to hold in fee  the rich mans son inherits wants   his

fee    the rose a ballad   i  in his tower sat the poet   gazing on the roaring sea take this rose he sighed and throw it   where theres none that loveth me on the rock the billow bursteth   and sinks back into the seas but in vain my spirit thirsteth   so to burst and be at ease take o sea the tender blossom   that hath lain against my breast on thy black and angry bosom   it will find a surer rest life is vain and love is hollow   ugly death stands there behind hate and scorn and hunger follow   him that toileth for his kind forth into the night he hurled it   and with bitter smile did mark how the surly tempest whirled it   swift into the hungry dark foam and spray drive back to leeward   and the gale with dreary moan drifts the helpless blossom seaward   through the breakers all alone   ii  stands a maiden on the morrow   musing by the wavebeat strand half in hope and half in sorrow   tracing words upon the sand shall i ever then behold him   who hath been my life so long ever to this sick heart told him   be the spirit of his song touch not sea the blessed letters   i have traced upon thy shore spare his name whose spirit fetters   mine with love forevermore swells the tide and overflows it   but with omen pure and meet brings a little rose and throws it   humbly at the maidens feet full of bliss she takes the token   and upon her snowy breast soothes the ruffled petals broken   with the oceans fierce unrest love is thine o heart and surely   peace shall also be thine own for the heart that trusteth purely   never long can pine alone   iii  in his tower sits the poet   blisses new and strange to him fill his heart and overflow it   with a wonder sweet and dim up the beach the ocean slideth   with a whisper of delight and the moon in silence glideth   through the peaceful blue of night rippling oer the poets shoulder   flows a maidens golden hair maiden lips with love grown bolder   kiss his moonlit forehead bare life is joy and love is power   death all fetters doth unbind strength and wisdom only flower   when we toil for all our kind hope is truththe future giveth   more than present takes away and the soul forever liveth   nearer god from day to day not a word the maiden uttered   fullest hearts are slow to speak but a withered roseleaf fluttered   down upon the poets cheek    song    violet sweet violet   thine eyes are full of tears         are they wet         even yet with the thought of other years or with gladness are they full for the night so beautiful and longing for those faroff spheres    loved one of my youth thou wast   of my merry youth         and i see         tearfully all the fair and sunny past all its openness and truth ever fresh and green in thee as the moss is in the sea    thy little heart that hath with love   grown colored like the sky above   on which thou lookest ever         can it know         all the woe of hope for what returneth never all the sorrow and the longing to these hearts of ours belonging    out on it no foolish pining         for the sky         dims thine eye or for the stars so calmly shining like thee let this soul of mine take hue from that wherefor i long selfstayed and high serene and strong not satisfied with hopingbut divine    violet dear violet   thy blue eyes are only wet with joy and love of him who sent thee and for the fulfilling sense of that glad obedience which made thee all that nature meant thee    rosaline  thou lookdst on me all yesternight thine eyes were blue thy hair was bright as when we murmured our trothplight beneath the thick stars rosaline thy hair was braided on thy head as on the day we two were wed mine eyes scarce knew if thou wert dead but my shrunk heart knew rosaline  the deathwatch ticked behind the wall the blackness rustled like a pall            10 the moaning wind did rise and fall among the bleak pines rosaline my heart beat thickly in mine ears the lids may shut out fleshly fears but still the spirit sees and hears its eyes are lidless rosaline  a wildness rushing suddenly a knowing some ill shape is nigh a wish for death a fear to die is not this vengeance rosaline             20 a loneliness that is not lone a love quite withered up and gone a strong soul ousted from its throne what wouldst thou further rosaline  tis drear such moonless nights as these strange sounds are out upon the breeze and the leaves shiver in the trees and then thou comest rosaline i seem to hear the mourners go with long black garments trailing slow     30 and plumes anodding to and fro as once i heard them rosaline  thy shroud is all of snowy white and in the middle of the night thou standest moveless and upright gazing upon me rosaline there is no sorrow in thine eyes but evermore that meek surprise o god thy gentle spirit tries to deem me guiltless rosaline             40  above thy grave the robin sings and swarms of bright and happy things flit all about with sunlit wings but i am cheerless rosaline the violets in the hillock toss the gravestone is oergrown with moss for nature feels not any loss but i am cheerless rosaline  i did not know when thou wast dead a blackbird whistling overhead             50 thrilled through my brain i would have fled but dared not leave thee rosaline the sun rolled down and very soon like a great fire the awful moon rose stained with blood and then a swoon crept chilly oer me rosaline  the stars came out and one by one each angel from his silver throne looked down and saw what i had done i dared not hide me rosaline            60 i crouched i feared thy corpse would cry against me to gods silent sky i thought i saw the blue lips try to utter something rosaline  i waited with a maddened grin to hear that voice all icy thin slide forth and tell my deadly sin to hell and heaven rosaline but no voice came and then it seemed that if the very corpse had screamed     70 the sound like sunshine glad had streamed through that dark stillness rosaline  and then amid the silent night i screamed with horrible delight and in my brain an awful light did seem to crackle rosaline it is my curse sweet memories fall from me like snow and only all of that one night like cold worms crawl my doomed heart over rosaline           80  why wilt thou haunt me with thine eyes wherein such blessed memories such pitying forgiveness lies than hate more bitter rosaline woes me i know that love so high as thine true soul could never die and with mean clay in churchyard lie would it might be so rosaline    a requiem  ay pale and silent maiden   cold as thou liest there thine was the sunniest nature   that ever drew the air the wildest and most wayward   and yet so gently kind thou seemedst but to body   a breath of summer wind  into the eternal shadow   that girds our life around into the infinite silence   wherewith deaths shore is bound thou hast gone forth beloved   and i were mean to weep that thou hast left lifes shallows   and dost possess the deep  thou liest low and silent   thy heart is cold and still thine eyes are shut forever   and death hath had his will he loved and would have taken   i loved and would have kept we stroveand he was stronger   and i have never wept  let him possess thy body   thy soul is still with me more sunny and more gladsome   than it was wont to be thy body was a fetter   that bound me to the flesh thank god that it is broken   and now i live afresh  now i can see thee clearly   the dusky cloud of clay that hid thy starry spirit   is rent and blown away to earth i give thy body   thy spirit to the sky i saw its bright wings growing   and knew that thou must fly  now i can love thee truly   for nothing comes between the senses and the spirit   the seen and the unseen lifts the eternal shadow   the silence bursts apart and the souls boundless future   is present in my heart    a parable  worn and footsore was the prophet   when he gained the holy hill god has left the earth he murmured here his presence lingers still  god of all the olden prophets   wilt thou speak with men no more have i not as truly served thee   as thy chosen ones of yore  hear me guider of my fathers   lo a humble heart is mine by thy mercy i beseech thee   grant thy servant but a sign  bowing then his head he listened   for an answer to his prayer no loud burst of thunder followed   not a murmur stirred the air  but the tuft of moss before him   opened while he waited yet and from out the rocks hard bosom   sprang a tender violet  god i thank thee said the prophet   hard of heart and blind was i looking to the holy mountain   for the gift of prophecy  still thou speakest with thy children   freely as in eld sublime humbleness and love and patience   still give empire over time  had i trusted in my nature   and had faith in lowly things thou thyself wouldst then have sought me   and set free my spirits wings  but i looked for signs and wonders   that oer men should give me sway thirsting to be more than mortal   i was even less than clay  ere i entered on my journey   as i girt my loins to start ran to me my little daughter   the beloved of my heart  in her hand she held a flower   like to this as like may be which beside my very threshold   she had plucked and brought to me    song  o moonlight deep and tender   a year and more agone your mist of golden splendor   round my betrothal shone  o elmleaves dark and dewy   the very same ye seem the low wind trembles through ye   ye murmur in my dream  o river dim with distance   flow thus forever by a part of my existence   within your heart doth lie  o stars ye saw our meeting   two beings and one soul two hearts so madly beating   to mingle and be whole  o happy night deliver   her kisses back to me or keep them all and give her   a blisslul dream of me     sonnets   i  to acl  through suffering and sorrow thou hast passed to show us what a woman true may be they have not taken sympathy from thee nor made thee any other than thou wast save as some tree which in a sudden blast sheddeth those blossoms that are weakly grown upon the air but keepeth every one whose strength gives warrant of good fruit at last so thou hast shed some blooms of gayety but never one of steadfast cheerfulness nor hath thy knowledge of adversity robbed thee of any faith in happiness but rather cleared thine inner eyes to see how many simple ways there are to bless   ii  what were i love if i were stripped of thee if thine eyes shut me out whereby i live thou who unto my calmer soul dost give knowledge and truth and holy mystery wherein truth mainly lies for those who see beyond the earthly and the fugitive who in the grandeur of the soul believe and only in the infinite are free without thee i were naked bleak and bare as yon dead cedar on the seacliffs brow and natures teachings which come to me now common and beautiful as light and air would be as fruitless as a stream which still slips through the wheel of some old ruined mill   iii  i would not have this perfect love of ours grow from a single root a single stem bearing no goodly fruit but only flowers that idly hide lifes iron diadem it should grow alway like that eastern tree whose limbs take root and spread forth constantly that love for one from which there doth not spring wide love for all is but a worthless thing not in another world as poets prate dwell we apart above the tide of things high floating oer earths clouds on faery wings but our pure love doth ever elevate into a holy bond of brotherhood all earthly things making them pure and good   iv  for this true nobleness i seek in vain in woman and in man i find it not i almost weary of my earthly lot my lifesprings are dried up with burning pain thou findst it not i pray thee look again look inward through the depths of thine own soul how is it with thee art thou sound and whole doth narrow search show thee no earthly stain be noble and the nobleness that lies in other men sleeping but never dead will rise in majesty to meet thine own then wilt thou see it gleam in many eyes then will pure light around thy path be shed and thou wilt nevermore be sad and lone   v  to the spirit of keats  great soul thou sittest with me in my room uplifting me with thy vast quiet eyes on whose full orbs with kindly lustre lies the twilight warmth of ruddy embergloom thy clear strong tones will oft bring sudden bloom of hope secure to him who lonely cries wrestling with the young poets agonies neglect and scorn which seem a certain doom yes the few words which like great thunderdrops thy large heart down to earth shook doubtfully thrilled by the inward lightning of its might serene and pure like gushing joy of light shall track the eternal chords of destiny after the moonled pulse of ocean stops   vi  great truths are portions of the soul of man great souls are portions of eternity each drop of blood that eer through true heart ran with lofty message ran for thee and me for gods law since the starry song began hath been and still forevermore must be that every deed which shall outlast times span must spur the soul to be erect and free slave is no word of deathless lineage sprung too many noble souls have thought and died too many mighty poets lived and sung and our good saxon from lips purified with martyrfire throughout the world hath rung too long to have gods holy cause denied   vii  i ask not for those thoughts that sudden leap from beings sea like the isleseeming kraken with whose great rise the ocean all is shaken and a hearttremble quivers through the deep give me that growth which some perchance deem sleep wherewith the steadfast coralstems uprise which by the toil of gathering energies their upward way into clear sunshine keep until by heavens sweetest influences slowly and slowly spreads a speck of green into a pleasant island in the seas where mid fall palms the caneroofed home is seen and wearied men shall sit at sunsets hour hearing the leaves and loving gods dear power   viii  to mw on her birthday  maiden when such a soul as thine is born the morningstars their ancient music make and joyful once again their song awake long silent now with melancholy scorn and thou not mindless of so blest a morn by no least deed its harmony shalt break but shalt to that high chime thy footsteps take through lifes most darksome passes unforlorn therefore from thy pure faith thou shalt not fall therefore shalt thou be ever fair and free and in thine every motion musical as summer air majestic as the sea a mystery to those who creep and crawl through time and part it from eternity   ix  my love i have no fear that thou shouldst die albeit i ask no fairer life than this whose numberingclock is still thy gentle kiss while time and peace with hands enlockèd fly yet care i not where in eternity we live and love well knowing that there is no backward step for those who feel the bliss of faith as their most lofty yearnings high love hath so purified my beings core meseems i scarcely should be startled even to find some morn that thou hadst gone before since with thy love this knowledge too was given which each calm day doth strengthen more and more that they who love are but one step from heaven   x  i cannot think that thou shouldst pass away whose life to mine is an eternal law a piece of nature that can have no flaw a new and certain sunrise every day but if thou art to be another ray about the sun of life and art to live free from what part of thee was fugitive the debt of love i will more fully pay not downcast with the thought of thee so high but rather raised to be a nobler man and more divine in my humanity as knowing that the waiting eyes which scan my life are lighted by a purer being and ask high calmbrowed deeds with it agreeing   xi  there never yet was flower fair in vain let classic poets rhyme it as they will the seasons toil that it may blow again and summers heart doth feel its every ill nor is a true soul ever born for naught wherever any such hath lived and died there hath been something for true freedom wrought some bulwark levelled on the evil side toil on then greatness thou art in the right however narrow souls may call thee wrong be as thou wouldst be in thine own clear sight and so thou shalt be in the worlds erelong for worldlings cannot struggle as they may from mans great soul one great thought hide away   xii  sub pondere crescit  the hope of truth grows stronger day by day i hear the soul of man around me waking like a great sea its frozen fetters breaking and flinging up to heaven its sunlit spray tossing huge continents in scornful play and crushing them with din of grinding thunder that makes old emptinesses stare in wonder the memory of a glory passed away lingers in every heart as in the shell resounds the bygone freedom of the sea and every hour new signs of promise tell that the great soul shall once again be free for high and yet more high the murmurs swell of inward strife for truth and liberty   xiii  beloved in the noisy city here the thought of thee can make all turmoil cease around my spirit folds thy spirit clear its still soft arms and circles it with peace there is no room for any doubt or fear in souls so overfilled with loves increase there is no memory of the bygone year but growth in hearts and spirits perfect ease how hath our love half nebulous at first rounded itself into a fullorbed sun how have our lives and wills as haply erst they were ere this forgetfulness begun through all their earthly distances outburst and melted like two rays of light in one   xiv  on reading wordsworths sonnets in defence of capital punishment  as the broad ocean endlessly upheaveth with the majestic beating of his heart the mighty tides whereof its rightful part each seawide bay and little weed receiveth so through his soul who earnestly believeth life from the universal heart doth flow whereby some conquest of the eternal woe by instinct of gods nature he achieveth a fuller pulse of this allpowerful beauty into the poets gulflike heart doth tide and he more keenly feels the glorious duty of serving truth despised and crucified happy unknowing sect or creed to rest and feel god flow forever through his breast   xv  the same continued  once hardly in a cycle blossometh a flowerlike soul ripe with the seeds of song a spirit foreordained to cope with wrong whose divine thoughts are natural as breath who the old darkness thickly scattereth with starry words that shoot prevailing light into the deeps and wither with the blight of serene truth the coward heart of death woe if such spirit thwart its errand high and mock with lies the longing soul of man yet one age longer must true culture lie soothing her bitter fetters as she can until new messages of love outstart at the next beating of the infinite heart   xvi  the same continued  the love of all things springs from love of one wider the souls horizon hourly grows and over it with fuller glory flows the skylike spirit of god a hope begun in doubt and darkness neath a fairer sun cometh to fruitage if it be of truth and to the law of meekness faith and ruth by inward sympathy shall all be won this thou shouldst know who from the painted feature of shifting fashion couldst thy brethren turn unto the love of everyouthful nature and of a beauty fadeless and eterne and always tis the saddest sight to see an old man faithless in humanity   xvii  the same continued  a poet cannot strive for despotism his harp falls shattered for it still must be the instinct of great spirits to be free and the sworn foes of cunning barbarism he who has deepest searched the wide abysm of that lifegiving soul which men call fate knows that to put more faith in lies and hate than truth and love is the true atheism upward the soul forever turns her eyes the next hour always shames the hour before one beauty at its highest prophesies that by whose side it shall seem mean and poor no godlike thing knows aught of less and less but widens to the boundless perfectness   xviii  the same continued  therefore think not the past is wise alone for yesterday knows nothing of the best and thou shalt love it only as the nest whence glorywingèd things to heaven have flown to the great soul only are all things known present and future are to her as past while she in glorious madness doth forecast that perfect bud which seems a flower fullblown to each new prophet and yet always opes fuller and fuller with each day and hour heartening the soul with odor of fresh hopes and longings high and gushings of wide power yet never is or shall be fully blown save in the forethought of the eternal one   xix  the same concluded  far yond this narrow parapet of time with eyes uplift the poets soul should look into the endless promise nor should brook one prying doubt to shake his faith sublime to him the earth is ever in her prime and dewiness of morning he can see good lying hid from all eternity within the teeming womb of sin and crime his soul should not be cramped by any bar his nobleness should be so godlike high that his least deed is perfect as a star his common look majestic as the sky and all oerflooded with a light from far undimmed by clouds of weak mortality   xx  to mos  mary since first i knew thee to this hour my love hath

know that in the early spring when wild march winds upon their errands sing thou wouldst return bursting on this still air like those same winds when startled from their lair they hunt up violets and free swift brooks from icy cares even as thy clear looks bid my heart bloom and sing and break all care when drops with welcome rain the april day my flowers shall find their april in thine eyes save there the rain in dreamy clouds doth stay as loath to fall out of those happy skies yet sure my love thou art most like to may that comes with steady sun when april dies   xxiii  wendell phillips  he stood upon the worlds broad threshold wide the din of tattle and of slaughter rose he saw god stand upon the weaker side that sank in seeming loss before its foes many there were who made great haste and sold unto the cunning enemy their swords he scorned their gifts of fame and power and gold and underneath their soft and flowery words heard the cold serpent hiss therefore he went and humbly joined him to the weaker part fanatic named and fool yet well content so he could he the nearer to gods heart and feel its solemn pulses sending blood through all the widespread veins of endless good   xxiv  the street  they pass me by like shadows crowds on crowds dim ghosts of men that hover to and fro hugging their bodies round them like thin shrouds wherein their souls were buried long ago they

experience young buds plucked hastily by childish hands not patient to await more fullblown flowers at least it hath seen more of life and men and pondered more and grown a shade more sad yet with no loss of hope or settled trust in the benignness of that providence           10 which shapes from out our elements awry the grace and order that we wonder at the mystic harmony of right and wrong both

song with its huge rivers and skypiercing peaks its sealike lakes and mighty cataracts      20 its forests vast and hoar and prairies wide and mounds that tell of wondrous tribes extinct but poesy springs not from rocks and woods her womb and cradle are the human heart and she can find a nobler theme for song in the most loathsome man that blasts the sight than in the broad expanse of sea and

from sestos to the other shore the moon looks down and ocean worships her stars rise and set and seasons come and go even as they did in homers elder time but we behold them not with grecian eyes then

make the shows of outward nature be they neer so grand seem small and worthless and contemptible these are the mountainsummits for our bards which stretch far upward into heaven itself and give such widespread and exulting view of hope and faith and onward destiny that shrunk parnassus to a molehill dwindles our new atlantis like a morningstar silvers the mirk face of slowyielding night     70

our gushing songs befit the dawn and sunrise and the yet unshaken dew      90 brimming the chalice of each fullblown hope whose blithe front turns to greet the growing day never had poets such high

loyalty to that alone can claim the wreath of patriotism    beloved if i wander far and oft from that which i believe and feel and know thou wilt forgive not with a sorrowing heart      130 but with a strengthened hope of better things knowing that i though often blind and false to those i love and oh more false than all unto myself have been most true to thee and that whoso in one thing hath been true can be as true in all therefore thy hope may yet not prove unfruitful and thy love meet day by day with less unworthy thanks whether as now we journey hand in hand or parted in the body yet are one               140 in spirit and the love of holy things     miscellaneous poems   a legend of brittany  part first   i  fair as a summer dream was margaret   such dream as in a poets soul might start musing of old loves while the moon doth set   her hair was not more sunny than her heart though like a natural golden coronet   it circled her dear head with careless art mocking the sunshine that would fain have lent to its frank grace a richer ornament   ii  his loved ones eyes could poet ever speak   so kind so dewy and so deep were hers      10 but while he strives the choicest phrase too weak   their glad reflection in his spirit blurs as one may see a dream dissolve and break   out of his grasp when he to tell it stirs like that sad dryad doomed no more to bless the mortal who revealed her loveliness   iii  she dwelt forever in a region bright   peopled with living fancies of her own where naught could come but visions of delight   far far aloof from earths eternal moan      20 a summer cloud thrilled through with rosy light   floating beneath the blue sky all alone her spirit wandered by itself and won a golden edge from some unsetting sun   iv  the heart grows richer that its lot is poor   god blesses want with larger sympathies love enters gladliest at the humble door   and makes the cot a palace with his eyes so margarets heart a softer beauty wore   and grew in gentleness and patience wise      30 for she was but a simple herdsmans child a lily chancesown in the rugged wild   v  there was no beauty of the wood or field   but she its fragrant bosomsecret knew nor any but to her would freely yield   some grace that in her soul took root and grew nature to her shone as but now revealed   all rosyfresh with innocent morning dew and looked into her heart with dim sweet eyes that left it full of sylvan memories      40   vi  oh what a face was hers to brighten light   and give back sunshine with an added glow to wile each moment with a fresh delight   and part of memorys best contentment grow oh how her voice as with an inmates right   into the strangest heart would welcome go and make it sweet and ready to become of white and gracious thoughts the chosen home   vii  none looked upon her but he straightway thought   of all the greenest depths of country cheer      50 and into each ones heart was freshly brought   what was to him the sweetest time of year so was her every look and motion fraught   with outofdoor delights and forest lere not the first violet on a woodland lea seemed a more visible gift of spring than she   viii  is love learned only out of poets books   is there not somewhat in the dropping flood and in the nunneries of silent nooks   and in the murmured longing of the wood      60 that could make margaret dream of lovelorn looks   and stir a thrilling mystery in her blood more trembly secret than auroras tear shed in the bosom of an eglatere   ix  full many a sweet forewarning hath the mind   full many a whispering of vague desire ere comes the nature destined to unbind   its virgin zone and all its deeps inspire     70 low stirrings in the leaves before the wind   wake all the green strings of the forest lyre faint heatings in the calyx ere the rose its warm voluptuous breast doth all unclose   x  long in its dim recesses pines the spirit   wildered and dark despairingly alone though many a shape of beauty wander near it   and many a wild and halfremembered tone tremble from the divine abyss to cheer it   yet still it knows that there is only one before whom it can kneel and tribute bring at once a happy vassal and a king      80   xi  to feel a want yet scarce know what it is   to seek one nature that is always new whose glance is warmer than anothers kiss   whom we can bare our inmost beauty to nor feel deserted afterwardsfor this   but with our destined comate we can do such longing instinct fills the mighty scope of the young soul with one mysterious hope   xii  so margarets heart grew brimming with the lore   of loves enticing secrets and although       90 she had found none to cast it down before   yet oft to fancys chapel she would go to pay her vowsand count the rosary oer   of her loves promised graceshaply so mirandas hope had pictured ferdinand long ere the gaunt wave tossed him on the strand   xiii  a newmade star that swims the lonely gloom   unwedded yet and longing for the sun whose beams the bridegifts of the lavish groom   blithely to crown the virgin planet run      100 her being was watching to see the bloom   of loves fresh sunrise roofing one by one its clouds with gold a triumpharch to be for him who came to hold her heart in fee   xiv  not far from margarets cottage dwelt a knight   of the proud templars a sworn celibate whose heart in secret fed upon the light   and dew of her ripe beauty through the grate of his close vow catching what gleams he might   of the free heaven and cursing all too late      110 the cruel faith whose black walls hemmed him in and turned lifes crowning bliss to deadly sin   xv  for he had met her in the wood by chance   and having drunk her beautys wildering spell his heart shook like the pennon of a lance   that quivers in a breezes sudden swell and thenceforth in a closeinfolded trance   from mistily golden deep to deep he fell till earth did waver and fade far away beneath the hope in whose warm arms he lay      120   xvi  a dark proud man he was whose halfblown youth   had shed its blossoms even in opening leaving a few that with more winning ruth   trembling around grave manhoods stem might cling more sad than cheery making in good sooth   like the fringed gentian a late autumn spring a twilight nature braided light and gloom a youth halfsmiling by an open tomb   xvii  fair as an angel who yet inly wore   a wrinkled heart foreboding his near fall       130 who saw him alway wished to know him more   as if he were some fates defiant thrall and nursed a dreaded secret at his core   little he loved but power the most of all and that he seemed to scorn as one who knew by what foul paths men choose to crawl thereto   xviii  he had been noble but some great deceit   had turned his better instinct to a vice he strove to think the world was all a cheat   that power and fame were cheap at any price       140 that the sure way of being shortly great   was even to play lifes game with loaded dice since he had tried the honest play and found that vice and virtue differed but in sound   xix  yet margarets sight redeemed him for a space   from his own thraldom man could never be a hypocrite when first such maiden grace   smiled in upon his heart the agony of wearing all day long a lying face   fell lightly from him and a moment free      150 erect with wakened faith his spirit stood and scorned the weakness of his demonmood   xx  like a sweet windharp to him was her thought   which would not let the common air come near till from its dim enchantment it had caught   a musical tenderness that brimmed his ear with sweetness more ethereal than aught   save silverdropping snatches that whilere rained down from some sad angels faithful harp to cool her fallen lovers anguish sharp      160   xxi  deep in the forest was a little dell   high overarchèd with the leafy sweep of a broad oak through whose gnarled roots there fell   a slender rill that sung itself to sleep where its continuous toil had scooped a well   to please the fairy folk breathlessly deep the stillness was save when the dreaming brook from its small urn a drizzly murmur shook   xxii  the wooded hills sloped upward all around   with gradual rise and made an even rim      170 so that it seemed a mighty casque unbound   from some huge titans brow to lighten him ages ago and left upon the ground   where the slow soil had mossed it to the brim till after countless centuries it grew into this dell the haunt of noontide dew   xxiii  dim vistas sprinkled oer with sunflecked green   wound through the thickset trunks on every side and toward the west in fancy might be seen   a gothic window in its blazing pride      180 when the low sun two arching elms between   lit up the leaves beyond which autumndyed with lavish hues would into splendor start shaming the labored panes of richest art   xxiv  here leaning once against the old oaks trunk   mordred for such was the young templars name saw margaret come unseen the falcon shrunk   from the meek dove sharp thrills of tingling flame made him forget that he was vowed a monk   and all the outworks of his pride oercame      190 flooded he seemed with bright delicious pain as if a star had burst within his brain   xxv  such power hath beauty and frank innocence   a flower bloomed forth that sunshine glad to bless even from his loves long leafless stem the sense   of exile from hopes happy realm grew less and thoughts of childish peace he knew not whence   thronged round his heart with many an old caress melting the frost there into pearly dew that mirrored back his natures morningblue      200   xxvi  she turned and saw him but she felt no dread   her purity like adamantine mail did so encircle her and yet her head   she drooped and made her golden hair her veil through which a glow of rosiest lustre spread   then faded and anon she stood all pale as snow oer which a blush of northern light suddenly reddens and as soon grows white   xxvii  she thought of tristrem and of lancilot   of all her dreams and of kind fairies might      210 and how that dell was deemed a haunted spot   until there grew a mist before her sight and where the present was she half forgot   borne backward through the realms of old delight then starting up awake she would have gone yet almost wished it might not be alone   xxviii  how they went home together through the wood   and how all life seemed focussed into one thoughtdazzling spot that set ablaze the blood   what need to tell fit language there is none      220 for the hearts deepest things who ever wooed   as in his boyish hope he would have done for when the soul is fullest the hushed tongue voicelessly trembles like a lute unstrung   xxix  but all things carry the hearts messages   and know it not nor doth the heart well know but nature hath her will even as the bees   blithe gobetweens fly singing to and fro with the fruitquickening pollenhard if these   found not some all unthoughtof way to show      230 their secret each to each and so they did and one hearts flowerdust into the other slid   xxx  young hearts are free the selfish world it is   that turns them miserly and cold as stone and makes them clutch their fingers on the bliss   which but in giving truly is their own she had no dreams of barter asked not his   but gave hers freely as she would have thrown a rose to him or as that rose gives forth its generous fragrance thoughtless of its worth      240   xxxi  her summer nature felt a need to bless   and a like longing to be blest again so from her skylike spirit gentleness   dropt ever like a sunlit fall of rain and his beneath drank in the bright caress   as thirstily as would a parched plain that long hath watched the showers of sloping gray for ever ever falling far away   xxxii  how should she dream of ill the heart filled quite   with sunshine like the shepherdsclock at noon      250 closes its leaves around its warm delight   whateer in life is harsh or out of tune is all shut out no boding shade of blight   can pierce the opiate ether of its swoon love is but blind as thoughtful justice is but naught can be so wantonblind as bliss   xxxiii  all beauty and all life he was to her   she questioned not his love she only knew that she loved him and not a pulse could stir   in her whole frame but quivered through and through      260 with this glad thought and was a minister   to do him fealty and service true like golden ripples hasting to the land to wreck their freight of sunshine on the strand   xxxiv  o dewy dawn of love that are   hung high like the cliffswallows perilous nest most like to fall when fullest and that jar   with every heavier billow o unrest than balmiest deeps of quiet sweeter far   how did ye triumph now in margarets breast      270 making it readier to shrink and start than quivering gold of the pondlilys heart   xxxv  here let us pause oh would the soul might ever   achieve its immortality in youth when nothing yet hath damped its high endeavor   after the starry energy of truth here let us pause and for a moment sever   this gleam of sunshine from the sad unruth that sometime comes to all for it is good to lengthen to the last a sunny mood      280    part second   i  as one who from the sunshine and the green   enters the solid darkness of a cave nor knows what precipice or pit unseen   may yawn before him with its sudden grave and with hushed breath doth often forward lean   dreaming he hears the plashing of a wave dimly below or feels a damper air from out some dreary chasm he knows not where   ii  so from the sunshine and the green of love   we enter on our storys darker part      290 and though the horror of it well may move   an impulse of repugnance in the heart yet let us think that as theres naught above   the allembracing atmosphere of art so also there is naught that falls below her generous reach though grimed with guilt and woe   iii  her fittest triumph is to show that good   lurks in the heart of evil evermore that love though scorned and outcast and withstood   can without end forgive and yet have store      300 gods love and mans are of the selfsame blood   and he can see that always at the door of foulest hearts the angelnature yet knocks to return and cancel all its debt   iv  it ever is weak falsehoods destiny   that her thick mask turns crystal to let through the unsuspicious eyes of honesty   but margarets heart was too sincere and true aught but plain truth and faithfulness to see   and mordreds for a time a little grew      310 to be like hers won by the mild reproof of those kind eyes that kept all doubt aloof   v  full oft they met as dawn and twilight meet   in northern climes she full of growing day as he of darkness which before her feet   shrank gradual and faded quite away soon to return for power had made love sweet   to him and when his will had gained full sway the taste began to pall for never power can sate the hungry soul beyond an hour      320   vi  he fell as doth the tempter ever fall   even in the gaining of his loathsome end god doth not work as man works but makes all   the crooked paths of ill to goodness tend let him judge margaret if to be the thrall   of love and faith too generous to defend its very life from him she loved be sin what hope of grace may the seducer win   vii  grimhearted world that lookst with levite eyes   on those poor fallen by too much faith in man      330 she that upon thy freezing threshold lies   starved to more sinning by thy savage ban seeking that refuge because foulest vice   more godlike than thy virtue is whose span shuts out the wretched only is more free to enter heaven than thou shalt ever be   viii  thou wilt not let her wash thy dainty feet   with such salt things as tears or with rude hair dry them soft pharisee that sitst at meat   with him who made her such and speakst him fair      340 leaving gods wandering lamb the while to bleat   unheeded shivering in the pitiless air thou hast made prisoned virtue show more wan and haggard than a vice to look upon   ix  now many months flew by and weary grew   to margaret the sight of happy things blight fell on all her flowers instead of dew   shut round her heart were now the joyous wings wherewith it wont to soar yet not untrue   though tempted much her womans nature clings      350 to its first pure belief and with sad eyes looks backward oer the gate of paradise   x  and so though altered mordred came less oft   and winter frowned where spring had laughed before in his strange eyes yet half her sadness doffed   and in her silent patience loved him more sorrow had made her soft heart yet more soft   and a new life within her own she bore which made her tenderer as she felt it move beneath her breast a refuge for her love      360   xi  this babe she thought would surely bring him back   and be a bond forever them between before its eyes the sullen tempestrack   would fade and leave the face of heaven serene and loves return doth more than fill the lack   which in his absence withered the hearts green and yet a dim foreboding still would flit between her and her hope to darken it   xii  she could not figure forth a happy fate   even for this life from heaven so newly come      370 the earth must needs be doubly desolate   to him scarce parted from a fairer home such boding heavier on her bosom sate   one night as standing in the twilight gloam she strained her eyes beyond that dizzy verge at whose foot faintly breaks the futures surge   xiii  poor little spirit naught but shame and woe   nurse the sick heart whose lifeblood nurses thine yet not those only love hath triumphed so   as for thy sake makes sorrow more divine      380 and yet though thou be pure the world is foe   to purity if born in such a shrine and having trampled it for struggling thence smiles to itself and calls it providence   xiv  as thus she mused a shadow seemed to rise   from out her thought and turn to dreariness all blissful hopes and sunny memories   and the quick blood would curdle up and press about her heart which seemed to shut its eyes   and hush itself as who with shuddering guess      390 harks through the gloom and dreads een now to feel through his hot breast the icy slide of steel   xv  but at that heartbeat while in dread she was   in the low wind the honeysuckles gleam a dewy thrill flits through the heavy grass   and looking forth she saw as in a dream within the wood the moonlights shadowy mass   nights starry heart yearning to hers doth seem and the deep sky fullhearted with the moon folds round her all the happiness of june      400   xvi  what fear could face a heaven and earth like this   what silveriest cloud could hang neath such a sky a tide of wondrous and unwonted bliss   rolls back through all her pulses suddenly as if some seraph who had learned to kiss   from the fair daughters of the world gone by had wedded so his fallen light with hers such sweet strange joy through soul and body stirs   xvii  now seek we mordred he who did not fear   the crime yet fears the latent consequence      410 if it should reach a brother templars ear   it haply might be made a good pretence to cheat him of the hope he held most dear   for he had spared no thoughts or deeds expense that by and by might help his wish to clip its darling bridethe high grandmastership   xviii  the apathy ere a crime resolved is done   is scarce less dreadful than remorse for crime by no allurement can the soul be won   from brooding oer the weary creep of time      420 mordred stole forth into the happy sun   striving to hum a scrap of breton rhyme but the sky struck him speechless and he tried in vain to summon up his callous pride   xix  in the courtyard a fountain leaped alway   a triton blowing jewels through his shell into the sunshine mordred turned away   weary because the stone face did not tell of weariness nor could he bear today   heartsick to hear the patient sink and swell      430 of winds among the leaves or golden bees drowsily humming in the orangetrees   xx  all happy sights and sounds now came to him   like a reproach he wandered far and wide following the lead of his unquiet whim   but still there went a something at his side that made the cool breeze hot the sunshine dim   it would not flee it could not be defied he could not see it but he felt it there by the damp chill that crept among his hair      440   xxi  day wore at last the eveningstar arose   and throbbing in the sky grew red and set then with a guilty wavering step he goes   to the hid nook where they so oft had met in happier season for his heart well knows   that he is sure to find poor margaret watching and waiting there with lovelorn breast around her young dreams rudely scattered nest   xxii  why follow here that grim old chronicle   which counts the daggerstrokes and drops of blood      450 enough that margaret by his mad steel fell   unmoved by murder from her trusting mood smiling on him as heaven smiles on hell   with a sad love remembering when he stood not fallen yet the unsealer of her heart of all her holy dreams the holiest part   xxiii  his crime complete scarce knowing what he did   so goes the tale beneath the altar there in the high church the stiffening corpse he hid   and then to scape that suffocating air      460 like a scared ghoul out of the porch he slid   but his strained eyes saw bloodspots everywhere and ghastly faces thrust themselves between his soul and hopes of peace with blasting mien   xxiv  his heart went out within him like a spark   dropt in the sea wherever he made bold to turn his eyes he saw all stiff and stark   pale margaret lying dead the lavish gold of her loose hair seemed in the cloudy dark   to spread a glory and a thousandfold      470 more strangely pale and beautiful she grew her silence stabbed his conscience through and through   xxv  or visions of past daysa mothers eyes   that smiled down on the fair boy at her knee whose happy upturned face to hers replies   he saw sometimes or margaret mournfully gazed on him full of doubt as one who tries   to crush belief that does love injury then she would wring her hands but soon again loves patience glimmered out through cloudy pain      480   xxvi  meanwhile he dared not go and steal away   the silent deadcold witness of his sin he had not feared the life but that dull clay   those open eyes that showed the death within would surely stare him mad yet all the day   a dreadful impulse whence his will could win no refuge made him linger in the aisle freezing with his wan look each greeting smile   xxvii  now on the second day there was to be   a festival in church from far and near      490 came flocking in the sunburnt peasantry   and knights and dames with stately antique cheer blazing with pomp as if all faerie   had emptied her quaint halls or as it were the illuminated marge of some old book while we were gazing life and motion took   xxviii  when all were entered and the roving eyes   of all were stayed some upon faces bright some on the priests some on the traceries   that decked the slumber of a marble knight      500 and all the rustlings over that arise   from recognizing tokens of delight when friendly glances meetthen silent ease spread oer the multitude by slow degrees   xxix  then swelled the organ up through choir and nave   the music trembled with an inward thrill of bliss at its own grandeur wave on wave   its flood of mellow thunder rose until the hushed air shivered with the throb it gave   then poising for a moment it stood still      510 and sank and rose again to burst in spray that wandered into silence far away   xxx  like to a mighty heart the music seemed   that yearns with melodies it cannot speak until in grand despair of what it dreamed   in the agony of effort it doth break yet triumphs breaking on it rushed and streamed   and wantoned in its might as when a lake long pent among the mountains bursts its walls and in one crowding gash leaps forth and falls      520   xxxi  deeper and deeper shudders shook the air   as the huge bass kept gathering heavily like thunder when it rouses in its lair   and with its hoarse growl shakes the lowhung sky it grew up like a darkness everywhere   filling the vast cathedralsuddenly from the dense mass a boys clear treble broke like lightning and the fulltoned choir awoke   xxxii  through gorgeous windows shone the sun aslant   brimming the church with gold and purple mist      530 meet atmosphere to bosom that rich chant   where fifty voices in one strand did twist their varicolored tones and left no want   to the delighted soul which sank abyssed in the warm music cloud while far below the organ heaved its surges to and fro   xxxiii  as if a lark should suddenly drop dead   while the blue air yet trembled with its song so snapped at once that musics golden thread   struck by a nameless fear that leapt along      540 from heart to heart and like a shadow spread   with instantaneous shiver through the throng so that some glanced behind as half aware a hideous shape of dread were standing there   xxxiv  as when a crowd of pale men gather round   watching an eddy in the leaden deep from which they deem the body of one drowned   will be cast forth from face to face doth creep an eager dread that holds all tongues fast bound   until the horror with a ghastly leap      550 starts up its dead blue arms stretched aimlessly heaved with the swinging of the careless sea   xxxv  so in the faces of all these there grew   as by one impulse a dark freezing awe which with a fearful fascination drew   all eyes toward the altar damp and raw the air grew suddenly and no man knew   whether perchance his silent neighbor saw the dreadful thing which all were sure would rise to scare the strained lids wider from their eyes      560   xxxvi  the incense trembled as it upward sent   its slow uncertain thread of wandering blue ast were the only living element   in all the church so deep the stillness grew it seemed one might have heard it as it went   give out an audible rustle curling through the midnight silence of that awestruck air more hushed than death though so much life was there   xxxvii  nothing they saw but a low voice was heard   threading the ominous silence of that fear      570 gentle and terrorless as if a bird   wakened by some volcanos glare should cheer the murk air with his song yet every word   in the cathedrals farthest arch seemed near as if it spoke to every one apart like the clear voice of conscience in each heart   xxxviii  o rest to weary hearts thou art most dear   o silence after lifes bewildering din thou art most welcome whether in the sear   days of our age thou comest or we win      580 thy poppywreath in youth then wherefore here   linger i yet once free to enter in at that wished gate which gentle death doth ope into the boundless realm of strength and hope   xxxix  think not in death my love could ever cease   if thou wast false more need there is for me still to be true that slumber were not peace   ift were unvisited with dreams of thee and thou hadst never heard such words as these   save that in heaven i must forever be      590 most comfortless and wretched seeing this our unbaptized babe shut out from bliss   xl  this little spirit with imploring eyes   wanders alone the dreary wild of space the shadow of his pain forever lies   upon my soul in this new dwellingplace his loneliness makes me in paradise   more lonely and unless i see his face even here for grief could i lie down and die      599 save for my curse of immortality   xli  world after world he sees around him swim   crowded with happy souls that take no heed of the sad eyes that from the nights faint rim   gaze sick with longing on them as they speed with golden gates that only shut on him   and shapes sometimes from hells abysses freed flap darkly by him with enormous sweep of wings that roughen wide the pitchy deep   xlii  i am a motherspirits do not shake   this much of earth from themand i must pine      610 till i can feel his little hands and take   his weary head upon this heart of mine and might it be full gladly for his sake   would i this solitude of bliss resign and be shut out of heaven to dwell with him forever in that silence drear and dim   xliii  i strove to hush my soul and would not speak   at first for thy dear sake a womans love is mighty but a mothers heart is weak   and by its weakness overcomes i strove      620 to smother bitter thoughts with patience meek   but still in the abyss my soul would rove seeking my child and drove me here to claim the rite that gives him peace in christs dear name   xliv  i sit and weep while blessed spirits sing   i can but long and pine the while they praise and leaning oer the wall of heaven i fling   my voice to where i deem my infant strays like a robbed bird that cries in vain to bring   her nestlings back beneath her wings embrace      630 but still he answers not and i but know that heaven and earth are both alike in woe   xlv  then the pale priests with ceremony due   baptized the child within its dreadful tomb beneath that mothers heart whose instinct true   starlike had battled down the triple gloom of sorrow love and death young maidens too   strewed the pale corpse with many a milkwhite bloom and parted the bright hair and on the breast crossed the unconscious hands in sign of rest      640   xlvi  some said that when the priest had sprinkled oer   the consecrated drops they seemed to hear a sigh as of some heart from travail sore   released and then two voices singing clear misereatur deus more and more   fading far upward and their ghastly fear fell from them with that sound as bodies fall from souls upspringing to celestial hall    prometheus    one after one the stars have risen and set sparkling upon the hoarfrost on my chain the bear that prowled all night about the fold of the northstar hath shrunk into his den scared by the blithesome footsteps of the dawn whose blushing smile floods all the orient and now bright lucifer grows less and less into the heavens blue quiet deepwithdrawn sunless and starless all the desert sky arches above me empty as this heart      10 for ages hath been empty of all joy except to brood upon its silent hope as oer its hope of day the sky doth now all night have i heard voices deeper yet the deep low breathing of the silence grew while all about muffled in awe there stood shadows or forms or both clearfelt at heart but when i turned to front them far along only a shudder through the midnight ran and the dense stillness walled me closer round      20 but still i heard them wander up and down that solitude and flappings of dusk wings did mingle with them whether of those hags let slip upon me once from hades deep or of yet direr torments if such be i could but guess and then toward me came a shape as of a woman very pale it was and calm its cold eyes did not move and mine moved not but only stared on them their fixed awe went through my brain like ice      30 a skeleton hand seemed clutching at my heart and a sharp chill as if a dank night fog suddenly closed me in was all i felt and then methought i heard a freezing sigh a long deep shivering sigh as from blue lips stiffening in death close to mine ear i thought some doom was close upon me and i looked and saw the red moon through the heavy mist just setting and it seemed as it were falling or reeling to its fall so dim and dead      40 and palsystruck it looked then all sounds merged into the rising surges of the pines which leagues below me clothing the gaunt loins of ancient caucasus with hairy strength sent up a murmur in the morning wind sad as the wail that from the populous earth all day and night to high olympus soars fit incense to thy wicked throne o jove    thy hated name is tossed once more in scorn from off my lips for i will tell thy doom      50 and are these tears nay do not triumph jove they are wrung from me but by the agonies of prophecy like those sparse drops which fall from clouds in travail of the lightning when the great wave of the storm highcurled and black rolls steadily onward to its thunderous break why art thou made a god of thou poor type of anger and revenge and cunning force true power was never born of brutish strength nor sweet truth suckled at the shaggy dugs      60 of that old shewolf are thy thunderbolts that quell the darkness for a space so strong as the prevailing patience of meek light who with the invincible tenderness of peace wins it to be a portion of herself why art thou made a god of thou who hast the neversleeping terror at thy heart that birthright of all tyrants worse to bear than this thy ravening bird on which i smile thou swearst to free me if i will unfold      70 what kind of doom it is whose omen flits across thy heart as oer a troop of doves the fearful shadow of the kite what need to know that truth whose knowledge cannot save evil its errand hath as well as good when thine is finished thou art known no more there is a higher purity than thou and higher purity is greater strength thy nature is thy doom at which thy heart trembles behind the thick wall of thy might     80 let man but hope and thou art straightway chilled with thought of that drear silence and deep night which like a dream shall swallow thee and thine let man but will and thou art god no more more capable of ruin than the gold and ivory that image thee on earth he who hurled down the monstrous titanbrood blinded with lightnings with rough thunders stunned is weaker than a simple human thought my slender voice can shake thee as the breeze      90 that seems but apt to stir a maidens hair sways huge oceanus from pole to pole for i am still prometheus and foreknow in my wise heart the end and doom of all    yes i am still prometheus wiser grown by years of solitudethat holds apart the past and future giving the soul room to search into itselfand long commune with this eternal silencemore a god in my longsuffering and strength to meet      100 with equal front the direst shafts of fate than thou in thy fainthearted despotism girt with thy babytoys of force and wrath yes i am that prometheus who brought down the light to man which thou in selfish fear hadst to thy self usurpedhis by sole right for man hath right to all save tyranny and which shall free him yet from thy frail throne tyrants are but the spawn of ignorance begotten by the slaves they trample on       110 who could they win a glimmer of the light and see that tyranny is always weakness or fear with its own bosom ill at ease would laugh away in scorn the sandwove chain which their own blindness feigned for adamant wrong ever builds on quicksands but the right to the firm centre lays its moveless base the tyrant trembles if the air but stir the innocent ringlets of a childs free hair and crouches when the thought of some great spirit      120 with worldwide murmur like a rising gale over mens hearts as over standing corn rushes and bends them to its own strong will so shall some thought of mine yet circle earth and puff away thy crumbling altars jove    and wouldst thou know of my supreme revenge poor tyrant even now dethroned in heart realmless in soul as tyrants ever are listen and tell me if this bitter peak this neverglutted vulture and these chains      130 shrink not before it for it shall befit a sorrowtaught unconquered titanheart men when their death is on them seem to stand on a precipitous crag that overhangs the abyss of doom and in that depth to see as in a glass the features dim and vast of things to come the shadows as it seems of what have been death ever fronts the wise not fearfully but with clear promises of larger life on whose broad vans upborne      140 their outlook widens and they see beyond the horizon of the present and the past even to the very source and end of things such am i now immortal woe hath made my heart a seer and my soul a judge between the substance and the shadow of truth the sure supremeness of the beautiful by all the martyrdoms made doubly sure of such as i am this is my revenge which of my wrongs builds a triumphal arch      150 through which i see a sceptre and a throne the pipings of glad shepherds on the hills tending the flocks no more to bleed for thee the songs of maidens pressing with white feet the vintage on thine altars poured no more the murmurous bliss of lovers underneath dim grapevine bowers whose rosy bunches press not half so closely their warm cheeks unpaled by thoughts of thy brute lust the hivelike hum of peaceful commonwealths where sunburnt toil      160 reaps for itself the rich earth made its own by its own labor lightened with glad hymns to an omnipotence which thy mad bolts would cope with as a spark with the vast sea even the spirit of free love and peace dutys sure recompense through life and death these are such harvests as all masterspirits reap haply not on earth but reap no less because the sheaves are bound by hands not theirs these are the bloodless daggers wherewithal      170 they stab fallen tyrants this their high revenge for their best part of life on earth is when long after death prisoned and pent no more their thoughts their wild dreams even have become part of the necessary air men breathe when like the moon herself behind a cloud they shed down light before us on lifes sea that cheers us to steer onward still in hope earth with her twining memories ivies oer their holy sepulchres the chainless sea      180 in tempest or wide calm repeats their thoughts the lightning and the thunder all free things have legends of them for the ears of men all other glories are as falling stars but universal nature watches theirs such strength is won by love of humankind    not that i feel that hunger after fame which souls of a halfgreatness are beset with but that the memory of noble deeds cries shame upon the idle and the vile      190 and keeps the heart of man forever up to the heroic level of old time to be forgot at first is little pain to a heart conscious of such high intent as must be deathless on the lips of men but having been a name to sink and be a something which the world can do without which having been or not would never change the lightest pulse of fatethis is indeed a cup of bitterness the worst to taste      200 and this thy heart shall empty to the dregs endless despair shall be thy caucasus and memory thy vulture thou wilt find oblivion far lonelier than this peak behold thy destiny thou thinkst it much that i should brave thee miserable god but i have braved a mightier than thou even the sharp tempting of this soaring heart which might have made me scarcely less than thou a god among my brethren weak and blind      210 scarce less than thou a pitiable thing to be downtrodden into darkness soon but now i am above thee for thou art the bungling workmanship of fear the block that awes the swart barbarian but i am what myself have madea nature wise with finding in itself the types of all with watching from the dim verge of the time what things to be are visible in the gleams thrown forward on them from the luminous past     220 wise with the history of its own frail heart with reverence and with sorrow and with love broad as the world for freedom and for man    thou and all strength shall crumble except love by whom and for whose glory ye shall cease and when thourt but a weary moaning heard from out the pitiless gloom of chaos i shall be a power and a memory a name to fright all tyrants with a light unsetting as the polestar a great voice     230 heard in the breathless pauses of the fight by truth and freedom ever waged with wrong clear as a silver trumpet to awake far echoes that from age to age live on in kindred spirits giving them a sense of boundless power from boundless suffering wrung and many a glazing eye shall smile to see the memory of my triumph for to meet wrong with endurance and to overcome the present with a heart that looks beyond     240 are triumph like a prophet eagle perch upon the sacred banner of the right evil springs up and flowers and bears no seed and feeds the green earth with its swift decay leaving it richer for the growth of truth but good once put in action or in thought like a strong oak doth from its boughs shed down the ripe germs of a forest thou weak god shalt fade and be forgotten but this soul freshliving still in the serene abyss     250 in every heaving shall partake that grows from heart to heart among the sons of men as the ominous hum before the earthquake runs far through the Ægean from roused isle to isle foreboding wreck to palaces and shrines and mighty rents in many a cavernous error that darkens the free light to manthis heart unscarred by thy grim vulture as the truth grows but more lovely neath the beaks and claws of harpies blind that fain would soil it shall     260 in all the throbbing exultations share that wait on freedoms triumphs and in all the glorious agonies of martyrspirits sharp lightningthroes to split the jagged clouds that veil the future snowing them the end pains thorny crown for constancy and truth girding the temples like a wreath of stars this is a thought that like the fabled laurel makes my faith thunderproof and thy dread bolts fall on me like the silent flakes of snow     270 on the hoar brows of aged caucasus but oh thought far more blissful they can rend this cloud of flesh and make my soul a star    unleash thy crouching thunders now o jove free this high heart which a poor captive long doth knock to be let forth this heart which still in its invincible manhood overtops thy puny godship as this mountain doth the pines that moss its roots oh even now while from my peak of suffering i look down     280 beholding with a farspread gush of hope the sunrise of that beauty in whose face shone all around with love no man shall look but straightway like a god he be uplift unto the throne long empty for his sake and clearly oft foreshadowed in brave dreams by his free inward nature which nor thou nor any anarch after thee can bind from working its great doomnow now set free this essence not to die but to become     290 part of that awful presence which doth haunt the palaces of tyrants to scare off with its grim eyes and fearful whisperings and hideous sense of utter loneliness all hope of safety all desire of peace all but the loathed forefeeling of blank death part of that spirit which doth ever brood in patient calm on the unpilfered nest of mans deep heart till mighty thoughts grow fledged to sail with darkening shadow oer the world     300 filling with dread such souls as dare not trust in the unfailing energy of good until they swoop and their pale quarry make of some oerbloated wrongthat spirit which scatters great hopes in the seedfield of man like acorns among grain to grow and be a roof for freedom in all coming time    but no this cannot be for ages yet in solitude unbroken shall i hear the angry caspian to the euxine shout     310 and euxine answer with a muffled roar on either side storming the giant walls of caucasus with leagues of climbing foam less from my height than flakes of downy snow that draw back baffled but to hurl again snatched up in wrath and horrible turmoil mountain on mountain as the titans erst my brethren scaling the high seat of jove heaved pelion upon ossas shoulders broad in vain emprise the moon will come and go     320 with her monotonous vicissitude once beautiful when i was free to walk among my fellows and to interchange the influence benign of loving eyes but now by aged use grows wearisome false thought most false for how could i endure these crawling centuries of lonely woe unshamed by weak complaining but for thee loneliest save me of all created things mildeyed astarte my best comforter             330 with thy pale smile of sad benignity    year after year will pass away and seem to me in mine eternal agony but as the shadows of dumb summer clouds which i have watched so often darkening oer the vast sarmatian plain leaguewide at first but with still swiftness lessening on and on till cloud and shadow meet and mingle where the gray horizon fades into the sky far far to northward yes for ages yet          340 must i lie here upon my altar huge a sacrifice for man sorrow will be as it hath been his portion endless doom while the immortal with the mortal linked dreams of its wings and pines for what it dreams with upward yearn unceasing better so for wisdom is stern sorrows patient child and empire over self and all the deep strong charities that make men seem like gods and love that makes them be gods from her breasts 350 sucks in the milk that makes mankind one blood good never comes unmixed or so it seems having two faces as some images are carved of foolish gods one face is ill but one heart lies beneath and that is good as are all hearts when we explore their depths therefore great heart bear up thou art but type of what all lofty spirits endure that fain would win men back to strength and peace through love each hath his lonely peak and on each heart       360 envy or scorn or hatred tears lifelong with vulture beak yet the high soul is left and faith which is but hope grown wise and love and patience which at last shall overcome    the shepherd of king admetus  there came a youth upon the earth   some thousand years ago whose slender hands were nothing worth whether to plough or reap or sow  upon an empty tortoiseshell   he stretched some chords and drew music that made mens bosoms swell fearless or brimmed their eyes with dew  then king admetus one who had   pure taste by right divine decreed his singing not too bad to hear between the cups of wine  and so well pleased with being soothed   into a sweet halfsleep three times his kingly beard he smoothed and made him viceroy oer his sheep  his words were simple words enough   and yet he used them so that what in other mouths was rough in his seemed musical and low  men called him but a shiftless youth   in whom no good they saw and yet unwittingly in truth they made his careless words their law  they knew not how he learned at all   for idly hour by hour he sat and watched the dead leaves fall or mused upon a common flower  it seemed the loveliness of things   did teach him all their use for in mere weeds and stones and springs he found a healing power profuse  men granted that his speech was wise   but when a glance they caught of his slim grace and womans eyes they laughed and called him goodfornaught  yet after he was dead and gone   and een his memory dim earth seemed more sweet to live upon more full of love because of him  and day by day more holy grew   each spot where he had trod till afterpoets only knew their firstborn brother as a god    the token  it is a mere wild rosebud   quite sallow now and dry yet theres something wondrous in it   some gleams of days gone by dear sights and sounds that are to me the very moons of memory and stir my hearts blood far below its shortlived waves of joy and woe  lips must fade and roses wither   all sweet times be oer they only smile and murmuring thither   stay with us no more and yet ofttimes a look or smile forgotten in a kisss while years after from the dark will start and flash across the trembling heart  thou hast given me many roses   but never one like this oerfloods both sense and spirit   with such a deep wild bliss we must have instincts that glean up sparse drops of this life in the cup whose taste shall give us all that we can prove of immortality  earths stablest things are shadows   and in the life to come haply some chancesaved trifle   may tell of this old home as now sometimes we seem to find in a dark crevice of the mind some relic which long pondered oer hints faintly at a life before    an incident in a railroad car    he spoke of burns men rude and rough   pressed round to hear the praise of one whose heart was made of manly simple stuff     as homespun as their own    and when he read they forward leaned   drinking with thirsty hearts and ears his brooklike songs whom glory never weaned     from humble smiles and tears    slowly there grew a tender awe   sunlike oer faces brown and hard as if in him who read they felt and saw     some presence of the bard    it was a sight for sin and wrong   and slavish tyranny to see a sight to make our faith more pure and strong     in high humanity    i thought these men will carry hence   promptings their former life above and something of a finer reverence     for beauty truth and love    god scatters love on every side   freely among his children all and always hearts are lying open wide     wherein some grains may fall    there is no wind but soweth seeds   of a more true and open life which burst unlooked for into highsouled deeds     with wayside beauty rife    we find within these souls of ours   some wild germs of a higher birth which in the poets tropic heart bear flowers     whose fragrance fills the earth    within the hearts of all men lie   these promises of wider bliss which blossom into hopes that cannot die     in sunny hours like this    all that hath been majestical   in life or death since time began is native in the simple heart of all     the angel heart of man    and thus among the untaught poor   great deeds and feelings find a home that cast in shadow all the golden lore     of classic greece and rome    o mighty brothersoul of man   whereer thou art in low or high thy skyey arches with exulting span     oerroof infinity    all thoughts that mould the age begin   deep down within the primitive soul and from the many slowly upward win     to one who grasps the whole    in his wide brain the feeling deep   that struggled on the manys tongue swells to a tide of thought whose surges leap     oer the weak thrones of wrong    all thought begins in feelingwide   in the great mass its base is hid and narrowing up to thought stands glorified     a moveless pyramid    nor is he far astray who deems   that every hope which rises and grows broad in the worlds heart by ordered impulse streams     from the great heart of god    god wills man hopes in common souls   hope is but vague and undefined till from the poets tongue the message rolls     a blessing to his kind    never did poesy appear   so full of heaven to me as when i saw how it would pierce through pride and fear     to the lives of coarsest men    it may be glorious to write   thoughts that shall glad the two or three high souls like those far stars that come in sight     once in a century    but better far it is to speak   one simple word which now and then shall waken their free nature in the weak     and friendless sons of men    to write some earnest verse or line   which seeking not the praise of art shall make a clearer faith and manhood shine     in the untutored heart    he who doth this in verse or prose   may be forgotten in his day but surely shall be crowned at last with those     who live and speak for aye    rhoecus  god sends his teachers unto every age to every clime and every race of men with revelations fitted to their growth and shape of mind nor gives the realm of truth into the selfish rule of one sole race therefore each form of worship that hath swayed the life of man and given it to grasp the masterkey of knowledge reverence infolds some germs of goodness and of right else never had the eager soul which loathes     10 the slothful down of pampered ignorance found in it even a moments fitful rest    there is an instinct in the human heart which makes that all the fables it hath coined to justify the reign of its belief and strengthen it by beautys right divine veil in their inner cells a mystic gift which like the hazel twig in faithful hands points surely to the hidden springs of truth for as in nature naught is made in vain           20 but all things have within their hull of use a wisdom and a meaning which may speak of spiritual secrets to the ear of spirit so in whatsoeer the heart hath fashioned for a solace to itself to make its inspirations suit its creed and from the niggard hands of falsehood wring its needful food of truth there ever is a sympathy with nature which reveals not less than her own works pure gleams of light   30 and earnest parables of inward lore hear now this fairy legend of old greece as full of gracious youth and beauty still as the immortal freshness of that grace carved for all ages on some attic frieze    a youth named rhoecus wandering in the wood saw an old oak just trembling to its fall and feeling pity of so fair a tree he propped its gray trunk with admiring care and with a thoughtless footstep loitered on        40 but as he turned he heard a voice behind that murmured rhoecus twas as if the leaves stirred by a passing breath had murmured it and while he paused bewildered yet again it murmured rhoecus softer than a breeze he started and beheld with dizzy eyes what seemed the substance of a happy dream stand there before him spreading a warm glow within the green glooms of the shadowy oak it seemed a womans shape yet far too fair         50 to be a woman and with eyes too meek for any that were wont to mate with gods all naked like a goddess stood she there and like a goddess all too beautiful to feel the guiltborn earthliness of shame rhoecus i am the dryad of this tree thus she began dropping her lowtoned words serene and full and clear as drops of dew and with it i am doomed to live and die the rain and sunshine are my caterers              60 nor have i other bliss than simple life now ask me what thou wilt that i can give and with a thankful joy it shall be thine    then rhoecus with a flutter at the heart yet by the prompting of such beauty bold answered what is there that can satisfy the endless craving of the soul but love give me thy love or but the hope of that which must be evermore my natures goal after a little pause she said again but with a glimpse of sadness in her tone     71 i give it rhoecus though a perilous gift an hour before the sunset meet me here and straightway there was nothing he could see but the green glooms beneath the shadowy oak and not a sound came to his straining ears but the low trickling rustle of the leaves and far away upon an emerald slope the falter of an idle shepherds pipe    now in those days of simpleness and faith 80 men did not think that happy things were dreams because they overstepped the narrow bourn of likelihood but reverently deemed nothing too wondrous or too beautiful to be the guerdon of a daring heart so rhoecus made no doubt that he was blest and all along unto the citys gate earth seemed to spring beneath him as he walked the clear broad sky looked bluer than its wont and he could scarce believe he had not wings     90 such sunshine seemed to glitter through his veins instead of blood so light he felt and strange    young rhoecus had a faithful heart enough but one that in the present dwelt too much and taking with blithe welcome whatsoeer chance gave of joy was wholly bound in that like the contented peasant of a vale deemed it the world and never looked beyond so haply meeting in the afternoon some comrades who were playing at the dice     100 he joined them and forgot all else beside    the dice were rattling at the merriest and rhoecus who had met but sorry luck just laughed in triumph at a happy throw when through the room there hummed a yellow bee that buzzed about his ear with downdropped legs as if to light and rhoecus laughed and said feeling how red and flushed he was with loss by venus does he take me for a rose and brushed him off with rough impatient hand     110 but still the bee came back and thrice again rhoecus did beat him off with growing wrath then through the window flew the wounded bee and rhoecus tracking him with angry eyes saw a sharp mountainpeak of thessaly against the red disk of the setting sun and instantly the blood sank from his heart as if its very walls had caved away without a word he turned and rushing forth ran madly through the city and the gate     120 and oer the plain which now the woods long shade by the low sun thrown forward broad and dim darkened wellnigh unto the citys wall    quite spent and out of breath he reached the tree and listening fearfully he heard once more the low voice murmur rhoecus close at hand whereat he looked around him but could see naught but the deepening glooms beneath the oak then sighed the voice o rhoecus nevermore shalt thou behold me or by day or night     130 me who would fain have blessed thee with a love more ripe and bounteous than ever yet filled up with nectar any mortal heart but thou didst scorn my humble messenger and sentst him back to me with bruised wings we spirits only show to gentle eyes we ever ask an undivided love and he who scorns the least of natures works is thenceforth exiled and shut out from all farewell for thou canst never see me more     140    then rhoecus beat his breast and groaned aloud and cried be pitiful forgive me yet this once and i shall never need it more alas the voice returned tis thou art blind not i unmerciful i can forgive but have no skill to heal thy spirits eyes only the soul hath power oer itself with that again there murmured nevermore and rhoecus after heard no other sound except the rattling of the oaks crisp leaves     150 like the long surf upon a distant shore raking the seaworn pebbles up and down the night had gathered round him oer the plain the city sparkled with its thousand lights and sounds of revel fell upon his ear harshly and like a curse above the sky with all its bright sublimity of stars deepened and on his forehead smote the breeze beauty was all around him and delight but from that eve he was alone on earth     160    the falcon  i know a falcon swift and peerless   as eer was cradled in the pine no bird had ever eye so fearless   or wing so strong as this of mine  the winds not better love to pilot   a cloud with molten gold oer run than him a little burning islet   a star above the coming sun  for with a larks heart he doth tower   by a glorious upward instinct drawn no bee nestles deeper in the flower   than he in the bursting rose of dawn  no harmless dove no bird that singeth   shudders to see him overhead the rush of his fierce swooping bringeth   to innocent hearts no thrill of dread  let fraud and wrong and baseness shiver   for still between them and the sky the falcon truth hangs poised forever   and marks them with his vengeful eye    trial   i  whether the idle prisoner through his grate watches the waving of the grasstuft small which having colonized its rift i th wall accepts gods dole of good or evil fate and from the skys just helmet draws its lot daily of shower or sunshine cold or hot whether the closer captive of a creed cooped up from birth to grind out endless chaff sees through his treadmillbars the noonday laugh and feels in vain his crumpled pinions breed whether the georgian slave look up and mark with bellying sails puffed full the tall cloudbark sink northward slowlythou alone seemst good fair only thou o freedom whose desire can light in muddiest souls quick seeds of fire and strain lifes chords to the old heroic mood   ii  yet are there other gifts more fair than thine nor can i count him happiest who has never been forced with his own hand his chains to sever and for himself find out the way divine he never knew the aspirers glorious pains he never earned the struggles priceless gains oh block by block with sore and sharp endeavor lifelong we build these human natures up into a temple fit for freedoms shrine and trial ever consecrates the cup wherefrom we pour her sacrificial wine    a glance behind the curtain  we see but half the causes of our deeds seeking them wholly in the outer life and heedless of the encircling spiritworld which though unseen is felt and sows in us all germs of pure and worldwide purposes from one stage of our being to the next we pass unconscious oer a slender bridge the momentary work of unseen hands which crumbles down behind us looking back we see the other shore the gulf between     10 and marvelling how we won to where we stand content ourselves to call the builder chance we trace the wisdom to the apples fall not to the birththroes of a mighty truth which for long ages in blank chaos dumb yet yearned to be incarnate and had found at last a spirit meet to be the womb from which it might be born to bless mankind not to the soul of newton ripe with all the hoarded thoughtfulness of earnest years     20 and waiting but one ray of sunlight more to blossom fully        but whence came that ray we call our sorrows destiny but ought rather to name our high successes so only the instincts of great souls are fate and have predestined sway all other things except by leave of us could never be for destiny is but the breath of god still moving in us the last fragment left of our unfallen nature waking oft     30 within our thought to beckon us beyond the narrow circle of the seen and known and always tending to a noble end as all things must that overrule the soul and for a space unseat the helmsman will the fate of england and of freedom once seemed wavering in the heart of one plain man one step of his and the great dialhand that marks the destined progress of the world in the eternal round from wisdom on     40 to higher wisdom had been made to pause a hundred years that step he did not take he knew not why nor we but only god and lived to make his simple oaken chair more terrible and soberly august more full of majesty than any throne before or after of a british king    upon the pier stood two sternvisaged men looking to where a little craft lay moored swayed by the lazy current of the thames     50 which weltered by in muddy listlessness grave men they were and battlings of fierce thought had trampled out all softness from their brows and ploughed rough furrows there before their time for other crop than such as homebred peace sows broadcast in the willing soil of youth care not of self but for the commonweal had robbed their eyes of youth and left instead a look of patient power and iron will and something fiercer too that gave broad hint       60 of the plain weapons girded at their sides the younger had an aspect of command not such as trickles down a slender stream in the shrunk channel of a great descent but such as lies entowered in heart and head and an arm prompt to do the hests of both his was a brow where gold were out of place and yet it seemed right worthy of a crown though he despised such were it only made of iron or some serviceable stuff that would have matched his brownly rugged face       71 the elder although such he hardly seemed care makes so little of some five short years had a clear honest face whose roughhewn strength was mildened by the scholars wiser heart to sober courage such as best befits the unsullied temper of a welltaught mind yet so remained that one could plainly guess the hushed volcano smouldering underneath he spoke the other hearing kept his gaze           80 still fixed as on some problem in the sky    o cromwell we are fallen on evil times there was a day when england had a wide room for honest men as well as foolish kings but now the uneasy stomach of the time turns squeamish at them both therefore let us seek out that savage clime where men as yet are free there sleeps the vessel on the tide her languid canvas drooping for the wind give us but that and what need we to fear            90 this order of the council the free waves will not say no to please a wayward king nor will the winds turn traitors at his beck all things are fitly cared for and the lord will watch us kindly oer the exodus of us his servants now as in old time we have no cloud or fire and haply we may not pass dryshod through the oceanstream but saved or lost all things are in his hand so spake he and meantime the other stood            100 with wide gray eyes still reading the blank air as if upon the skys blue wall he saw some mystic sentence written by a hand such as of old made pale the assyrian king girt with his satraps in the blazing feast    hampden a moment since my purpose was to fly with theefor i will call it flight nor flatter it with any smoother name but something in me bids me not to go and i am one thou knowest who unmoved      110 by what the weak deem omens yet give heed and reverence due to whatsoeer my soul whispers of warning to the inner ear moreover as i know that god brings round his purposes in ways undreamed by us and makes the wicked but his instruments to hasten their own swift and sudden fall i see the beauty of his providence in the kings order blind he will not let his doom part from him but must bid it stay      120 as t were a cricket whose enlivening chirp he loved to hear beneath his very hearth why should we fly nay why not rather stay and rear again our zions crumbled walls not as of old the walls of thebes were built by minstrel twanging but if need should be with the more potent music of our swords thinkst thou that score of men beyond the sea claim more gods care than all of england here no when he moves his arm it is to aid      130 whole peoples heedless if a few be crushed as some are ever when the destiny of man takes one stride onward nearer home believe me tis the mass of men he loves and where there is most sorrow and most want where the high heart of man is trodden down the most tis not because he hides his face from them in wrath as purblind teachers prate not so there most is he for there is he most needed men who seek for fate abroad      140 are not so near his heart as they who dare frankly to face her where she faces them on their own threshold where their souls are strong to grapple with and throw her as i once being yet a boy did cast this puny king who now has grown so dotard as to deem that he can wrestle with an angry realm and throw the brawned antæus of mens rights no hampden they have halfway conquered fate who go halfway to meet heras will i     150 freedom hath yet a work for me to do so speaks that inward voice which never yet spake falsely when it urged the spirit on to noble emprise for country and mankind and for success i ask no more than this to bear unflinching witness to the truth all true whole men succeed for what is worth successs name unless it be the thought the inward surety to have carried out a noble purpose to a noble end      160 although it be the gallows or the block tis only falsehood that doth ever need these outward shows of gain to bolster her be it we prove the weaker with our swords truth only needs to be for once spoke out and theres such music in her such strange rhythm as makes mens memories her joyous slaves and clings around the soul as the sky clings round the mute earth forever beautiful and if oerclouded only to burst forth      170 more allembracingly divine and clear get but the truth once uttered and tis like a star newborn that drops into its place and which once circling in its placid round not all the tumult of the earth can shake    what should we do in that small colony of pinched fanatics who would rather choose freedom to clip an inch more from their hair than the great chance of setting england free not there amid the stormy wilderness      180 should we learn wisdom or if learned what room to put it into actelse worse than naught we learn our souls more tossing for an hour upon this huge and evervexed sea of human thought where kingdoms go to wreck like fragile bubbles yonder in the stream than in a cycle of new england sloth broke only by a petty indian war or quarrel for a letter more or less in some hard word which spelt in either way      190 not their most learned clerks can understand new times demand new measures and new men the world advances and in time outgrows the laws that in our fathers day were best and doubtless after us some purer scheme will be shaped out by wiser men than we made wiser by the steady growth of truth we cannot hale utopia on by force but better almost be at work in sin than in a brute inaction browse and sleep     200 no man is born into the world whose work is not born with him there is always work and tools to work withal for those who will and blessed are the horny hands of toil the busy world stoves angrily aside the man who stands with arms akimbo set until occasion tells him what to do and he who waits to have his task marked out shall die and leave his errand unfulfilled our time is one that calls for earnest deeds      210 season and government like two broad seas yearn for each other with outstretched arms across this narrow isthmus of the throne and roll their white surf higher every day one age moves onward and the next builds up cities and gorgeous palaces where stood the rude loghuts of those who tamed the wild rearing from out the forests they had felled the goodly framework of a fairer state the builders trowel and the settlers axe      220 are seldom wielded by the selfsame hand ours is the harder task yet not the less shall we receive the blessing for our toil from the choice spirits of the aftertime my soul is not a palace of the past where outworn creeds like romes gray senate quake hearing afar the vandals trumpet hoarse that shakes old systems with a thunderfit that time is ripe and rottenripe for change then let it come i have no dread of what      230 is called for by the instinct of mankind nor think i that gods world will fall apart because we tear a parchment more or less truth is eternal but her effluence with endless change is fitted to the hour her mirror is turned forward to reflect the promise of the future not the past he who would win the name of truly great must understand his own age and the next and make the present ready to fulfil      240 its prophecy and with the future merge gently and peacefully as wave with wave the future works out great mens purposes the present is enough for common souls who never looking forward are indeed mere clay wherein the footprints of their age are petrified forever better those who lead the blind old giant by the hand from out the pathless desert where he gropes and set him onward in his darksome way      250 i do not fear to follow out the truth albeit along the precipices edge let us speak plain there is more force in names than most men dream of and a lie may keep its throne a whole age longer if it skulk behind the shield of some fairseeming name let us call tyrants tyrants and maintain that only freedom comes by grace of god and all that comes not by his grace must fail for men in earnest have no time to waste     260 in patching figleaves for the naked truth    i will have one more grapple with the man charles stuart whom the boy oercame the man stands not in awe of i perchance am one raised up by the almighty arm to witness some great truth to all the world souls destined to oerleap the vulgar lot and mould the world unto the scheme of god have a foreconsciousness of their high doom as men are known to shiver at the heart     270 when the cold shadow of some coming ill creeps slowly oer their spirits unawares hath good less power of prophecy than ill how else could men whom god hath called to sway earths rudder and to steer the bark of truth beating against the tempest towrd her port bear all the mean and buzzing grievances the petty martyrdoms wherewith sin strives to weary out the tethered hope of faith the sneers the unrecognizing look of friends     280 who worship the dead corpse of old king custom where it doth lie in state within the church striving to cover up the mighty ocean with a mans palm and making even the truth lie for them holding up the glass reversed to make the hope of man seem farther off my god when i read oer the bitter lives of men whose eager hearts were quite too great to beat beneath the cramped mode of the day and see them mocked at by the world they love     290 haggling with prejudice for pennyworths of that reform which their hard toil will make the common birthright of the age to come when i see this spite of my faith in god i marvel how their hearts bear up so long nor could they but for this same prophecy this inward feeling of the glorious end    deem me not fond but in my warmer youth ere my hearts bloom was soiled and brushed away i had great dreams of mighty things to come      300 of conquest whether by the sword or pen i knew not but some conquest i would have or else swift death now wiser grown in years i find youths dreams are but the flutterings of those strong wings whereon the soul shall soar in after time to win a starry throne and so i cherish them for they were lots which i a boy cast in the helm of fate now will i draw them since a mans right hand a right hand guided by an earnest soul        310 with a true instinct takes the golden prize from out a thousand blanks what men call luck is the prerogative of valiant souls the fealty life pays its rightful kings the helm is shaking now and i will stay to pluck my lot forth it were sin to flee    so they two turned together one to

indebted to the very valuable algic researches of henry r schoolcraft esq jrl  the old chief feeling now wellnigh his end called his two eldest children to his side and gave them in few words his parting charge my son and daughter me ye see no more the happy huntinggrounds await me green with change of spring and summer through the year but for remembrance after i am gone be kind to little sheemah for my sake weakling he is and young and knows not yet to set the trap or draw the seasoned bow     10 therefore of both your loves he hath more need and he who needeth love to love hath right it is not like our furs and stores of corn whereto we claim sole title by our toil but the great spirit plants it in our hearts and waters it and gives it sun to be the common stock and heritage of all therefore be kind to sheemah that yourselves may not be left deserted in your need    alone beside a lake their wigwam stood     20 far from the other dwellings of their tribe and after many moons the loneliness wearied the elder brother and he said why should i dwell here far from men shut out from the free natural joys that fit my age lo i am tall and strong well skilled to hunt patient of toil and hunger and not yet have seen the danger which i dared not look full in the face what hinders me to be a mighty brave and chief among my kin         30 so taking up his arrows and his bow as if to hunt he journeyed swiftly on until he gained the wigwams of his tribe where choosing out a bride he soon forgot in all the fret and bustle of new life the little sheemah and his fathers charge    now when the sister found her brother gone and that for many days he came not back she wept for sheemah more than for herself for love bides longest in a womans heart       40 and flutters many times before he flies and then doth perch so nearly that a word may lure him back to his accustomed nest and duty lingers even when love is gone oft looking out in hope of his return and after duty hath been driven forth then selfishness creeps in the last of all warming her lean hands at the lonely hearth and crouching oer the embers to shut out whatever paltry warmth and light are left      50 with avaricious greed from all beside so for long months the sister hunted wide and cared for little sheemah tenderly but daily more and more the loneliness grew wearisome and to herself she sighed am i not fair at least the glassy pool that hath no cause to flatter tells me so but oh how flat and meaningless the tale unless it tremble on a lovers tongue beauty hath no true glass except it be        60 in the sweet privacy of loving eyes thus deemed she idly and forgot the lore which she had learned of nature and the woods that beautys chief reward is to itself and that loves mirror holds no image long save of the inward fairness blurred and lost unless kept clear and white by dutys care so she went forth and sought the haunts of men and being wedded in her household cares soon like the elder brother quite forgot     70 the little sheemah and her fathers charge    but sheemah left alone within the lodge waited and waited with a shrinking heart thinking each rustle was his sisters step till hope grew less and less and then went out and every sound was changed from hope to fear few sounds there werethe dropping of a nut the squirrels chirrup and the jays harsh scream autumns sad remnants of blithe summers cheer heard at long intervals seemed but to make     80 the dreadful void of silence silenter soon what small store his sister left was gone and through the autumn he made shift to live on roots and berries gathered in much fear of wolves whose ghastly howl he heard ofttimes hollow and hungry at the dead of night but winter came at last and when the snow thickheaped for gleaming leagues oer hill and plain spread its unbroken silence over all made bold by hunger he was fain to glean     90 more sick at heart than ruth and all alone after the harvest of the merciless wolf grim boaz who sharpribbed and gaunt yet feared a thing more wild and starving than himself till by degrees the wolf and he grew friends and shared together all the winter through    late in the spring when all the ice was gone the elder brother fishing in the lake upon whose edge his fathers wigwam stood heard a low moaning noise upon the shore     100 half like a child it seemed half like a wolf and straightway there was something in his heart that said it is thy brother sheemahs voice so paddling swiftly to the bank he saw within a little thicket close at hand a child that seemed fast clinging to a wolf from the neck downward gray with shaggy hair that still crept on and upward as he looked the face was turned away but well he knew that it was sheemahs even his brothers face     110 then with his trembling hands he hid his eyes and bowed his head so that he might not see the first look of his brothers eyes and cried o sheemah o my brother speak to me dost thou not know me that i am thy brother come to me little sheemah thou shall dwell with me henceforth and know no care or want sheemah was silent for a space as if t were hard to summon up a human voice and when he spake the voice was as a wolfs     120 i know thee not nor art thou what thou sayst i have none other brethren than the wolves and till thy heart be changed from what it is thou art not worthy to be called their kin then groaned the other with a choking tongue alas my heart is changed right bitterly tis shrunk and parched within me even now and looking upward fearfully he saw only a wolf that shrank away and ran ugly and fierce to hide among the woods      130    stanzas on freedom  men whose boast it is that ye come of fathers brave and free if there breathe on earth a slave are ye truly free and brave if ye do not feel the chain when it works a brothers pain are ye not base slaves indeed slaves unworthy to be freed  women who shall one day bear sons to breathe new england air if ye

break fetters for our own dear sake and with leathern hearts forget that we owe mankind a debt no true freedom is to share all the chains our brothers wear and with heart and hand to be earnest to make others free  they are slaves who fear to speak for the fallen and the weak they are slaves who will not choose hatred scoffing and abuse rather than in silence shrink from the truth they needs

but the sad sea the beating heart of this great enterprise which without me would stiffen in swift death this have i mused on since mine eye could first among the stars distinguish and with joy rest on that godfed pharos of the north      110 on some blue promontory of heaven lighted that juts far out into the upper sea to this one hope my heart hath clung for years as would a foundling to the talisman hung round his neck by hands he knew not whose a poor vile thing and dross to all beside yet he therein can feel a virtue left by the sad pressure of a mothers hand and unto him it still is tremulous with palpitating haste and wet with tears      120 the key to him of hope and humanness the coarse shell of lifes pearl expectancy this hope hath been to me for love and fame hath made me wholly lonely on the earth building me up as in a thickribbed tower wherewith enwalled my watching spirit burned conquering its little island from the dark sole as a scholars lamp and heard mens steps in the far hurry of the outward world pass dimly forth and back sounds heard in dream      130 as ganymede by the eagle was snatched up from the gross sod to be joves cupbearer so was i lifted by my great design and who hath trod olympus from his eye fades not that broader outlook of the gods his lifes low valleys overbrow earths clouds and that olympian spectre of the past looms towering up in

greatly dreamed precludes low ends great days have ever such a morningred on such a base great futures are built up and aspiration though not put in act comes back to ask its plighted troth again still watches round its grave the unlaid ghost of a dead virtue and makes other hopes save that implacable one seem thin and bleak      150 as shadows of bare trees upon the snow bound freezing there by the unpitying moon  while other youths perplexed their mandolins praying that thetis would her fingers twine in the loose glories of her lovers hair and wile another kiss to keep back day i stretched beneath the manycenturied shade of some writhed oak the woods laocoön did of my hope a dryad mistress make whom i would woo to meet me privily      160 or underneath the stars or when the moon flecked all the forest floor with scattered pearls o days whose memory tames to fawning down the surly fell of oceans bristled neck  i know not when this hope enthralled me first but from my boyhood up i loved to hear the tall pineforests of the apennine murmur their hoary legends of the sea which hearing i in vision clear beheld the sudden dark of tropic night shut down      170 oer the huge whisper of great watery wastes the while a pair of herons trailingly flapped inland where some leaguewide river hurled the yellow spoil of unconjectured realms far through a gulfs green silence never scarred by any but the northwinds hurrying keels and not the pines alone all sights and sounds to my worldseeking heart paid fealty and catered for it as the cretan bees brought honey to the baby jupiter who in his soft hand crushed a violet     181 godlike foremusing the rough thunders gripe then did i entertain the poets song my great ideas guest and passing oer that iron bridge the tuscan built to hell i heard ulysses tell of mountainchains whose adamantine links his manacles the western main shook growling and still gnawed i brooded on the wise athenians tale of happy atlantis and heard björnes keel      190 crunch the gray pebbles of the vinland shore i listened musing to the prophecy of neros tutorvictim lo the birds sing darkling conscious of the climbing dawn and i believed the poets it is they who utter wisdom from the central deep and listening to the inner flow of things speak to the age out of eternity  ah me old hermits sought for solitude in caves and desert places of the earth      200 where their own heartbeat was the only stir of living thing that comforted the year but the bald pillartop of simeon in midnights blankest waste were populous matched with the isolation drear and deep of him who pines among the swarm of men at once a new thoughts king and prisoner feeling the truer life within his life the fountain of his spirits prophecy sinking away and wasting drop by drop      210 in the ungrateful sands of sceptic ears he in the palaceaisles of untrod woods doth walk a king for him the pentup cell widens beyond the circles of the stars and all the sceptred spirits of the past come thronging in to greet him as their peer but in the marketplaces glare and throng he sits apart an exile and his brow aches with the mocking memory of its crown  yet to the spirit select there is no choice      220 he cannot say this will i do or that for the cheap means putting heavens ends in pawn and bartering his bleak rocks the freehold stern of destinys firstborn for smoother fields that yield no crop of selfdenying will a hand is stretched to him from out the dark which grasping without question he is led where there is work that he must do for god the trial still is the strengths complement and the uncertain dizzy path that scales      230 the sheer heights of supremest purposes is steeper to the angel than the child chances have laws as fixed as planets have and disappointments dry and bitter root envys harsh berries and the choking pool of the worlds scorn are the right mothermilk to the tough hearts that pioneer their

stay and when the leaden world sets its hard face against their fateful thought and brute strength like the gaulish conqueror clangs his huge glaive down in the other scale the inspired soul but flings his patience in and slowly that outweighs the ponderous globe one faith against a whole earths unbelief one soul against the flesh of all mankind  thus ever seems it when my soul can hear      250 the voice that errs not then my triumph gleams oer the blank ocean beckoning and all night my heart flies on before me as i sail far on i see my lifelong enterprise that rose like ganges mid the freezing snows of a worlds solitude sweep broadening down and gathering to itself a thousand streams grow sacred ere it mingle with the sea i see the ungated wall of chaos old with blocks cyclopean hewn of solid night      260 fade like a wreath of unreturning mist before the irreversible feet of light and lo with what clear omen in the east on days gray threshold stands the eager dawn like young leander rosy from the sea glowing at heros lattice                                       one day more these muttering shoalbrains leave the helm to me god let me not in their dull ooze be stranded let not this one frail bark to hollow which i have dug out the pith and sinewy heart      270 of my aspiring lifes fair trunk be so cast up to warp and blacken in the sun just as the opposing

is columbuss a lavish day one day with life and heart is more than time enough to find a world    an incident of the fire at hamburg  the tower of old saint nicholas soared upward to the skies like some huge piece of natures make the growth of centuries you could not deem its crowding spires a work of human art they seemed to struggle lightward from a sturdy living heart  not natures self more freely speaks in crystal or in oak than through the pious builders hand in that gray pile she spoke and as from acorn springs the oak so freely and alone sprang from his heart this hymn to god sung in obedient stone  it seemed a wondrous freak of chance so perfect yet so rough a whim of nature crystallized slowly in granite tough the thick spires yearned towards the sky in quaint harmonious lines and in broad sunlight basked and slept like a grove of blasted pines  never did rock or stream or tree lay claim with better right to all the adorning sympathies of shadow and of light and in that forest petrified as forester there dwells stout herman the old sacristan sole lord of all its bells  surge leaping after surge the fire roared onward red as blood till half of hamburg lay engulfed beneath the eddying flood for miles away the fiery spray poured down its deadly rain and back and forth the billows sucked and paused and burst again  from square to square with tiger leaps panted the lustful fire the air to leeward shuddered with the gasps of its desire and church and palace which even now stood whelmed but to the knee lift their black roofs like breakers lone amid the whirling sea  up in his tower old herman sat and watched with quiet look his soul had trusted god too long to be at last forsook he could not fear for surely god a pathway would unfold through this red sea for faithful hearts as once he did of old  but scarcely can he cross himself or on his good saint call before the sacrilegious flood oerleaped the churchyard wall and ere a pater half was said mid smoke and crackling glare his island tower scarce juts its head above the wide despair  upon the perils desperate peak his heart stood up sublime his first thought was for god above his next was for his chime sing now and make your voices heard in hymns of praise cried he as did the israelites of old safe walking through the sea  through this red sea our god hath made the pathway safe to shore our promised land stands full in sight shout now as neer before and as the tower came crashing down the bells in clear accord pealed forth the grand old german hymnall good souls praise the      lord    the sower  i saw a sower walking slow   across the earth from east to west his hair was white as mountain snow   his head drooped forward on his breast  with shrivelled hands he flung his seed   nor ever turned to look behind of sight or sound he took no heed   it seemed he was both deaf and blind  his dim face showed no soul beneath   yet in my heart i felt a stir as if i looked upon the sheath   that once had held excalibur  i heard as still the seed he cast   how crooning to himself he sung i sow again the holy past   the happy days when i was young  then all was wheat without a tare   then all was righteous fair and true and i am he whose thoughtful care   shall plant the old world in the new  the fruitful germs i scatter free   with busy hand while all men sleep in europe now from sea to sea   the nations bless me as they reap  then i looked back along his path   and heard the clash of steel on steel where man faced man in deadly wrath   while clanged the tocsins hurrying peal  the sky with burning towns flared red   nearer the noise of fighting rolled and brothers blood by brothers shed   crept curdling over pavements cold  then marked i how each germ of truth   which through the dotards fingers ran was mated with a dragons tooth   whence there sprang up an armèd man  i shouted but he could not hear   made signs but these he could not see and still without a doubt or fear   broadcast he scattered anarchy  long to my straining ears the blast   brought faintly back the words he sung i sow again the holy past   the happy days when i was young    hunger and cold  sisters

past victims haggard throng     from the mould you unbury swords and spears weaker are than poor mens tears weaker than your silent years     hunger and cold  let them guard both hall and bower

mad hand crashing melody frantic while he pours forth his mighty desire   to leap down on the eager atlantic     whose arms stretch to his playmate  the wild storm makes his lair in thy branches   swooping thence on the continent under like a lion crouched close on his haunches   there awaiteth his leap the fierce thunder     growling low with impatience  spite of winter thou keepst thy green glory   lusty father of titans past number the snowflakes alone make thee hoary   nestling close to thy branches in slumber     and thee mantling with silence  thou alone knowst the splendor of winter   mid thy snowsilvered hushed precipices hearing crags of green ice groan and splinter   and then plunge down the muffled abysses     in the quiet of midnight  thou alone knowst the glory of summer   gazing down on thy broad seas of forest on thy subjects that send a proud murmur   up to thee to their sachem who towerest     from thy bleak throne to heaven    si descendero in infernum ades  o

hebe    i saw the twinkle of white feet i saw the flush of robes descending   before her ran an influence fleet that bowed my heart like barley bending    as in bare fields the searching bees pilot to blooms beyond our finding  it led me on by sweet degrees joys simple honeycells unbinding    those graces were that seemed grim fates with nearer love the sky leaned oer me   the longsought secrets golden gates on musical hinges swung before me    i saw the brimmed bowl in her grasp thrilling with godhood like a lover   i sprang the proffered life to clasp the beaker fell the luck was over    the earth has drunk the vintage up what boots it patch the goblets splinters   can summer fill the icy cup whose treacherous crystal is but winters    o spendthrift haste await the gods the nectar crowns the lips of patience  haste scatters on unthankful sods the immortal gift in vain libations    coy hebe flies from those that woo and shuns the hands would seize upon her   follow thy life and she will sue to pour for thee the cup of honor    the search      i went to seek for christ     and nature seemed so fair that first the woods and fields my youth enticed   and i was sure to find him there     the temple i forsook     and to the solitude allegiance paid but winter came and shook   the crown and purple from my wood his snows like desert sands with scornful drift   besieged the columned aisle and palacegate my thebes cut deep with many a solemn rift   but epitaphed her own sepulchered state then i remembered whom i went to seek and blessed blunt winter for his counsel bleak      back to the world i turned     for christ i said is king so the cramped alley and the hut i spurned   as far beneath his sojourning     mid power and wealth i sought     but found no trace of him and all the costly offerings i had brought   with sudden rust and mould grew dim i found his tomb indeed where by their laws   all must on stated days themselves imprison mocking with bread a dead creeds grinning jaws   witless how long the life had thence arisen due sacrifice to this they set apart prizing it more than christs own living heart      so from my feet the dust     of the proud world i shook then came dear love and shared with me his crust   and half my sorrows burden took     after the worlds soft bed     its rich and dainty fare like down seemed loves coarse pillow to my head   his cheap food seemed as manna rare freshtrodden prints of bare and bleeding feet   turned to the heedless city whence i came hard by i saw and springs of worship sweet   gushed from my cleft heart smitten by the same love looked me in the face and spake no words but straight i knew those footprints were the lords      i followed where they led     and in a hovel rude with naught to fence the weather from his head   the king i sought for meekly stood     a naked hungry child     clung round his gracious knee and a poor hunted slave looked up and smiled   to bless the smile that set him free new miracles i saw his presence do   no more i knew the hovel bare and poor the gathered chips into a woodpile grew   the broken morsel swelled to goodly store i knelt and wept my christ no more i seek his throne is with the outcast and the weak    the present crisis  when a deed is done for freedom through the broad earths aching breast runs a thrill of joy prophetic trembling on from east to west and the slave whereer he cowers feels the soul within him climb to the awful verge of manhood as the energy sublime of a century bursts fullblossomed on the thorny stem of time  through the walls of hut and palace shoots the instantaneous throe when the travail of the ages wrings earths systems to and fro at the birth of each new era with a recognizing start nation wildly looks at nation standing with mute lips apart and glad truths yet mightier manchild leaps beneath the futures   heart    10  so the evils triumph sendeth with a terror and a chill under continent to continent the sense of coming ill and the slave whereer he cowers feels his sympathies with god in hot teardrops ebbing earthward to be drunk up by the sod till a corpse crawls round unburied delving in the nobler clod  for mankind are one in spirit and an instinct bears along round the earths electric circle the swift flash of right or wrong whether conscious or unconscious yet humanitys vast frame through its oceansundered fibres feels the gush of joy or shame in the gain or loss of one race all the rest have equal claim     20  once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide in the strife of truth with falsehood for the good or evil side some great cause gods new messiah offering each the bloom or blight parts the goats upon the left hand and the sheep upon the right and the choice goes by forever twixt that darkness and that light  hast thou chosen o my people on whose party thou shalt stand ere the doom from its worn sandals shakes the dust against our land though the cause of evil prosper yet tis truth alone is strong and albeit she wander outcast now i see around her throng troops of beautiful tall angels to enshield her from all wrong     30  backward look across the ages and

that grew in the forests hush slowly as teardrops gather and gush when a word some poet chanced to say ages ago in his careless way brings our youth back to us out of its shroud clearly as under yon thundercloud i see that white seagull it grew and grew from the pinetrees gathering a sombre hue till it seems a mere murmur out of the vast norwegian forests of the past      10 and it grew itself like a true northern pine first a little slender line like a mermaids green eyelash and then anon a stem that a tower might rest upon standing spearstraight in the waistdeep moss its bony roots clutching around and across as if they would tear up earths heart in their grasp ere the storm should uproot them or make them unclasp its cloudy boughs singing as suiteth the pine to snowbearded seakings old songs of the brine      20 till they straightened and let their staves fall to the floor hearing waves moan again on the perilous shore of vinland perhaps while their prow groped its way twixt the frothed gnashing tusks of some shipcrunching bay  so pinelike the legend grew stronglimbed and tall as the gypsy child grows that eats crusts in the hall it sucked the whole strength of the earth and the sky spring summer fall winter all brought it supply twas a natural growth and stood fearlessly there true part of the landscape as sea land and air      30 for it grew in good times ere the fashion it was to force these wild births of the woods under glass and so if tis told as it should be told though twere sung under venices moonlight of gold you would hear the old voice of its mother the pine murmur sealike and northern through every line and the verses should grow selfsustained and free round the vibrating stem of the melody like the lithe moonlit limbs of the parent tree  yes the pine is the mother of legends what food      40 for their grim roots is left when the thousandyeared wood the dimaisled cathedral whose tall arches spring light sinewy graceful firmset as the wing from michaels white shoulder is hewn and defaced by iconoclast axes in desperate waste and its wrecks seek the ocean it prophesied long cassandralike crooning its mystical song then the legends go with themeven yet on the sea a wild virtue is left in the touch of the tree and the sailors nightwatches are thrilled to the core      50 with the lineal offspring of odin and thor  yes wherever the pinewood has never let in since the day of creation the light and the din of manifold life but has safely conveyed from the midnight primeval its armful of shade and has kept the weird past with its childfaith alive mid the hum and the stir of todays busy hive there the legend takes root in the agegathered gloom and its murmurous boughs for their sagas find room  where aroostook farheard seems to sob as he goes      60 groping down to the sea neath his mountainous snows where the lakes frore sahara of nevertracked white when the crack shoots across it complains to the night with a long lonely moan that leagues northward is lost as the ice shrinks away from the tread of the frost where the lumberers sit by the logfires that throw their own threatening shadows far round oer the snow when the wolf howls aloof and the wavering glare flashes out from the blackness the eyes of the bear when the woods huge recesses halflighted supply      70 a canvas where fancy her mad brush may try blotting in giant horrors that venture not down through the rightangled streets of the brisk whitewashed town but skulk in the depths of the measureless wood mid the darks creeping whispers that curdle the blood when the eye glanced in dread oer the shoulder may dream ere it shrinks to the campfires companioning gleam that it saw the fierce ghost of the red man crouch back to the shroud of the treetrunks invincible black there the old shapes crowd thick round the pineshadowed camp      80 which shun the keen gleam of the scholarly lamp and the seed of the legend finds true norland ground while the bordertales told and the canteen flits round    a contrast  thy love thou sendest oft to me   and still as oft i thrust it back thy messengers i could not see   in those who everything did lack   the poor the outcast and the black  pride held his hand before mine eyes   the world with flattery stuffed mine ears i looked to see a monarchs guise   nor dreamed thy love would knock for years   poor naked fettered full of tears  yet when i sent my love to thee   thou with a smile didst take it in and entertaindst it royally   though grimed with earth with hunger thin   and leprous with the taint of sin  now every day thy love i meet   as oer the earth it wanders wide with weary step and bleeding feet   still knocking at the heart of pride   and offering grace though still denied    extreme unction  go leave me priest my soul would be   alone with the consoler death far sadder eyes than thine will see   this crumbling clay yield up its breath these shrivelled

whereby to crawl away from heaven  men think it is an awful sight   to see a soul just set adrift on that drear voyage from whose night   the ominous shadows never lift but tis more awful to behold   a helpless infant newly born      70 whose little hands unconscious hold   the keys of darkness and of morn  mine held them once i flung away   those keys that might have open set the golden sluices of the day   but clutch the keys of darkness yet i hear the reapers singing go   into gods harvest i that might with them have chosen here below   grope shuddering at the gates of night      80  o

his ornament  how towers he too amid the billowed snows   an unquelled exile from the summers throne whose plain uncinctured front more kingly shows   now that the obscuring courtier leaves are flown his boughs make music of the winter air   jewelled with sleet like some cathedral front where clinging snowflakes with quaint art repair   the dints and furrows of times envious brunt  how doth his

delving within thy grace an eyeless mole make me the least of thy dodonagrove   cause me some message of thy truth to bring speak but a word through me nor let thy love   among my boughs disdain to perch and sing    ambrose  never surely was holier man than ambrose since the world began with diet spare and raiment thin he shielded himself from the father of sin with bed of iron and scourgings oft his heart to gods hand as wax made soft  through earnest prayer and watchings long he sought to know tween right and wrong much wrestling with the blessed word to make it yield the sense of the lord      10 that he might build a stormproof creed to fold the flock in at their need  at last he builded a perfect faith fenced round about with the lord thus saith to himself he fitted the doorways size meted the light to the need of his eyes and knew by a sure and inward sign that the work of his fingers was divine  then ambrose said all those shall die the eternal death who believe not as i      20 and some were boiled some burned in fire some sawn in twain that his hearts desire for the good of mens souls might be satisfied by the drawing of all to the righteous side  one day as ambrose was seeking the truth in his lonely walk he saw a youth resting himself in the shade of a tree it had never been granted him to see so shining a face and the good man thought twere pity he should not believe as he ought      30  so he set himself by the young mans side and the state of his soul with questions tried but the heart of the stranger was hardened indeed nor received the stamp of the one true creed and the spirit of ambrose waxed sore to find such features the porch of so narrow a mind  as each beholds in cloud and fire the shape that answers his own desire so each said the youth in the law shall find the figure and fashion of his mind         40 and to each in his mercy hath god allowed his several pillar of fire and cloud  the soul of ambrose burned with zeal and holy wrath for the young mans weal believest thou then most wretched youth cried he a dividual essence in truth i fear me thy heart is too cramped with sin to take the lord in his glory in  now there bubbled beside them where they stood a fountain of waters sweet and good        50 the youth to the streamlets brink drew near saying ambrose thou maker of creeds look here six vases of crystal then he took and set them along the edge of the brook  as into these vessels the water i pour there shall one hold less another more and the water unchanged in every case shall put on the figure of the vase o thou who wouldst unity make through strife canst thou fit this sign to the water of life      60  when ambrose looked up he stood alone the youth and the stream and the vases were gone but he knew by a sense of humbled grace he had talked with an angel face to face and felt his heart change inwardly as he fell on his knees beneath the tree    above and below   i  o dwellers in the valleyland   who in deep twilight grope and cower till the slow mountains dialhand   shorten to noons triumphal hour while ye sit idle do ye think   the lords great work sits idle too that light dare not oerleap the brink   of morn because tis dark with you  though yet your valleys skulk in night   in gods ripe fields the day is cried and reapers with their sickles bright   troop singing down the mountainside come up and feel what health there is   in the frank dawns delighted eyes as bending with a pitying kiss   the nightshed tears of earth she dries  the lord wants reapers oh mount up   before night comes and says too late stay not for taking scrip or cup   the master hungers while ye wait tis from these heights alone your eyes   the advancing spears of day can see that oer the eastern hilltops rise   to break your long captivity   ii  lone watcher on the mountainheight   it is right precious to behold the first long surf of climbing light   flood all the thirsty east with gold but we who in the shadow sit   know also when the day is nigh seeing thy shining forehead lit   with his inspiring prophecy  thou hast thine office we have ours   god lacks not early service here but what are thine eleventh hours   he counts with us for morning cheer our day for him is long enough   and when he giveth work to do the bruisèd reed is amply tough   to pierce the shield of error through  but not the less do thou

obedience too is light   and following that is finding him    the captive  it was past the hour of trysting   but she lingered for him still like a child the eager streamlet   leaped and laughed adown the hill happy to be free at twilight   from its toiling at the mill  then the great moon on a sudden   ominous and red as blood startling as a new creation   oer the eastern hilltop stood casting deep and deeper shadows   through the mystery of the wood  dread closed fast and vague about her   and her thoughts turned fearfully to her heart if there some shelter   from the silence there might be like bare cedars leaning inland   from the blighting of the sea  yet he came not and the stillness   dampened round her like a tomb she could feel cold eyes of spirits   looking on her through the gloom she could hear the groping footsteps   of some blind gigantic doom  suddenly the silence wavered   like a light mist in the wind for a voice broke gently through it   felt like sunshine by the blind and the dread like mist in sunshine   furled serenely from her mind  once my love my love forever   flesh or spirit still the same if i failed at time of trysting   deem then not my faith to blame i alas was made a captive   as from holy land i came  on a green spot in the desert   gleaming like an emerald star where a palmtree in lone silence   yearning for its mate afar droops above a silver runnel   slender as a scimitar  there thoult find the humble postern   to the castle of my foe if thy love burn clear and faithful   strike the gateway green and low ask to enter and the warder   surely will not say thee no  slept again the aspen silence   but her loneliness was oer bound her soul a motherly patience   clasped its arms forevermore from her heart ebbed back the sorrow   leaving smooth the golden shore  donned she now the pilgrim scallop   took the pilgrim staff in hand like a cloudshade flitting eastward   wandered she oer sea and land and her footsteps in the desert   fell like cool rain on the sand  soon beneath the palmtrees shadow   knelt she at the postern low and thereat she knocked full gently   fearing much the warders no all her heart stood still and listened   as the door swung backward slow  there she saw no surly warder   with an eye like bolt and bar through her soul a sense of music   throbbed and like a guardian lar on the threshold stood an angel   bright and silent as a star  fairest seemed he of gods seraphs   and her spirit lilywise opened when he turned upon her   the deep welcome of his eyes sending upward to that sunlight   all its dew for sacrifice  then she heard a voice come onward   singing with a rapture new as eve heard the songs in eden   dropping earthward with the dew well she knew the happy singer   well the happy song she knew  forward leaped she oer the threshold   eager as a glancing surf fell from her the spirits languor   fell from her the bodys scurf neath the palm next day some arabs   found a corpse upon the turf    the birchtree  rippling through thy branches goes the sunshine among thy leaves that palpitate forever ovid in thee a pining nymph had prisoned the soul once of some tremulous inland river quivering to tell her woe but ah dumb dumb forever  while all the forest witched with slumberous moonshine holds up its leaves in happy happy stillness waiting the dew with breath and pulse suspended i hear afar thy whispering gleamy islands and track thee wakeful still amid the widehung silence  on the brink of some woodnestled lakelet thy foliage like the tresses of a dryad dripping round thy slim white stem whose shadow slopes quivering down the waters dusky quiet thou shrinkst as on her baths edge would some startled naiad  thou art the gobetween of rustic lovers thy white bark has their secrets in its keeping reuben writes here the happy name of patience and thy lithe boughs hang murmuring and weeping above her as she steals the mystery from thy keeping  thou art to me like my beloved maiden so frankly coy so full of trembly confidences thy shadow scarce seems shade thy pattering leaflets sprinkle their gathered sunshine oer my senses and nature gives me all her summer confidences  whether my heart with hope or sorrow tremble thou sympathizest still wild and unquiet i fling me down thy ripple like a river flows valleyward where calmness is and by it my heart is floated down into the land of quiet    an interview with miles standish  i sat one evening in my room   in that sweet hour of twilight when blended thoughts half light half gloom   throng through the spirits skylight the flames by fits curled round the bars   or up the chimney crinkled while embers dropped like falling stars   and in the ashes tinkled  i sat and mused the fire burned low   and oer my senses stealing            10 crept something of the ruddy glow   that bloomed on wall and ceiling my pictures they are very few   the heads of ancient wise men smoothed down their knotted fronts and grew   as rosy as excisemen  my antique highbacked spanish chair   felt thrills through wood and leather that had been strangers since whilere   mid andaluslan heather                  20 the oak

stay in it   is more or less than human              40  i offer to all bores this perch   dear wellintentioned people with heads as void as weekday church   tongues longer than the steeple to folks with missions whose gaunt eyes   see golden ages rising salt of the earth in what queer guys   thourt fond of crystallizing  my wonder then was not unmixed   with merciful suggestion                50 when as my roving eyes grew fixed   upon the chair in question i saw its trembling arms enclose   a figure grim and rusty whose doublet plain and plainer hose   were something worn and dusty  now even such men as nature forms   merely to fill the street with once turned to ghosts by hungry worms       59   are serious things to meet with your penitent spirits are no jokes   and though im not averse

buccaneerish air   about that garb outlandish      70 just then the ghost drew up his chair   and said my name is standish  i come from plymouth deadly bored   with toasts and songs and speeches as long and flat as my old sword   as threadbare as my breeches they understand us pilgrims they   smooth men with rosy faces strengths knots and gnarls all pared away   and varnish in their places

pitys burning flood of words is redhot in the breast  though we break our fathers promise we have nobler duties first the traitor to humanity is the traitor most accursed man is more than constitutions better rot beneath the sod than be true to church and state while we are doubly false to god  we owe allegiance to the state but deeper truer more to the sympathies that god hath set

humblest and the weakest neath the allbeholding sun that wrong is also done to us and they are slaves most base whose love of right is for themselves and not for all their race  god works for all ye

oft had i mused of calm and peace and safe forgetfulness of folded hands closed eyes and heart at rest and slumber sound beneath a flowery turf of faults forgotten and an inner place kept sacred for us in the heart of friends but these were idle fancies satisfied with the mere husk of this great mystery and dwelling in the outward shows of things      10 heaven is not mounted to on wings of dreams nor doth the unthankful happiness of youth aim thitherward but floats from bloom to bloom with earths warm patch of sunshine well content tis sorrow builds the shining ladder up whose golden rounds are our calamities whereon our firm feet planting nearer god the spirit climbs and hath its eyes unsealed  true is it that deaths face seems stern and cold when he is sent to summon those we love      20 but all gods angels come to us disguised sorrow and sickness poverty and death one after other lift their frowning masks and we behold the seraphs face beneath all radiant with the glory and the calm of having looked upon the front of god with every anguish of our earthly part the spirits sight grows clearer this was meant when jesus touched the blind mans lids with clay life is the jailer death the angel sent      30 to draw the unwilling bolts and set us free he flings not ope the ivory gate of rest only the fallen spirit knocks at that but to benigner regions beckons us to destinies of more rewarded toil in the hushed chamber sitting by the dead it grates on us to hear the flood of life whirl rustling onward senseless of our loss the bee hums on around the blossomed vine whirs the light hummingbird the cricket chirps      40 the locusts shrill alarum stings the ear hard by the cock shouts lustily from farm to farm his cheery brothers telling of the sun answer till far away the joyance dies we never knew before how god had filled the summer air with happy living sounds all round us seems an overplus of life and yet the one dear heart lies cold and still it is most strange when the great miracle hath for our sakes been done when we have had      50 our inwardest experience of god when with his presence still the room expands and is awed after him that naught is changed that natures face looks unacknowledging and the mad world still dances heedless on after its butterflies and gives no sign tis hard at first to see it all aright in vain faith blows her trump to summon back her scattered troop yet through the clouded glass of our own bitter tears we learn to look      60 undazzled on the kindness of gods face earth is too dark and heaven alone shines through  it is no little thing when a fresh soul and a fresh heart with their unmeasured scope for good not gravitating earthward yet but circling in diviner periods are sent into the worldno little thing when this unbounded possibility into the outer silence is withdrawn ah in this world where every guiding thread      70 ends suddenly in the one sure centre death the visionary hand of

dim   and lifes last oil is nearly spent one gush of light these eyes will brim   only to think she came and went    the changeling  i had a little daughter   and she was given to me to lead me gently backward   to the heavenly fathers knee that i by the force of nature   might in some dim wise divine the depth of his infinite patience   to this wayward soul of mine  i know not how others saw her   but to me she was wholly fair and the light of the heaven she came from   still lingered and gleamed in her hair for it was as wavy and golden   and as many changes took as the shadows of sungilt ripples   on the yellow bed of a brook  to what can i liken her smiling   upon me her kneeling lover how it leaped from her lips to her eyelids   and dimpled her wholly over till her outstretched hands smiled also   and i almost seemed to see the very heart of her mother   sending sun through her veins to me  she had been with us scarce a twelvemonth   and it hardly seemed a day when a troop of wandering angels   stole my little daughter away or perhaps those heavenly zingari   but loosed the hampering strings and when they had opened her cagedoor   my little bird used her wings  but they left in her stead a changeling   a little angel child that seems like her bud in full blossom   and smiles as she never smiled when i wake in the morning i see it   where she always used to lie and i feel as weak as a violet   alone neath the awful sky  as weak yet as trustful also   for the whole year long i see all the wonders of faithful nature   still worked for the love of me winds wander and dews drip earthward   rain falls suns rise and set earth whirls and all but to prosper   a poor little violet  this child is not mine as the first was   i cannot sing it to rest i cannot lift it up fatherly   and bliss it upon my breast yet it lies in my little ones cradle   and sits in my little ones chair and the light of the heaven shes gone to   transfigures its golden hair    the pioneer    what man would live coffined with brick and stone     imprisoned from the healing touch of air     and cramped with selfish landmarks everywhere when all before him stretches furrowless and lone   the unmapped prairie none can fence or own    what man would read and read the selfsame faces     and like the marbles which the windmill grinds     rub smooth forever with the same smooth minds this year retracing last years every years dull traces   when there are woods and unpenfolded spaces    what man oer one old thought would pore and pore     shut like a book between its covers thin     for every fool to leave his dogs ears in when solitude is his and god forevermore   just for the opening of a paltry door    what man would watch lifes oozy element     creep letheward forever when he might     down some great river drift beyond mens sight to where the undethroned forests royal tent   broods with its hush oer half a continent    what man with men would push and altercate     piecing out crooked means to crooked ends     when he can have the skies and woods for friends snatch back the rudder of his undismantled fate   and in himself be ruler church and state    cast leaves and feathers rot in last years nest     the wingèd brood flown thence new dwellings plan     the serf of his own past is not a man to change and change is life to move and never rest   not what we are but what we hope is best    the wild free woods make no man halt or blind     cities rob men of eyes and hands and feet     patching one whole of many incomplete the general preys upon the individual mind   and each alone is helpless as the wind    each man is some mans servant every soul     is by some others presence quite discrowned     each owes the next through all the imperfect round yet not with mutual help each man is his own goal   and the whole earth must stop to pay him toll    here life the undiminished man demands     new faculties stretch out to meet new wants     what nature asks that nature also grants here man is lord not drudge of eyes and feet and hands   and to his life is knit with hourly bands    come out then from the old thoughts and old ways     before you harden to a crystal cold     which the new life can shatter but not mould freedom for you still waits still looking backward stays   but widens still the irretrievable space     longing  of all the myriad moods of mind   that through the soul come thronging which one was eer so dear so kind   so beautiful as longing the thing we long for that we are   for one transcendent moment before the present poor and bare   can make its sneering comment  still through our paltry stir and strife   glows down the wished ideal and longing moulds in clay what life   carves in the marble real to let the new life in we know   desire must ope the portal perhaps the longing to be so   helps make the soul immortal  longing is gods fresh heavenward will   with our poor earthward striving we quench it that we may be still   content with merely living but would we learn that hearts full scope   which we are hourly wronging our lives must climb from hope to hope   and realize our longing  ah let us hope that to our praise   good god not only reckons the moments when we tread his ways   but when the spirit beckons that some slight good is also wrought   beyond selfsatisfaction when we are simply good in thought   howeer we fail in action    ode to france  february 1848   i  as flake by flake the beetling avalanches   build up their imminent crags of noiseless snow till some chance thrill the loosened ruin launches   in unwarned havoc on the roofs below so grew and gathered through the silent years   the madness of a people wrong by wrong there seemed no strength in the dumb toilers tears   no strength in suffering but the past was strong the brute despair of trampled centuries   leaped up with one hoarse yell and snapped its bands     10   groped for its right with horny callous hands and stared around for god with bloodshot eyes   what wonder if those palms were all too hard for nice distinctionsif that mænad throng   they whose thick atmosphere no bard had shivered with the lightning of his song   brutes with the memories and desires of men   whose chronicles were writ with iron pen     in the crooked shoulder and the forehead low     set wrong to balance wrong                             20     and physicked woe with woe   ii  they did as they were taught not theirs the blame if men who scattered firebrands reaped the flame   they trampled peace beneath their savage feet     and by her golden tresses drew   mercy along the pavement of the street o freedom freedom is thy morningdew     so gory red alas thy light had neer     shone in upon the chaos of their lair they reared to thee such symbol as they knew               30     and worshipped it with flame and blood     a vengeance axe in hand that stood holding a tyrants head up by the clotted hair   iii  what wrongs the oppressor suffered these we know   these have found piteous voice in song and prose but for the oppressed their darkness and their woe   their grinding centurieswhat muse had those though hall and palace had nor eyes nor ears   hardening a peoples heart to senseless stone thou knewest them o earth that drank their tears      40   o heaven that heard their inarticulate moan they noted down their fetters link by link coarse was the hand that scrawled and red the ink   rude was their score as suits unlettered men notched with a headsmans axe upon a block what marvel if when came the avenging shock   twas atë not urania held the pen   iv  with eye averted and an anguished frown   loathingly glides the muse through scenes of strife where like the heart of vengeance up and down          50   throbs in its framework the bloodmuffled knife slow are the steps of freedom but her feet   turn never backward hers no bloody glare her light is calm and innocent and sweet   and where it enters there is no despair not first on palace and cathedral spire quivers and gleams that unconsuming fire   while these stand black against her morning skies the peasant sees it leap from peak to peak   along his hills the craftsmans burning eyes          60 own with cool tears its influence mothermeek   it lights the poets heart up like a star   ah while the tyrant deemed it still afar and twined

thou wast naught soon as the strip of gold about thy brows   was no more emblem of the peoples thought vain were thy bayonets against the foe   thou hadst to cope with thou didst wage war not with frenchmen merelyno   thy strife was with the spirit of the age the invisible spirit whose first breath divine         89     scattered thy frail endeavor and like poor last years leaves whirled thee and thine       into the dark forever   vii    is here no triumph nay what though the yellow blood of trade meanwhile should pour   along its arteries a shrunken flow and the idle canvas droop around the shore       these do not make a state       nor keep it great       i think god made   the earth for man not trade    100 and where each humblest human creature can stand no more suspicious or

only lit with bestial loves and rages     there i behold a nation         the france which lies           110     between the pyrenees and rhine   is the least part of france i see her rather in the

heap of dust    a parable  said christ our lord i will go and see how the men my brethren believe in me he passed not again through the gate of birth but made himself known to the children of earth  then said the chief priests and rulers and kings behold now the giver of all good things go to let us welcome with pomp and state him who alone is mighty and great  with carpets of gold the ground they spread wherever the son of man should tread and in palacechambers lofty and rare they lodged him and served him with kingly fare  great organs surged through arches dim their jubilant floods in praise of him and in church and palace and judgmenthall he saw his own image high over all  but still wherever his steps they led the lord in sorrow bent down his head and from under the heavy foundationstones the son of mary heard bitter groans  and in church and palace and judgmenthall he marked great fissures that rent the wall and opened wider and yet more wide as the living foundation

truly great was he   go ask it of the poor    the vision of sir launfal  according to the mythology of the romancers the san greal or holy grail was the cup out of which jesus partook of the last supper with his disciples it was brought into england by joseph of arimathea and remained there an object of pilgrimage and adoration for many years in the keeping of his lineal descendants it was incumbent upon those who had charge of it to be chaste in thought word and deed but one of the keepers having broken this condition the holy grail disappeared from that time it was a favorite enterprise of the knights of arthurs court to go in search of it sir galahad was at last successful in finding it as may be read in the seventeenth book of the romance of king arthur tennyson has made sir galahad the subject of one of the most exquisite of his poems  the plot if i may give that name to anything so slight of the following poem is my own and to serve its purposes i have enlarged the circle of competition in search of the miraculous cup in such a manner as to include not only other persons than the heroes of the round table but also a period of time subsequent to the supposed date of king arthurs reign   prelude to part first  over his keys the musing organist   beginning doubtfully and far away first lets his fingers wander as they list   and builds a bridge from dreamland for his lay then as the touch of his loved instrument   gives hope and fervor nearer draws his theme first guessed by faint auroral flushes sent   along the wavering vista of his dream                                         not only around our infancy   doth heaven with all its splendors lie      10   daily with souls that cringe and plot   we sinais climb and know it not  over our manhood bend the skies   against our fallen and traitor lives the great winds utter prophecies   with our faint hearts the mountain strives its arms outstretched the druid wood   waits with its benedicite and to our ages drowsy wood   still shouts the inspiring sea                     20  earth gets its price for what earth gives us   the beggar is taxed for a corner to die in the priest hath his lee who comes and shrives us   we bargain for the graves we lie in at the devils booth are all things sold   each ounce of dross costs its ounce of gold for a cap and bells our lives we pay   bubbles we buy with a whole souls tasking tis heaven alone that is given away   tis only god may be had for the asking             30 no price is set on the lavish summer   june may be had by the poorest comer  and what is so rare as a day in june   then if ever come perfect days then heaven tries earth if it be in tune   and over it softly her warm ear lays whether we look or whether we listen we hear life murmur or see it glisten every clod feels a stir of might   an instinct within it that reaches and towers      40 and groping blindly above it for light   climbs to a soul in grass and flowers the flush of life may well be seen   thrilling back over hills and valleys the cowslip startles in meadows green   the buttercup catches the sun in its chalice and theres never a leaf nor a blade too mean   to be some happy creatures palace the little bird sits at his door in the sun   atilt like a blossom among the leaves              50 and lets his illumined being oerrun   with the deluge of summer it receives his mate feels the eggs beneath her wings   and the heart in her dumb breast flutters and sings he sings to the wide world and she to her nest   in the nice ear of nature which song is the best  now is the hightide of the year   and whatever of life hath ebbed away comes flooding back with a ripply cheer   into every bare inlet and creek and bay            60 now the heart is so full that a drop overfills it we are happy now because god wills it no matter how barren the past may have been tis enough for us now that the leaves are green we sit in the warm shade and feel right well how the sap creeps up and the blossoms swell we may shut our eyes but we cannot help knowing that skies are clear and grass is growing the breeze comes whispering in our ear that dandelions are blossoming near                  70   that maize has sprouted that streams are flowing that the river is bluer than the sky that the robin is plastering his house hard by and if the breeze kept the good news back for other couriers we should not lack   we could guess it all by yon heifers lowing and hark how clear bold chanticleer warmed with the new wine of the year   tells all in his lusty crowing  joy comes grief goes we know not how               80 everything is happy now   everything is upward striving tis as easy now for the heart to be true as for grass to be green or skies to be blue   tis the natural way of living who knows whither the clouds have fled   in the unscarred heaven they leave no wake and the eyes forget the tears they have shed   the heart forgets its sorrow and ache the soul partakes the seasons youth                 90   and the sulphurous rifts of passion and woe lie deep neath a silence pure and smooth   like burntout craters healed with snow what wonder if sir launfal now remembered the keeping of his vow   part first   i  my golden spurs now bring to me   and bring to me my richest mail for tomorrow i go over land and sea   in search of the holy grail shall never a bed for me be spread                   100 nor shall a pillow be under my head till i begin my vow to keep here on the rushes will i sleep and perchance there may come a vision true ere day create the world anew   slowly sir launfals eyes grew dim   slumber fell like a cloud on him and into his soul the vision flew   ii  the crows flapped over by twos and threes in the pool drowsed the cattle up to their knees     110   the little birds sang as if it were   the one day of summer in all the year and the very leaves seemed to sing on the trees the castle alone in the landscape lay like an outpost of winter dull and gray twas the proudest hall in the north countree and never its gates might opened be save to lord or lady of high degree summer besieged it on every side but the churlish stone her assaults defied           120 she could not scale the chilly wall though around it for leagues her pavilions tall stretched left and right over the hills and out of sight   green and broad was every tent   and out of each a murmur went till the breeze fell off at night   iii  the drawbridge dropped with a surly clang and through the dark arch a charger sprang bearing sir launfal the maiden knight               130 in his gilded mail that flamed so bright it seemed the dark castle had gathered all those shafts the fierce sun had shot over its wall   in his siege of three hundred summers long and binding them all in one blazing sheaf   had cast them forth so young and strong and lightsome as a locustleaf sir launfal flashed forth in his maiden mail to seek in all climes for the holy grail   iv  it was morning on hill and stream and tree           140   and morning in the young knights heart only the castle moodily rebuffed the gifts of the sunshine free   and gloomed by itself apart the season brimmed all other things up full as the rain fills the pitcherplants cup   v  as sir launfal made morn through the darksome gate   he was ware of a leper crouched by the same who begged with his hand and moaned as he sate   and a loathing over sir launfal came               150 the sunshine went out of his soul with a thrill   the flesh neath his armor gan shrink and crawl and midway its leap his heart stood still   like a frozen waterfall for this man so foul and bent of stature rasped harshly against his dainty nature and seemed the one blot on the summer morn so he tossed him a piece of gold in scorn   vi  the leper raised not the gold from the dust better to me the poor mans crust                   160 better the blessing of the poor though i turn me empty from his door that is no true alms which the hand can hold he gives only the worthless gold   who gives from a sense of duty but he who gives but a slender mite and gives to that which is out of sight   that thread of the allsustaining beauty which runs through all and doth all unite the hand cannot clasp the whole of his alms          170 the heart outstretches its eager palms for a god goes with it and makes it store to the soul that was starving in darkness before    prelude to part second  down swept the chill wind from the mountain peak   from the snow five thousand summers old on open wold and hilltop bleak   it had gathered all the cold and whirled it like sleet on the wanderers cheek it carried a shiver everywhere from the unleafed boughs and pastures bare      180 the little brook heard it and built a roof neath which he could house him winterproof all night by the white stars frosty gleams he groined his arches and matched his beams slender and clear were his crystal spars as the lashes of light that trim the stars he sculptured every summer delight in his halls and chambers out of sight sometimes his tinkling waters slipt down through a frostleaved forestcrypt      190 long sparkling aisles of steelstemmed trees bending to counterfeit a breeze sometimes the roof no fretwork knew but silvery mosses that downward grew sometimes it was carved in sharp relief with quaint arabesques of icefern leaf sometimes it was simply smooth and clear for the gladness of heaven to shine through and here he had caught the nodding bulrushtops and hung them thickly with diamond drops     200 that crystalled the beams of moon and sun and made a star of every one no mortal builders most rare device could match this winterpalace of ice twas as if every image that mirrored lay in his depths serene through the summer day each fleeting shadow of earth and sky lest the happy model should be lost had been mimicked in fairy masonry by the elfin builders of the frost     210  within the hall are song and laughter   the cheeks of christmas glow red and jolly and sprouting is every corbel and rafter   with lightsome green of ivy and holly through the deep gulf of the chimney wide wallows the yulelogs roaring tide the broad flamepennons droop and flap   and belly and tug as a flag in the wind like a locust shrills the imprisoned sap   hunted to death in its galleries blind     220 and swift little troops of silent sparks   now pausing now scattering away as in fear go threading the sootforests tangled darks   like herds of startled deer  but the wind without was eager and sharp of sir launfals gray hair it makes a harp     and rattles and wrings     the icy strings   singing in dreary monotone   a christmas carol of its own     230   whose burden still as he might guess   was shelterless shelterless shelterless the voice of the seneschal flared like a torch as he shouted the wanderer away from the porch and he sat in the gateway and saw all night   the great hallfire so cheery and bold   through the windowslits of the castle old build out its piers of ruddy light against the drift of the cold   part second   i  there was never a leaf on bush or tree       240 the bare boughs rattled shudderingly the river was dumb and could not speak   for the weaver winter its shroud had spun a single crow on the treetop bleak   from his shining feathers shed off the cold sun again it was morning but shrunk and cold as if her veins were sapless and old and she rose up decrepitly for a last dim look at earth and sea   ii  sir launfal turned from his own hard gate      250 for another heir in his earldom sate an old bent man worn out and frail he came back from seeking the holy grail little he recked of his earldoms loss no more on his surcoat was blazoned the cross but deep in his soul the sign he wore the badge of the suffering and the poor   iii  sir launfals raiment thin and spare was idle mail gainst the barbèd air for it was just at the christmas time         260 so he mused as he sat of a sunnier clime and sought for a shelter from cold and snow in the light and warmth of longago he sees the snakelike caravan crawl oer the edge of the desert black and small then nearer and nearer till one by one he can count the camels in the sun as over the redhot sands they pass to where in its slender necklace of grass the little spring laughed and leapt in the shade      270 and with its own self like an infant played and waved its signal of palms   iv  for christs sweet sake i beg an alms the happy camels may reach the spring but sir launfal sees only the grewsome thing the leper lank as the rainblanched bone that cowers beside him a thing as lone and white as the iceisles of northern seas in the desolate horror of his disease   v  and sir launfal said i behold in thee        280 an image of him who died on the tree thou also hast had thy crown of thorns thou also hast had the worlds buffets and scorns and to thy life were not denied the wounds in the hands and feet and side mild marys son acknowledge me behold through him i give to thee   vi  then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes  and looked at sir launfal and straightway he remembered in what a haughtier guise             290   he had flung an alms to leprosie when he girt his young life up in gilded mail and set forth in search of the holy grail the heart within him was ashes and dust he parted in twain his single crust he broke the ice on the streamlets brink and gave the leper to eat and drink twas a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread   twas water out of a wooden bowl yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed          300 and twas red wine he drank with his thirsty soul   vii  as sir launfal mused with a downcast face a light shone round about the place the leper no longer crouched at his side but stood before him glorified shining and tall and fair and straight as the pillar that stood by the beautiful gate himself the gate whereby men can enter the temple of god in man   viii  his words were shed softer than leaves from the pine     310 and they fell on sir launfal as snows on the brine that mingle their softness and quiet in one with the shaggy unrest they float down upon and the voice that was softer than silence said lo it is i be not afraid in many climes without avail thou hast spent thy life for the holy grail behold it is herethis cup which thou didst fill at the streamlet for me but now this crust is my body broken for thee          320 this water his blood that died on the tree the holy supper is kept indeed in whatso we share with anothers need not what we give but what we share for the gift without the giver is bare who gives himself with his alms feeds three himself his hungering neighbor and me   ix  sir launfal awoke as from a swound the grail in my castle here is found hang my idle armor up on the wall        330 let it be the spiders banquet hall he must be fenced with stronger mail who would seek and find the holy grail   x  the castle gate stands open now   and the wanderer is welcome to the hall as the hangbird is to the elmtree bough   no longer scowl the turrets tall the summers long siege at last is

volumes contents  a glance at a few of our literary progenies  mrs malaprops word  from the tub of diogenes  a vocal and musical medley  that is  a series of jokes  by a wonderful quiz   who accompanies himself with a rubadubdub full of spirit and grace on the top of the tub  set forth in  october the 21st day in the year 48  gp putnam broadway   it being the commonest mode of procedure i premise a few candid remarks  to the reader  this trifle begun to please only myself and my own private fancy was laid on the shelf but some friends who had seen it induced me by dint of saying they liked it to put it in print that is having come to that very conclusion i asked their advice when twould make no confusion for though in the gentlest of ways they had hinted it was scarce worth the while i should doubtless have printed it  i began it intending a fable a frail slender thing rhymeywinged with a sting in its tail but by addings and alterings not previously planned digressions chancehatched like birds eggs in the sand and dawdlings to suit every whimseys demand always freeing the bird which i held in my hand for the two perched perhaps out of reach in the treeit grew by degrees to the size which you see i was like the old woman that carried the calf and my neighbors like hers no doubt wonder and laugh and when my strained arms with their grown burthen full i call it my fable they call it a bull  having scrawled at full gallop as far as that goes in a style that is neither good verse nor bad prose and being a person whom nobody knows some people will say i am rather more free with my readers than it is becoming to be that i seem to expect them to wait on my leisure in following wherever i wander at pleasure that in short i take more than a young authors lawful ease and laugh in a queer way so like mephistopheles that the public will doubt as they grope through my rhythm if in truth i am making fun of them or with them  so the excellent public is hereby assured that the sale of my book is already secured for there is not a poet throughout the whole land but will purchase a copy or two out of hand in the fond expectation of being amused in it by seeing his betters cut up and abused in it now i find by a pretty exact calculation there are something like ten thousand bards in the nation of that special variety whom the review and magazine critics call lofty and true and about thirty thousand this tribe is increasing of the kinds who are termed full of promise and pleasing the public will see by a glance at this schedule that they cannot expect me to be oversedulous about courting them since it seems i have got enough fuel made sure of for boiling my pot  as for such of our poets as find not their names mentioned once in my pages with praises or blames let them send in their cards without further delay to my friend gp putnam esquire in broadway where a list will be kept with the strictest regard to the day and the hour of receiving the card then taking them up as i chance to have time that is if their names can be twisted in rhyme i will honestly give each his proper position at the rate of one author to each new edition thus a premium is offered sufficiently high as the magazines say when they tell their best lie to induce bards to club their resources and buy the balance of every edition until they have all of them fairly been run through the mill  one word to such readers judicious and wise as read books with something behind the mere eyes of whom in the country perhaps there are two including myself gentle reader and you all the characters sketched in this slight jeu desprit though it may be they seem here and there rather free and drawn from a somewhat too cynical standpoint are meant to be faithful for that is the grand point and none but an owl would feel sore at a rub from a jester who tells you without any subterfuge that he sits in diogenes tub    a preliminary note to the second edition  though it well may be reckoned of all composition the species at once most delightful and healthy is a thing which an author unless he be wealthy and willing to pay for that kind of delight is not in all instances called on to write though there are it is said who their spirits to cheer slip in a new titlepage three times a year and in this way snuff up an imaginary savor of that sweetest of dishes the popular favormuch as if a starved painter should fall to and treat the ugolino inside to a picture of meat  you remember if not pray turn backward and look that in writing the preface which ushered my book i treated you excellent public not merely with a cool disregard but downright cavalierly now i would not take back the least thing i then said though i thereby could butter both sides of my bread for i never could see that an author owed aught to the people he solaced diverted or taught and as for mere fame i have long ago learned that the persons by whom it is finally earned are those with whom your verdict weighed not a pin unsustained by the higher court sitting within  but i wander from what i intended to saythat you have namely shown such a liberal way of thinking and so much æsthetic perception of anonymous worth in the handsome reception you gave to my book spite of some private piques having bought the first thousand in barely two weeks that i think past a doubt if you measured the phiz of yours most devotedly wonderful quiz you would find that its vertical section was shorter by an inch and two tenths or twixt that and a quarter  you have watched a child playingin those wondrous years when belief is not bound to the eyes and the ears and the vision divine is so clear and unmarred that each baker of pies in the dirt is a bard give a knife and a shingle he fits out a fleet and on that little mudpuddle over the street his fancy in purest good faith will make sail round the globe with a puff of his breath for a gale will visit in barely ten minutes all climes and do the columbusfeat hundreds of times or suppose the young poet fresh stored with delights from that bible of childhood the arabian nights he will turn to a crony and cry jack lets play that i am a genius jacky straightway makes aladdins lamp out of a stone and for hours they enjoy each his own supernatural powers this is all very pretty and pleasant but then suppose our two urchins have grown into men and both have turned authorsone says to his brother lets play were the american somethings or othersay homer or sophocles goethe or scott only let them be big enough no matter what come you shall be byron or pope which you choose ill be coleridge and both shall write mutual reviews so they both as mere strangers before many days send each other a cord of anonymous bays each piling his epithets smiles in his sleeve to see what his friend can be made to believe each reading the others unbiased review thinksheres pretty high praise but no more than my due well we laugh at them both and yet make no great fuss when the same farce is acted to benefit us even i who it asked scarce a month since what fudge meant should have answered the dear publics critical judgment begin to think sharpwitted horace spoke sooth when he said that the public sometimes hit the truth  in reading these lines you perhaps have a vision of a person in pretty good health and condition and yet since i put forth my primary edition i have been crushed scorched withered used up and put down by smith with the cordial assistance of brown in all if you put any faith in my rhymes to the number of ninetyfive several times and while i am writingi tremble to think of it for i may at this moment be just on the brink of itmolybdostom angry at being omitted has begun a

calumet in your private capacities come when you please i will give you my hand and a fresh pipe apiece  as i ran through the leaves of my poor little book to take a fond authors first tremulous look it was quite an excitement to hunt the errata sprawled in as birds tracks are in some kinds of strata only these made things crookeder fancy an heir that a father had seen born wellfeatured and fair turning suddenly wrynosed clubfooted squinteyed hairlipped wapperjawed carrothaired from a pride become an aversionmy case was yet worse a clubfoot by way of a change in a verse i might have forgiven an os being wry a limp in an e or a cock in an ibut to have the sweet babe of my brain served in pi i am not queasystomached but such a thyestean banquet as that was quite out of the question  in the edition now issued no pains are neglected and my verses as orators say stand corrected yet some blunders remain of the publics own make which i wish to correct for my personal sake for instance a character drawn in pure fun and condensing the traits of a dozen in one has been as i hear by some persons applied to a good friend of mine whom to stab in the side as we walked along chatting and joking together would not be my way i can hardly tell whether a question will ever arise in which he and i should by any strange fortune agree but meanwhile my esteem for him grows as i know him and though not the best judge on earth of a poem he knows what it is he is saying and why and is honest and fearless two good points which i have not found so rife i can easily smother my love for them whether on my side or tother  for my other anonymi you may be sure that i know what is meant by a caricature and what by a portrait there are those who think it is capital fun to be spattering their ink on quiet unquarrelsome folk but the minute the game changes sides and the others begin it they see something savage and horrible in it as for me i respect neither women nor men for their gender nor own any sex in a pen i choose just to hint to some causeless unfriends that as far as i know there are always two ends and one of them heaviest too to a staff and two parties also to every good laugh     a fable for critics     phoebus sitting one day in a laureltrees shade was reminded of daphne of whom it was made for the god being one day too warm in his wooing she took to the tree to escape his pursuing be the cause what it might from his offers she shrunk and ginevralike shut herself up in a trunk and though twas a step into which he had driven her he somehow or other had never forgiven her her memory he nursed as a kind of a tonic something bitter to chew when hed play the byronic      10 and i cant count the obstinate nymphs that he brought over by a strange kind of smile he put on when he thought of her my case is like didos he sometimes remarked when i last saw my love she was fairly embarked in a laurel as she thoughtbut ah how fate mocks she has found it by this time a very bad box let hunters from me take this saw when they need it youre not always sure of your game when youve treed it just conceive such a change taking place in ones mistress what romance would be leftwho can flatter or kiss trees      20 and for mercys sake how could one keep up a dialogue with a dull wooden thing that will live and will die a log not to say that the thought would forever intrude that youve less chance to win her the more she is wood ah it went to my heart and the memory still grieves to see those loved graces all taking their leaves those charms beyond speech so enchanting but now as they left me forever each making its bough if her tongue had a tang sometimes more than was right her new bark is worse than ten times her old bite      30    now daphnebefore she was happily treeified over all other blossoms the lily had deified and when she expected the god on a visit twas before he had made his intentions explicit some buds she arranged with a vast deal of care to look as if artlessly twined in her hair where they seemed as he said when he paid his addresses like the day breaking through the long night of her tresses so whenever he wished to be quite irresistible like a man with eight trumps in his hand at a whisttable      40 i feared me at first that the rhyme was untwistable though i might have lugged in an allusion to cristabel he would take up a lily and gloomily look in it as i shall at the when they cut up my book in it    well here after all the bad rhyme ive been spinning ive got back at last to my storys beginning sitting there as i say in the shade of his mistress as dull as a volume of old chester mysteries or as those puzzling specimens which in old histories we read of his versesthe oracles namely    50 i wonder the greeks should have swallowed them tamely for one might bet safely whatever he has to risk they were laid at his door by some ancient miss asterisk and so dull that the men who retailed them outdoors got the ill name of augurs because they were bores first he mused what the animal substance or herb is would induce a mustache for you know hes imberbis then he shuddered to think how his youthful position was assailed by the age of his son the physician at some poems he glanced had been sent to him lately      60 and the metre and sentiment puzzled him greatly mehercle id make such proceeding felonious have they all of them slept in the cave of trophonius look well to your seat tis like taking an airing on a corduroy road and that out of repairing it leads one tis true through the primitive forest grand natural features but then one has no rest you just catch a glimpse of some ravishing distance when a jolt puts the whole of it out of existence why not use their ears if they happen to have any      70 here the laurel leaves murmured the name of poor daphne    oh weep with me daphne he sighed for you know its a terrible thing to be pestered with poets but alas she is dumb and the proverb holds good she never will cry till shes out of the wood what wouldnt i give if i never had known of her twere a kind of relief had i something to groan over if i had but some letters of hers now to toss over i might turn for the nonce a byronic philosopher and bewitch all the flats by bemoaning the loss of her      80 one needs something tangible though to begin on a loom as it were for the fancy to spin on what boots all your grist it can never be ground till a breeze makes the arms of the windmill go round or if tis a watermill alter the metaphor and say it wont stir save the wheel be well wet afore or lug in some stuff about water so dreamily it is not a metaphor though tis a simile a lily perhaps would set my mill agoing for just at this season i think they are blowing      90 here somebody fetch one not very far hence theyre in bloom by the score tis but climbing a fence theres a poet hard by who does nothing but fill his whole garden from one end to tother with lilies a very good plan were it not for satiety one longs for a weed here and there for variety though a weed is no more than a flower in disguise which is seen through at once if love give a man eyes    now there happened to be among phoebuss followers a gentleman one of the omnivorous swallowers      100 who bolt every book that comes out of the press without the least question of larger or less whose stomachs are strong at the expense of their head for reading new books is like eating new bread one can bear it at first but by gradual steps he is brought to deaths door of a mental dyspepsy on a previous stage of existence our hero had ridden outside with the glass below zero he had been tis a fact you may safely rely on of a very old stock a most eminent scion     110 a stock all fresh quacks their fierce boluses ply on who stretch the new boots earths unwilling to try on whom humbugs of all shapes and sorts keep their eye on whose hairs in the mortar of every new zion who when whistles are dear go directly and buy one who think slavery a crime that we must not say fie on who hunt if they eer hunt at all with the lion though they hunt lions also whenever they spy one who contrive to make every good fortune a wry one and at last choose the hard bed of honor to die on      120 whose pedigree traced to earths earliest years is longer than anything else but their ears in short he was sent into life with the wrong key he unlocked the door and stept forth a poor donkey though kicked and abused by his bipedal betters yet he filled no mean place in the kingdom of letters far happier than many a literary hack he bore only papermill rags on his back for it makes a vast difference which side the mill one expends on the paper his labor and skill      130 so when his soul waited a new transmigration and destiny balanced twixt this and that station not having much time to expend upon bothers remembering hed had some connection with authors and considering his four legs had grown paralytic she set him on two and he came forth a critic    through his babyhood no kind of pleasure he took in any amusement but tearing a book for him there was no intermediate stage from babyhood up to straightlaced middle age      140 there were years when he didnt wear coattails behind but a boy he could never be rightly defined like the irish good folk though in length scarce a span from the womb he came gravely a little old man while other boys trousers demanded the toil of the motherly fingers on all kinds of soil red yellow brown black clayey gravelly loamy he sat in the corner and read viri romæ he never was known to unbend or to revel once in base marbles hockey or kick up the devil once      150 he was just one of those who excite the benevolence of your old prigs who sound the souls depths with a ledger and are on the lookout for some young men to edger cate as they call it who wont be too costly and wholl afterward take to the ministry mostly who always wear spectacles always look bilious always keep on good terms with each materfamilias throughout the whole parish and manage to rear ten boys like themselves on four hundred a year who fulfilling in turn the same fearful conditions      160 either preach through their noses or go upon missions  in this way our hero got safely to college where he bolted alike both his commons and knowledge a readingmachine always wound up and going he mastered whatever was not worth the knowing appeared in a gown with black waistcoat of satin to spout such a gothic oration in latin that tully could never have made out a word in it though himself was the model the author preferred in it and grasping the parchment which gave him in fee      170 all the mystic andsoforths contained in ab he was launched life is always compared to a sea with just enough learning and skill for the using it to prove hed a brain by forever confusing it so worthy st benedict piously burning with the holiest zeal against secular learning nesciensque scienter as writers express it indoctusque sapienter a roma recessit    twould be endless to tell you the things that he knew each a separate fact undeniably true     180 but with him or each other theyd nothing to do no power of combining arranging discerning digested the masses he learned into learning there was one thing in life he had practical knowledge for and this you will think he need scarce go to college for not a deed would he do nor a word would he utter till hed weighed its relations to plain bread and butter when he left alma mater he practised his wits in compiling the journals historical bits of shops broken open men falling in fits     190 great fortunes in england bequeathed to poor printers and cold spells the coldest for many past winters then rising by industry knack and address got notices up for an unbiased press with a mind so well poised it seemed equally made for applause or abuse just which chanced to be paid for from this point his progress was rapid and sure to the post of a regular heavy reviewer    and here i must say he wrote excellent articles on hebraical points or the force of greek particles     200 they filled up the space nothing else was prepared for and nobody read that which nobody cared for if any old book reached a fiftieth edition he could fill forty pages with safe erudition he could gauge the old books by the old set of rules and his very old nothings pleased very old fools but give him a new book fresh out of the heart and you put him at sea without compass or chart his blunders aspired to the rank of an art for his lore was engraft something foreign that grew in him     210 exhausting the sap of the native and true in him so that when a man came with a soul that was new in him carving new forms of truth out of natures old granite new and old at their birth like le verriers planet which to get a true judgment themselves must create in the soul of their critic the measure and weight being rather themselves a fresh standard of grace to compute their own judge and assign him his place our reviewer would crawl all about it and round it and reporting each circumstance just as he found it     220 without the least malicehis record would be profoundly æsthetic as that of a flea which supping on wordsworth should print for our sakes recollections of nights with the bard of the lakes or lodged by an arab guide ventured to render a comprehensive account of the ruins at denderah    as i said he was never precisely unkind the defect in his brain was just absence of mind if he boasted twas simply that he was selfmade a position which i for one never gainsaid     230 my respect for my maker supposing a skill in his works which our hero would answer but ill and i trust that the mould which he used may be cracked or he made bold by success may enlarge his phylactery and set up a kind of a manmanufactory an event which i shudder to think about seeing that man is a moral accountable being    he meant well enough but was still in the way as dunces still are let them be where they may indeed they appear to come into existence     240 to impede other folks with their awkward assistance if you set up a dunce on the very north pole all alone with himself i believe on my soul hed manage to get betwixt somebodys shins and pitch him down bodily all in his sins to the grave polar bears sitting round on the ice all shortening their grace to be in for a slice or if he found nobody else there to pother why one of his legs would just trip up the other for theres nothing we read of in tortures inventions     250 like a wellmeaning dunce with the best of intentions    a terrible fellow to meet in society not the toast that he buttered was ever so dry at tea there hed sit at the table and stir in his sugar crouching close for a spring all the while like a cougar be sure of your facts of your measures and weights of your timehes as fond as an arab of dates youll be telling perhaps in your comical way of something youve seen in the course of the day and just as youre tapering out the conclusion     260 you venture an illfated classic allusion the girls have all got their laughs ready when whack the cougar comes down on your thunderstruck back you had left out a commayour greeks put in joint and pointed at cost of your storys whole point in the course of the evening you find chance for certain soft speeches to anne in the shade of the curtain you tell her your heart can be likened to one flower and that o most charming of women s the sunflower which turnshere a clear nasal voice to your terror     270 from outside the curtain says thats all an error as for him hesno matter he never grew tender sitting after a ball with his feet on the fender shaping somebodys sweet features out of cigar smoke though hed willingly grant you that such doings are smoke all women he damns with mutabile semper and if ever he felt something like loves distemper twas towrds a young lady who spoke ancient mexican and assisted her father in making a lexicon though i recollect hearing him get quite ferocious      280 about mary clausum the mistress of grotius or something of that sortbut no more to bore ye with characterpainting ill turn to my story    now apollo who finds it convenient sometimes to get his court clear of the makers of rhymes the genus i think it is called irritabile every one of whom thinks himself treated most shabbily and nurses awhat is itimmedicabile which keeps him at boilingpoint hot for a quarrel as bitter as wormwood and sourer than sorrel      290 if any poor devil but look at a laurel apollo i say being sick of their rioting though he sometimes acknowledged their verse had a quieting effect after dinner and seemed to suggest a retreat to the shrine of a tranquil siesta kept our hero at hand who by means of a bray which he gave to the life drove the rabble away and if that wouldnt do he was sure to succeed if he took his review out and offered to read or failing in plans of this milder description      300 he would ask for their aid to get up a subscription considering that authorship wasnt a rich craft to print the american drama of witchcraft stay ill read you a scenebut he hardly began ere apollo shrieked help and the authors all ran and once when these purgatives acted with less spirit and the desperate case asked a remedy desperate he drew from his pocket a foolscap epistle as calmly as if twere a ninebarrelled pistol and threatened them all with the judgment to come      310 of a wandering stars first impressions of rome stop stop with their hands oer their ears screamed the muses he may go off and murder himself if he chooses twas a means selfdefence only sanctioned his trying tis mere massacre now that the enemys flying if hes forced to t again and we happen to be there give us each a large handkerchief soaked in strong ether    i called this a fable for critics you think its more like a display of my rhythmical trinkets my plot like an icicles slender and slippery      320 every moment more slender and likely to slip awry and the reader unwilling in loco desipere is free to jump over as much of my frippery as he fancies and if hes a provident skipper he may have like odysseus control of the gales and get safe to port ere his patience quite fails moreover although tis a slender return for your toil and expense yet my paper will burn and if you have manfully struggled thus far with me you may een twist me up and just light your cigar with me      330 if too angry for that you can tear me in pieces and my membra disjecta consign to the breezes a fate like great ratzaus whom one of those bores who beflead with bad verses poor louis quatorze describes the first verse somehow ends with victoire as dispersant partout et ses membres et sa gloire or if i were overdesirous of earning a repute among noodles for classical learning i could pick you a score of allusions iwis as new as the jests of didaskalos tis      340 better still i could make out a good solid list from authors recondite who do not exist but that would be naughty at least i could twist something out of absyrtus or turn your inquiries after miltons prose metaphor drawn from osiris but as cicero says he wont say this or that a fetch i must say most transparent and flat after saying whateer he could possibly think of i simply will state that i pause on the brink of a mire ankledeep of deliberate confusion      350 made up of old jumbles of classic allusion so when you were thinking yourselves to be pitied just conceive how much harder your teeth youd have gritted an twere not for the dulness ive kindly omitted    id apologize here for my many digressions were it not that im certain to trip into fresh ones tis so hard to escape if you get in their mesh once just reflect if you please how tis said by horatius that mæonides nods now and then and my gracious it certainly does look a little bit ominous      360 when he gets under way with ton dapameibomenos here a something occurs which ill just clap a rhyme to and say it myself ere a zoilus have time to any author a nap like van winkles may take if he only contrive to keep readers awake but hell very soon find himself laid on the shelf if they fall anodding when he nods himself    once for all to return and to stay will i nill i when phoebus expressed his desire for a lily our hero whose homoeopathic sagacity          370 with an ocean of zeal mixed his drop of capacity set off for the garden as fast as the wind or to take a comparison more to my mind as a sound politician leaves conscience behind and leaped the low fence as a party hack jumps oer his principles when something else turns up trumps    he was gone a long time and apollo meanwhile went over some sonnets of his with a file for of all compositions he thought that the sonnet best repaid all the toil you expended upon it      380 it should reach with one impulse the end of its course and for one final blow collect all of its force not a verse should be salient but each one should tend with a wavelike upgathering to break at the end so condensing the strength here there smoothing a wry kink he was killing the time when up walked mr d at a few steps behind him a small man in glasses went dodging about muttering murderers asses from out of his pocket a paper hed take with a proud look of martyrdom tied to its stake      390 and reading a squib at himself hed say here i see gainst american letters a bloody conspiracy they are all by my personal enemies written i must post an anonymous letter to britain and show that this gall is the merest suggestion of spite at my zeal on the copyright question for on this side the water tis prudent to pull oer the eyes of the public their national wool by accusing of slavish respect to john bull all american authors who have more or less      400 of that antiamerican humbugsuccess while in private were always embracing the knees of some twopenny editor over the seas and licking his critical shoes for you know tis the whole aim of our lives to get one english notice my american puffs i would willingly burn all theyre all from one source monthly weekly diurnal to get but a kick from a transmarine journal    so culling the gibes of each critical scorner as if they were plums and himself were jack horner      410 he came cautiously on peeping round every corner and into each hole where a weasel might pass in expecting the knife of some critic assassin who stabs to the heart with a caricature not so bad as those daubs of the sun to be sure yet done with a daggerotype whose vile portraits disperse all ones good and condense all ones poor traits    apollo looked up hearing footsteps approaching and slipped out of sight the new rhymes he was broaching good day mr d im happy to meet      420 with a scholar so ripe and a critic so neat who through grub street the soul of a gentleman carries what news from that suburb of london and paris which latterly makes such shrill claims to monopolize the credit of being the new worlds metropolis    why nothing of consequence save this attack on my friend there behind by some pitiful hack who thinks every national author a poor one that isnt a copy of something thats foreign      429 and assaults the american dick                                   nay tis clear that your damon theres fond of a flea in his ear and if no one else furnished them gratis on tick he would buy some himself just to hear the old click why i honestly think if some fool in japan should turn up his nose at the poems on man which contain many verses as fine by the bye as any that lately came under my eye your friend there by some inward instinct would know it would get it translated reprinted and show it as a man might take off a high stock to exhibit      440 the autograph round his own neck of the gibbet nor would let it rest so but fire column after column signed cato or brutus or something as solemn by way of displaying his critical crosses and tweaking that poor transatlantic proboscis his broadsides resulting this last theres no doubt of in successively sinking the craft theyre fired out of now nobody knows when an author is hit if he have not a public hysterical fit let him only keep close in his snug garrets dim ether      450 and nobodyd think of his foesor of him either if an author have any least fibre of worth in him abuse would but tickle the organ of mirth in him all the critics on earth cannot crush with their ban one word thats in tune with the nature of man    well perhaps so meanwhile i have brought you a book into which if youll just have the goodness to look you may feel so delighted when once you are through it as to deem it not unworth your while to review it and i think i can promise your thoughts if you do      460 a place in the next democratic review    the most thankless of gods you must surely have thought me for this is the fortyfourth copy youve brought me i have given them away or at least i have tried but ive fortytwo left standing all side by side the man who accepted that one copy died from one end of a shelf to the other they reach with the authors respects neatly written in each the publisher sure will proclaim a te deum when he hears of that order the british museum      470 has sent for one set of what books were first printed in america little or bigfor tis hinted that this is the first truly tangible hope he has ever had raised for the sale of a copy ive thought very often twould be a good thing in all public collections of books if a wing were set off by itself like the seas from the dry lands marked literature suited to desolate islands and filled with such books as could never be read save by readers of proofs forced to do it for bread     480 such books as ones wrecked on in small country taverns such as hermits might mortify over in caverns such as satan if printing had then been invented as the climax of woe would to job have presented such as crusoe might dip in although there are few so outrageously cornered by fate as poor crusoe and since the philanthropists just now are banging and gibbeting all whore in favor of hanging though cheever has proved that the bible and altar were let down from heaven at the end of a halter      490 and that vital religion would dull and grow callous unrefreshed now and then with a sniff of the gallows and folks are beginning to think it looks odd to choke a poor scamp for the glory of god and that he who esteems the virginia reel a bait to draw saints from their spiritual weal and regards the quadrille as a far greater knavery than crushing his african children with slavery since all who take part in a waltz or cotillon are mounted for hell on the devils own pillion      500 who as every true orthodox christian well knows approaches the heart through the door of the toes that he i was saying whose judgments are stored for such as take steps in despite of his word should look with delight on the agonized prancing of a wretch who has not the least ground for his dancing while the state standing by sings a verse from the psalter about offering to god on his favorite halter and when the legs droop from their twitching divergence sells the clothes to a jew and the corpse to the surgeons now instead of all this i think i can direct you all      511 to a criminal code both humane and effectual i propose to shut up every doer of wrong with these desperate books for such term short or long as by statute in such cases made and provided shall be by your wise legislators decided thus let murderers be shut to grow wiser and cooler at hard labor for life on the works of miss petty thieves kept from flagranter crimes by their fears shall peruse yankee doodle a blank term of years    520 that american punch like the english no doubt just the sugar and lemons and spirit left out    but stay here comes tityrus griswold and leads on the flocks whom he first plucks alive and then feeds on a loudcackling swarm in whose leathers warm drest he goes for as perfect aswan as the rest    there comes emerson first whose rich words every one are like gold nails in temples to hang trophies on whose prose is grand verse while his verse the lord knows is some of it pr no tis not even prose      530 im speaking of metres some poems have welled from those rare depths of soul that have neer been excelled theyre not epics but that doesnt matter a pin in creating the only hard things to begin a grassblades no easier to make than an oak if youve once found the way youve achieved the grand stroke in the worst of his poems are mines of rich matter but thrown in a heap with a crash and a clatter now it is not one thing nor another alone makes a poem but rather the general tone       540 the something pervading uniting the whole the before unconceived unconceivable soul so that just in removing this trifle or that you take away as it were a chief limb of the statue roots wood bark and leaves singly perfect may be but clapt hodgepodge together they dont make a tree    but to come back to emerson whom by the way i believe we left waitinghis is we may say a greek head on right yankee shoulders whose range has olympus for one pole for tother the exchange      550 he seems to my thinking although im afraid the comparison must long ere this have been made a plotinusmontaigne where the egyptians gold mist and the gascons shrewd wit cheekbyjowl coexist all admire and yet scarcely six converts hes got to i dont nor they either exactly know what for though he builds glorious temples tis odd he leaves never a doorway to get in a god tis refreshing to oldfashioned people like me to meet such a primitive pagan as he      560 in whose mind all creation is duly respected as parts of himselfjust a little projected and whos willing to worship the stars and the sun a convert tonothing but emerson so perfect a balance there is in his head that he talks of things sometimes as if they were dead life nature love god and affairs of that sort he looks at as merely ideas in short as if they were fossils stuck round in a cabinet of such vast extent that our earths a mere dab in it      570 composed just as he is inclined to conjecture her namely one part pure earth ninetynine parts pure lecturer you are filled with delight at his clear demonstration each figure word gesture just fits the occasion with the quiet precision of science hell sort em but you cant help suspecting the whole a post mortem    there are persons moleblind to the souls make and style who insist on a likeness twixt him and carlyle to compare him with plato would be vastly fairer carlyles the more burly but e is the rarer      580 he sees fewer objects but clearlier truelier if cs as original es more peculiar that hes more of a man you might say of the one of the other hes more of an emerson cs the titan as shaggy of mind as of limb e the cleareyed olympian rapid and slim the ones two thirds norseman the other half greek where the ones most abounding the others to seek cs generals require to be seen in the mass es specialties gain if enlarged by the glass      590 c gives nature and god his own fits of the blues and rims commonsense things with mystical hues e sits in a mystery calm and intense and looks coolly around him with sharp commonsense c shows you how everyday matters unite with the dim transdiurnal recesses of night while e in a plain preternatural way makes mysteries matters of mere every day c draws all his characters quite à la fuseli not sketching their bundles of muscles and thews illy      600 he paints with a brush so untamed and profuse they seem nothing but bundles of muscles and thews e is rather like flaxman lines strait and severe and a colorless outline but full round and clear to the men he thinks worthy he frankly accords the design of a white marble statue in words c labors to get at the centre and then take a reckoning from there of his actions and men e calmly assumes the said centre as granted and given himself has whatever is wanted      610    he has imitators in scores who omit no part of the man but his wisdom and wit who go carefully oer the skyblue of his brain and when he has skimmed it once skim it again if at all they resemble him you may be sure it is because their shoals mirror his mists and obscurities as a mudpuddle seems deep as heaven for a minute while a cloud that floats oer is reflected within it    there comes for instance to see hims rare sport tread in emersons tracks with legs painfully short      620 how he jumps how he strains and gets red in the face to keep step with the mystagogues natural pace he follows as close as a stick to a rocket his fingers exploring the prophets each pocket fie for shame brother bard with good fruit of your own cant you let neighbor emersons orchards alone besides tis no use youll not find een a core  has picked up all the windfalls before they might strip every tree and e never would catch em his hesperides have no rude dragon to watch em      630 when they send him a dishful and ask him to try em he never suspects how the sly rogues came by em he wonders why tis there are none such his trees on and thinks em the best he has tasted this season    yonder calm as a cloud alcott stalks in a dream and fancies himself in thy groves academe with the parthenon nigh and the olivetrees oer him and never a fact to perplex him or bore him with a snug room at platos when night comes to walk to and people from morning till midnight to talk to      640 and from midnight till morning nor snore in their listening so he muses his face with the joy of it glistening for his highest conceit of a happiest state is where theyd live upon acorns and hear him talk gratis and indeed i believe no man ever talked better each sentence hangs perfectly poised to a letter he seems piling words but theres royal dust hid in the heart of each skypiercing pyramid while he talks he is great but goes out like a taper if you shut him up closely with pen ink and paper      650 yet his fingers itch for em from morning till night and he thinks he does wrong if he dont always write in this as in all things a lamb among men he goes to sure death when he goes to his pen    close behind him is brownson his mouth very full with attempting to gulp a gregorian bull who contrives spite of that to pour out as he goes a stream of transparent and forcible prose he shifts quite about then proceeds to expound that tis merely the earth not himself that turns round and wishes it clearly impressed on your mind       661 that the weathercock rules and not follows the wind proving first then as deftly confuting each side with no doctrine pleased thats not somewhere denied he lays the denier away on the shelf and thendown beside him lies gravely himself hes the salt river boatman who always stands willing to convey friend or foe without charging a shilling and so fond of the trip that when leisures to spare hell row himself up if he cant get a fare      670 the worst of it is that his logics so strong that of two sides he commonly chooses the wrong if there is only one why hell split it in two and first pummel this half then that black and blue that whites white needs no proof but it takes a deep fellow to prove it jetblack and that jetblack is yellow he offers the true faith to drink in a sieve when it reaches your lips theres naught left to believe but a few sillysyllo i meangisms that squat em like tadpoles oerjoyed with the mud at the bottom      680    there is willis all natty and jaunty and gay who says his best things in so foppish a way with conceits and pet phrases so thickly oerlaying em that one hardly knows whether to thank him for saying em overornament ruins both poem and prose just conceive of a muse with a ring in her nose his prose had a natural grace of its own and enough of it too if hed let it alone but he twitches and jerks so one fairly gets tired and is forced to forgive where one might have admired      690 yet whenever it slips away free and unlaced it runs like a stream with a musical waste and gurgles along with the liquidest sweep tis not deep as a river but whod have it deep in a country where scarcely a village is found that has not its author sublime and profound for some one to be slightly shallows a duty and williss shallowness makes half his beauty his prose winds along with a blithe gurgling error and reflects all of heaven it can see in its mirror      700 tis a narrowish strip but it is not an artifice tis the true outofdoors with its genuine hearty phiz it is nature herself and theres something in that since most brains reflect but the crown of a hat few volumes i know to read under a tree more truly delightful than his a labri with the shadows of leaves flowing over your book like rippleshades netting the bed of a brook with june coming softly your shoulder to look over breezes waiting to turn every leaf of your book over      710 and nature to criticise still as you read the page that bears that is a rare one indeed    hes so innate a cockney that had he been born where plain bareskins the only fulldress that is worn hed have given his own such an air that youd say t had been made by a tailor to lounge in broadway his natures a glass of champagne with the foam on t as tender as fletcher as witty as beaumont so his best things are done in the flush of the moment if he wait all is spoiled he may stir it and shake it      720 but the fixed air once gone he can never remake it he might be a marvel of easy delightfulness if he would not sometimes leave the r out of sprightfulness and he ought to let scripture alonetis selfslaughter for nobody likes inspirationandwater hed have been just the fellow to sup at the mermaid cracking jokes at rare ben with an eye to the barmaid his wit running up as canary ran down the topmost bright bubble on the wave of the town    here comes parker the orson of parsons a man      730 whom the church undertook to put under her ban the church of socinus i meanhis opinions being soultracinian they shocked the socinians they believedfaith im puzzledi think i may call their belief a believing in nothing at all or something of that sort i know they all went for a general union of total dissent he went a step farther without cough or hem he frankly avowed he believed not in them and before he could be jumbled up or prevented      740 from their orthodox kind of dissent he dissented there was heresy here you perceive for the right of privately judging means simply that light has been granted to me for deciding on you and in happier times before atheism grew the deed contained clauses for cooking you too now at xerxes and knut we all laugh yet our foot with the same wave is wet that mocked xerxes and knut and we all entertain a secure private notion that our thus far will have a great weight with the ocean twas so with our liberal christians they bore      751 with sincerest conviction their chairs to the shore they brandished their worn theological birches bade natural progress keep out of the churches and expected the lines they had drawn to prevail with the fastrising tide to keep out of their pale they had formerly dammed the pontifical see and the same thing they thought would do nicely for p but he turned up his nose at their mumming and shamming and cared shall i say not a d for their damming      760 so they first read him out of their church and next minute turned round and declared he had never been in it but the ban was too small or the man was too big for he recks not their bells books and candles a fig he scarce looks like a man who would stay treated shabbily sophroniscus sons head oer the features of rabelais he bangs and bethwacks themtheir backs he salutes with the whole tree of knowledge torn up by the roots his sermons with satire are plenteously verjuiced and he talks in one breath of confutzee cass

a bore all the names you have ever or not heard before and when youve done thatwhy invent a few more his hearers cant tell you on sunday beforehand if in that days discourse theyll be bibled or koraned for hes seized the idea by his martyrdom fired that all men not orthodox may be inspired yet though wisdom profane with his creed he may weave in he makes it quite clear what he doesnt believe in      791 while some who decry him think all kingdom come is a sort of a kind of a species of hum of which as it were so to speak not a crumb would be left if we didnt keep carefully mum and to make a clean breast that tis perfectly plain that all kinds of wisdom are somewhat profane now ps creed than this may be lighter or darker but in one thing tis clear he has faith namelyparker and this is what makes him the crowddrawing preacher      800 theres a background of god to each hardworking feature every word that he speaks has been fierily furnaced in the blast of a life that has struggled in earnest there he stands looking more like a ploughman than priest if not dreadfully awkward not graceful at least his gestures all downright and same if you will as of brownfisted hobnail in hoeing a drill but his periods fall on you stroke after stroke like the blows of a lumberer felling an oak you forget the man wholly youre thankful to meet      810 with a preacher who smacks of the field and the street and to hear youre not overparticular whence almost taylors profusion quite latimers sense    there is bryant as quiet as cool and as dignified as a smooth silent iceberg that never is ignified save when by reflection tis kindled o nights with a semblance of flame by the chill northern lights he may rank griswold says so first bard of your nation theres no doubt that he stands in supreme iceolation your topmost parnassus he may set his heel on      820 but no warm applauses come peal following peal on hes too smooth and too polished to hang any zeal on unqualified merits ill grant if you choose he has em but he lacks the one merit of kindling enthusiasm if he stir you at all it is just on my soul like being stirred up with the very north pole    he is very nice reading in summer but inter nos we dont want extra freezing in winter take him up in the depth of july my advice is when you feel an egyptian devotion to ices      830 but deduct all you can theres enough thats right good in him he has a true soul for field river and wood in him and his heart in the midst of brick walls or whereer it is glows softens and thrills with the tenderest charities to you mortals that delve in this traderidden planet no to old berkshires hills with their limestone and granite if youre one who in loco add foco here desipis you will get out of his outermost heart as i guess a piece but youd get deeper down if you came as a precipice and would break the last seal of its inwardest fountain      840 if you only could palm yourself off for a mountain mr quivis or somebody quite as discerning some scholar whos hourly expecting his learning calls b the american wordsworth but wordsworth may be rated at more than your whole tuneful herds worth no dont be absurd hes an excellent bryant but my friends youll endanger the life of your client by attempting to stretch him up into a giant if you choose to compare him i think there are two per sons fit for a parallelthomson and cowper2      850 i dont mean exactlytheres something of each theres ts love of nature cs penchant to preach just mix up their minds so that cs spice of craziness shall balance and neutralize ts turn for laziness and it gives you a brain cool quite frictionless quiet whose internal police nips the buds of all riot a brain like a permanent straitjacket put on the heart that strives vainly to burst off a button a brain which without being slow or mechanic does more than a larger less drilled more volcanic      860 hes a cowper condensed with no craziness bitten and the advantage that wordsworth before him had written    but my dear little bardlings dont prick up your ears nor suppose i would rank you and bryant as peers if i call him an iceberg i dont mean to say there is nothing in that which is grand in its way he is almost the one of your poets that knows how much grace strength and dignity lie in repose if he sometimes fall short he is too wise to mar his thoughts modest fulness by going too far      870 t would be well if your authors should all make a trial of what virtue there is in severe selfdenial and measure their writings by hesiods staff which teaches that all has less value than half    there is whittier whose swelling and vehement heart strains the straitbreasted drab of the quaker apart and reveals the live man still supreme and erect underneath the bemummying wrappers of sect there was neer a man born who had more of the swing of the true lyric bard and all that kind of thing      880 and his failures arise though he seem not to know it from the very same cause that has made him a poet a fervor of mind which knows no separation twixt simple excitement and pure inspiration as my pythoness erst sometimes erred from not knowing if twere i or mere wind through her tripod was blowing let his mind once get head in its favorite direction and the torrent of verse bursts the dams of reflection while borne with the rush of the metre along the poet may chance to go right or go wrong      890 content with the whirl and delirium of song then his grammars not always correct nor his rhymes and hes prone to repeat his own lyrics sometimes not his best though for those are struck off at whiteheats when the heart in his breast like a triphammer beats and can neer be repeated again any more than they could have been carefully plotted before like old whatshisname there at the battle of hastings who however gave more than mere rhythmical bastings our quaker leads off metaphorical fights      900 for reform and whatever they call human rights both singing and striking in front of the war and hitting his foes with the mallet of thor anne haec one exclaims on beholding his knocks vestis filii tui o leatherclad fox can that be thy son in the battles mid din preaching brotherly love and then driving it in to the brain of the tough old goliath of sin with the smoothest of pebbles from castalys spring impressed on his hard moral sense with a sling      910    all honor and praise to the righthearted bard who was true to the voice when such service was hard who himself was so free he dared sing for the slave when to look but a protest in silence was brave all honor and praise to the women and men who spoke out for the dumb and the downtrodden then it needs not to name them already for each i see history preparing the statue and niche they were harsh but shall you be so shocked at hard words who have beaten your pruninghooks up into swords      920 whose rewards and hurrahs men are surer to gain by the reaping of men and of women than grain why should you stand aghast at their fierce wordy war if you scalp one another for bank or for tariff your calling them cutthroats and knaves all day long doesnt prove that the use of hard language is wrong while the worlds heart beats quicker to think of such men as signed tyrannys doom with a bloody steelpen while on fourthofjulys beardless orators fright one with hints at harmodius and aristogeiton                 930 you need not look shy at your sisters and brothers who stab with sharp words for the freedom of others no a wreath twine a wreath for the loyal and true who for sake of the many dared stand with the few not of bloodspattered laurel for enemies braved but of broad peaceful oakleaves for citizens saved    here comes dana abstractedly loitering along involved in a paulopostfuture of song wholl be going to write whatll never be written till the muse ere he think of it gives him the mitten   940 who is so well aware of how things should be done that his own works displease him before theyre begun who so well all that makes up good poetry knows that the best of his poems is written in prose all saddled and bridled stood pegasus waiting he was booted and spurred but he loitered debating in a very grave question his soul was immersed which foot in the stirrup he ought to put first and while this point and that he judicially dwelt on he somehow or other had written paul felton              950 whose beauties or faults whichsoever you see there youll allow only genius could hit upon either that he once was the idle man none will deplore but i fear he will never be anything more the ocean of song heaves and glitters before him the depth and the vastness and longing sweep oer him he knows every breaker and shoal on the chart he has the coast pilot and so on by heart yet he spends his whole life like the man in the fable in learning to swim on his library table               960    there swaggers john neal who has wasted in maine the sinews and cords of his pugilist brain who might have been poet but that in its stead he preferred to believe that he was so already too hasty to wait till arts ripe fruit should drop he must pelt down an unripe and colicky crop who took to the law and had this sterling plea for it it required him to quarrel and paid him a fee for it a man whos made less than he might have because he always has thought himself more than he was    970 who with very good natural gifts as a bard broke the strings of his lyre out by striking too hard and cracked half the notes of a truly fine voice because song drew less instant attention than noise ah men do not know how much strength is in poise that he goes the farthest who goes far enough and that all beyond that is just bother and stuff no vain man matures he makes too much new wood his blooms are too thick for the fruit to be good tis the modest man ripens tis he that achieves      980 just whats needed of sunshine and shade he receives grapes to mellow require the cool dark of their leaves neal wants balance he throws his mind always too far whisking out flocks of comets but never a star he has so much muscle and loves so to show it that he strips himself naked to prove hes a poet and to show he could leap arts wide ditch if he tried jumps clean oer it and into the hedge tother side he has strength but theres nothing about him in keeping one gets surelier onward by walking than leaping      990 he has used his own sinews himself to distress and had done vastly more had he done vastly less in letters too soon is as bad as too late could he only have waited he might have been great but he plumped into helicon up to the waist and muddied the stream ere he took his first taste    there is hawthorne with genius so shrinking and rare that you hardly at first see the strength that is there a frame so robust with a nature so sweet so earnest so graceful so lithe and so fleet      1000 is worth a descent from olympus to meet tis as if a rough oak that for ages had stood with his gnarled bony branches like ribs of the wood should bloom after cycles of struggle and scathe with a single anemone trembly and rathe his strength is so tender his wildness so meek that a suitable parallel sets one to seek hes a john bunyan fouque a puritan tieck when nature was shaping him clay was not granted for making so fullsized a man as she wanted      1010 so to fill out her model a little she spared from some finergrained stuff for a woman prepared and she could not have hit a more excellent plan for making him fully and perfectly man the success of her scheme gave her so much delight that she tried it again shortly after in dwight only while she was kneading and shaping the clay she sang to her work in her sweet childish way and found when shed put the last touch to his soul that the music had somehow got mixed with the whole      1020    heres cooper whos written six volumes to show hes as good as a lord well lets grant that hes so if a person prefer that description of praise why a coronets certainly cheaper than bays but he need take no pains to convince us hes not as his enemies say the american scott choose any twelve men and let c read aloud that one of his novels of which hes most proud and id lay any bet that without ever quitting their box theyd be all to a man for acquitting      1030 he has drawn you one character though that is new one wildflower hes plucked that is wet with the dew of this fresh western world and the thing not to mince he has done naught but copy it ill ever since his indians with proper respect be it said are just natty bumppo daubed over with red and his very long toms are the same useful nat rigged up in duck pants and a souwester hat though once in a coffin a good chance was found to have slipped the old fellow away underground      1040 all his other menfigures are clothes upon sticks the dernière chemise of a man in a fix as a captain besieged when his garrisons small sets up caps upon poles to be seen oer the wall and the women he draws from one model dont vary all sappy as maples and flat as a prairie when a characters wanted he goes to the task as a cooper would do in composing a cask he picks out the staves of their qualities heedful just hoops them together as tight as is needful      1050 and if the best fortune should crown the attempt he has made at the most something wooden and empty    dont suppose i would underrate coopers abilities if i thought youd do that i should feel very ill at ease the men who have given to one character life and objective existence are not very rife you may number them all both prosewriters and singers without overrunning the bounds of your fingers and natty wont go to oblivion quicker than adams the parson or primrose the vicar      1060    there is one thing in cooper i like too and that is that on manners he lectures his countrymen gratis not precisely so either because for a rarity he is paid for his tickets in unpopularity now he may overcharge his american pictures but youll grant theres a good deal of truth in his strictures and i honor the man who is willing to sink half his present repute for the freedom to think and when he has thought be his cause strong or weak will risk tother half for the freedom to speak      1070 caring naught for what vengeance the mob has in store let that mob be the upper ten thousand or lower    there are truths you americans need to be told and it neverll refute them to swagger and scold john bull looking oer the atlantic in choler at your aptness for trade says you worship the dollar but to scorn such eyedollartrys what very few do and john goes to that church as often as you do no matter what john says dont try to outcrow him tis enough to go quietly on and outgrow him      1080 like most fathers bull hates to see number one displacing himself in the mind of his son and detests the same faults in himself hed neglected when he sees them again in his childs glass reflected to love one another youre too like by half if he is a bull youre a pretty stout calf and tear your own pasture for naught but to show what a nice pair of horns youre beginning to grow    there are one or two things i should just like to hint for you dont often get the truth told you in print      1090 the most of you this is what strikes all beholders have a mental and physical stoop in the shoulders though you ought to be free as the winds and the waves youve the gait and the manners of runaway slaves though you brag of your new world you dont half believe in it and as much of the old as is possible weave in it your goddess of freedom a tight buxom girl with lips like a cherry and teeth like a pearl with eyes bold as herës and hair floating free and full of the sun as the spray of the sea      1100 who can sing at a husking or romp at a shearing who can trip through the forests alone without fearing who can drive home the cows with a song through the grass keeps glancing aside into europes cracked glass hides her red hands in gloves pinches up her lithe waist and makes herself wretched with transmarine taste she loses her fresh country charm when she takes any mirror except her own rivers and lakes    you steal englishmens books and think englishmens thought with their salt on her tail your wild eagle is caught      1110 your literature suits its each whisper and motion to what will be thought of it over the ocean the cast clothes of europe your statesmanship tries and mumbles again the old blarneys and lies forget europe wholly your veins throb with blood to which the dull current in hers is but mud let her sneer let her say your experiment fails in her voice theres a tremble een now while she rails and your shore will soon be in the nature of things covered thick with gilt driftwood of castaway kings      1120 where alone as it were in a longfellows waif her fugitive pieces will find themselves safe o my friends thank your god if you have one that he twixt the old world and you set the gulf of a sea be strongbacked brownhanded upright as your pines by the scale of a hemisphere shape your designs be true to yourselves and this new nineteenth age as a statue by powers or a picture by page plough sail forge build carve paint make all over new to your own newworld instincts contrive to be true      1130 keep your ears open wide to the futures first call be whatever you will but yourselves first of all stand fronting the dawn on toils heavenscaling peaks and become my new race of more practical greeks hem your likeness at present i shudder to tell ot is that you have your slaves and the greek had his helot    here a gentleman present who had in his attic more pepper than brains shrieked the mans a fanatic im a capital tailor with warm tar and feathers and will make him a suit thatll serve in all weathers      1140 but well argue the point first im willing to reason t palaver before condemnations but decent so through my humble person humanity begs of the friends of true freedom a loan of bad eggs but apollo let one such a look of his show forth as when greek aeie nukti eoikios and so forth and the gentleman somehow slunk out of the way but as he was going gained courage to say at slavery in the abstract my whole soul rebels i am as strongly opposed to t as any one else      1150 ay no doubt but whenever ive happened to meet with a wrong or a crime it is always concrete answered phoebus severely then turning to us the mistake of such fellows as just made the fuss is only in taking a great busy nation for a part of their pitiful cottonplantation but there comes miranda zeus where shall i flee to she has such a penchant for bothering me too she always keeps asking if i dont observe a particular likeness twixt her and minerva      1160 she tells me my efforts in verse are quite clever shes been travelling now and will be worse than ever one would think though a sharpsighted noter shed be of all thats worth mentioning over the sea for a woman must surely see well if she try the whole of whose beings a capital i she will take an old notion and make it her own by saying it oer in her sibylline tone or persuade you tis something tremendously deep by repeating it so as to put you to sleep      1170 and she well may defy any mortal to see through it when once she has mixed up her infinite me through it there is one thing she owns in her own single right it is native and genuinenamely her spite though when acting as censor she privately blows a censer of vanity neath her own nose    here miranda came up and said phoebus you know that the infinite soul has its infinite woe as i ought to know having lived cheek by jowl since the day i was born with the infinite soul      1180 i myself introduced i myself i alone to my lands better life authors solely my own who the sad heart of earth on their shoulders have taken whose works sound a depth by lifes quiet unshaken such as shakespeare for instance the bible and bacon not to mention my own works times nadir is fleet and as for myself im quite out of conceit    quite out of conceit im enchanted to hear it cried apollo aside whod have thought she was near it to be sure one is apt to exhaust those commodities      1190 one uses too fast yet in this case as odd it is as if neptune should say to his turbots and whitings im as much out of salt as mirandas own writings which as she in her own happy manner has said sound a depth for tis one of the functions of lead she often has asked me if i could not find a place somewhere near me that suited her mind i know but a single one vacant which she with her rare talent that way would fit to a t and it would not imply any pause or cessation      1200 in the work she esteems her peculiar vocation she may enter on duty today if she chooses and remain tiringwoman for life to the muses    miranda meanwhile has succeeded in driving up into a corner in spite of their striving a small flock of terrified victims and there with an iturnthecrankoftheuniverse air and a tone which at least to my fancy appears not so much to be entering as boxing your ears is unfolding a tale of herself i surmise      1210 for tis dotted as thick as a peacocks with is apropos of miranda ill rest on my oars and drift through a trifling digression on bores for though not wearing earrings in more majorum our ears are kept bored just as if we still wore em there was one feudal custom worth keeping at least roasted bores made a part of each wellordered feast and of all quiet pleasures the very ne plus was in hunting wild bores as the tame ones hunt us archæologians i know who have personal fears      1220 of this wise application of hounds and of spears have tried to make out with a zeal more than wonted twas a kind of wild swine that our ancestors hunted but ill never believe that the age which has strewn europe oer with cathedrals and otherwise shown that it knew what was what could by chance not have known spending too its chief time with its buff on no doubt which beast twould improve the world most to thin out i divide bores myself in the manner of rifles into two great divisions regardless of trifles     1230 theres your smoothbore and screwbore who do not much vary in the weight of cold lead they respectively carry the smoothbore is one in whose essence the mind not a corner nor cranny to cling by can find you feel as in nightmares sometimes when you slip down a steep slated roof where theres nothing to grip you slide and you slide the blank horror increases you had rather by far be at once smashed to pieces you fancy a whirlpool below white and frothing and finally drop off and light uponnothing      1240 the screwbore has twists in him faint predilections for going just wrong in the tritest directions when hes wrong he is flat when hes right he cant show it hell tell you what snooks said about the new poet3 or how fogrum was outraged by tennysons princess he has spent all his spare time and intellect since his birth in perusing on each art and science just the books in which no one puts any reliance and though nemo were told horis omnibus sapit the rule will not fit him however you shape it      1250 for he has a perennial foison of sappiness he has just enough force to spoil half your days happiness and to make him a sort of mosquito to be with but just not enough to dispute or agree with    these sketches i made not to be too explicit from two honest fellows who made me a visit and broke like the tale of the bear and the fiddle my reflections on halleck short off by the middle i shant now go into the subject more deeply for i notice that some of my readers look sleeply      1260 i will barely remark that mongst civilized nations theres none that displays more exemplary patience under all sorts of boring at all sorts of hours from all sorts of desperate persons than ours not to speak of our papers our state legislatures and other such trials for sensitive natures just look for a moment at congressappalled my fancy shrinks back from the phantom it called why theres scarcely a member unworthy to frown neath what fourier nicknames the boreal crown         1270 only think what that infinite borepowr could do if applied with a utilitarian view suppose for example we shipped it with care to saharas great desert and let it bore there if they held one short session and did nothing else theyd fill the whole waste with artesian wells but tis time now with pen phonographic to follow through some more of his sketches our laughing apollo    there comes harry franco and as he draws near you find thats a smile which you took for a sneer      1280 one half of him contradicts tother his wont is to say very sharp things and do very blunt his manners as hard as his feelings are tender and a sortie hell make when he means to surrender hes in joke half the time when he seems to be sternest when he seems to be joking be sure hes in earnest he has common sense in a way thats uncommon hates humbug and cant loves his friends like a woman builds his dislikes of cards and his friendships of oak loves a prejudice better than aught but a joke         1290 is half upright quaker half downright comeouter loves freedom too well to go stark mad about her quite artless himself is a lover of art shuts you out of his secrets and into his heart and though not a poet yet all must admire in his letters of pinto his skill on the liar    there comes poe with his raven like barnaby rudge three fifths of him genius and two fifths sheer fudge who talks like a book of iambs and pentameters in a way to make people of common sense damn metres      1300 who has written some things quite the best of their kind but the heart somehow seems all squeezed out by the mind whobut heyday whats this messieurs mathews and poe you mustnt fling mudballs at longfellow so does it make a man worse that his characters such as to make his friends love him as you think too much why there is not a bard at this moment alive more willing than he that his fellows should thrive while you are abusing him thus even now he would help either one of you out of a slough      1310 you may say that hes smooth and all that till youre hoarse but remember that elegance also is force after polishing granite as much as you will the heart keeps its tough old persistency still deduct all you can that still keeps you at bay why hell live till men weary of collins and gray im not overfond of greek metres in english to me rhymes a gain so it be not too jinglish and your modern hexameter verses are no more like greek ones than sleek mr pope is like homer      1320 as the roar of the sea to the coo of a pigeon is so compared to your moderns sounds old melesigenes i may be too partial the reason perhaps ot is that ive heard the old blind man recite his own rhapsodies and my ear with that music impregnate may be like the poor exiled shell with the soul of the sea or as one cant bear strauss when his nature is cloven to its deeps within deeps by the stroke of beethoven but set that aside and tis truth that i speak had theocritus written in english not greek      1330 i believe that his exquisite sense would scarce change a line in that rare tender virginlike pastoral evangeline thats not ancient nor modern its place is apart where time has no sway in the realm of pure art tis a shrine of retreat from earths hubbub and strife as quiet and chaste as the authors own life    there comes philothea her face all aglow she has just been dividing some poor creatures woe and cant tell which pleases her most to relieve his want or his story to hear and believe      1340 no doubt against many deep griefs she prevails for her ear is the refuge of destitute tales she knows well that silence is sorrows best food and that talking draws off from the heart its black blood so shell listen with patience and let you unfold your bundle of rags as twere pure cloth of gold which indeed it all turns to as soon as shes touched it and to borrow a phrase from the nursery muched it she has such a musical taste she will go any distance to hear one who draws a long bow      1350 she will swallow a wonder by mere might and main and thinks it geometrys fault if shes fain to consider things flat inasmuch as theyre plain facts with her are accomplished as frenchmen would say they will prove all she wishes them to either way and as fact lies on this side or that we must try if were seeking the truth to find where it dont lie i was telling her once of a marvellous aloe that for thousands of years had looked spindling and sallow and though nursed by the fruitfullest powers of mud      1360 had never vouchsafed een so much as a bud till its owner remarked as a sailor you know often will in a calm that it never would blow for he wished to exhibit the plant and designed that its blowing should help him in raising the wind at last it was told him that if he should water its roots with the blood of his unmarried daughter who was born as her mother a calvinist said with william laws serious caul on her head it would blow as the obstinate breeze did when by a      1370 like decree of her father died iphigenia at first he declared he himself would be blowed ere his conscience with such a foul crime he would load but the thought coming oft grew less dark than before and he mused as each creditor knocked at his door if this were but done they would dun me no more i told philothea his struggles and doubts and how he considered the ins and the outs of the visions he had and the dreadful dyspepsy how he went to the seër that lives at pokeepsie      1380 how the seër advised him to sleep on it first and to read his big volume in case of the worst and further advised he should pay him five dollars for writing old english hum hum on his wristbands and collars three years and ten days these dark words he had studied when the daughter was missed and the aloe had budded i told how he watched it grow large and more large and wondered how much for the show he should charge she had listened with utter indifference to this till i told how it bloomed and discharging its pistil      1390 with an aim the eumenides dictated shot the botanical filicide dead on the spot it had blown but he reaped not his horrible gains for it blew with such force as to blow out his brains and the crime was blown also because on the wad which was paper was writ visitation of god as well as a thrilling account of the deed which the coroner kindly allowed me to read    well my friend took this story up just to be sure      1399 as one might a poor foundling thats laid at ones door she combed it and washed it and clothed it and fed it and as if twere her own child most tenderly bred it laid the scene of the legend i mean far away a mong the green vales underneath himalaya and by artistlike touches laid on here and there made the whole thing so touching i frankly declare i have read it all thrice and perhaps i am weak but i found every time there were tears on my cheek    the pole science tells us the magnet controls but she is a magnet to emigrant poles               1410 and folks with a mission that nobody knows throng thickly about her as bees round a rose she can fill up the carets in such make their scope converge to some focus of rational hope and with sympathies fresh as the morning their gall can transmute into honeybut this is not all not only for those she has solace oh say vices desperate nursling adrift in broadway who clingest with all that is left of thee human to the last slender spar from the wreck of the woman      1420 hast thou not found one shore where those tired drooping feet could reach firm motherearth one full heart on whose beat the soothed head in silence reposing could hear the chimes of far childhood throb back on the ear ah theres many a beam from the fountain of day that to reach us unclouded must pass on its way through the soul of a woman and hers is wide ope to the influence of heaven as the blue eyes of hope yes a great heart is hers one that dares to go in to the prison the slavehut the alleys of sin      1430 and to bring into each or to find there some line of the never completely outtrampled divine if her heart at high floods swamps her brain now and then tis but richer for that when the tide ebbs agen as after old nile has subsided his plain overflows with a second broad deluge of grain what a wealth would it tiring to the narrow and sour could they be as a child but for one little hour    what irving thrice welcome warm heart and fine brain you bring back the happiest spirit from spain      1440 and the gravest sweet humor that ever were there since cervantes met death in his gentle despair nay dont be embarrassed nor look so beseeching i shant run directly against my own preaching and having just laughed at their raphaels and dantes go to setting you up beside matchless cervantes but allow me to speak what i honestly feel to a true poetheart add the fun of dick steele throw in all of addison minus the chill      1449 with the whole of that partnerships stock and goodwill mix well and while stirring hum oer as a spell the fine old english gentleman simmer it well sweeten just to your own private liking then strain that only the finest and clearest remain let it stand out of doors till a soul it receives from the warm lazy sun loitering down through green leaves and youll find a choice nature not wholly deserving a name either english or yankeejust irving    there goesbut stet nominis umbrahis name youll be glad enough some day or other to claim      1460 and will all crowd about him and swear that you knew him if some english critic should chance to review him the old porcos ante ne projiciatis margaritas for him you have verified gratis what matters his name why it may be sylvester judd junior or junius ulysses or nestor for aught i know or care tis enough that i look on the author of margaret the first yankee book with the soul of down east in t and things farther east as far as the threshold of morning at least      1470 where awaits the fair dawn of the simple and true of the day that comes slowly to make all things new t has a smack of pine woods of bare field and bleak hill such as only the breed of the mayflower could till the puritans shown in it tough to the core such as prayed smiting agag on red marston moor with an unwilling humor half choked by the drouth in brown hollows about the inhospitable mouth with a soul full of poetry though it has qualms about finding a happiness out of the psalms      1480 full of tenderness too though it shrinks in the dark hamadryadlike under the coarse shaggy bark that sees visions knows wrestlings of god with the will and has its own sinais and thunderings still    here forgive me apollo i cried while i pour my heart out to my birthplace o loved more and more dear baystate from whose rocky bosom thy sons should suck milk strongwillgiving brave such as runs in the veins of old greylockwho is it that dares      1489 call thee pedler a soul wrapped in bankbooks and shares it is false shes a poet i see as i write along the far railroad the steamsnake glide white the cataractthrob of her millhearts i hear the swift strokes of triphammers weary my ear sledges ring upon anvils through logs the saw screams blocks swing to their place beetles drive home the beams it is songs such as these that she croons to the din of her fastflying shuttles year out and year in while from earths farthest corner there comes not a breeze but wafts her the buzz of her goldgleaning bees      1500 what though those horn hands have as yet found small time for painting and sculpture and music and rhyme these will come in due order the need that pressed sorest was to vanquish the seasons the ocean the forest to bridle and harness the rivers the steam making those whirl her millwheels this tug in her team to vassalize old tyrant winter and make him delve surlily for her on river and lake when this new world was parted she strove not to shirk her lot in the heirdom the tough silent work                1510 the heroshare ever from herakles down to odin the earths iron sceptre and crown yes thou dear noble mother if ever mens praise could be claimed for creating heroical lays thou hast won it if ever the laurel divine crowned the maker and builder that glory is thine thy songs are right epic they tell how this rude rockrib of our earth here was tamed and subdued thou hast written them plain on the face of the planet in brave deathless letters of iron and granite               1520 thou hast printed them deep for all time they are set from the same runic typefount and alphabet with thy stout berkshire hills and the arms of thy bay they are staves from the burly old mayflower lay if the drones of the old world in querulous ease ask thy art and thy letters point proudly to these or if they deny these are letters and art toil on with the same old invincible heart thou art rearing the pedestal broadbased and grand whereon the fair shapes of the artist shall stand             1530 and creating through labors undaunted and long the theme for all sculpture and painting and song    but my good mother baystate wants no praise of mine she learned from her mother a precept divine about something that butters no parsnips her forte in another direction lies work is her sport though shell curtsey and set her cap straight that she will if you talk about plymouth and red bunkers hill dear notable goodwife by this time of night her hearth is swept neatly her fire burning bright           1540 and she sits in a chair of home plan and make rocking musing much all the while as she darns on a stocking whether turkeys will come pretty high next thanksgiving whether flourll be so dear for as sure as shes living she will use ryeandinjun then whether the pig by this time aint got pretty tolerable big and whether to sell it outright will be best or to smoke hams and shoulders and salt down the rest at this minute shed swop all my verses ah cruel for the last patent stove that is saving of fuel              1550 so ill just let apollo go on for his phiz shows ive kept him awaiting too long as it is    if our friend there who seems a reporter is done with his burst of emotion why i will go on said apollo some smiled and indeed i must own there was something sarcastic perhaps in his tone    theres holmes who is matchless among you for wit a leydenjar always fullcharged from which flit the electrical tingles of hit after hit in long poems tis painful sometimes and invites           1560 a thought of the way the new telegraph writes which pricks down its little sharp sentences spitefully as if you got more than youd title to rightfully and you find yourself hoping its wild father lightning would flame in for a second and give you a frightning he has perfect sway of what i call a sham metre but many admire it the english pentameter and campbell i think wrote most commonly worse with less nerve swing and fire in the same kind of verse nor eer achieved aught int so worthy of praise             1570 as the tribute of holmes to the grand marseillaise you went crazy last year over bulwers new timon why if b to the day of his dying should rhyme on heaping verses on verses and tomes upon tomes he could neer reach the best point and vigor of holmes his are just the fine hands too to weave you a lyric full of fancy fun feeling or spiced with satiric in a measure so kindly you doubt if the toes that are trodden upon are your own or your foes    there is lowell whos striving parnassus to climb          1580 with a whole bale of isms tied together with rhyme he might get on alone spite of brambles and boulders but he cant with that bundle he has on his shoulders the top of the hill he will neer come nigh reaching till he learns the distinction twixt singing and preaching his lyre has some chords that would ring pretty well but hed rather by half make a drum of the shell and rattle away till hes old as methusalem at the head of a march to the last new jerusalem      1589    there goes halleck whose fannys a pseudo don juan with the wickedness out that gave salt to the true one hes a wit though i hear of the very first order and once made a pun on the words soft recorder more than this hes a very great poet im told and has had his works published in crimson and gold with something they call illustrations to wit like those with which chapman obscured holy writ4 which are said to illustrate because as i view it like lucus a non they precisely dont do it let a man who can write what himself understands             1600 keep clear if he can of designing mens hands who bury the sense if theres any worth having and then very honestly call it engraving but to quit badinage which there isnt much wit in hallecks better i doubt not than all he has written in his verse a clear glimpse you will frequently find if not of a great of a fortunate mind which contrives to be true to its natural loves in a world of backoffices ledgers and stoves when his heart breaks away from the brokers and banks       1610 and kneels in his own private shrine to give thanks theres a genial manliness in him that earns our sincerest respect read for instance his burns and we cant but regret seek excuse where we may that so much of a man has been peddled away    but whats that a massmeeting no there come in lots the american bulwers disraelis and scotts and in short the american everything elses each charging the others with envies and jealousies by the way tis a fact that displays what profusions       1620 of all kinds of greatness bless free institutions that while the old world has produced barely eight of such poets as all men agree to call great and of other great characters hardly a score one might safely say less than that rather than more with you every year a whole crop is begotten theyre as much of a staple as corn is or cotton why theres scarcely a huddle of loghuts and shanties that has not brought forth its own miltons and dantes       1629 i myself know ten byrons one coleridge three shelleys two raphaels six titians i think one apelles leonardos and rubenses plenty as lichens one but that one is plenty american dickens a whole flock of lambs any number of tennysons in short if a man has the luck to have any sons he may feel pretty certain that one out of twain will be some very great person over again there is one inconvenience in all this which lies in the fact that by contrast we estimate size5 and where there are none except titans great stature    1640 is only the normal proceeding of nature what puff the strained sails of your praise will you furl at if the calmest degree that you know is superlative at rome all whom charon took into his wherry must as a matter of course be well issimust and errimust a greek too could feel while in that famous boat he tost that his friends would take care he was greek istost and   greek otatost and formerly we as through graveyards we past thought the world went from bad to worst fearfully fast let us glance for a moment tis well worth the pains     1650 and note what an average graveyard contains there lie levellers levelled duns done up themselves there are booksellers finally laid on their shelves horizontally there lie upright politicians doseadose with their patients sleep faultless physicians there are slavedrivers quietly whipped under ground there bookbinders done up in boards are fast bound there cardplayers wait till the last trump be played there all the choice spirits get finally laid there the babe thats unborn is supplied with a berth     1660 there men without legs get their six feet of earth there lawyers repose each wrapped up in his case there seekers of office are sure of a place there defendant and plaintiff get equally cast there shoemakers quietly stick to the last there brokers at length become silent as stocks there stagedrivers sleep without quitting their box and so forth and so forth and so forth and so on with this kind of stuff one might endlessly go on to come to the point i may safely assert you              1670 will find in each yard every cardinal virtue6 each has six truest patriots four discoverers of ether who never had thought on t nor mentioned it either ten poets the greatest who ever wrote rhyme two hundred and forty first men of their time one person whose portrait just gave the least hint its original had a most horrible squint one critic most what do they call it reflective who never had used the phrase obor subjective forty fathers of freedom of whom twenty bred              1680 their sons for the riceswamps at so much a head and their daughters forfaugh thirty mothers of gracchi nonresistants who gave many a spiritual blackeye eight true friends of their kind one of whom was a jailer four captains almost as astounding as taylor two dozen of italys exiles who shoot us his kaisership daily stern penandink brutuses who in yankee backparlors with crucified smile7 mount serenely their countrys funereal pile ninetynine irish heroes ferocious rebellers              1690 gainst the saxon in cismarine garrets and cellars who shake their dread fists oer the sea and all that as long as a copper drops into the hat nine hundred teutonic republicans stark from vaterlands battle just wonin the park who the happy profession of martyrdom take whenever it gives them a chance at a steak sixtytwo second washingtons two or three jacksons and so many everythings else that it racks ones poor memory too much to continue the list     1700 especially now they no longer exist i would merely observe that youve taken to giving the puffs that belong to the dead to the living and that somehow your trumpofcontemporarydooms tones is tuned after old dedications and tombstones    here the critic came in and a thistle presented8 from a frown to a smile the gods features relented as he stared at his envoy who swelling with pride to the gods asking look nothing daunted replied youre surprised i suppose i was absent so long     1710 but your godship respecting the lilies was wrong i hunted the garden from one end to tother and got no reward but vexation and bother till tossed out with weeds in a corner to wither this one lily i found and made haste to bring hither  did he think i had given him a book to review i ought to have known what the fellow would do muttered phoebus aside for a thistle will pass beyond doubt for the queen of all flowers with an ass he has chosen in just the same way as hed choose     1720 his specimens out of the books he reviews and now as this offers an excellent text ill give em some brief hints on criticism next so musing a moment he turned to the crowd and clearing his voice spoke as follows aloud    my friends in the happier days of the muse we were luckily free from such things as reviews then naught came between with its fog to make clearer the heart of the poet to that of his hearer then the poet brought heaven to the people and they     1730 felt that they too were poets in hearing his lay then the poet was prophet the past in his soul precreated the future both parts of one whole then for him there was nothing too great or too small for one natural deity sanctified all then the bard owned no clipper and meter of moods save the spirit of silence that hovers and broods oer the seas and the mountains the rivers and woods he asked not earths verdict forgetting the clods his soul soared and sang to an audience of gods     1740 twas for them that he measured the thought and the line and shaped for their vision the perfect design with as glorious a foresight a balance as true as swung out the worlds in the infinite blue then a glory and greatness invested mans heart the universal which now stands estranged and apart in the free individual moulded was art then the forms of the artist seemed thrilled with desire for something as yet unattained fuller higher as once with her lips lifted hands and eyes listening      1750 and her whole upward soul in her countenance glistening eurydice stoodlike a beacon unfired which once touched with flame will leap heavnward inspired and waited with answering kindle to mark the first gleam of orpheus that pained the red dark then painting song sculpture did more than relieve the need that men feel to create and believe and as in all beauty who listens with love hears these words oft repeatedbeyond and above so these seemed to be but the visible sign                    1760 of the grasp of the soul after things more divine they were ladders the artist erected to climb oer the narrow horizon of space and of time and we see there the footsteps by which men had gained to the one rapturous glimpse of the neverattained as shepherds could erst sometimes trace in the sod the last spurning print of a skycleaving god    but now on the poets disprivacied moods with do this and do that the pert critic intrudes while he thinks hes been barely fulfilling his duty          1770 to interpret twixt men and their own sense of beauty and has striven while others sought honor or pelf to make his kind happy as he was himself he finds hes been guilty of horrid offences in all kinds of moods numbers genders and tenses hes been ob and subjective what kettle calls pot precisely at all events what he ought not you have done this says one judge done that says another you should have done this grumbles one that says tother never mind what he touches one shrieks out taboo     1780 and while he is wondering what he shall do since each suggests opposite topics for song they all shout together youre right and youre wrong    nature fits all her children with something to do he who would write and cant write can surely review can set up a small booth as critic and sell us his petty conceit and his pettier jealousies thus a lawyers apprentice just out of his teens will do for the jeffrey of six magazines having read johnsons lives of the poets half through        1790 theres nothing on earth hes not competent to he reviews with as much nonchalance as he whistles he goes through a book and just picks out the thistles it matters not whether he blame or commend if hes bad as a foe hes far worse as a friend let an author but write whats above his poor scope he goes to work gravely and twists up a rope and inviting the world to see punishment done hangs himself up to bleach in the wind and the sun tis delightful to see when a man comes along      1800 who has anything in him peculiar and strong every cockboat that swims clear its fierce pop gundeck at him and make as he passes its ludicrous peck at him    here miranda came up and began as to that apollo at once seized his gloves cane and hat and seeing the place getting rapidly cleared i too snatched my notes and forthwith disappeared     the unhappy lot of mr knott  part i  showing how he built his house and his wife moved into it  my worthy friend a gordon knott   from business snug withdrawn was much contented with a lot that would contain a tudor cot twixt twelve feet square of gardenplot   and twelve feet more of lawn  he had laid business on the shelf   to give his taste expansion and since no man retired with pelf   the building mania can shun      10 knott being middleaged himself resolved to build unhappy elf   a mediæval mansion  he called an architect in counsel   i want said he ayou know what   you are a builder i am knott   a thing complete from chimneypot down to the very grounsel   heres a halfacre of good land   just have it nicely mapped and planned      20 and make your workmen drive on   meadow there is and upland too   and i should like a waterview dyou think you could contrive one   perhaps the pump and trough would do   if painted a judicious blue   the woodland ive attended to   he meant three pines stuck up askew two dead ones and a live one   a pocketfull of rocks twould take      30 to build a house of freestone   but then it is not hard to make what nowadays is the stone   the cunning painter in a trice   your houses outside petrifies   and people think it very gneiss without inquiring deeper   my money never shall be thrown   away on such a deal of stone when stone of deal is cheaper      40  and so the greenest of antiques   was reared for knott to dwell in the architect worked hard for weeks in venting all his private peaks upon the roof whose crop of leaks   had satisfied fluellen whatever anybody had out of the common good or bad   knott had it all worked well in a donjonkeep where clothes might dry      50 a porters lodge that was a sty a campanile slim and high   too small to hang a bell in all up and down and here and there with lordknowswhats of round and square stuck on at random everywhere it was a house to make one stare   all corners and all gables like dogs let loose upon a bear ten emulous styles staboyed with care      60 the whole among them seemed to tear and all the oddities to spare   were set upon the stables  knott was delighted with a pile   approved by fashions leaders only he made the builder smile by asking every little while why that was called the twodoor style   which certainly had three doors yet better for this luckless man      70 if he had put a downright ban   upon the thing in limine for though to quit affairs his plan ere many days poor knott began perforce accepting draughts that ran   all waysexcept up chimney the house though painted stone to mock with nice white lines round every block   some trepidation stood in when tempests with petrific shock      80 so to speak made it really rock   though not a whit less wooden and painted stone howeer well done will not take in the prodigal sun whose beams are never quite at one   with our terrestrial lumber so the wood shrank around the knots and gaped in disconcerting spots and there were lots of dots and rots   and crannies without number     90 wherethrough as you may well presume the wind like water through a flume   came rushing in ecstatic leaving in all three floors no room   that was not a rheumatic and what with points and squares and rounds   grown shaky on their poises the house at nights was full of pounds thumps bumps creaks scratchings rapstillzounds cried knott this goes beyond all bounds      100 i do not deal in tongues and sounds nor have i let my house and grounds   to a family of noyeses  but though knotts house was full of airs   he had but onea daughter and as he owned much stocks and shares many who wished to render theirs such vain unsatisfying cares and needed wives to sew their tears   in matrimony sought her      110 they vowed her gold they wanted not   their faith would never falter they longed to tie this single knott   in the hymeneal halter so daily at the door they rang   cards for the belle delivering or in the choir at her they sang achieving such a rapturous twang   as set her nerves ashivering  now knott had quite made up his mind      120   that colonel jones should have her no beauty he but oft we find sweet kernels neath a roughish rind so hoped his jennyd be resigned   and make no more palaver glanced at the fact that love was blind that girls were ratherish inclined   to pet their little crosses then nosologically defined the rate at which the system pined      130 in

maid or else be mrs doctor slade      150   if a woman could contrive it and though the weddingday was set   jenny was more so rather declaring in a pretty pet that howsoeer they spread their net she would outjennyral them yet   the colonel and her father  just at this time the publics eyes   were keenly on the watch a stir beginning slowly to arise      160 about those questions and replies those raps that unwrapped mysteries   so rapidly at rochester and knott already nervous grown by lying much awake alone and listening sometimes to a moan   and sometimes to a clatter wheneer the wind at night would rouse the gingerbreadwork on his house or when some hastytempered mouse      170 behind the plastering made a towse   about a family matter began to wonder if his wife a paralytic half her life   which made it more surprising might not to rule him from her urn have taken a peripatetic turn   for want of exorcising  this thought once nestled in his head erelong contagious grew and spread       180 infecting all his mind with dread until at last he lay in bed and heard his wife with wellknown tread entering the kitchen through the shed   or wast his fancy mocking opening the pantry cutting bread and then shed been some ten years dead   closets and drawers unlocking or in his room his breath grew thick       189 he heard the longfamiliar click of slender needles flying quick   as if she knit a stocking for whomhe prayed that years might flit   with pains rheumatic shooting before those ghostly things she knit upon his unfleshed sole might fit he did not fancy it a bit   to stand upon that footing at other times his frightened hairs       199   above the bedclothes trusting he heard her full of household cares no dream entrapped in suppers snares the foal of horrible nightmares but broad awake as he declares go bustling up and down the stairs or setting back last evenings chairs   or with the poker thrusting the rakedup seacoals hardened crust andwhat impossible it must he knew she had returned to dust       210 and yet could scarce his senses trust hearing her as she poked and fussed   about the parlor dusting  night after night he strove to sleep   and take his ease in spite of it but still his flesh would chill and creep and though two nightlamps he might keep   he could not so make light of it at last quite desperate he goes and tells his neighbors all his woes       220   which did but their amount enhance they made such mockery of his fears that soon his days were of all jeers   his nights of the rueful countenance i thought most folks one neighbor said gave up the ghost when they were dead another gravely shook his head   adding from all we hear its quite plain poor knott is going mad for how can he at once be sad       230   and think hes full of spirits a third declared he knew a knife   would cut this knott much quicker the surest way to end all strife and lay the spirit of a wife   is just to take and lick her a temperance man

with which his house is haunted i see the thing as clear as light if knott would give up getting tight   naught farther would be wanted so all his neighbors stood aloof and that the spirits neath his roof were not entirely up to proof   unanimously granted        250  knott knew that cocks and sprites were foes and so bought up heaven only knows how many for he wanted crows to give ghosts caws as i suppose   to think that day was breaking moreover what he called his park he turned into a kind of ark for dogs because a little bark is a good tonic in the dark   if one is given to waking        260 but things went on from bad to worse his curs were nothing but a curse   and what was still more shocking foul ghosts of living fowl made scoff and would not think of going off   in spite of all

fortunate and he   still found his trouble waxing as for the dogs the rows they made        280 and how they howled snarled barked and bayed   beyond all human knowledge is all night as wide awake as gnats the terriers rumpused after rats or just for practice taught their brats to worry castoff shoes and hats the bulldogs settled private spats all chased imaginary cats or raved behind the fences slats at real ones or from their mats with friends miles off held pleasant chats        291 or like some folks in white cravats contemptuous of sharps and flats   sat up and sang dogsologies meanwhile

sinking the age takes in the newspapers or to say sooth unshrinking the newspapers take in the age and stocks do all the thinking    an oriental apologue    somewhere in india upon a time read it not injah or you spoil the verse   there dwelt two saints whose privilege sublime it was to sit and watch the world grow worse   their only care in that delicious clime at proper intervals to pray and curse   pracrit the dialect each prudent brother   used for himself damnonian for the other    one half the time of each was spent in praying for blessings on his own unworthy head                10   the other half in fearfully portraying where certain folks would go when they were dead   this system of exchangestheres no saying to what more solid barter twould have led   but that a river vext with boils and swellings   at rainy times kept peace between their dwellings    so they two played at wordy battledore and kept a curse forever in the air   flying this way or that from shore to shore nor other labor did this holy pair                 20   clothed and supported from the lavish store which crowds lanigerous brought with daily care   they toiled not neither did they spin their bias   was towrd the harder task of being pious    each from his hut rushed six score times a day like a great canon of the church fullrammed   with cartridge theologic so to say touched himself off and then recoiling slammed   his hovels door behind him in away that to his foe said plainlyyoull be damned      30   and so like potts and wainwright shrill and strong   the two d dd each other all day long    one was a dancing dervise a mohammedan the other was a hindoo a gymnosophist   one kept his whatdyecallit and his ramadan laughing to scorn the sacred rites and laws of his   transfluvial rival who in turn called ahmed an old top and as a clincher shook across a fist   with nails six inches long yet lifted not   his eyes from off his navels mystic knot              40    who whirls not round six thousand times an hour will go screamed ahmed to the evil place   may he eat dirt and may the dog and giaour defile the graves of him and all his race   allah loves faithful souls and gives them power to spin till they are purple in the face   some folks get you know what but he that pure is   earns paradise and ninety thousand houris    upon the silver mountain south by east sits brahma fed upon the sacred bean                 30   he loves those men whose nails are still increased who all their lives keep ugly foul and lean   tis of his grace that not a bird or beast adorned with claws like mine was ever seen   the suns and stars are brahmas thoughts divine   even as these trees i seem to see are mine    thou seemst to see indeed roared ahmed back were i but once across this plaguy stream   with a stout sapling in my hand one whack on those lank ribs would rid thee of that dream          60   thy brahmablasphemy is ipecac to my souls stomach couldst thou grasp the scheme   of true redemption thou wouldst know that deity   whirls by a kind of blessed spontaneity    and this it is which keeps our earth here going with all the starsoh vile but theres a place   prepared for such to think of brahma throwing worlds like a jugglers balls up into space   why not so much as a smooth lotos blowing is eer allowed that silence to efface                70   which broods round brahma and our earth tis known   rests on a tortoise moveless as this stone    so they kept up their banning amoebæan when suddenly came floating down the stream   a youth whose face like an incarnate pæan glowed twas so full of grandeur and of gleam   if there be gods then doubtless this must be one thought both at once and then began to scream   surely whateer immortals know thou knowest   decide between us twain before thou goest            80    the youth was drifting in a slim canoe most like a huge white waterlilys petal   but neither of our theologians knew whereof twas made whether of heavenly metal   seldseen or of a vast pearl split in two and hollowed was a point they could not settle   twas good debateseed though and bore large fruit   in after years of many a tart dispute    there were no wings upon the strangers shoulders and yet he seemed so capable of rising     90   that had he soared like thistledown beholders had thought the circumstance noways surprising   enough that he remained and when the scolders hailed him as umpire in their vocal prizering   the painter of his boat he lightly threw   around a lotosstem and brought her to    the strange youth had a look as if he might have trod far planets where the atmosphere   of nobler temper steeps the face with light just as our skins are tanned and freckled here     100   his air was that of a cosmopolite in the wide universe from sphere to sphere   perhaps he was his face had such grave beauty   an officer of saturns guards off duty    both saints began to unfold their tales at once both wished their tales like simial ones prehensile   that they might seize his ear fool knave and dunce flew zigzag back and forth like strokes of pencil   in a childs fingers voluble as duns they jabbered like the stones on that immense hill     110   in the arabian nights until the stranger   began to think his eardrums in some danger    in general those who nothing have to say contrive to spend the longest time in doing it   they turn and vary it in every way hashing it stewing it mincing it ragouting it   sometimes they keep it purposely at bay then let it slip to be again pursuing it   they drone it groan it whisper it and shout it   refute it flout it swear to t prove it doubt it     120    our saints had practised for some thirty years their talk beginning with a single stem   spread like a banyan sending down live piers colonies of digression and in them   germs of yet new dispersion once by the ears they could convey damnation in a hem   and blow the pinch of premisepriming off   long syllogistic batteries with a cough    each had a theory that the human ear a providential tunnel was which led      130   to a huge vacuum and surely here they showed some knowledge of the general head   for cant to be decanted through a mere auricular canal or millrace fed   all day and night in sunshine and in shower   from their vast heads of milkandwaterpower    the present being a peculiar case each with unwonted zeal the other scouted   put his spurred hobby through its every pace     139 pished pshawed poohed horribled bahed jeered sneered flouted   sniffed nonsensed infideled fudged with his face looked scorn too nicely shaded to be shouted   and with each inch of person and of vesture   contrived to hint some most disdainful gesture    at length when their breaths end was come about and both could now and then just gasp impostor   holding their heads thrust menacingly out as staggering cocks keep up their fighting posture   the stranger smiled and said beyond a doubt tis fortunate my friends that you have lost your     150   united parts of speech or it had been   impossible for me to get between    produce says naturewhat have you produced a new straitwaistcoat for the human mind   are you not limbed nerved jointed arteried juiced as other men yet faithless to your kind   rather like noxious insects you are used to puncture lifes fair fruit beneath the rind   laying your creedeggs whence in time there spring   consumers new to eat and buzz and sting     160    work you have no conception how twill sweeten your views of life and nature god and man   had you been forced to earn what you have eaten your heaven had shown a less dyspeptic plan   at present your whole function is to eat ten and talk ten times as rapidly as you can   were your shape true to cosmogonic laws   you would be nothing but a pair of jaws    of all the useless beings in creation the earth could spare most easily you bakers     170   of little clay gods formed in shape and fashion precisely in the image of their makers   why it would almost move a saint to passion to see these blind and deaf the hourly breakers   of gods own image in their brother men   set themselves up to tell the how where when    of gods existence ones digestions worse so makes a god of vengeance and of blood   anotherbut no matter they reverse creations plan out of their own vile mud     180   pat up a god and burn drown hang or curse whoever worships not each keeps his stud   of texts which wait with saddle on and bridle   to hunt down atheists to their ugly idol    this i perceive has been your occupation you should have been more usefully employed   all men are bound to earn their daily ration where states make not that primal contract void   by cramps and limits simple devastation is the worms task and what he has destroyed     190   his monument creating is mans work   and that too something more than mist and murk    so having said the youth was seen no more and straightway our sage brahmin the philosopher   cried that was aimed at thee thou endless bore idle and useless as the growth of moss over   a rotting treetrunk i would square that score full soon replied the dervise could i cross over   and catch thee by the beard thy nails id trim   and make thee work as was advised by him     200    work am i not at work from morn till night sounding the deeps of oracles umbilical   which for mans guidance never come to light with all their various aptitudes until i call   and i do i not twirl from left to right for conscience sake is that no work thou silly gull   he had thee in his eye twas gabriel   sent to reward my faith i know him well    twas vishnu thou vile whirligig and so the good old quarrel was begun anew     210   one would have sworn the sky was black as sloe had but the other dared to call it blue   nor were the followers who fed them slow to treat each other with their curses too   each hating tother moves it tears or laughter   because he thought him sure of hell hereafter    at last some genius built a bridge of boats over the stream and ahmeds zealots filed   across upon a mission to cut throats and spread religion pure and undefiled     220   they sowed the propagandists wildest oats cutting off all down to the smallest child   and came back giving thanks for such fat mercies   to find their harvest gone past prayers or curses    all gone except their saints religious hops which he kept up with more than common flourish   but these however satisfying crops for the inner man were not enough to nourish   the body politic which quickly drops reserve in such sad junctures and turns currish        230   so ahmed soon got cursed for all the famine   whereer the popular voice could edge a damn in    at first he pledged a miracle quite boldly and for a day or two they growled and waited   but finding that this kind of manna coldly sat on their stomachs they erelong berated   the saint for still persisting in that old lie till soon the whole machine of saintship grated   ran slow creaked stopped and wishing him in tophet   they gathered strength enough to stone the prophet    240    some stronger ones contrived by eatting leather their weaker friends and one thing or another   the winter months of scarcity to weather among these was the late saints younger brother   who in the spring collecting them together persuaded them that ahmeds holy pother   had wrought in their behalf and that the place   of saint should be continued to his race    accordingly twas settled on the spot that allah favored that peculiar breed           250   beside as all were satisfied twould not be quite respectable to have the need   of public spiritual food forgot and so the tribe with proper forms decreed   that he and failing him his next of kin   forever for the peoples good should spin      the biglow papers  first series  notices of an independent press   i have observed reader beneor malevolent as it may happen that it is customary to append to the second editions of books and to the second works of authors short sentences commendatory of the first under the title of notices of the press these i have been given to understand are procurable at certain established rates payment being made either in money or advertising patronage by the publisher or by an adequate outlay of servility on the part of the author considering these things with myself and also that such notices are neither intended nor generally believed to convey any real opinions being a purely ceremonial accompaniment of literature and resembling certificates to the virtues of various morbiferal panaceas i conceived that it would be not only more economical to prepare a sufficient number of such myself but also more immediately subservient to the end in view to prefix them to this our primary edition rather than to await the contingency of a second when they would seem to be of small utility to delay attaching the bobs until the second attempt at flying the kite would indicate but a slender experience in that useful art neither has it escaped my notice nor failed to afford me matter of reflection that when a circus or a caravan is about to visit jaalam the initial step is to send forward large and highly ornamented bills of performance to be hung in the barroom and the postoffice these having been sufficiently gazed at and beginning to lose their attractiveness except for the flies and truly the boys also in whom i find it impossible to repress even during schoolhours certain oral and telegraphic communications concerning the expected show upon some fine morning the band enters in a gayly painted wagon or triumphal chariot and with noisy advertisement by means of brass wood and sheepskin makes the circuit of our startled village streets then as the exciting sounds draw nearer and nearer do i desiderate those eyes of aristarchus whose looks were as a breeching to a boy then do i perceive with vain regret of wasted opportunities the advantage of a pancratic or pantechnic education since he is most reverenced by my little subjects who can throw the cleanest summerset or walk most securely upon the revolving cask the story of the pied piper becomes for the first time credible to me albeit confirmed by the hameliners dating their legal instruments from the period of his exit as i behold how those strains without pretence of magical potency bewitch the pupillary legs nor leave to the pedagogic an entire selfcontrol for these reasons lest my kingly prerogative should suffer diminution i prorogue my restless commons whom i follow into the street chiefly lest some mischief may chance befall them after the manner of such a band i send forward the following notices of domestic manufacture to make brazen proclamation not unconscious of the advantage which will accrue if our little craft cymbula sutilis shall seem to leave port with a clipping breeze and to carry in nautical phrase a bone in her mouth nevertheless i have chosen as being more equitable to prepare some also sufficiently objurgatory that readers of every taste may find a dish to their palate i have modelled them upon actually existing specimens preserved in my own cabinet of natural curiosities one in particular i had copied with tolerable exactness from a notice of one of my own discourses which from its superior tone and appearance of vast experience i concluded to have been written by a man at least three hundred years of age though i recollected no existing instance of such antediluvian longevity nevertheless i afterwards discovered the author to be a young gentleman preparing for the ministry under the direction of one of my brethren in a neighboring town and whom i had once instinctively corrected in a latin quantity but this i have been forced to omit from its too great lengthhw                                       from the universal littery universe  full of passages which rivet the attention of the reader under a rustic garb sentiments are conveyed which should be committed to the memory and engraven on the heart of every moral and social being we consider this a unique performance we hope to see it soon introduced into our common schools mr wilbur has performed his duties as editor with excellent taste and judgment this is a vein which we hope to see successfully prosecuted we hail the appearance of this work as a long stride toward the formation of a purely aboriginal indigenous native and american literature we rejoice to meet with an author national enough to break away from the slavish deference too common among us to english grammar and orthography where all is so good we are at a loss how to make extracts on the whole we may call it a volume which no library pretending to entire completeness should fail to place upon its shelves                                       from the higginbottomopolis snappingturtle  a collection of the merest balderdash and doggerel that it was ever our bad fortune to lay eyes on the author is a vulgar buffoon and the editor a talkative tedious old fool we use strong language but should any of our readers peruse the book from which calamity heaven preserve them they will find reasons for it thick as the leaves of vallumbrozer or to use a still more expressive comparison as the combined heads of author and editor the work is wretchedly got up we should like to know how much british gold was pocketed by this libeller of our country and her purest patriots                                       from the oldfogrumville mentor  we have not had time to do more than glance through this handsomely printed volume but the name of its respectable editor the rev mr wilbur of jaalam will afford a sufficient guaranty for the worth of its contents the paper is white the type clear and the volume of a convenient and attractive size in reading this elegantly executed work it has seemed to us that a passage or two might have been retrenched with advantage and that the general style of diction was susceptible of a higher polish on the whole we may safely leave the ungrateful task of criticism to the reader we will barely suggest that in volumes intended as this is for the illustration of a provincial dialect and turns of expression a dash of humor or satire might be thrown in with advantage the work is admirably got up this work will form an appropriate ornament to the centre table it is beautifully printed on paper of an excellent quality                                       from the dekay bulwark  we should be wanting in our duty as the conductor of that tremendous engine a public press as an american and as a man did we allow such an opportunity as is presented to us by the biglow papers to pass by without entering our earnest protest against such attempts now alas too common at demoralizing the public sentiment under a wretched mask of stupid drollery slavery war the social glass and in short all the valuable and timehonored institutions justly dear to our common humanity and especially to republicans are made the butt of coarse and senseless ribaldry by this lowminded scribbler it is time that the respectable and religious portion of our community should be aroused to the alarming inroads of foreign jacobinism sansculottism and infidelity it is a fearful proof of the widespread nature of this contagion that these secret stabs at religion and virtue are given from under the cloak credite posteri of a clergyman it is a mournful spectacle indeed to the patriot and christian to see liberality and new ideas falsely so calledthey are as old as eden invading the sacred precincts of the pulpit on the whole we consider this volume as one of the first shocking results which we predicted would spring out of the late french revolution                                        from the bungtown copper and comprehensive tocsin a tryweakly family journal   altogether an admirable work full of humor boisterous but delicateof wit withering and scorching yet combined with a pathos cool as morning dewof satire ponderous as the mace of richard yet keen as the scymitar of saladin a work full of mountainmirth mischievous as puck and lightsome as ariel we know not whether to admire most the genial fresh and discursive concinnity of the author or his playful fancy weird imagination and compass of style at once both objective and subjective we might indulge in some criticisms but were the author other than he is he would be a different being as it is he has a wonderful pose which flits from flower to flower and bears the reader irresistibly along on its eagle pinions like ganymede to the highest heaven of invention  we love a book so purely objective  many of his pictures of natural scenery have an extraordinary subjective clearness and fidelity in fine we consider this as one of the most extraordinary volumes of this or any age we know of no english author who could have written it it is a work to which the proud genius of our country standing with one foot on the aroostook and the other on the rio grande and holding up the starspangled banner amid the wreck of matter and the crush of worlds may point with bewildering scorn of the punier efforts of enslaved europe we hope soon to encounter our author among those higher walks of literature in which he is evidently capable of achieving enduring fame already we should be inclined to assign him a high position in the bright galaxy of our american bards                                       from the saltriver pilot and flag of freedom  a volume in bad grammar and worse taste while the pieces here collected were confined to their appropriate sphere in the corners of

recently returned from a continental tour and who is already favorably known to our readers by his sprightly letters from abroad which have graced our columns called at our office yesterday we learn from him that having enjoyed the distinguished privilege while in germany of an introduction to the celebrated von humbug he took the opportunity to present that eminent man with a copy of the biglow papers the next morning he received the following note which he has kindly furnished us for publication we prefer to print it verbatim knowing that our readers will readily forgive the few errors into

a copy of his famous work on cosmetics to be presented to mr biglow but this was taken from our friend by the english customhouse officers probably through a petty national spite no doubt it has by this time found its way into the british museum we trust this outrage will be exposed in all our american papers we shall do our best to bring it to the notice of the state department our numerous readers will share in the pleasure we experience at seeing our young and vigorous national literature thus encouragingly patted on the head by this venerable and worldrenowned german we love to see

as it contains one of mr biglows poems not elsewhere printedhw  from the jaalam independent blunderbuss   but while we lament to see our young townsman thus mingling in the heated contests of party politics we think we detect in him the presence of talents which if properly directed might give an innocent pleasure to many as a proof that he is competent to the production of other kinds of poetry

porcine calcasti en siliquas accipe jac car fil ad pub leg section 1   note to titlepage  it will not have escaped the attentive eye that i have on the titlepage omitted those honorary appendages to the editorial name which not only add greatly to the value of every book but whet and exacerbate the appetite of the reader for not only does he surmise that an honorary membership of literary and scientific societies implies a certain amount of necessary distinction on the part of the recipient of such decorations but he is willing to trust himself more entirely to an author who writes under the fearful responsibility of involving the reputation of such bodies as the s archæol dahom or the acad lit et scient kamtschat i cannot but think that the early editions of shakespeare and milton would have met with more rapid and general acceptance but for the barrenness of their respective titlepages and i believe that even now a publisher of the works of either of those justly distinguished men would find his account in procuring their admission to the membership of learned bodies on the continenta proceeding no whit more incongruous than the reversal of the judgment against socrates when he was already more than twenty centuries beyond the reach of antidotes and when his memory had acquired a deserved respectability i conceive that it was a feeling of the importance of this precaution which induced mr locke to style himself gent on the titlepage of his essay as who should say to his readers that they could receive his metaphysics on the honor of a gentleman  nevertheless finding that without descending to a smaller size of type than would have been compatible with the dignity of the several societies to be named i could not compress my intended list within the limits of a single page and thinking moreover that the act would carry with it an air of decorous modesty i have chosen to take the reader aside as it were into my private closet and there not only exhibit to him the diplomas which i already possess but also to furnish him with a prophetic vision of those which i may without undue presumption hope for as not beyond the reach of human ambition and attainment and i am the rather induced to this from the fact that my name has been unaccountably dropped from the last triennial catalogue of our beloved alma mater whether this is to be attributed to the difficulty of latinizing any of those honorary adjuncts with a complete list of which i took care to furnish the proper persons nearly a year beforehand or whether it had its origin in any more culpable motives i forbear to consider in this place the matter being in course of painful investigation but however this may be i felt the omission the more keenly as i had in expectation of the new catalogue enriched the library of the jaalam athenæum with the old one then in my possession by which means it has come about that my children will be deprived of a neverwearying winter evenings amusement in looking out the name of their parent in that distinguished roll those harmless innocents had at least committed nobut i forbear having intrusted my reflections and animadversions on this painful topic to the safekeeping of my private diary intended for posthumous publication i state this fact here in order that certain nameless individuals who are perhaps overmuch congratulating themselves upon my silence may know that a rod is in pickle which the vigorous hand of a justly incensed posterity will apply to their memories  the careful reader will note that in the list which i have prepared i have included the names of several cisatlantic societies to which a place is not commonly assigned in processions of this nature i have ventured to do this not only to encourage native ambition and genius but also because i have never been able to perceive in what way distance unless we suppose them at the end of a lever could increase the weight of learned bodies as far as i have been able to extend my researches among such stuffed specimens as occasionally reach america i have discovered no generic difference between the antipodal fogrum japonicum and the f americanum sufficiently common in our own immediate neighborhood yet with a becoming deference to the popular belief that distinctions of this sort are enhanced in value by every additional mile they travel i have intermixed the names of some tolerably distant literary and other associations with the rest  i add here also an advertisement which that it may be the more readily understood by those persons especially interested therein i have written in that curtailed and otherwise maltreated canine latin to the writing and reading of which they are accustomed  omnib per tot orb terrar catalog academ

diffus general tenebr secret corr  introduction  when more than three years ago my talented young parishioner mr biglow came to me and submitted to my animadversions the first of his poems which he intended to commit to the more hazardous trial of a city newspaper it never so much as entered my imagination to conceive that his productions would ever be gathered into a fair volume and ushered into the august presence of the reading public by myself  so little are we shortsighted mortals able to predict the event i confess that there is to me a quite new satisfaction in being associated though only as sleeping partner in a book which can stand by itself in an independent unity on the shelves of libraries for there is always this drawback from the pleasure of printing a sermon that whereas the queasy stomach of this generation will not bear a discourse long enough to make a separate volume those religious and godlyminded children those samuels if i may call them so of the brain must at first be buried in an undistinguished heap and then get such resurrection as is vouchsafed to them mummywrapped with a score of others in a cheap binding with no other mark of distinction than the word miscellaneous printed upon the back far be it from me to claim any credit for the quite unexpected popularity which i am pleased to find these bucolic strains have attained unto if i know myself i am measurably free from the itch of vanity yet i may be allowed to say that i was not backward to recognize in them a certain wild puckery acidulous sometimes even verging toward that point which in our rustic phrase is termed shuteyed flavor not wholly unpleasing nor unwholesome to palates cloyed with the sugariness of tamed and cultivated fruit it may be also that some touches of my own here and there may have led to their wider acceptance albeit solely from my larger experience of literature and authorship9  i was at first inclined to discourage mr biglows attempts as knowing that the desire to poetize is one of the diseases naturally incident to adolescence which if the fitting remedies be not at once and with a bold hand applied may become chronic and render one who might else have become in due time an ornament of the social circle a painful object even to nearest friends and relatives but thinking on a further experience that there was a germ of promise in him which required only culture and the pulling up of weeds from about it i thought it best to set before him the acknowledged examples of english composition in verse and leave the rest to natural emulation with this view i accordingly lent him some volumes of pope and goldsmith to the assiduous study of which he promised to devote his evenings not long afterward he brought me some verses written upon that model a specimen of which i subjoin having changed some phrases of less elegancy and a few rhymes objectionable to the cultivated ear the poem consisted of childish reminiscences and the sketches which follow will not seem destitute of truth to those whose fortunate education began in a country village and first let us hang up his charcoal portrait of the schooldame  propped on the marsh a dwelling now i see the humble schoolhouse of my a b c where welldrilled urchins each behind his tire waited in ranks the wished command to fire then all together when the signal came discharged their ab abs against the dame daughter of danaus who could daily pour in treacherous pipkins her pierian store she mid the volleyed learning firm and calm patted the furloughed ferule on her palm and to our wonder could divine at once who flashed the pan and who was downright dunce  there young devotion learned to climb with ease the gnarly limbs of scripture familytrees and he was most commended and admired who soonest to the topmost twig perspired each name was called as many various ways as pleased the readers ear on different days so that the weather or the ferules stings colds in the head or fifty other things transformed the helpless hebrew thrice a week to guttural pequot or resounding greek the vibrant accent skipping here and there just as it pleased invention or despair no controversial hebraist was the dame with or without the points pleased her the same if any tyro found a name too tough and looked at her pride furnished skill enough she nerved her larynx for the desperate thing and cleared the fivebarred syllables at a spring  ah dear old times there once it was my hap perched on a stool to wear the longeared cap from books degraded there i sat at ease a drone the envy of compulsory bees rewards of merit too full many a time each with its woodcut and its moral rhyme and pierced halfdollars hung on ribbons gay about my neck to be restored next day i carried home rewards as shining then as those that deck the lifelong pains of men more solid than the redemanded praise with which the world beribbons later days  ah dear old times how brightly ye return how rubbed afresh your phosphor traces burn the ramble schoolward through dewsparkling meads the willowwands turned cinderella steeds the impromptu pinbent hook the deep remorse oer the chancecaptured minnows inchlong corse the pockets plethoric with marbles round that still a space for ball and pegtop found nor satiate yet could manage to confine horsechestnuts flagroot and the kites wound twine nay like the prophets carpet could take in enlarging still the popguns magazine the dinner carried in the small tin pail shared with some dog whose most beseeching tail and dripping tongue and eager ears belied the assumed indifference of canine pride the caper homeward shortened if the cart of neighbor pomeroy trundling from the mart oertook methen translated to the seat i praised the steed how stanch he was and fleet while the bluff farmer with superior grin explained where horses should be thick where thin and warned me joke he always had in store to shun a beast that four white stockings wore what a fine natural courtesy was his his nod was pleasure and his full bow bliss how did his wellthumbed hat with ardor rapt its curve decorous to each rank adapt how did it graduate with a courtly ease the whole long scale of social differences yet so gave each his measure running oer none thought his own was less his neighbors more the squire was flattered and the pauper knew old times acknowledged neath the threadbare blue dropped at the corner of the embowered lane whistling i wade the kneedeep leaves again while eager argus who has missed all day the sharer of his condescending play comes leaping onward with a bark elate and boisterous tail to greet me at the gate that i was true in absence to our love let the thick dogsears in my primer prove  i add only one further extract which will possess a melancholy interest to all such as have endeavored to glean the materials of revolutionary history from the lips of aged persons who took a part in the actual making of it and finding the manufacture profitable continued the supply in an adequate proportion to the demand  old joe is gone who saw hot percy goad his slow artillery lip the concord road a tale which grew in wonder year by year as every time he told it joe drew near to the main fight till faded and grown gray the original scene to bolder tints gave way then joe had heard the foes scared doublequick beat on stove drum with one uncaptured stick and ere death came the lengthening tale to lop himself had fired and seen a redcoat drop had joe lived long enough that scrambling fight had squared more nearly with his sense of right and vanquished percy to complete the tale had hammered stone for life in concord jail  i do not know that the foregoing extracts ought not to be called my own rather than mr biglows as indeed he maintained stoutly that my file had left nothing of his in them i should not perhaps have felt entitled to take so great liberties with them had i not more than suspected an hereditary vein of poetry in myself a very near ancestor having written a latin poem in the harvard gratulatio on the accession of george the third suffice it to say that whether not satisfied with such limited approbation as i could conscientiously bestow or from a sense of natural inaptitude certain it is that my young friend could never be induced to any further essays in this kind he affirmed that it was to him like writing in a foreign tonguethat mr popes versification was like the regular ticking of one of willards clocks in which one could fancy after long listening a certain kind of rhythm or tune but which yet was only a povertystricken tick tick after alland that he had never seen a sweetwater on a trellis growing so fairly or in forms so pleasing to his eye as a foxgrape over a scruboak in a swamp he added i know not what to the effect that the sweetwater would only be the more disfigured by having its leaves starched and ironed out and that pegasus so he called him hardly looked right with his mane and tail in curlpapers these and other such opinions i did not long strive to eradicate attributing them rather to a defective education and senses untuned by too long familiarity with purely natural objects than to a perverted moral sense i was the more inclined to this leniency since sufficient evidence was not to seek that his verses wanting as they certainly were in classic polish and point had somehow taken hold of the public ear in a surprising manner so only setting him right as to the quantity of the proper name pegasus i left him to follow the bent of his natural genius  yet could i not surrender him wholly to the tutelage of the pagan which literally interpreted signifies village muse without yet a further effort for his conversion and to this end i resolved that whatever of poetic fire yet burned in myself aided by the assiduous bellows of correct models should be put in requisition accordingly when my ingenious young parishioner brought to my study a copy of verses which he had written touching the acquisition of territory resulting from the mexican war and the folly of leaving the question of slavery or freedom to the adjudication of chance i did myself indite a short fable or apologue after the manner of gay and prior to the end that he might see how easily even such subjects as he treated of were capable of a more refined style and more elegant expression mr biglows production was as follows    the two gunners  a fable  two fellers isrel named and joe one sundy mornin greed to go agunnin soon z the bells wuz done and meetin finally begun sost no one wouldnt be about ther sabbathbreakin to spy out  joe didnt want to go a mite he felt ez though twarnt skeercely right but when his doubts he went to speak

nary thing to pop at found till fairly tired o their spree they leaned their guns agin a tree an jest ez they wuz settin down to take their noonin joe looked roun and see acrost lots in a pond that warnt morn twenty rod beyond a goose that on the water sot ez ef awaitin to be shot  isrel he ups and grabs his gun sez he by ginger heres some fun dont fire sez joe it aint no use thets deacon pelegs tame wilgoose sez isrel i dont care a cent ive sighted an ill let her went bang went queensarm ole gander flopped his wings a spell an quorked an dropped  sez joe i wouldnt ha been hired at that poor

tetched it with a pole but isrel kind o liked the smell on t an made his dinner very well on t   my own humble attempt was in manner and form following and i print it here i sincerely trust out of no vainglory but solely with the hope of doing good    leaving the matter open  a tale  by homer wilbur am  two brothers once an illmatched pair together dwelt no matter where to whom an uncle sam or some one had left a house and farm in common the two in principles and habits were different as rats from rabbits stout farmer north with frugal care laid up provision for his heir not scorning with hard sunbrowned hands to scrape acquaintance with his lands whatever thing he had to do he did and made it pay him too he sold his waste stone by the pound his drains made waterwheels spin round his ice in summertime he sold his wood brought profit when twas cold he dug and delved from morn till night strove to make profit square with right lived on his means cut no great dash and paid his debts in honest cash  on tother hand his brother south lived very much from hand to mouth played gentleman nursed dainty hands borrowed norths money on his lands and culled his morals and his graces from cockpits barrooms fights and races his sole work in the farming line was keeping droves of longlegged swine which brought great bothers and expenses to north in looking after fences and when they happened to break through cost him both time and temper too for south insisted it was plain he ought to drive them home again and north consented to the work because he loved to buy cheap pork  meanwhile souths swine increasing fast his farm became too small at last so having thought the matter over and feeling bound to live in clover and never pay the clovers worth he said one day to brother north  our families are both increasing and though we labor without ceasing our produce soon will be too scant to keep our children out of want they who wish fortune to be lasting must be both prudent and forecasting we soon shall need more land a lot i know that cheaply can be bot you lend the cash ill buy the acres and well be equally partakers  poor north whose anglosaxon blood gave him a hankering after mud wavered a moment then consented and when the cash was paid repented to make the new land worth a pin thought he it must be all fenced in for if souths swine once get the run on t no kind of farming can be done on t if that dont suit the other side tis best we instantly divide  but somehow south could neer incline this way or that to run the line and always found some new pretence gainst setting the division fence at last he said                  for peaces sake liberal concessions i will make though i believe upon my soul ive a just title to the whole ill make an offer which i call genrouswell have no fence at all then both of us wheneer we choose can take what part we want to use if you should chance to need it first pick you the best ill take the worst  agreed cried north thought he this fall with wheat and rye ill sow it all in that way i shall get the start and south may whistle for his part so thought so done the field was sown and winter haying come and gone sly north walked blithely forth to spy the progress of his wheat and rye heavens what a sight his brothers swine had asked themselves all out to dine such grunting munching rooting shoving the soil seemed all alive and moving as for his grain such work theyd made on t he couldnt spy a single blade on t  off in a rage he rushed to south my wheat and ryegrief choked his mouth pray dont mind me said south but plant all of the new land that you want yes but your hogs cried north                                    the grain wont hurt them answered south again but they destroy my crop                              no doubt tis fortunate youve found it out misfortunes teach and only they you must not sow it in their way nay you says north must keep them out did i create them with a snout asked south demurely as agreed the land is open to your seed and would you fain prevent my pigs from running there their harmless rigs god knows i view this compromise with not the most approving eyes i gave up my unquestioned rights for sake of quiet days and nights i offered then you know tis true to cut the piece of land in two then cut it now growls north                                 abate your heat says south tis now too late i offered you the rocky corner but you of your own good the scorner refused to take it i am sorry no doubt you might have found a quarry perhaps a goldmine for aught i know containing heaps of native rhino you cant expect me to resign my rights    but where quoth north are mine your rights says tother well thats funny i bought the land                      i paid the money that answered south is from the point the ownership youll grant is joint im sure my only hope and trust is not law so much as abstract justice though you remember twas agreed that so and soconsult the deed objections now are out of date they might have answered once but fate quashes them at the point weve got to obsta principiis thats my motto so saying south began to whistle and looked as obstinate as gristle while north went homeward each brown paw clenched like a knot of natural law and all the while in either ear heard something clicking wondrous clear   to turn now to other matters there are two things upon which it should seem fitting to dilate somewhat more largely in this placethe yankee character and the yankee dialect and first of the yankee character which has wanted neither open maligners nor even more dangerous enemies in the persons of those unskilful painters who have given to it that hardness angularity and want of proper perspective which in truth belonged not to their subject but to their own niggard and unskilful pencil  new england was not so much the colony of a mother country as a hagar driven forth into the wilderness the little selfexiled band which came hither in 1620 came not to seek gold but to found a democracy they came that they might have the privilege to work and pray to sit upon hard benches and listen to painful preachers as long as they would yea even unto thirtyseventhly if the spirit so willed it and surely if the greek might boast his thermopylæ where three hundred men fell in resisting the persian we may well be proud of our plymouth rock where a handful of men women and children not merely faced but vanquished winter famine the wilderness and the yet more invincible storge that drew them back to the green island far away these found no lotus growing upon the surly shore the taste of which could make them forget their little native ithaca nor were they so wanting to themselves in faith as to burn their ship but could see the fair westwind belly the homeward sail and then turn unrepining to grapple with the terrible unknown  as want was the prime foe these hardy exodists had to fortress themselves against so it is little wonder if that traditional feud be long in wearing out of the stock the wounds of the old warfare were long ahealing and an eastwind of hard times puts a new ache into every one of them thrift was the first lesson in their hornbook pointed out letter after letter by the lean finger of the hard schoolmistress necessity neither were those plump rosygilled englishmen that came hither but a hardfaced atrabilious earnesteyed race stiff from long wrestling with the lord in prayer and who had taught satan to dread the new puritan hug add two hundred years influence of soil climate and exposure with its necessary result of idiosyncrasies and we have the present yankee full of expedients halfmaster of all trades inventive in all but the beautiful full of shifts not yet capable of comfort armed at all points against the old enemy hunger longanimous good at patching not so careful for what is best as for what will do with a clasp to his purse and a button to his pocket not skilled to build against time as in old countries but against sorepressing need accustomed to move the world with no greek pou sto but his own two feet and no lever but his own long forecast a strange hybrid indeed did circumstance beget here in the new world upon the old puritan stock and the earth never before saw such mysticpracticalism such

trades as well as tools his brain is his capital and he will get education at all risks put him on juan fernandez and he would make a spellingbook first and a saltpan afterward in coelum jusseris ibitor the other way eitherit is all one so anything is to be got by it yet after all thin speculative jonathan is more like the englishman of two centuries ago than john bull himself is he has lost somewhat in solidity has become fluent and adaptable but more of the original groundwork of character remains he feels more at home with fulke greville herbert of cherbury quarles george herbert and browne than with his modern english cousins he is nearer than john by at least a hundred years to naseby marston moor worcester and the time when if ever there were true englishmen john bull has suffered the idea of the invisible to be very much fattened out of him jonathan is conscious still that he lives in the world of the unseen as well as of the seen to move john you must make your fulcrum of solid beef and pudding an abstract idea will do for jonathan                                          to the indulgent reader   my friend the rev mr wilbur having been seized with a dangerous fit of illness before this introduction had passed through the press and being incapacitated for all literary exertion sent to me his notes memoranda c and requested me to fashion them into some shape more fitting for the general eye this owing to the fragmentary and disjointed state of his manuscripts i have felt wholly unable to do yet being unwilling that the reader should be deprived of such parts of his lucubrations as seemed more finished and not well discerning how to segregate these from the rest i have concluded to send them all to the press precisely as they are  columbus nye  pastor of a church in bungtown corner   it remains to speak of the yankee dialect and first it may be premised in a general way that any one much read in the writings of the early colonists need not be told that the far greater share of the words and phrases now esteemed peculiar to new england and local there were brought from the mother country a person familiar with the dialect of certain portions of massachusetts will not fail to recognize in ordinary discourse many words now noted in english vocabularies as archaic the greater part of which were in common use about the time of the king james translation of the bible shakespeare stands less in need of a glossary to most newenglanders than to many a native of the old country the peculiarities of our speech however are rapidly wearing out as there is no country where reading is so universal and newspapers are so multitudinous so no phrase remains long local but is transplanted in the mailbags to every remotest corner of the land consequently our dialect approaches nearer to uniformity than that of any other nation  the english have complained of us for coining new words many of those so stigmatized were old ones by them forgotten and all make now an unquestioned part of the currency wherever english is spoken undoubtedly we have a right to make new words as they are needed by the fresh aspects under which life presents itself here in the new world and indeed wherever a language is alive it grows it might be questioned whether we could not establish a stronger title to the ownership of the english tongue than the motherislanders themselves here past all question is to be its great home and centre and not only is it already spoken here by greater numbers but with a far higher popular average of correctness than in britain the great writers of it too we might claim as ours were ownership to be settled by the number of readers and lovers  as regards the provincialisms to be met with in this volume i may say that the reader will not find one which is not as i believe either native or imported with the early settlers nor one which i have not with my own ears heard in familiar use in the metrical portion of the book i have endeavored to adapt the spelling as nearly as possible to the ordinary mode of pronunciation let the reader who deems me overparticular remember this caution of martial    quem recitas meus est o fidentine libellus   sed male cum recitas incipit esse tuus  a few further explanatory remarks will not be impertinent  i shall barely lay down a few general rules for the readers guidance  1 the genuine yankee never gives the rough sound to the r when he can help it and often displays considerable ingenuity in avoiding it even before a vowel  2 he seldom sounds the final g a piece of selfdenial if we consider his partiality for nasals the same of the final d as han and stan for hand and stand  3 the h in such words as while when where he omits altogether  4 in regard to a he shows some inconsistency sometimes giving a close and obscure sound as hev for have hendy for handy ez for as thet for that and again giving it the broad sound it has in father as hânsome for handsome  5 to the sound ou he prefixes an e hard to exemplify otherwise than orally  the following passage in shakespeare he would recite thus  neow is the winta uv eour discontent med

drawl ad libitum  mr wilburs notes here become entirely fragmentarycn   greek a unable to procure a likeness of mr biglow i thought the curious reader might be gratified with a sight of the editorial effigies and here a choice between two was offeredthe one a profile entirely black cut by doyle the other a portrait painted by a native artist of much promise the first of these seemed wanting in expression and in the second a slight obliquity of the visual organs has been heightened perhaps from an overdesire of force on the part of the artist into too close an approach to actual strabismus this slight divergence in my optical apparatus from the ordinary modelhowever i may have been taught to regard it in the light of a mercy rather than a cross since it enabled me to give as much of directness and personal application to my discourses as met the wants of my congregation without risk of offending any by being supposed to have him or her in my eye as the saying isseemed yet to mrs wilbur a sufficient objection to the engraving of the aforesaid painting we read of many who either absolutely refused to allow the copying of their features as especially did plotinus and agesilaus among the ancients not to mention the more modern instances of scioppius palæottus pinellus velserus gataker and others or were indifferent thereto as cromwell  greek b yet was cæsar desirous of

job as going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it bishop latimer will have him to have been a bishop but to me that other calling would appear more congenial the sect of cainites is not yet extinct who esteemed the firstborn of adam to be the most worthy not only because of that privilege of primogeniture but inasmuch as he was able to overcome and slay his younger brother that was a wise saying of the famous marquis pescara to the papal legate that it was impossible for men to serve mars and christ at the same time yet in time past the profession of arms was judged to be greek kat exochaen that of a gentleman nor does this opinion want for strenuous upholders even in our day must we suppose then that the profession of christianity was only intended for losels or at best to afford an opening for plebeian ambition or shall we hold with that nicely metaphysical pomeranian captain vratz who was count königsmarks chief instrument in the murder of mr thynne that the scheme of salvation has been arranged with an especial eye to the necessities of the upper classes and that god would consider a gentleman and deal with him suitably to the condition and profession he had placed him in it may be said of us all exemplo plus quam ratione vivimushw    no ii  a letter  from mr hosea biglow to the hon jt buckingham editor of the boston courier covering a letter from mr b sawin private in the massachusetts regiment   this letter of mr sawins was not originally written in verse mr biglow thinking it peculiarly susceptible of metrical adornment translated it so to speak into his own vernacular tongue this is not the time to consider the question whether rhyme be a mode of expression natural to the human race if leisure from other and more important avocations be granted i will handle the matter more at large in an appendix to the present volume in this place i will barely remark that i have sometimes noticed in the unlanguaged prattlings of infants a fondness for alliteration assonance and even rhyme in which natural predisposition we may trace the three degrees through which our anglosaxon verse rose to its culmination in the poetry of pope i would not be understood as questioning in these remarks that pious theory which supposes that children if left entirely to themselves would naturally discourse in hebrew for this the authority of one experiment is claimed and i could with sir thomas browne desire its establishment inasmuch as the acquirement of that sacred tongue would thereby be facilitated i am aware that herodotus states the conclusion of psammetieus to have been in favor of a dialect of the phrygian but beside the chance that a trial of this importance would hardly be blessed to a pagan monarch whose only motive was curiosity we have on the hebrew side the comparatively recent investigation of james the fourth of scotland i will add to this prefatory remark that mr sawin though a native of jaalam has never been a stated attendant on the religious exercises of my congregation i consider my humble efforts prospered in that not one of my sheep hath ever indued the wolfs clothing of war save for the comparatively innocent diversion of a militia training not that my flock are backward to undergo the hardships of defensive warfare they serve cheerfully in the great army which fights even unto death pro aris et focis accoutred with the spade the axe the plane the sledge the spellingbook and other such effectual weapons against want and ignorance and unthrift i have taught them under god to esteem our human

for the spreading of free institutions and of protestantism capita vix duabus anticyris medenda verily i admire that no pious sergeant among these new crusaders beheld martin luther riding at the front of the host upon a tamed pontifical bull as in that former invasion of mexico the zealous gomara spawn though he were of the scarlet woman was favored with a vision of st james of compostella skewering the infidels upon his apostolical lance we read also that richard of the lion heart having gone to palestine on a similar errand of mercy was divinely encouraged to cut the throats of such

those foolish fishes such piscatorial persuasion is satan cunning in before one he trails a hat and feather or a bare feather without a hat before another a presidential chair or a tidewaiters stool

marathon and those dioscuri whom we must conclude imps of the pit who sundry times captained the pagan roman soldiery it is strange that our first american crusade was not in some such wise also signalized yet it is said that the lord hath manifestly prospered our armies this opens the question whether when our hands are strengthened to make great slaughter of our enemies it be absolutely and demonstratively certain that this might is added to us from above or whether some potentate from an opposite quarter may not have a finger in it as there are few pies into which his meddling digits are not thrust would the sanctifier and setterapart of the seventh day have assisted in a victory gained on the sabbath as was one in the late war do we not know from josephus that careful of his decree a certain river in judaea abstained from flowing on the day of rest or has that day become less an object of his especial care since the year 1697 when so manifest a providence occurred to mr

moreover have conveyed to them a symbolical reproof for their breach of the day being known in the rude dialect of our mariners as cape cod clergymen  it has been a refreshment to many nice consciences to know that our chief magistrate would not regard with eyes of approval the by many esteemed sinful pastime of dancing and i own myseif to be so far of that mind that i could not but set my face against this mexican polka though danced to the presidential piping with a gubernatorial second if ever the country should be seized with another such mania pro propaganda fide i think it would be wise to fill our bombshells with alternate copies of the cambridge platform and the thirtynine articles which would produce a mixture of the highest explosive power and to wrap every one of our cannonballs in a leaf of the new testament the reading of which is denied to those who sit in the darkness of popery those iron evangelists would thus be able to disseminate vital religion and gospel truth in quarters inaccessible to the ordinary missionary i have seen lads unimpregnate with the more sublimated punctiliousness of walton secure pickerel taking their unwary siesta beneath the lilypads too nigh the surface with a gun and small shot why not then since gunpowder was unknown in the time of the apostles not to enter here upon the question whether it were discovered before that period by the chinese suit our metaphor to the age in which we live and say shooters as well as fishers of men  i do much fear that we shall be seized now and then with a protestant fervor as long as we have neighbor naboths whose wallowings in papistical mire excite our horror in exact proportion to the size and desirableness of their vineyards yet i rejoice that some earnest protestants have been made by this wari mean those who protested against it fewer they were than i could wish for one might imagine america to have been colonized by a tribe of those nondescript african animals the ayeayes so difficult a word is no to us all there is some malformation or defect of the vocal organs which either prevents our uttering it at all or gives it so thick a pronunciation as to be

its original to a speech of ensign cilley at a dinner of the bungtown fencibleshw    no iii  what mr robinson thinks  a few remarks on the following verses will not be out of place the satire in them was not meant to have any personal but only a general application of the gentleman upon whose letter they were intended as a commentary mr biglow had never heard till he saw the letter itself the position of the satirist is oftentimes one which he would not have chosen had the election been left to himself in attacking bad principles he is obliged to select some individual who has made himself their exponent and in whom they are impersonate to the end that what he says may not through ambiguity be dissipated tenues in auras for what says seneca longum iter per præcepta breve et efficace per exempla a bad principle is comparatively harmless while it continues to be an abstraction nor can the general mind comprehend it fully till it is printed in that large type which all men can read at sight namely the life and character the sayings and doings of particular persons it is one of the cunningest fetches of satan that he never exposes himself directly to our arrows but still dodging behind this neighbor or that acquaintance compels us to wound him through them if at all he holds our affections as hostages the while he patches up a truce with our conscience  meanwhile let us not forget that the aim of the true satirist is not to be severe upon persons but only upon falsehood and as truth and falsehood start from the same point and sometimes even go along together for a little way his business is to follow the path of the latter after it diverges and to show her floundering in the bog at the end of it truth is quite beyond the reach of satire there is so brave a simplicity in her that she can no more be made ridiculous than an oak or a pine the danger of the satirist is that continual use may deaden his sensibility to the force of language he becomes more and more liable to strike harder than he knows or intends he may be careful to put on his boxinggloves and yet forget that the older they grow the more plainly may the knuckles inside be felt moreover in the heat of contest the eye is insensibly drawn to the crown of victory whose tawdry tinsel glitters through that dust of the ring which obscures truths wreath of simple leaves i have sometimes thought that my young friend mr biglow needed a monitory hand laid on his armaliquid sufflaminandus erat i have never thought it good husbandry to water the tender plants of reform with aqua fortis yet where so much is to do in the beds he were a sorry gardener who should wage a whole days war with an iron scuffle on those ill weeds that make the gardenwalks of life unsightly when a sprinkle of attic salt will wither them up est ars etiam maledicendi says scaliger and truly it is a hard thing to say where the graceful gentleness of the lamb merges in downright sheepishness we may conclude with worthy

that pernicious sentimentour country right or wrong it is an abuse of language to call a certain portion of land much more certain personages elevated for the time being to high station our country i would not sever nor loosen a single one of those ties by which we are united to the spot of our birth nor minish by a tittle the respect due to the magistrate i love our own bay state too well to do the one and as for the other i have myself for nigh forty years exercised however unworthily the function of justice of the peace having been called thereto by the unsolicited kindness of that most excellent man and upright patriot caleb strong patriæ fumus igne alieno luculentior is best qualified with thisubi libertas ibi patria we are inhabitants of two worlds and owe a double but not a divided allegiance in virtue of our clay this little ball of earth exacts a certain loyalty of us while in our capacity as spirits we are admitted citizens of an invisible and holier fatherland there is a patriotism of the soul whose claim absolves us from our other and terrene fealty our true country is that ideal realm which we represent to ourselves under the names of religion duty and the like our terrestrial organizations are but faroff approaches to so fair a model and all they are verily traitors who resist not any attempt to divert them from this their original intendment when therefore one would have us to fling up our caps and shout with the multitudeour country however bounded he demands of us that we sacrifice the larger to the less the higher to the lower and that we yield to the imaginary claims of a few acres of soil our duty and privilege as liegemen of truth our true country is bounded on the north and the south on the east and the west by justice and when she oversteps that invisible boundaryline by so much as a hairsbreadth she ceases to be our mother and chooses rather to be looked upon quasi noverca that is a hard choice when our earthly love of country calls upon us to tread one path and our duty points us to another we must make as noble and becoming an election as did penelope between icarius and ulysses veiling our faces we must take silently the hand of duty to follow her  shortly after the publication of the foregoing poem there appeared some comments upon it in one of the public prints which seemed to call for animadversion i accordingly addressed to mr buckingham of the boston courier the following letter   jaalam november 4 1847  to the editor of the courier  respected sircalling at the postoffice this morning our worthy and efficient postmaster offered for my perusal a paragraph in the boston morning post of the 3d instant wherein certain effusions of the pastoral muse are attributed to the pen of mr james russell lowell for aught i know or can affirm to the contrary this mr lowell may be a very deserving person and a youth of parts though i have seen verses of his which i could never rightly understand and if he be such he i am certain as well as i would be free from any proclivity to appropriate to himself whatever of credit or discredit may honestly belong to another i am confident that in penning these few lines i am only forestalling a disclaimer from that young gentleman whose silence hitherto when rumor pointed to himward has excited in my bosom mingled emotions of sorrow and surprise well may my young parishioner mr biglow exclaim with the poet    sic vos non vobis c  though in saying this i would not convey the impression that he is a proficient in the latin tonguethe tongue i might add of a horace and a tully  mr b does not employ his pen i can safely say for any lucre of worldly gain or to be exalted by the carnal plaudits of men digito monstrari c he does not wait upon providence for mercies and in his heart mean merces but i should esteem myself as verily deficient in my duty who am his friend and in some unworthy sort his spiritual fidus achates c if i did not step forward to claim for him whatever measure of applause might be assigned to him by the judicious  if this were a fitting occasion i might venture here a brief dissertation touching the manner and kind of my young friends poetry but i dubitate whether this abstruser sort of speculation though enlivened by some apposite instances from aristophanes would sufficiently interest your oppidan readers as regards their satirical tone and their plainness of speech i will only say that in my pastoral experience i have found that the archenemy loves nothing better than to be treated as a religious moral and intellectual being and that there is no apage sathanas so potent as ridicule but it is a kind of weapon that must have a button of goodnature on the point of it  the productions of mr b have been stigmatized in some quarters as unpatriotic but i can vouch that he loves his native soil with that hearty though discriminating attachment which springs from an intimate social intercourse of many years standing in the ploughing season no one has a deeper share in the wellbeing of the country than he if dean swift were right in saying that he who makes two blades of grass grow where one grew before confers a greater benefit on the state than he who taketh a city mr b might exhibit a fairer claim to the presidency than general scott himself i think that some of those disinterested lovers of the hardhanded democracy whose fingers have never touched anything rougher than the dollars of our common country would hesitate to compare palms with him it would do your heart good respected sir to see that young man mow he cuts a cleaner and wider swath than any in this town  but it is time for me to be at my post it is very clear that my young friends shot has struck the lintel for the post is shaken amos ix 1 the editor of that paper is a strenuous advocate of the mexican war and a colonel as i am given to understand i presume that being necessarily absent in mexico he has left his journal in some less judicious hands at any rate the post has been too swift on this occasion it could hardly have cited a more incontrovertible line from any poem than that which it has selected for animadversion namely    we kind o thought christ went agin war an pillage  if the post maintains the converse of this proposition it can hardly be considered as a safe guidepost for the moral and religious portions of its party however many other excellent qualities of a post it may be blessed with there is a sign in london on which is paintedthe green man it would do very well as a portrait of any individual who should support so unscriptural a thesis as regards the language of the line in question i am bold to say that he who readeth the hearts of men will not account any dialect unseemly which conveys a sound and pious sentiment i could wish that such sentiments were more common however uncouthly expressed saint ambrose affirms that veritas a quocunque why not then quomodocunque dicatur a spiritu sancto est digest also this of baxter the plainest words are the most profitable oratory in the weightiest matters  when the paragraph in question was shown to mr biglow the only part of it which seemed to give him any dissatisfaction was that which classed him with the whig party he says that if resolutions are a nourishing kind of diet that party must be in a very hearty and flourishing condition for that they have quietly eaten more good ones of their own baking than he could have conceived to be possible without repletion he has been for some years past i regret to say an ardent opponent of those sound doctrines of protective policy which form so prominent a portion of the creed of that party i confess that in some discussions which i have had with him on this point in my study he has displayed a vein of obstinacy which i had not hitherto detected in his composition he is also horresco referens infected in no small measure with the peculiar notions of a print called the liberator whose heresies i take every proper opportunity of combating and of which i thank god i have never read a single line  i did not see mr bs verses until they appeared in print and there is certainly one thing in them which i consider highly improper i allude to the personal references to myself by name to confer notoriety on an humble individual who is laboring quietly in his vocation and who keeps his cloth as free as he can from the dust of the political arena though voe mihi si non evangelizavero is no doubt an indecorum the sentiments which he attributes to me i will not deny to be mine they were embodied though in a different form in a discourse preached upon the last day of public fasting and were acceptable to my entire people of whatever political views except the postmaster who dissented ex officio i observe that you sometimes devote a portion of your paper to a religious summary i should be well pleased to furnish a copy of my discourse for insertion in this department of your instructive journal by omitting the advertisements it might easily be got within the limits of a single number and i venture to insure you the sale of some scores of copies in this town i will cheerfully render myself responsible for ten it might possibly be advantageous to issue it as an extra but perhaps you will not esteem it an object and i will not press it my offer does not spring from any weak desire of seeing my name in print for i can enjoy this satisfaction at any time by turning to the triennial catalogue of the university where it also possesses that added emphasis of italics with which those of my calling are distinguished  i would simply add that i continue to fit ingenuous youth for college and that i have two spacious and airy sleeping apartments at this moment unoccupied ingenuas didicisse c terms which vary according to the circumstances of the parents may be known on application to me by letter postpaid in all cases the lad will be expected to fetch his own towels this rule mrs w desires me to add has no exceptions  respectfully your obedient servant  homer wilbur am  ps perhaps the last paragraph may look like an attempt to obtain the insertion of my circular gratuitously if it should appear to you in that light i desire that you would erase it or charge for it at the usual rates and deduct the amount from the proceeds in your hands from the sale of my discourse when it shall be printed my circular is much longer and more explicit and will be forwarded without charge to any who may desire it it has been very neatly executed on a letter sheet by a very deserving printer who attends upon my ministry and is a creditable specimen of the typographic art i have one hung over my mantelpiece in a neat frame where it makes a beautiful and appropriate ornament and balances the profile of mrs w cut with her toes by the young lady born without arms  hw   i have in the foregoing letter mentioned general scott in connection with the presidency because i have been given to understand that he has blown to pieces and otherwise caused to be destroyed more mexicans than any other commander his claim would therefore be deservedly considered the strongest until accurate returns of the mexicans killed wounded and maimed be obtained it will be difficult to settle these nice points of precedence should it prove that any other officer has been more meritorious and destructive than general s and has thereby rendered himself more worthy of the confidence and support of the conservative portion of our community i shall cheerfully insert his name instead of that of general s in a future edition it may be thought likewise that general s has invalidated his claims by too much attention to the decencies of apparel and the habits belonging to a gentleman these abstruser points of statesmanship are beyond my scope i wonder not that successful military achievement should attract the admiration of the multitude rather do i rejoice with wonder to behold how rapidly this sentiment is losing its hold upon the popular mind it is related of thomas warton the second of that honored name who held the office of poetry professor at oxford that when one wished to find him being absconded as was his wont in some obscure alehouse he was counselled to traverse the city with a drum and fife the sound of which inspiring music would be sure to draw the doctor from his retirement into the street we are all more or less bitten with this martial insanity nescio qua dulcedine  cunctos ducit i confess to some infection of that itch myself when i see a brigadiergeneral maintaining his insecure elevation in the saddle under the severe fire of the trainingfield and when i remember that some military enthusiasts through haste inexperience or an overdesire to lend reality to those fictitious combats will sometimes discharge their ramrods i cannot but admire while i deplore the mistaken devotion of those heroic officers semel insanivimus omnes i was myself during the late war with great britain chaplain of a regiment which was fortunately never called to active military duty i mention this circumstance with regret rather than pride had i been summoned to actual warfare i trust that i might have been strengthened to bear myself after the manner of that reverend father in our new england israel dr benjamin colman who as we are told in turells life of him when the vessel in which he had taken passage for england was attacked by a french privateer fought like a philosopher and a christian  and prayed all the while he charged and fired as this note is already long i shall not here enter upon a discussion of the question whether christians may lawfully be soldiers i think it sufficiently evident that during the first two centuries of the christian era at least the two professions were esteemed incompatible consult jortin on this headhw    no iv  remarks of increase d ophace esquire  at an extrumpery caucus in state street reported by mr h biglow   the ingenious reader will at once understand that no such speech as the following was ever totidem verbis pronounced but there are simpler and less guarded wits for the satisfying of which such an explanation may be needful for there are certain invisible lines which as truth successively overpasses she becomes untruth to one and another of us as a large river flowing from one kingdom into another sometimes takes a new name albeit the waters undergo no change how small soever there is moreover a truth of fiction more veracious than the truth of fact as that of the poet which represents to us things and events as they ought to be rather than servilely copies them as they are imperfectly imaged in the crooked and smoky glass of our mundane affairs it is this which makes the speech of antonius though originally spoken in no wider a forum than the brain of shakespeare more historically valuable than that other which appian has reported by as much as the understanding of the englishman was more comprehensive than that of the alexandrian mr biglow in the present instance has only made use of a license assumed by all the historians of antiquity who put into the mouths of various characters such words as seem to them most fitting to the occasion and to the speaker if it be objected that no such oration could ever have been delivered i answer that there are few assemblages for speechmaking which do not better deserve the title of parliamentum indoctorum than did the sixth parliament of henry the fourth and that men still continue to have as much faith in the oracle of fools as ever pantagruel had howell in his letters recounts a merry tale of a certain ambassador of queen elizabeth who having written two lettersone to her majesty and the other to his wifedirected them at crosspurposes so that the queen was beducked and bedeared and requested to send a change of hose and the wife was beprincessed and otherwise unwontedly besuperlatived till the one feared for the wits of her ambassador and the other for those of her husband in like manner it may be presumed that our speaker has misdirected some of his thoughts and given to the whole theatre what he would have wished to confide only to a select auditory at the back of the curtain for it is seldom that we can get any frank utterance from men who address for the most part a buncombe either in this world or the next as for their audiences it may be truly said of our people that they enjoy one political institution in common with the ancient athenians i mean a certain profitless kind of ostracism wherewith nevertheless they seem hitherto well enough content for in presidential elections and other affairs of the sort whereas i observe that the oysters fall to the lot of comparatively few the shells such as the privileges of voting as they are told to do by the ostrivori aforesaid and of huzzaing at public meetings are very liberally distributed among the people as being their prescriptive and quite sufficient portion  the occasion of the speech is supposed to be mr palfreys refusal to vote for the whig candidate for the speakershiphw   no hez he he haint though wut voted agin him ef the bird of our country could ketch him shed skin him i seem s though i

so noted a pest           230 i shant talk with him my religions too fervent good mornin my friends im your most humble servant   into the question whether the ability to express ourselves in articulate language has been productive of more good or evil i shall not here enter at large the two faculties of speech and of speechmaking are wholly diverse in their natures by the first we make ourselves intelligible by the last unintelligible to our fellows it has not seldom occurred to me noting how in our national legislature everything runs to talk as lettuces if the season or the soil be unpropitious shoot up lankly to seed instead of forming handsome heads that babel was the first congress the earliest mill erected for the manufacture of gabble in these days what with town meetings school committees boards lumber of one kind and another congresses parliaments diets indian councils palavers and the like there is scarce a village which has not its factories of this description driven by milkandwater power i cannot conceive the confusion of tongues to have been the curse of babel since i esteem my ignorance of other languages as a kind of martellotower in which i am safe from the furious bombardments of foreign garrulity for this reason i have ever preferred the study of the dead languages those primitive formations being ararats upon whose silent peaks i sit secure and watch this new deluge without fear though it rain figures simulacra semblances of speech forty days and nights together as it not uncommonly happens thus is my coat as it were without buttons by which any but a vernacular wild bore can seize me is it not possible that the shakers may intend to convey a quiet reproof and hint in fastening their outer garments with hooks and eyes  this reflection concerning babel which i find in no commentary was first thrown upon my mind when an excellent deacon of my congregation being infected with the second advent delusion assured me that he had received a first instalment of the gift of tongues as a small earnest of larger possessions in the like kind to follow for of a truth i could not reconcile it with my ideas of the divine justice and mercy that the single wall which protected people of other languages from the incursions of this otherwise wellmeaning propagandist should be broken down  in reading congressional debates i have fancied that after the subsidence of those painful buzzings in the brain which result from such exercises i detected a slender residuum of valuable information i made the discovery that nothing takes longer in the saying than anything else for as ex nihilo nihil fit so from one polypus nothing any number of similar ones may be produced i would recommend to the attention of viva voce debaters and controversialists the admirable example of the monk copres who in the fourth century stood for half an hour in the midst of a great fire and thereby silenced a manichæan antagonist who had less of the salamander in him as for those who quarrel in print i have no concern with them here since the eyelids are a divinely granted shield against all such moreover i have observed in many modern books that the printed portion is becoming gradually smaller and the number of blank or flyleaves as they are called greater should this fortunate tendency of literature continue books will grow more valuable from year to year and the whole serbonian bog yield to the advances of firm arable land  the sagacious lacedæmonians hearing that tesephone had bragged that he could talk all day long on any given subject made no more ado but forthwith banished him whereby they supplied him a topic and at the same time took care that his experiment upon it should be tried out of earshot  i have wondered in the representatives chamber of our own commonwealth to mark how little impression seemed to be produced by that emblematic fish suspended over the heads of the members our wiser ancestors no doubt hung it there as being the animal which the pythagoreans reverenced for its silence and which certainly in that particular does not so well merit the epithet cold blooded by which naturalists distinguish it as certain bipeds afflicted with ditchwater on the brain who take occasion to tap themselves in faneuil halls meetinghouses and other places of public resorthw    no v  the debate in the sennit  sot to a nusry rhyme   the incident which gave rise to the debate satirized in the following verses was the unsuccessful attempt of drayton and sayres to give freedom to seventy men and women fellowbeings and fellowchristians had tripoli instead of washington been the scene of this undertaking the unhappy leaders in it would have been as secure of the theoretic as they now are of the practical part of martyrdom i question whether the dey of tripoli is blessed with a district attorney so benighted as ours at the seat of government very fitly is he named key who would allow himself to be made the instrument of locking the door of hope against sufferers in such a cause not all the waters of the ocean can cleanse the vile smutch of the jailers fingers from off that little key ahenea clavis a brazen key indeed  mr calhoun who is made the chief speaker in this burlesque seems to think that the light of the nineteenth century is to be put out as soon as he tinkles his little cowbell curfew whenever slavery is touched he sets up his scarecrow of dissolving the union this may do for the north but i should conjecture that something more than a pumpkinlantern is required to scare manifest and irretrievable destiny out of her path mr calhoun cannot let go the apronstring of the past the past is a good nurse but we must be weaned from her sooner or later even though like plotinus we should run home from school to ask the breast after we are tolerably wellgrown youths it will not do for us to hide our faces in her lap whenever the strange future holds out her arms and asks us to come to her  but we are all alike we have all heard it said often enough that little boys must not play with fire and yet if the matches be taken away from us and put out of reach upon the shelf we must needs get into our little corner and scowl and stamp and threaten the dire revenge of going to bed without our supper the world shall stop till we get our dangerous plaything again dame earth meanwhile who has more than enough household matters to mind goes bustling hither and thither as a hiss or a sputter tells her that this or that kettle of hers is boiling over and before bedtime we are glad to eat our porridge cold and gulp down our dignity along with it  mr calhoun has somehow acquired the name of a great statesman and if it be great statesmanship to put lance in rest and run a tilt at the spirit of the age with the certainty of being next moment hurled neck and heels into the dust amid universal laughter he deserves the title he is the sir kay of our modern chivalry he should remember the old scandinavian mythus thor was the strongest of gods but he could not wrestle with time nor so much as lift up a fold of the great snake which bound the universe together and when he smote the earth though with his terrible mallet it was but as if a leaf had fallen yet all the while it seemed to thor that he had only been wrestling with an old woman striving to lift a cat and striking a stupid giant on the head  and in old times doubtless the giants were stupid and there was no better sport for the sir launcelots and sir gawains than to go about cutting off their great blundering heads with enchanted swords but things have wonderfully changed it is the giants nowadays that have the science and the intelligence while the chivalrous don quixotes of conservatism still cumber themselves with the clumsy armor of a bygone age on whirls the restless globe through unsounded time with its cities and its silences its births and funerals half light half shade but never wholly dark and sure to swing round into the happy morning at last with an involuntary smile one sees mr calhoun letting slip his packthread cable with a crooked pin at the end of it to anchor south

said of old time that riches have wings and though this be not applicable in a literal strictness to the wealth of our patriarchal brethren of the south yet it is clear that their possessions have legs and an unaccountable propensity for using them in a northerly direction i marvel that the grand jury of washington did not find a true bill against the north star for aiding and abetting drayton and sayres it would have been quite of a piece with the intelligence displayed by the south on other questions connected with slavery i think that no ship of state was ever freighted with a more veritable jonah than this same domestic institution of ours mephistopheles himself could not feign so bitterly so satirically sad a sight as this of three millions of human beings crushed beyond help or hope by this one mighty argumentour fathers knew no better nevertheless it is the unavoidable destiny of jonahs to be cast overboard sooner or later or shall we try the experiment of hiding our jonah in a safe place that none may lay hands on him to make jetsam of him let us then with equal forethought and wisdom lash ourselves to the anchor and await in pious confidence the certain result perhaps our suspicious passenger is no jonah after all being black for it is well known that a superintending providence made a kind of sandwich of ham and his descendants to be devoured by the caucasian race  in gods name let all who hear nearer and nearer the hungry moan of the storm and the growl of the breakers speak out but alas we have no right to interfere if a man pluck an apple of mine he shall be in danger of the justice but if he steal my brother i must be silent who says this our constitution consecrated by the callous consuetude of sixty years and grasped in triumphant

honorable mr bagowind mc will be expected to take their places on the left as our hircine vicars    quid sum miser tunc dicturus   quem patronum rogaturus  there is a point where toleration sinks into sheer baseness and poltroonery the toleration of the worst leads us to look on what is barely better as good enough and to worship what is only moderately good woe to that man or that nation to whom mediocrity has become an ideal  has our experiment of selfgovernment succeeded if it barely manage to rub and go here now is a piece of barbarism which christ and the nineteenth century say shall cease and which messrs smith brown and others say shall not cease i would by no means deny the eminent respectability of these gentlemen but i confess that in such a wrestling match i cannot help having my fears for them    discite justitiam moniti et non temnere divos  hw    no vi  the pious editors creed   at the special instance of mr biglow i preface the following satire with an extract from a sermon preached during the past summer from ezekiel xxxiv 2 son of man prophesy against the shepherds of israel since the sabbath on which this discourse was delivered the editor of the jaalam independent blunderbuss has unaccountably absented himself from our house of worship  i know of no so responsible position as that of the public journalist the editor of our day bears the same relation to his time that the clerk bore to the age before the invention of printing indeed the position which he holds is that which the clergyman should hold even now but the clergyman chooses to walk off to the extreme edge of the world and to throw such seed as he has clear over into that darkness which he calls the next life as if next did not mean nearest and as if any life were nearer than that immediately present one which boils and eddies all around him at the caucus the ratification meeting and the polls who taught him to exhort men to prepare for eternity as for some future era of which the present forms no integral part the furrow which time is even now turning runs through the everlasting and in that must he plant or nowhere yet he would fain believe and teach that we are going to have more of eternity than we have now this going of his is like that of the auctioneer on which gone follows before we have made up our minds to bidin which manner not three months back i lost an excellent copy of chappelow on job so it has come to pass that the preacher instead of being a living force has faded into an emblematic figure at christenings weddings and funerals or if he exercise any other function it is as keeper and feeder of certain theologic dogmas which when occasion offers he unkennels with a staboy to bark and bite as tis their nature to whence that reproach of odium theologicum has arisen  meanwhile see what a pulpit the editor mounts daily sometimes with a congregation of fifty thousand within reach of his voice and never so much as a nodder even among them and from what a bible can he choose his texta bible which needs no translation and which no priestcraft can shut and clasp from the laitythe open volume of the world upon which with a pen of sunshine or destroying fire the inspired present is even now writing the annals of god methinks the editor who should understand his calling and be equal thereto would truly deserve that title of greek poimaen laon which homer bestows upon princes he would be the moses of our nineteenth century and whereas the old sinai silent now is but a common mountain stared at by the elegant tourist and crawled over by the hammering geologist he must find his tables of the new law here among factories and cities in this wilderness of sin numbers xxxiii 12 called progress of civilization and be the captain of our exodus into the canaan of a truer social order  nevertheless our editor will not come so far within even the shadow of sinai as mahomet did but chooses rather to construe moses by joe smith he takes up the crook not that the sheep may be fed but that he may never want a warm woollen suit and a joint of mutton    immemor o fidei pecorumque oblite tuorum  for which reason i would derive the name editor not so much from edo to publish as from edo to eat that being the peculiar profession to which he esteems himself called he blows up the flames of political discord for no other occasion than that he may thereby handily boil his own pot i believe there are two thousand of these muttonloving shepherds in the united states and of these how many have even the dimmest perception of their immense power and the duties consequent thereon here and there haply one nine hundred and ninetynine labor to impress upon the people the great principles of tweedledum and other nine hundred

infinitesimal creature upon whom some score of others as minute as he are gazing in openmouthed admiration is a famous philosopher expounding to a select audience their capacity for the infinite that scarce discernible pufflet of smoke and dust is a revolution that speck there is a reformer just arranging the lever with which he is to move the world and lo there creeps forward the shadow of a skeleton that blows one breath between its grinning teeth and all our distinguished actors are whisked off the slippery stage into the dark beyond  yes the little showbox has its solemner suggestions now and then we catch a glimpse of a grim old man who lays down a scythe and hourglass in the corner while he shifts the scenes there too in the dim background a weird shape is ever delving sometimes he leans upon his mattock and gazes as a coach whirls by bearing the newly married on their wedding jaunt or glances carelessly at a babe brought home from christening suddenly for the scene grows larger and larger as we look a bony hand snatches back a performer in the midst of his part and him whom yesterday two infinities past and future would not suffice a handful of dust is enough to cover and silence forever nay we see the same fleshless fingers opening to clutch the showman himself and guess not without a shudder that they are lying in wait for spectator also  think of it for three dollars a year i buy a seasonticket to this great globe theatre for which god would write the dramas only that we like farces spectacles and the tragedies of apollyon better whose sceneshifter is time and whose curtain is rung down by death  such thoughts will occur to me sometimes as i am tearing off the wrapper of my newspaper then suddenly that otherwise too often vacant sheet becomes invested for me with a strange kind of awe look deaths and marriages notices of inventions discoveries and books lists of promotions of killed wounded and missing news of fires accidents of sudden wealth and as sudden povertyi hold in my hand the ends of myriad invisible electric conductors along which tremble the joys sorrows wrongs triumphs hopes and despairs of as many men and women everywhere so that upon that mood of mind which seems to isolate me from mankind as a spectator of their puppetpranks another supervenes in which i feel that i too unknown and unheard of am yet of some import to my fellows for through my newspaper here do not families take pains to send me an entire stranger news of a death among them are not here two who would have me know of their marriage and strangest of all is not this singular person anxious to have me informed that he has received a fresh supply of dimitry bruisgins but to none of us does the present continue miraculous even if for a moment discerned as such we glance carelessly at the sunrise and get used to orion and the pleiades the wonder wears off and tomorrow this sheet acts x 11 12 in which a vision was let down to me from heaven shall be the wrappage to a bar of soap or the platter for a beggars broken victualshw    no vii  a letter  from a candidate for the presidency in answer to suttin questions proposed by mr hosea biglow inclosed in a note from mr biglow to sh gay esq editor of the national antislavery standard   curiosity may be said to be the quality which preeminently distinguishes and segregates man from the lower animals as we trace the scale of animated nature downward we find this faculty as it may truly he called of the mind diminished in the savage and wellnigh extinct in the brute the first object which civilized man proposes to himself i take to be the finding out whatsoever he can concerning his neighbors nihil humanum a me alienum puto i am curious about even john smith the desire next in strength to this an opposite pole indeed of the same magnet is that of communicating the unintelligence we have carefully picked up  men in general may be divided into the inquisitive and the communicative to the first class belong peeping toms eavesdroppers navelcontemplating brahmins metaphysicians travellers empedocleses spies the various societies for promoting rhinothism columbuses yankees discoverers and men of science who present themselves to the mind as so many marks of interrogation wandering up and down the world or sitting in studies and laboratories the second class i should again subdivide into four in the first subdivision i would rank those who have an itch to tell us about themselvesas keepers of diaries insignificant persons generally montaignes horace walpoles autobiographers poets the second includes those who are anxious to impart information concerning other peopleas historians barbers and such to the third belong those who labor to give us intelligence about nothing at allas novelists political orators the large majority of authors preachers lecturers and the like in the fourth come those who are communicative from motives of public benevolenceas finders of maresnests and bringers of ill news each of us twolegged fowls without feathers embraces all these subdivisions in himself to a greater or less degree for none of us so much as lays an egg or incubates a chalk one but straightway the whole barnyard shall know it by our cackle or our cluck omnibus hoc vitium est there are different grades in all these classes one will turn his telescope toward a backyard another toward uranus one will tell you that he dined with smith another that he supped with plato in one particular all men may be considered as belonging to the first grand division inasmuch as they all seem equally desirous of discovering the mote in their neighbors eye  to one or another of these species every human being may safely be referred i think it beyond a peradventure that jonah prosecuted some inquiries into the digestive apparatus of whales and that noah sealed up a letter in an empty bottle that news in regard to him might not be wanting in case of the worst they had else been super or subter human i conceive also that as there are certain persons who continually peep and pry at the keyhole of that mysterious door through which sooner or later we all make our exits so there are doubtless ghosts fidgeting and fretting on the other side of it because they have no means of conveying back to this world the scraps of news they have picked up in that for there is an answer ready somewhere to every question the great law of give and take runs through all nature and if we see a hook we may be sure that an eye is waiting for it i read in every face i meet a standing advertisement of information wanted in regard to ab or that the friends of cd can hear something to his disadvantage by application to such a one  it was to gratify the two great passions of asking and answering that epistolary correspondence was first invented letters for by this usurped title epistles are now commonly known are of several kinds first there are those which are not letters at allas letterspatent letters dismissory letters enclosing bills letters of administration plinys letters letters of diplomacy of cato of mentor of lords lyttelton chesterfield and orrery of jacob behmen seneca whom st jerome includes in his list of sacred writers letters from abroad from sons in college to their fathers letters of marque and letters generally which are in no wise letters of mark second are real letters such as those of gray cowper walpole howell lamb dy the first letters from children printed in staggering capitals letters from new york letters of credit and others interesting for the sake of the writer or the thing written i have read also letters from europe by a gentleman named pinto containing some curious gossip and which i hope to see collected for the benefit of the curious there are besides letters addressed to posterityas epitaphs for example written for their own monuments by monarchs whereby we have lately become possessed of the names of several great conquerors and kings of kings hitherto unheard of and still unpronounceable but valuable to the student of the entirely dark ages the letter of our saviour to king abgarus that which st peter sent to king pepin in the year of grace 755 that of the virgin to the magistrates of messina that of the sanhedrim of toledo to annas and caiaphas ad 35 that of galeazzo sforzas spirit to his brother lodovico that of st gregory thaumaturgus to the dl and that of this lastmentioned active policemagistrate to a nun of girgenti i would place in a class by themselves as also the letters of candidates concerning which i shall dilate more fully in a note at the end of the following poem at present sat prata biberunt only concerning the shape of letters they are all either square or oblong

epistles candidatial which are of two kindsnamely letters of acceptance and letters definitive of position our republic on the eve of an election may safely enough be called a republic of letters epistolary composition becomes then an epidemic which seizes one candidate after another not seldom cutting short the thread of political life it has come to such a pass that a party dreads less the attacks of its opponents than a letter from its candidate litera scripta manet and it will go hard if something bad cannot be made of it general harrison it is well understood was surrounded during his candidacy with the cordon sanitaire of a vigilance committee no prisoner in spielberg was ever more cautiously deprived of writing materials the soot was scraped carefully from the chimneyplaces outposts of expert rifleshooters rendered it sure death for any goose who came clad in feathers to approach within a certain limited distance of north bend and all domestic fowls about the premises were reduced to the condition of platos original man by these precautions the general was saved parva componere magnis i remember that when partyspirit once ran high among my people upon occasion of the choice of a new deacon i having my preferences yet not caring too openly to express them made use of an innocent fraud to bring about that result which i deemed most desirable my stratagem was no other than the throwing a copy of the complete letterwriter in the way of the candidate whom i wished to defeat he caught the infection and addressed a short note to his constituents in which the opposite party detected so many and so grave improprieties he had modelled it upon the letter of a young lady accepting a proposal of marriage that he not only lost his election but falling under a suspicion of sabellianism and i know not what the widow endive assured me that he was a paralipomenon to her certain knowledge was forced to leave the town thus it is that the letter killeth  the object which candidates propose to themselves in writing is to convey no meaning at all and here is a quite unsuspected pitfall into which they successively plunge headlong for it is precisely in such cryptographies that mankind are prone to seek for and find a wonderful amount and variety of significance omne ignotum pro mirifico how do we admire at the antique world striving to crack those oracular nuts from delphi hammon and elsewhere in only one of which can i so much as surmise that any kernel had ever lodged that namely wherein apollo confessed that he was mortal one didymus is moreover related to have written six thousand books on the single subject of grammar a topic rendered only more tenebrific by the labors of his successors and which seems still to possess an attraction for authors in proportion as they can make nothing of it a singular loadstone for theologians also is the beast in the apocalypse whereof in the course of my studies i have noted two hundred and three several interpretations each lethiferal to all the rest non nostrum est tantas componere lites yet i have myself ventured upon a two hundred and fourth which i embodied in a discourse preached on occasion of the demise of the late usurper napoleon bonaparte and which quieted in a large measure the minds of my people it is true that my views on this important point were ardently controverted by mr shearjashub holden the then preceptor of our academy and in other particulars a very deserving and sensible young man though possessing a somewhat limited knowledge of the greek tongue but his heresy struck down no deep root and he having been lately removed by the hand of providence i had the satisfaction of reaffirming my cherished sentiments in a sermon preached upon the lords day immediately succeeding his funeral this might seem like taking an unfair advantage did i not add that he had made provision in his last will being celibate for the publication of a posthumous tractate in support of his own dangerous opinions  i know of nothing in our modern times which approaches so nearly to the ancient oracle as the letter of a presidential candidate now among the greeks the eating of beans was strictly forbidden to all such as had it in mind to consult those expert amphibologists and this same prohibition on the part of pythagoras to his disciples is understood to imply an abstinence from politics beans having been used as ballots that other explication quod videlicet sensus eo cibo obtundi existimaret though supported pugnis et calcibus by many of the learned and not wanting the countenance of cicero is confuted by the larger experience of new england on the whole i think it safer to apply here the rule of interpretation which now generally obtains in regard to antique cosmogonies myths fables proverbial expressions and knotty points generally which is to find a commonsense meaning and then select whatever can be imagined the most opposite thereto in this way we arrive at the conclusion that the greeks objected to the questioning of candidates and very properly if as i conceive the chief point be not to discover what a person in that position is or what he will do but whether he can be elected vos exemplaria græca nocturna versate manu versate diurna  but since an imitation of the greeks in this particular the asking of questions being one chief privilege of freemen is hardly to be hoped for and our candidates will answer whether they are questioned or not i would recommend that these anteelectionary dialogues should be carried on by symbols as were the diplomatic correspondences of the scythians an macrobii or confined to the language of signs like the famous interview of panurge and goatsnose a candidate might then convey a suitable reply to all committees of inquiry by closing one eye or by presenting them with a phial of egyptian darkness to be speculated upon by their respective constituencies these answers would be susceptible of whatever retrospective construction the exigencies of the political campaign might seem to demand and the candidate could take his position on either side of the fence with entire consistency or if letters must be written profitable use might be made of the dighton rock hieroglyphic or the cuneiform script every fresh decipherer of which is enabled to educe a different meaning whereby a sculptured stone or two supplies us and will probably continue to supply posterity with a very vast and various body of authentic history for even the briefest epistle in the ordinary chirography is dangerous there is scarce any style so compressed that superfluous words may not be detected in it a severe critic might curtail that famous brevity of cæsars by two thirds drawing his pen through the supererogatory veni and vidi perhaps after all the surest footing of hope is to be found in the rapidly increasing tendency to demand less and less of qualification in candidates already have statesmanship experience and the possession nay the profession even of principles been rejected as superfluous and may not the patriot reasonably hope that the ability to write will follow at present there may be death in pothooks as well as pots the loop of a letter may suffice for a bowstring and all the dreadful heresies of antislavery may lurk in a flourishhw    no viii  a second letter from b sawin esq   in the following epistle we behold mr sawin returning a miles emeritus to the bosom of his family quantum mutatus the good father of us all had doubtless intrusted to the keeping of this child of his certain faculties of a constructive kind he had put in him a share of that vital force the nicest economy of every minute atom of which is necessary to the perfect development of humanity he had given him a brain and heart and so had equipped his soul with the two strong wings of knowledge and love whereby it can mount to hang its nest under the eaves of heaven and this child so dowered he had intrusted to the keeping of his vicar the state how stands the account of that stewardship the state or society call her by what name you will had taken no manner of thought of him till she saw him swept out into the street the pitiful leavings of last nights debauch with cigarends lemonparings tobaccoquids slops vile stenches and the whole loathsome nextmorning of the barrooman own child of the almighty god i remember him as he was brought to be christened a ruddy rugged babe and now there he wallows reeking seethingthe dead corpse not of a man but of a soula putrefying lump horrible for the life that is in it comes the wind of heaven that good samaritan and parts the hair upon his forehead nor is too nice to kiss those parched cracked lips the morning opens upon him her eyes full of pitying sunshine the sky yearns down to himand there he lies fermenting o sleep let me not profane thy holy name by calling that stertorous unconsciousness a slumber by and by comes along the state gods vicar does she say my poor forlorn fosterchild behold here a force which i will make dig and plant and build for me not so but here is a recruit readymade to my hand a piece of destroying energy lying unprofitably idle so she claps an ugly gray suit on him puts a musket in his grasp and sends him off with gubernatorial and other godspeeds to do duty as a destroyer  i made one of the crowd at the last mechanics fair and with the rest stood gazing in wonder at a perfect machine with its soul of fire its boilerheart that sent the hot blood pulsing along the iron arteries and its thews of steel and while i was admiring the adaptation of means to end the harmonious involutions of contrivance and the neverbewildered complexity i saw a grimed and greasy fellow the imperious engines lackey and drudge whose sole office was to let fall at intervals a drop or two of oil upon a certain joint then my soul said within me see there a piece of mechanism to which that other you marvel at is but as the rude first effort of a childa force which not merely suffices to set a few wheels in motion but which can send an impulse all through the infinite futurea contrivance not for turning out pins or stitching buttonholes but for making hamlets and lears and yet this thing of iron shall be housed waited on guarded from rust and dust and it shall be a crime but so much as to scratch it with a pin while the other with its fire of god in it shall be buffeted hither and thither and finally sent carefully a thousand miles to be the target

tribulation quid non mortalia pectora cogis auri sacra fames the speculation has sometimes crossed my mind in that dreary interval of drought which intervenes between quarterly stipendiary showers that providence by the creation of a moneytree might have simplified wonderfully the sometimes perplexing problem of human life we read of breadtrees the butter for which lies readychurned in irish bogs milktrees we are assured of in south america and stout sir john hawkins testifies to watertrees in the canaries boottrees bear abundantly in lynn and elsewhere and i have seen in the entries of the wealthy hattrees with a fair show of fruit a familytree i once cultivated myself and found therefrom but a scanty yield and that quite tasteless and innutritious of trees bearing men we are not without examples as those in the park of louis the eleventh of france who has forgotten moreover that olivetree growing in the athenians backgarden with its strange uxorious crop for the general propagation of which as of a new and precious variety the philosopher diogenes hitherto uninterested in arboriculture was so zealous in the sylva of our own southern states the females of my family have called my attention to the chinatree not to multiply examples i will barely add to my list the birchtree in the smaller branches of which has been implanted so miraculous a virtue for communicating the latin and greek languages and which may well therefore be classed among the trees producing necessaries of lifevenerabile donum fatalis virgæ that moneytrees existed in the golden age there want not prevalent reasons for our believing for does not the old proverb when it asserts that money does not grow on every bush imply a fortiori that there were certain bushes which did produce it again there is another ancient saw to the effect that money is the root of all evil from which two adages it may be safe to infer that the aforesaid species of tree first degenerated into a shrub then absconded underground and finally in our iron age vanished altogether in favorable exposures it may be conjectured that a specimen or two survived to a great age as in the garden of the hesperides and indeed what else could that tree in the sixth Æneid have been with a branch whereof the trojan hero procured admission to a territory for the entering of which money is a surer passport than to a certain other more profitable and too foreign kingdom whether these speculations of mine have any force in them or whether they will not rather by most readers be deemed impertinent to the matter in hand is a question which i leave to the determination of an indulgent posterity that there were in more primitive and happier times shops where money was soldand that too on credit and at a bargaini take to be matter of demonstration for what but a dealer in this article was that Æolus who supplied ulysses with motivepower for his fleet in bags what that ericus king of sweden who is said to have kept the winds in his cap what in more recent times those lapland nornas who traded in favorable breezes all which will appear the more clearly when we consider that even to this day raising the wind is proverbial for raising money and that brokers and banks were invented by the venetians at a later period  and now for the improvement of this digression i find a parallel to mr sawins fortune in an adventure of my own for shortly after i had first broached to myself the beforestated naturalhistorical and archæological theories as i was passing haec negotia penitus mecum revolvens through one of the obscure suburbs of our new england metropolis my eye was attracted by these words upon a signboardcheap cashstore here was at once the confirmation of my speculations and the substance of my hopes here lingered the fragment of a happier past or stretched out the first tremulous organic filament of a more fortunate future thus glowed the distant mexico to the eyes of sawin as he looked through the dirty pane of the recruitingoffice window or speculated from the summit of that miragepisgah which the imps of the bottle are so cunning to raise up already had my alnascharfancy even during that first halfbelieving glance expended in various useful directions the funds to be obtained by pledging the manuscript of a proposed volume of discourses already did a clock ornament the tower of the jaalam meetinghouse a gift appropriately but modestly commemorated in the parish and town records both for now many years kept by myself already had my son seneca completed his course at the university whether for the moment we may not be considered as actually lording it over those baratarias with the viceroyalty of which hope invests us and whether we are ever so warmly housed as in our spanish castles would afford matter of argument enough that i found that signboard to be no other than a bait to the trap of a decayed grocer nevertheless i bought a pound of dates getting short weight by reason of immense flights of harpy flies who pursued and lighted upon their prey even in the very scales which purchase i made not only with an eye to the little ones at home but also as a figurative reproof of that too frequent habit of my mind which forgetting the due order of chronology will often persuade me that the happy sceptre of saturn is stretched over this astræaforsaken nineteenth century  having glanced at the ledger of glory under the title sawin b let us extend our investigations and discover if that instructive volume does not contain some charges more personally interesting to ourselves i think we should be more economical of our resources did we thoroughly appreciate the fact that whenever brother jonathan seems to be thrusting his hand into his own pocket he is in fact picking ours i confess that the late muck which the country has been running has materially changed my views as to the best method of raising revenue if by means of direct taxation the bills for every extraordinary outlay were brought under our immediate eye so that like thrifty housekeepers we could see where and how fast the money was going we should be less likely to commit extravagances at present these things are managed in such a huggermugger way that we know not what we pay for the poor man is charged as much as the rich and while we are saving and scrimping at the spigot the government is drawing off at the bung if we could know that a part of the money we expend for tea and coffee goes to buy powder and balls and that it is mexican blood which makes the clothes on our backs more costly it would set some of us athinking during the present fall i have often pictured to myself a government official entering my study and handing me

high charge sir but in these days slaughtering is slaughtering verily i would that every one understood that it was for it goes about obtaining money under the false pretence of being glory for me i have an imagination which plays me uncomfortable tricks it happens to me sometimes to see a slaughterer on his way home from his days work and forthwith my imagination puts a cockedhat upon his head and epaulettes upon his shoulders and sets him up as a candidate for the presidency so also on a recent public occasion as the place assigned to the reverend clergy is just behind that of officers of the army and navy in processions it was my fortune to be seated at the dinnertable over against one of these respectable persons he was arrayed as out of his own profession only kings courtofficers and footmen are in europe and indians in america now what does my overofficious imagination but set to work upon him strip him of his gay livery and present him to me coatless his trousers thrust into the tops of a pair of boots thick with clotted blood and a basket on his arm out of which lolled a goresmeared axe thereby destroying my relish for the temporal mercies upon the board before me hw    no ix  a third letter from b sawin esq   upon the following letter slender comment will be needful in what river selemnus has mr sawin bathed that he has become so swiftly oblivious of his former loves from an ardent and as befits a soldier confident wooer of that coy bride the popular favor we see him subside of a sudden into the i trust not jilted cincinnatus returning to his plough with a goodly sized branch of willow in his hand figuratively returning however to a figurative plough and from no profound affection for that honored implement of husbandry for which indeed mr sawin never displayed any decided predilection but in order to be gracefully summoned therefrom to more congenial labors it should seem that the character of the ancient dictator had become part of the recognized stock of our modern political comedy though as our term of office extends to a quadrennial length the parallel is not so minutely exact as could be desired it is sufficiently so however for purposes of scenic representation an humble cottage if built of logs the better forms the arcadian background of the stage this rustic paradise is labelled ashland jaalam north bend marshfield kinderhook or bâton rouge as occasion demands before the door stands a something with one handle the other painted in proper perspective which represents in happy ideal vagueness the plough to this the defeated candidate rushes with delirious joy welcomed as a father by appropriate groups of happy laborers or from it the successful one is torn with difficulty sustained alone by a noble sense of public duty only i have observed that if the scene be laid at bâton rouge or ashland the laborers are kept carefully in the backgrouud and are heard to shout from behind the scenes in a singular tone resembling ululation and accompanied by a sound not unlike vigorous clapping this however may be artistically in keeping with the habits of the rustic population of those localities the precise connection between agricultural pursuits and statesmanship i have not been able after diligent inquiry to discover but that my investigations may not be barren of all fruit i will mention one curious statistical fact which i consider thoroughly established namely that no real farmer ever attains practically beyond a seat in the general court however theoretically qualified for more exalted station  it is probable that some other prospect has been opened to mr sawin and that he has not made this great sacrifice without some definite understanding in regard to a seat in the cabinet or a foreign mission it may be supposed that we of jaalam were not untouched by a feeling of villatic pride in beholding our townsman occupying so large a space in the public eye and to me deeply revolving the qualifications necessary to a candidate in these frugal times those of mr s seemed peculiarly adapted to a successful campaign the loss of a leg an arm an eye and four fingers reduced him so nearly to the condition of a vox et præterea nihil that i could think of nothing but the loss of his head by which his chance could have been bettered but since he has chosen to balk our suffrages we must

patient reader we take leave of each other i trust with some mutual satisfaction i say patient for i love not that kind which skims dippingly over the surface of the page as swallows over a pool before rain by such no pearls shall be gathered but if no pearls there be as indeed the world is not without example of books wherefrom the longestwinded diver shall bring up no more than his proper handful of mud yet let us hope that an oyster or two may reward adequate perseverance if neither pearls nor oysters yet is patience itself a gem worth diving deeply for  it may seem to some that too much space has been usurped by my own private lucubrations and some may be fain to bring against me that old jest of him who preached all his hearers out of the meetinghouse save only the sexton who remaining for yet a little space from a sense of official duty at last gave out also and presenting the keys humbly requested our preacher to lock the doors when he should have wholly relieved himself of his testimony i confess to a satisfaction in the self act of preaching nor do i esteem a discourse to be wholly thrown away even upon a sleeping or unintelligent auditory i cannot easily believe that the gospel of saint john which jacques cartier ordered to be read in the latin tongue to the canadian savages upon his first meeting with them fell altogether upon stony ground for the earnestness of the preacher is a sermon appreciable by dullest intellects and most alien ears in this wise did episcopius convert many to his opinions who yet understood not the language in which he discoursed the chief thing is that the messenger believe that he has an authentic message to deliver for counterfeit messengers that mode of treatment which father john de plano carpini relates to have prevailed among the tartars would seem effectual and perhaps deserved enough for my own part i may lay claim to so much of the spirit of martyrdom as would have led me to go into banishment with those clergymen whom alphonso the sixth of portugal drave out of his kingdom for refusing to shorten their pulpit eloquence it is possible that i having been invited into my brother biglows desk i may have been too little scrupulous in using it for the venting of my own peculiar doctrines to a congregation drawn together in the expectation and with the desire of hearing him  i am not wholly unconscious of a peculiarity of mental organization which impels me like the railroadengine with its train of cars to run backward for a short distance in order to obtain a fairer start i may compare myself to one fishing from the rocks when the sea runs high who misinterpreting the suction of the undertow for the biting of some larger fish jerks suddenly and finds that he has caught bottom hauling in upon the end of his line a trail of various algæ among which nevertheless the naturalist may haply find somewhat to repay the disappointment of the angler yet have i conscientiously endeavored to adapt myself to the impatient temper of the age daily degenerating more and more from the high standard of our pristine new england to the catalogue of lost arts i would mournfully add also that of listening to twohour sermons surely we have been abridged into a race of pygmies for truly in those of the old discourses yet subsisting to us in print the endless spinal column of divisions and subdivisions can be likened to nothing so exactly as to the vertebræ of the saurians whence the theorist may conjecture a race of anakim proportionate to the withstanding of these other monsters i say anakim rather than nephelim because there seem reasons for supposing that the race of those whose heads though no giants are constantly enveloped in clouds which that name imports will never become extinct the attempt to vanquish the innumerable heads of one of those aforementioned discourses may supply us with a plausible interpretation of the second labor of hercules and his successful experiment with fire affords us a useful precedent  but while i lament the degeneracy of the age in this regard i cannot refuse to succumb to its influence looking out through my studywindow i see mr biglow at a distance busy in gathering his baldwins of which to judge by the number of barrels lying about under the trees his crop is more abundant than my ownby which sight i am admonished to turn to those orchards of the mind wherein my labors may be more prospered and apply myself diligently to the preparation of my next sabbaths discoursehw   meliboeushipponax

dans le journal du matinhenri beyle  when the book appeared it bore a dedication to er hoar and was introduced by an essay of the yankee form of english speech this introduction is so distinctly an essay that it has been thought best to print it as an appendix to this volume rather than allow it to break in upon the pages of verse there is however one passage in it which may be repeated here since it bears directly upon the poem which serves as a sort of prelude to the series   the only attempt i had ever made at anything like a pastoral if that may be called an attempt which was the result almost of pure accident was in the courtin while the introduction to the first series was going through the press i received word from the printer that there was a blank page left which must be filled i sat down at once and improvised another fictitious notice of the press in which because verse would fill up space more cheaply than prose i inserted an extract from a supposed ballad of mr biglow i kept no copy of it and the printer as directed cut it off when the gap was filled presently i began to receive letters asking for the rest of it sometimes for the balance of it i had none but to answer such demands i patched a conclusion upon it in a later edition those who had only the first continued to importune me afterward being asked to write it out as an autograph for the baltimore sanitary commission fair i added other verses into some of which i infused a little more sentiment in a homely way and after a fashion completed it by sketching in the characters and making a connected story most likely i have spoiled it but i shall put it at the end of this introduction to answer once for all those kindly importunings    the courtin  god makes sech nights all white an

papers  second series  no i  birdofredum sawin esq to mr hosea biglow  letter from the reverend homer wilbur ma enclosing the epistle aforesaid  jaalam 15th nov 1861                                       it is not from any idle wish to obtrude my humble person with undue prominence upon the publick view that i resume my pen upon the present occasion juniores ad labores but having been a main instrument in rescuing the talent of my young parishioner from being buried in the ground by giving it such warrant with the world as could be derived from a name already widely known by several printed discourses all of which i may be permitted without immodesty to state have been deemed worthy of preservation in the library of harvard college by my esteemed friend mr sibley it seemed becoming that i should not only testify to the genuineness of the following production but call attention to it the more as mr biglow had so long been silent as to be in danger of absolute oblivion i insinuate no claim to any share in the authorship vix ea nostra voco of the works already published by mr biglow but merely take to myself the credit of having fulfilled toward them the office of taster experto crede who having first tried could afterward bear witness credenzen it was aptly named by the germans an office always arduous and sometimes even dangerous as in the case of those devoted persons who venture their lives in the deglutition of patent medicines dolus latet in generalibus there is deceit in the most of them and thereafter are wonderfully preserved long enough to append their signatures to testimonials in the diurnal and hebdomadal prints i say not this as covertly glancing at the authors of certain manuscripts which have been submitted to my literary judgment though an epick in twentyfour books on the taking of jericho might save for the prudent forethought of mrs wilbur in secreting the same just as i had arrived beneath the walls and was beginning a catalogue of the various horns and their blowers too ambitiously emulous in longanimity of homers list of ships might i say have rendered frustrate any hope i could entertain vacare musis for the small remainder of my days but only the further to secure myself against any imputation of unseemly forthputting i will barely subjoin in this connexion that whereas job was left to desire in the soreness of his heart that his adversary had written a book as perchance misanthropically wishing to indite a review thereof yet was not satan allowed so far to tempt him as to send bildad eliphaz and zophar each with an unprinted work in his wallet to be submitted to his censure but of this enough were i in need of other excuse i might add that i write by the express desire of mr biglow himself whose entire winter leisure is occupied as he assures me in answering demands for autographs a labor exacting enough in itself and egregiously so to him who being no ready penman cannot sign so much as his name without strange contortions of the face his nose even being essential to complete success and painfully suppressed saintvitusdance of every muscle in his body this with his having been put in the commission of the peace by our excellent governor o si sic omnes immediately on his accession to office keeps him continually employed haud inexpertus loquor having for many years written myself jp and being not seldom applied to for specimens of my chirography a request to which i have sometimes over weakly assented believing as i do that nothing written of set purpose can properly be called an autograph but only those unpremeditated sallies and lively runnings which betray the fireside man instead of the hunted notoriety doubling on his pursuers but it is time that i should bethink me of st austins prayer libera me a meipso if i would arrive at the matter in hand  moreover i had yet another reason for taking up the pen myself i am informed that the atlantic monthly is mainly indebted for its success to the contributions and editorial supervision of dr holmes whose excellent annals of america occupy an honored place upon my shelves the journal itself i have never seen but if this be so it might seem that the recommendation of a brotherclergyman though par magis quam similis should carry a greater weight i suppose that you have a department for historical lucubrations and should be glad if deemed desirable to forward for publication my collections for the antiquities of jaalam and my now happily complete pedigree of the wilbur family from its fons et origo the wild boar of ardennes withdrawn from the active duties of my profession by the settlement of a colleaguepastor the reverend jeduthun hitchcock formerly of brutus fourcorners i might find time for further contributions to general literature on similar topicks i have made large advances towards a completer genealogy of mrs wilburs family the pilcoxes not if i know myself from any idle vanity but with the sole desire of rendering myself useful in my day and generation nulla dies sine lineâ i inclose a meteorological register a list of the births deaths and marriages and a few memorabilia of longevity in jaalam east parish for the last halfcentury though spared to the unusual period of more than eighty years i find no diminution of my faculties or abatement of my natural vigor except a scarcely sensible decay of memory and a necessity of recurring to younger eyesight or spectacles for the finer print in cruden it would gratify me to make some further provision for declining years from the emoluments of my literary labors i had intended to effect an insurance on my life but was deterred therefrom by a circular from one of the offices in which the sudden death of so large a proportion of the insured was set forth as an inducement that it seemed to me little less than a tempting of providence neque in summâ inopiâ levis esse senectus potest ne sapienti quidem  thus far concerning mr biglow and so much seemed needful brevis esse laboro by way of preliminary after a silence of fourteen years he greatly fears lest he may in this essay have fallen below himself well knowing that if exercise be dangerous on a full stomach no less so is writing on a full reputation beset as he has been on all sides he could not refrain and would only imprecate patience till he shall again have got the hang as he calls it of an accomplishment long disused the letter of mr sawin was received some time in last june and others have followed which will in due season be submitted to the publick how largely his statements are to be depended on i more than merely dubitate he was always distinguished for a tendency to exaggerationit might almost be qualified by a stronger term fortiter mentire aliquid hæret seemed to be his favorite rule of rhetoric that he is actually where he says he is the postmark would seem to confirm that he was received with the publick demonstrations he describes would appear consonant with what we know of the habits of those regions but further than this i venture not to decide i have sometimes suspected a vein of humor in him which leads him to speak by contraries but since in the unrestrained intercourse of private life i have never observed in him any striking powers of invention i am the more willing to put a certain qualified faith in the incidents and the details of life and manners which give to his narratives some portion of the interest and entertainment which characterizes a century sermon  it may be expected of me that i should say something to justify myself with the world for a seeming inconsistency with my wellknown principles in allowing my youngest son to raise a company for the war a fact known to all through the medium of the publick prints i did reason with the young man but expellas naturam furcâ tamen usque recurrit having myself been a chaplain in 1812 i could the less wonder that a man of war had sprung from my loins it was indeed grievous to send my benjamin the child of my old age but after the discomfiture of manassas i with my own hands did buckle on his armor trusting in the great comforter and commander for strength according to my need for truly the memory of a brave son dead in his shroud were a greater staff of my declining years than a living coward if those may be said to have lived who carry all of themselves into the grave with them though his days might be long in the land and he should get much goods it is not till our earthen vessels are broken that we find and truly possess the treasure that was laid up in them migravi in animam meam i have sought refuge in my own soul nor would i be shamed by the heathen comedian with his neqwam illud verbum bene vult nisi bene facit during our dark days i read constantly in the inspired book of job which i believe to contain more food to maintain the fibre of the soul for right living and high thinking than all pagan literature together though i would by no means vilipend the study of the classicks there i read that job said in his despair even as the fool saith in his heart there is no godthe tabernacles of robbers prosper and they that provoke god are secure job xii 6 but i sought farther till i found this scripture also which i would have those perpend who have striven to turn our israel aside to the worship of strange godsif i did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant when they contended with me what then shall i do when god riseth up and when he visiteth what shall i answer him job xxxi 13 14 on this text i preached a discourse on the last day of fasting and humiliation with general acceptance though there were not wanting one or two laodiceans who said that i should have waited till the president announced his policy but let us hope and pray remembering this of saint gregory vult deus rogari vult cogi vult quâdam importunitate vinci  we had our first fall

  no ii  mason and slidell a yankee idyll  to the editors of the atlantic monthly  jaalam 6th jan 1862  gentlemeni was highly gratified by the insertion of a portion of my letter in the last number of your valuable and entertaining miscellany though in a type which rendered its substance inaccessible even to the beautiful new spectacles presented to me by a committee of the parish on new years day i trust that i was able to bear your very considerable abridgment of my lucubrations with a spirit becoming a christian my third granddaughter rebekah aged fourteen years and whom i have trained to read slowly and with proper emphasis a practice too much neglected in our modern systems of education read aloud to me the excellent essay upon old age the author of which i cannot help suspecting to be a young man who has never yet known what it was to have snow canities morosa upon his own roof dissolve frigus large super foco ligna reponens is a rule for the young whose woodpile is yet abundant for such cheerful lenitives a good life behind him is the best thing to keep an old mans shoulders from shivering at every breath of sorrow or illfortune but methinks it were easier for an old man to feel the disadvantages of youth than the advantages of age of these latter i reckon one of the chiefest to be this that we attach a less inordinate value to our own productions and distrusting daily more and more our own wisdom with the conceit whereof at twenty we wrap ourselves away from knowledge as with a garment do reconcile ourselves with the wisdom of god i could have wished indeed that room might have been made for the residue of the anecdote relating to deacon tinkham which would not only have gratified a natural curiosity on the part of the publick as i have reason to know from several letters of inquiry already received but would also as i think have largely increased the circulation of your magazine in this town nihil humani alienum there is a curiosity about the affairs of our neighbors which is not only pardonable but even commendable but i shall abide a more fitting season  as touching the following literary effort of esquire biglow much might be profitably said on the topick of idyllick and pastoral poetry and concerning the proper distinctions to be made between them from theocritus the inventor of the former to collins the latest authour i know of who has emulated the classicks in the latter style but in the time of a civil war worthy a milton to defend and a lucan to sing it may be reasonably doubted whether the publick never too studious of serious instruction might not consider other objects more deserving of present attention concerning the title of idyll which mr biglow has adopted at my suggestion it may not be improper to animadvert that the name properly signifies a poem somewhat rustick in phrase for though the learned are not agreed as to the particular dialect employed by theocritus they are universanimous both as to its rusticity and its capacity of rising now and then to the level of more elevated sentiments and expressions while it is also descriptive of real scenery and manners yet it must be admitted that the production now in question which here and there bears perhaps too plainly the marks of my correcting hand does partake of the nature of a pastoral inasmuch as the interlocutors therein are purely imaginary beings and the whole is little better than greek kapnou skias onar the plot was as i believe suggested by the twa brigs of robert burns a scottish poet of the last century as that found its prototype in the mutual complaint of plainstanes and causey by fergusson though the metre of this latter be different by a foot in each verse perhaps the two dogs of cervantes gave the first hint i reminded my talented young parishioner and friend that concord bridge had long since yielded to the edacious tooth of time but he answered me to this effect that there was no greater mistake of an authour than to suppose the reader had no fancy of his own that if once that faculty was to be called into activity it were better to be in for the whole sheep than the shoulder and that he knew concord like a bookan expression questionable in propriety since there are few things with which he is not more familiar than with the printed page in proof of what he affirmed he showed me some verses which with others he had stricken out as too much delaying the action but which i communicate in this place because they rightly define punkinseed which mr bartlett would have a kind of percha creature to which i have found a rod or pole not to be so easily equivalent in our inland waters as in the books of arithmetic and because it conveys an eulogium on the worthy son of an excellent father with whose acquaintance eheu fugaces anni i was formerly honoured  but nowadays the bridge aint wut they show so much ez emson hawthorne an thoreau i know the village though was sent there once aschoolin cause to home i played the dunce an i ve ben sence a visitin the jedge whose garding whispers with the rivers edge where i ve sot mornins lazy as the bream whose ony business is to head upstream we call em punkinseed or else in chat along th the jedge who covers with his hat more wit an gumption an shrewd yankee sense than there is mosses on an ole stone fence  concerning the subjectmatter of the verses i have not the leisure at present to write so fully as i could wish my time being occupied with the preparation of a discourse for the forthcoming bicentenary celebration of the first settlement of jaalam east parish it may gratify the publick interest to mention the circumstance that my investigations to this end have enabled me to verify the fact of much historick importance and hitherto hotly debated that shearjashub tarbox was the first child of white parentage born in this town being named in his fathers will under date august 7th or 9th 1662 it is well known that those who advocate the claims of mehetable goings are unable to find any trace of her existence prior to october of that year as respects the settlement of the mason and slidell question mr biglow has not incorrectly stated the popular sentiment so far as i can judge by its expression in this locality for myself i feel more sorrow than resentment for i am old enough to have heard those talk of england who still even after the unhappy estrangement could not unschool their lips from calling her the mothercountry but england has insisted on ripping up old wounds and has undone the healing work of fifty years for nations do not reason they only feel and the spretæ injuria formæ rankles in their minds as bitterly as in that of a woman and because this is so i feel the more satisfaction that our government has acted as all governments should standing as they do between the people and their passions as if it had arrived at years of discretion there are three short and simple words the hardest of all to pronounce in any language and i suspect they were no easier before the confusion of tongues but which no man or nation that cannot utter can claim to have arrived at manhood those words are i was wrong and i am proud that while england played the boy our rulers had strength enough from the people below and wisdom enough from god above to quit themselves like men  the sore points on both sides have been skilfully exasperated by interested and unscrupulous persons who saw in a war between the two countries the only hope of profitable return for their investment in confederate stock whether political or financial the always supercilious often insulting and sometimes even brutal tone of british journals and publick men has certainly not tended to soothe whatever resentment might exist in america  perhaps it was right to dissemble your love but why did you kick me down stairs  we have no reason to complain that england as a necessary consequence of her clubs has become a great society for the minding of other peoples business and we can smile goodnaturedly when she lectures other nations on the sins of arrogance and conceit but we may justly consider it a breach of the political convenances which are expected to regulate the intercourse of one wellbred government with another when men holding places in the ministry allow themselves to dictate our domestic policy to instruct us in our duty and to stigmatize as unholy a war for the rescue of whatever a highminded people should hold most vital and most sacred was it in good taste that i may use the mildest term for earl russell to expound our own constitution to president lincoln or to make a new and fallacious application of an old phrase for our benefit and tell us that the rebels were fighting for independence and we for empire as if all wars for independence were by nature just and deserving of sympathy and all wars for empire ignoble and worthy only of reprobation or as if these easy phrases in any way characterized this terrible struggleterrible not so truly in any superficial sense as from the essential and deadly enmity of the principles that underlie it his lordships bit of borrowed rhetoric would justify smith obrien nana sahib and the maori chieftains while it would condemn nearly every war in which england has ever been engaged was it so very presumptuous in us to think that it would be decorous in english statesmen if they spared time enough to acquire some kind of knowledge though of the most elementary kind in regard to this country and the questions at issue here before they pronounced so offhand a judgment or is political information expected to come dogberryfashion in england like reading and writing by nature  and now all respectable england is wondering at our irritability and sees a quite satisfactory explanation of it in our national vanity suave mari magno it is pleasant sitting in the easychairs of downing street to sprinkle pepper on the raw wounds of a kindred people struggling for life and philosophical to find in selfconceit the cause of our instinctive resentment surely we were of all nations the least liable to any temptation of vanity at a time when the gravest anxiety and the keenest sorrow were never absent from our hearts nor is conceit the exclusive attribute of any one nation the earliest of english travellers sir john mandeville took a less provincial view of the matter when he said for fro what partie of the erthe that men duellen other aboven or beneathen it semethe alweys to hem that duellen that thei gon more righte than any other folke the english have always had their fair share of this amiable quality we may say of them still as the authour of the lettres cabalistiques said of them more than a century ago ces derniers disent naturellement quil ny a queux qui soient estimables and as he also saysjaimerois presque autant tomber entre les mains dun inquisiteur que dun anglois qui me fait sentir sans cesse combien il sestime plus que moi et qui ne daigne me parler que pour injurier ma nation et pour mennuyer du récit des grandes qualités de la sienne of this bull we may safely say with horace habet fænum in cornu what we felt to be especially insulting was the quiet assumption that the descendants of men who left the old world for the sake of principle and who had made the wilderness into a new world patterned after an idea could not possibly be susceptible of a generous or lofty sentiment could have no feeling of nationality deeper than that of a tradesman for his shop one would have thought in listening to england that we were presumptuous in fancying that we were a nation at all or had any other principle of union than that of booths at a fair where there is no higher notion of government than the constable or better image of god than that stamped upon the current coin  it is time for englishmen to consider whether there was nothing in the spirit of their press and of their leading public men calculated to rouse a just indignation and to cause a permanent estrangement on the part of any nation capable of selfrespect and sensitively jealous as ours then was of foreign interference was there nothing in the indecent haste with which belligerent rights were conceded to the rebels nothing in the abrupt tone assumed in the trent case nothing in the fitting out of confederate privateers that might stir the blood of a people already overcharged with doubt suspicion and terrible responsibility the laity in any country do not stop to consider points of law but they have an instinctive perception of the animus that actuates the policy of a foreign nation and in our own case they remembered that the british authorities in canada did not wait till diplomacy could send home to england for her slow official tinderbox to fire the caroline add to this what every sensible american knew that the moral support of england was equal to an army of two hundred thousand men to the rebels while it insured us another year or two of exhausting war it was not so much the spite of her words though the time might have been more tastefully chosen as the actual power for evil in them that we felt as a deadly wrong perhaps the most immediate and efficient cause of mere irritation was the sudden and unaccountable change of manner on the other side of the water only six months before the prince of wales had come over to call us cousins and everywhere it was nothing but our american brethren that great offshoot of british institutions in the new world so almost identical with them in laws language and literaturethis last of the alliterative compliments being so bitterly true that perhaps it will not be retracted even now to this outburst of longrepressed affection we responded with genuine warmth if with something of the awkwardness of a poor relation bewildered with the sudden tightening of the ties of consanguinity when it is rumored that he has come into a large estate then came the rebellion and presto a flaw in our titles was discovered the plate we were promised at the family table is flung at our head and we were again the scum of creation intolerably vulgar at once cowardly and overbearingno relations of theirs after all but a dreggy hybrid of the basest bloods of europe panurge was not quicker to call friar john his former friend i cannot help thinking of walter mapess jingling paraphrase of petronius  dummodo sim splendidis vestibus ornatus et multa familia sim circumvallatus prudens sum et sapiens et morigeratus et tuus nepos sum et tu meus cognatus  which i may freely render thus  so long as i was prosperous id dinners by the dozen was wellbred witty virtuous and everybodys cousin if luck should turn as well she may her fancy is so flexile will virtue cousinship and all return with her from exile  there was nothing in all this to exasperate a philosopher much to make him smile rather but the earths surface is not chiefly inhabited by philosophers and i revive the recollection of it now in perfect goodhumour merely by way of suggesting to our cidevant british cousins that it would have been easier for them to hold their tongues than for us to keep our tempers under the circumstances  the english cabinet made a blunder unquestionably in taking it so hastily for granted that the united states had fallen forever from their position as a firstrate power and it was natural that they should vent a little of their vexation on the people whose inexplicable obstinacy in maintaining freedom and order and in resisting degradation was likely to convict them of their mistake but if bearing a grudge be the sure mark of a small mind in the individual can it be a proof of high spirit in a nation if the result of the present estrangement between the two countries shall be to make us more independent of british twaddle indomito nec dira ferens stipendia tauro so much the better but if it is to make us insensible to the value of british opinion in matters where it gives us the judgment of an impartial and cultivated outsider if we are to shut ourselves out from the advantages of english culture the loss will be ours and not theirs because the door of the old homestead has been once slammed in our faces shall we in a huff reject all future advances of conciliation and cut ourselves foolishly off from any share in the humanizing influences of the place with its ineffable riches of association its heirlooms of immemorial culture its historic monuments ours no less than theirs its noble gallery of ancestral portraits we have only to succeed and england will not only respect but for the first time begin to understand us and let us not in our justifiable indignation at wanton insult forget that england is not the england only of snobs who dread the democracy they do not comprehend but the england of history of heroes statesmen and poets whose names are dear and their influence as salutary to us as to her  let us strengthen the hands of those in authority over us and curb our own tongues remembering that general wait commonly proves in the end more than a match for general headlong and that the good book ascribes safety to a multitude indeed but not to a mob of counsellours let us remember and perpend the words of paulus emilius to the people of rome that if they judged they could manage the war to more advantage by any other he would willingly yield up his charge but if they confided in him they were not to make themselves his colleagues in his office or raise reports or criticise his actions but without talking supply him with means and assistance necessary to the carrying on of the war for if they proposed to command their own commander they would render this expedition more ridiculous than the former vide plutarchum in vitâ pe let us also not forget what the same excellent authour says concerning perseuss fear of spending money and not permit the covetousness of brother jonathan to be the good fortune of jefferson davis for my own part till i am ready to admit the commanderinchief to my pulpit i shall abstain from planning his battles if courage be the sword yet is patience the armour of a nation and in our desire for peace let us never be willing to surrender the constitution bequeathed us by fathers at least as wise as ourselves even with jefferson davis to help us and with those degenerate romans tuta et præsentia quam vetera et periculosa malle  and not only should we bridle our own tongues but the pens of others which are swift to convey useful intelligence to the enemy this is no new inconvenience for under date 3d june 1745 general pepperell wrote thus to governor shirley from louisbourg what your excellency observes of the armys being made acquainted with any plans proposed until ready to be put in execution has always been disagreeable to me and i have given many cautions relating to it but when your excellency considers that our council of war consists of more than twenty members i am persuaded you will think it impossible for me to hinder it if any of them will persist in communicating to inferior officers and soldiers what ought to be kept secret i am informed that the boston newspapers are filled with paragraphs from private letters relating to the expedition will your excellency permit me to say i think it may be of ill consequence would it not be convenient if your excellency should forbid the printers inserting such news verily if tempora mutantur we may question the et nos

am  to the editors of the atlantic monthly  jaalam 7th feb 1862  respected friendsif i know myselfand surely a man can hardly be supposed to have overpassed the limit of fourscore years without attaining to some proficiency in that most useful branch of learning e coelo descendit says the pagan poeti have no great smack of that weakness which would press upon the publick attention any matter pertaining to my private affairs but since the following letter of mr sawin contains not only a direct allusion to myself but that in connection with a topick of interest to all those engaged in the publick ministrations of the sanctuary i may be pardoned for touching briefly thereupon mr sawin was never a stated attendant upon my preachingnever as i believe even an occasional one since the erection of the new house where we now worship in 1845 he did indeed for a time supply a not unacceptable bass in the choir but whether on some umbrage omnibus hoc vitium est cantoribus taken against the bassviol then and till his decease in 1850 æt 77 under the charge of mr asaph perley or as was reported by others on account of an imminent subscription for a new bell he thenceforth absented himself from all outward and visible communion yet he seems to have preserved altâ mente repostum as it were in the pickle of a mind soured by prejudice a lasting scunner as he would call it against our staid and decent form of worship for i would rather in that wise interpret his fling than suppose that any chance tares sown by my pulpit discourses should survive so long while good seed too often fails to root itself i humbly trust that i have no personal feeling in the matter though i know that if we sound any man deep enough our lead shall bring up the mud of human nature at last the bretons believe in an evil spirit which they call ar chouskezik whose office it is to make the congregation drowsy and though i have never had reason to think that he was specially busy among my flock yet have i seen enough to make me sometimes regret the hinged seats of the ancient meetinghouse whose lively clatter not unwillingly intensified by boys beyond eyeshot of the tithingman served at intervals as a wholesome réveil it is true i have numbered among my parishioners some who are proof against the prophylactick fennel nay whose gift of somnolence rivalled that of the cretan rip van winkle epimenides and who nevertheless complained not so much of the substance as of the length of my by them unheard discourses some ingenious persons of a philosophick turn have assured us that our pulpits were set too high and that the soporifick tendency increased with the ratio of the angle in which the hearers eye was constrained to seek the preacher this were a curious topick for investigation there can be no doubt that some sermons are pitched too high and i remember many struggles with the drowsy fiend in my youth happy saint anthony of padua whose finny acolytes however they might profit could never murmur quare fremuerunt gentes who is he that can twice a week be inspired or has eloquence ut ita dicam always on tap a good man and next to david a sacred poet himself haply not inexpert of evil in this particular has said  the worst speak something good if all want sense god takes a text and preacheth patience  there are one or two other points in mr sawins letter which i would also briefly animadvert upon and first concerning the claim he sets up to a certain superiority of blood and lineage in the people of our southern states now unhappily in rebellion against lawful authority and their own better interests there is a sort of opinions anachronisms at once and anachorisms foreign both to the age and the country that maintain a feeble and buzzing existence scarce to be called life like winter flies which in mild weather crawl out from obscure nooks and crannies to expatiate in the sun and sometimes acquire vigor enough to disturb with their enforced familiarity the studious hours of the scholar one of the most stupid and pertinacious of these is the theory that the southern states were settled by a class of emigrants from the old world socially superior to those who founded the institutions of new england the virginians especially lay claim to this generosity of lineage which were of no possible account were it not for the fact that such superstitions are sometimes not without their effect on the course of human affairs the early adventurers to massachusetts at least paid their passages no felons were ever shipped thither and though it be true that many deboshed younger brothers of what are called good families may have sought refuge in virginia it is equally certain that a great part of the early deportations thither were the sweepings of the london streets and the leavings of the london stews it was this my lord bacon had in mind when he wrote it is a shameful and unblessed thing to take the scum of people and wicked condemned men to be the people with whom you plant that certain names are found there is nothing to the purpose for even had an alias been beyond the invention of the knaves of that generation it is known that servants were often called by their masters names as slaves are now on what the heralds call the spindle side some at least of the oldest virginian families are descended from matrons who were exported and sold for so many hogsheads of tobacco the head so notorious was this that it became one of the jokes of contemporary playwrights not only that men bankrupt in purse and character were food for the plantations and this before the settlement of new england but also that any drab would suffice to wive such pitiful adventurers never choose a wife as if you were going to virginia says middleton in one of his comedies the mule is apt to forget all but the equine side of his pedigree how early the counterfeit nobility of the old dominion became a topick of ridicule in the mother country may be learned from a play of mrs behns founded on the rebellion of bacon for even these kennels of literature may yield a fact or two to pay the raking mrs flirt the keeper of a virginia ordinary calls herself the daughter of a baronet undone in the late rebellionher father having in truth been a tailorand three of the council assuming to themselves an equal splendor of origin are shown to have been one a broken exciseman who came over a poor servant another a tinker transported for theft and the third a common pickpocket often flogged at the carts tail the ancestry of south carolina will as little pass muster at the heralds visitation though i hold them to have been more reputable inasmuch as many of them were honest tradesmen and artisans in some measure exiles for conscience sake who would have smiled at the highflying nonsense of their descendants some of the more respectable were jews the absurdity of supposing a population of eight millions all sprung from gentle loins in the course of a century and a half is too manifest for confutation but of what use to discuss the matter an expert genealogist will provide any solvent man with a genus et pro avos to order my lord burleigh used to say with aristotle and the emperor frederick ii to back him that nobility was ancient riches whence also the spanish were wont to call their nobles ricos hombres and the aristocracy of america are the descendants of those who first became wealthy by whatever means petroleum will in this wise be the source of much good blood among our posterity the aristocracy of the south such as it is has the shallowest of all foundations for it is only skindeepthe most odious of all for while affecting to despise trade it traces its origin to a successful traffick in men women and children and still draws its chief revenues thence and though as doctor chamberlayne consolingly says in his present state of england to become a merchant of foreign commerce without serving any apprentisage hath been allowed no disparagement to a gentleman born especially to a younger brother yet i conceive that he would hardly have made a like exception in favour of the particular trade in question oddly enough this trade reverses the ordinary standards of social respectability no less than of morals for the retail and domestick is as creditable as the wholesale and foreign is degrading to him who follows it are our morals then no better than mores after all i do not believe that such aristocracy as exists at the south for i hold with marius fortissimum quemque generosissimum will be found an element of anything like persistent strength in warthinking the saying of lord bacon whom one quaintly called inductionis dominus et verulamii as true as it is pithy that the more gentlemen ever the lower books of subsidies it is odd enough as an historical precedent that while the fathers of new england were laying deep in religion education and freedom the basis of a polity which has substantially outlasted any then existing the first work of the founders of virginia as may be seen in wingfields memorial was conspiracy and rebellionodder yet as showing the changes which are wrought by circumstance that the first insurrection in south carolina was against the aristocratical scheme of the proprietary government i do not find that the cuticular aristocracy of the south has added anything to the refinements of civilization except the carrying of bowieknives and the chewing of tobaccoa hightoned southern gentleman being commonly not only quadrumanous but quidruminant  i confess that the present letter of mr sawin increases my doubts as to the sincerity of the convictions which he professes and i am inclined to think that the triumph of the legitimate government sure sooner or later to take place will find him and a large majority of his newly adopted fellowcitizens who hold with dædalus the primal sitteronthefence that medium tenere tutissimum original union men the criticisms towards the close of his letter on certain of our failings are worthy to be seriously perpended for he is not as i think without a spice of vulgar shrewdness fas est et ab hoste doceri there is no reckoning without your host as to the goodnature in us which he seems to gird at while i would not consecrate a chapel as they have not scrupled to do in france to notre dame de la haine our lady of hate yet i cannot forget that the corruption of goodnature is the generation of laxity of principle goodnature is our national characteristick and though it be perhaps nothing more than a culpable weakness or cowardice when it leads us to put up tamely with manifold impositions and breaches of implied contracts as too frequently in our publick conveyances it becomes a positive crime when it leads us to look unresentfully on peculation and to regard treason to the best government that ever existed as something with which a gentleman may shake hands without soiling his fingers i do not think the gallowstree the most profitable member of our sylva but since it continues to be planted i would fain see a northern limb ingrafted on it that it may bear some other fruit than loyal tennesseeans  a relick has recently been discovered on the east bank of bushy brook in north jaalam which i conceive to be an inscription in runick characters relating to the early expedition of the northmen to this continent i shall make fuller investigations and communicate the result in due season    respectfully      your obedient servant        homer wilbur am  psi inclose a years

of jeff davis in secret session  conjecturally reported by h biglow  to the editors of the atlantic monthly  jaalam 10th march 1862  gentlemenmy leisure has been so entirely occupied with the hitherto fruitless endeavour to decypher the runick inscription whose fortunate discovery i mentioned in my last communication that i have not found time to discuss as i had intended the great problem of what we are to do with slaverya topick on which the publick mind in this place is at present more than ever agitated what my wishes and hopes are i need not say but for safe conclusions i do not conceive that we are yet in possession of facts enough on which to bottom them with certainty acknowledging the hand of providence as i do in all events i am sometimes inclined to think that they are wiser than we and am willing to wait till we have made this continent once more a place where freemen can live in security and honour before assuming any further responsibility this is the view taken by my neighbour habakkuk sloansure esq the president of our bank whose opinion in the practical affairs of life has great weight with me as i have generally found it to be justified by the event and whose counsel had i followed it would have saved me from an unfortunate investment of a considerable part of the painful economies of half a century in the northwestpassage tunnel after a somewhat animated discussion with this gentleman a few days since i expanded on the audi alteram partem principle something which he happened to say by way of illustration into the following fable   festina lente  once on a time there was a pool fringed all about with flagleaves cool and spotted with cowlilies garish of frogs and pouts the ancient parish alders the creaking redwings sink on tussocks that house

skill as wateringplaces sometimes will  now in this abbey of theleme which realized the fairest dream that ever dozing bullfrog had sunned on a halfsunk lilypad there rose a party with a mission to mend the polliwogs condition who notified the selectmen to call a meeting there and then some kind of steps they said are needed they dont come on so fast as we did lets dock their tails if that dont make em frogs by brevet the old one take em that boy that came the other day to dig some flagroot down this way his jackknife left and tis a sign that heaven approves of our design twere wicked not to

of croaking and entreating the vote was carried in marshmeeting  lord knows protest the polliwogs were anxious to be grownup frogs but dont push in to do the work of nature till she prove a shirk tis not by jumps that she advances but wins her way by circumstances pray wait awhile until you know were so contrived as not to grow let nature take her own direction and shell absorb our imperfection you mightnt like em to appear with but we must have the things to steer with  no piped the party of reform all great results are taen by storm fate holds her best gifts till we show weve strength to make her let them go the providence that works in history and seems to some folks such a mystery does not creep slowly on incog but moves by jumps a mighty frog no more reject the ages chrism your queues are an anachronism no more the futures promise mock but lay your tails upon the block thankful that we the means have voted to have you thus to frogs promoted  the thing was done the tails were

smother with heads and tails that missed each other here snoutless tails there tailless snouts the only gainers were the pouts   moral  from lower to the higher next not to the top is natures text and embryo good to reach full stature absorbs the evil in its nature   i think that nothing will ever give permanent peace and security to this continent but the extirpation of slavery therefrom and that

wood to an unequal conflict with iron it is not enough merely to have the right on our side if we stick to the old flintlock of tradition i have observed in my parochial experience haud ignarus mali that the devil is prompt to adopt the latest inventions of destructive warfare and may thus take even such a threedecker as bishop butler at an advantage it is curious that as gunpowder made armour useless on shore so armour is having its revenge by baffling its old enemy at sea and that while gunpowder robbed land warfare of nearly all its picturesqueness to give even greater stateliness and

that the ultimate if not speedy success of the national arms is now sufficiently ascertained sure as i am of the righteousness of our cause and its consequent claim on the blessing of god for i would not show a faith inferior to that of the pagan historian with his facile evenit quod dis cordi est it seems to me a suitable occasion to withdraw our minds a moment from the confusing din of battle to objects of peaceful and permanent interest let us not neglect the monuments of preterite history because what shall be history is so diligently making under our eyes cras ingens iterabimus æquor tomorrow will be time enough for that stormy sea today let me engage the attention of your readers with the runick inscription to whose fortunate discovery i have heretofore alluded well may we say with the poet multa renascuntur quæ jam cecidere and i would premise that although i can no longer resist the evidence of my own senses from the stone before me to the antecolumbian discovery of this continent by the northmen gens inclytissima as they are called in a palermitan inscription written fortunately in a less debatable character than that which i am about to decipher yet i would by no means be understood as wishing to vilipend the merits of the great genoese whose name will never be forgotten so long as the inspiring strains of hail columbia shall continue to be heard though he must be stripped also of whatever praise may belong to the experiment of the egg which i find proverbially attributed by castilian authors to a certain juanito or jack perhaps an offshoot of our giantkilling mythus his name will still remain one of the most illustrious of modern times but the impartial historian owes a duty likewise to obscure merit and my solicitude to render a tardy justice is perhaps quickened by my having known those who had their own field of labour been less secluded might have found a readier acceptance with the reading publick i could give an example but i forbear forsitan nostris ex ossibus oritur ultor  touching runick inscriptions i find that they may lie classed under three general heads 1º those which are understood by the danish royal society of northern antiquaries and professor rafn their secretary 2º those which are comprehensible only by mr rafn and 3º those which neither the society mr rafn nor anybody else can be said in any definite sense to understand and which accordingly offer peculiar temptations to enucleating sagacity these last are naturally deemed the most valuable by intelligent antiquaries and to this class the stone now in my possession fortunately belongs such give a picturesque variety to ancient events because susceptible oftentimes of as many interpretations as there are individual archæologists and since facts are only the pulp in which the idea or eventseed is softly imbedded till it ripen it is of little consequence what colour or flavour we attribute to them provided it be agreeable availing myself of the obliging assistance of mr arphaxad bowers an ingenious photographick artist whose houseonwheels has now stood for three years on our meetinghouse green with the somewhat contradictory inscriptionour motto is onwardi have sent accurate copies of my treasure to many learned men and societies both native and european i may hereafter communicate their different and me judice equally erroneous solutions i solicit also messrs editors your own acceptance of the copy herewith enclosed i need only premise further that the stone itself is a goodly block of metamorphick sandstone and that the runes resemble very nearly the ornithichnites or fossil birdtracks of dr hitchcock but with less regularity or apparent design than is displayed by those remarkable geological monuments these are rather the non bene junctarum discordia semina rerum resolved to leave no door open to cavil i first of all attempted the elucidation of this remarkable example of lithick literature by the ordinary modes but with no adequate return for my labour i then considered myself amply justified in resorting to that heroick treatment the felicity of which as applied by the great bentley to milton had long ago enlisted my admiration indeed i had already made up my mind that in case good fortune should throw any such invaluable record in my way i would proceed with it in the following simple and satisfactory method alter a cursory examination merely sufficing for an approximative estimate of its length i would write down a hypothetical inscription based upon antecedent probabilities and then proceed to extract from the characters engraven on the stone a meaning as nearly as possible conformed to this a priori product of my own ingenuity the result more than justified my hopes inasmuch as the two inscriptions were made without any great violence to tally in all essential particulars i then proceeded not without some anxiety to my second test which was to read the runick letters diagonally and again with the same success with an excitement pardonable under the circumstances yet tempered with thankful humility i now applied my last and severest trial my experimentum crucis i turned the stone now doubly precious in my eyes with scrupulous exactness upside down the physical exertion so far displaced my spectacles as to derange for a moment the focus of vision i confess that it was with some tremulousness that i readjusted them upon my nose and prepared my mind to bear with calmness any disappointment that might ensue but o albo dies notanda lapillo what was my delight to find that the change of position had effected none in the sense of the writing even by so much as a single letter i was now and justly as i think satisfied of the conscientious exactness of my interpretation it is as follows              here      bjarna grimolfsson   first drank cloudbrother   through childoflandandwater  that is drew smoke through a reed stem in other words we have here a record of the first smoking of the herb nicotiana tabacum by an european on this continent the probable results of this discovery are so vast as to baffle conjecture if it be objected that the smoking of a pipe would hardly justify the setting up of a memorial stone i answer that even now the moquis indian ere he takes his first whiff bows reverently toward the four quarters of the sky in succession and that the loftiest monuments have been read to perpetuate fame which is the dream of the shadow of smoke the saga it will be remembered leaves this bjarna to a fate something like that of sir humphrey gilbert on board a sinking ship in the wormy sea having generously given up his place in the boat to a certain icelander it is doubly pleasant therefore to meet with this proof that the brave old man arrived safely in vinland and that his declining years were cheered by the respectful attentions of the dusky denizens of our then uninvaded forest most of all was i gratified however in thus linking forever the name of my native town with one of the most momentous occurrences of modern times hitherto jalaam though in soil climate and geographical position as highly qualified to be the theatre of remarkable historical incidents as any spot on the earths surface has been if i may say it without seeming to question the wisdom of providence almost maliciously neglected as it might appear by occurrences of worldwide interest in want of a situation and in matters of this nature it must be confessed that adequate events are as necessary as the vates sacer to record them jaalam stood always modestly ready but circumstances made no fitting response to her generous intentions now however she assumes her place on the historick roll i have hitherto been a zealous opponent of the circean herb but i shall now reëxamine the question without bias  i am aware that the rev jonas tutchel in a recent communication to the bogus four corners weekly meridian has endeavored to show that this is the sepulchral inscription of thorwald eriksson who as is wellknown was slain in vinland by the natives but i think he has been misled by a preconceived theory and cannot but feel that he has thus made an ungracious return for my allowing him to inspect the stone with the aid of my own glasses he having by accident left his at home and in my own study the heathen ancients might have instructed this christian minister in the rites of hospitality but much is to be pardoned to the spirit of selflove he must indeed be ingenious who can make out the words hèr hvilir from any characters in the inscription in question which whatever else it may be is certainly not mortuary and even should the reverend gentleman succeed in persuading some fantastical wits of the soundness of his views i do not see what useful end he will have gained for if the english courts of law hold the testimony of gravestones from the burialgrounds of protestant dissenters to be questionable even where it is essential in proving a descent i cannot conceive that the epitaphial assertions of heathens should be esteemed of more authority by any man of orthodox sentiments  at this moment happening to cast my eyes upon the stone whose characters a transverse light from my southern window brings out with singular distinctness another interpretation has occurred to me promising even more interesting results i hasten to close my letter in order to follow at once the clue thus providentially suggested  i inclose as usual a contribution from mr biglow and remain

jaalam 17th may 1862  gentlemenat the special request of mr biglow i intended to inclose together with his own contribution into which at my suggestion he has thrown a little more of pastoral sentiment than usual some passages from my sermon on the day of the national fast from the text remember them that are in bonds as bound with them heb xiii 3 but i have not leisure sufficient at present for the copying of them even were i altogether satisfied with the production as it stands i should prefer i confess to contribute the entire discourse to the pages of your respectable miscellany if it should be found acceptable upon perusal especially as i find the difficulty in selection of greater magnitude than i had anticipated what passes without challenge in the fervour of oral delivery cannot always stand the colder criticism of the closet i am not so great an enemy of eloquence as my friend mr biglow would appear to be from some passages in his contribution for the current month i would not indeed hastily suspect him of covertly glancing at myself in his somewhat caustick animadversions albeit some of the phrases he girds at are not entire strangers to my lips i am a more hearty admirer of the puritans than seems now to be the fashion and believe that if they hebraized a little too much in their speech they showed remarkable practical sagacity as statesmen and founders but such phenomena as puritanism are the results rather of great religious than of merely social convulsions and do not long survive them so soon as an earnest conviction has cooled into a phrase its work is over and the best that can be done with it is to bury it ite missa est i am inclined to agree with mr biglow that we cannot settle the great political questions which are now presenting themselves to the nation by the opinions of jeremiah or ezekiel as to the wants and duties of the jews in their time nor do i believe that an entire community with their feelings and views would be practicable or even agreeable at the present day at the same time i could wish that their habit of subordinating the actual to the moral the flesh to the spirit and this world to the other were more common they had found out at least the great military secret that soul weighs more than bodybut i am suddenly called to a sickbed in the household of a valued parishioner    with esteem and

with feelings of the liveliest pain that we inform our readers of the death of the reverend homer wilbur am which took place suddenly by an apoplectic stroke on the afternoon of christmas day 1862 our venerable friend for so we may venture to call him though we never enjoyed the high privilege of his personal acquaintance was in his eightyfourth year having been born june 12 1779 at pigsgusset precinct now west jerusha in the then district of maine graduated with distinction at hubville college in 1805 he pursued his theological studies with the late reverend preserved thacker dd and was called to the charge of the first society in jaalam in 1809 where he remained till his death  as an antiquary he has probably left no superior if indeed an equal writes his friend and colleague the reverend jeduthun hitchcock to whom we are indebted for the above facts in proof of which i need only allude to his history of jaalam genealogical topographical and ecclesiastical 1849 which has won him an eminent and enduring place in our more solid and useful literature it is only to be regretted that his intense application to historical studies should have so entirely withdrawn him from the pursuit of poetical composition for which he was endowed by nature with a remarkable aptitude his wellknown hymn beginning with clouds of care encompassed round has been attributed in some collections to the late president dwight and it is hardly presumptuous to affirm that the simile of the rainbow in the eighth stanza would do no discredit to that polished pen  we regret that we have not room at present for the whole of mr hitchcocks exceedingly valuable communication we hope to lay more liberal extracts from it before our readers at an early day a summary of its contents will give some notion of its importance and interest it contains 1st a biographical sketch of mr wilbur with notices of his predecessors in the pastoral office and of eminent clerical contemporaries 2d an obituary of deceased from the punkinfalls weekly parallel 3d a list of his printed and manuscript productions and of projected works 4th personal anecdotes and recollections with specimens of tabletalk 5th a tribute to his relict mrs dorcas pilcox wilbur 6th a list of graduates fitted for different colleges by mr wilbur with biographical memoranda touching the more distinguished 7th concerning learned charitable and other societies of which mr wilbur was a member and of those with which had his life been prolonged he would doubtless have been associated with a complete catalogue of such americans as have been fellows of the royal society 8th a brief summary of mr wilburs latest conclusions concerning the tenth horn of the beast in its special application to recent events for which the public as mr hitchcock assures us have been waiting with feelings of lively anticipation 9th mr hitchcocks own views on the same topic and 10th a brief essay on the importance of local histories it will be apparent that the duty of preparing mr wilburs biography could not have fallen into more sympathetic hands  in a private letter with which the reverend gentleman has since favored us he expresses the opinion that mr wilburs life was shortened by our unhappy civil war it disturbed his studies dislocated all his habitual associations and trains of thought and unsettled the foundations of a faith rather the result of habit than conviction in the capacity of man for selfgovernment such has been the felicity of my life he said to mr hitchcock on the very morning of the day he died that through the divine mercy i could always say summum nec metuo diem nec opto it has been my habit as you know on every recurrence of this blessed anniversary to read miltons hymn of the nativity till its sublime harmonies so dilated my soul and quickened its spiritual sense that i seemed to hear that other song which gave assurance to the shepherds that there was one who would lead them also in green pastures and beside the still waters but today i have been unable to think of anything but that mournful text i came not to send peace but a sword and did it not smack of pagan presumptuousness could almost wish i had never lived to see this day  mr hitchcock also informs us that his friend lies buried in the jaalam graveyard under a large redcedar which he specially admired a neat and substantial monument is to be erected over his remains with a latin epitaph written by himself for he was accustomed to say pleasantly that there was at least one occasion in a scholars life when he might show the advantages of a classical training  the following fragment of a letter addressed to us and apparently intended to accompany mr biglows contribution to the present number was found upon his table after his deceaseeditors atlantic monthly   to the editors of the atlantic monthly  jaalam 24th dec 1862  respected sirs the infirm state of my bodily health would be a sufficient apology for not taking up the pen at this time wholesome as i deem it for the mind to apricate in the shelter of epistolary confidence were it not that a considerable i might even say a large number of individuals in this parish expect from their pastor some publick expression of sentiment at this crisis moreover qui tacitus ardet magis uritur in trying times like these the besetting sin of undisciplined minds is to seek refuge from inexplicable realities in the dangerous stimulant of angry partisanship or the indolent narcotick of vague and hopeful vaticination fortunamque suo temperat arbitrio both by reason of my age and my natural temperament i am unfitted for either unable to penetrate the inscrutable judgments of god i am more than ever thankful that my life has been prolonged till i could in some small measure comprehend his mercy as there is no man who does not at some time render himself amenable to the onequum vix justus sit securusso there is none that does not feel himself in daily need of the other  i confess i cannot feel as some do a personal consolation for the manifest evils of this war in any remote or contingent advantages that may spring from it i am old and weak i can bear little and can scarce hope to see better days nor is it any adequate compensation to know that nature is young and strong and can bear much old men philosophize over the past but the present is only a burthen and a weariness the one lies before them like a placid evening landscape the other is full of vexations and anxieties of housekeeping it may be true enough that miscet hæc illis prohibetque clotho fortunam stare but he who said it was fain at last to call in atropos with her shears before her time and i cannot help selfishly mourning that the fortune of our republick could not at least stay till my days were numbered  tibullus would find the origin of wars in the great exaggeration of riches and does not stick to say that in the days of the beechen trencher there was peace but averse as i am by nature from all wars the more as they have been especially fatal to libraries i would have this one go on till we are reduced to wooden platters again rather than surrender the principle to defend which it was undertaken though i believe slavery to have been the cause of it by so thoroughly demoralizing northern politicks for its own purposes as to give opportunity and hope to treason yet i would not have our thought and purpose diverted from their true objectthe maintenance of the idea of government we are not merely suppressing an enormous riot but contending for the possibility of permanent order coexisting with democratical fickleness and while i would not superstitiously venerate form to the sacrifice of substance neither would i forget that an adherence to precedent and prescription can alone give that continuity and coherence under a democratical constitution which are inherent in the person of a despotick monarch and the selfishness of an aristocratieal class stet pro ratione voluntas is as dangerous in a majority as in a tyrant  i cannot allow the present production of my young friend to go out without a protest from me against a certain extremeness in his views more pardonable in the poet than in the philosopher while i agree with him that the only cure for rebellion is suppression by force yet i must animadvert upon certain phrases where i seem to see a coincidence with a popular fallacy on the subject of compromise on the one hand there are those who do not see that the vital principle of government and the seminal principle of law cannot properly be made a subject of compromise at all and on the other those who are equally blind to the truth that without a compromise of individual opinions interests and even rights no society would be possible in medio tutissimus for my own part i would gladly   ef i a song or two could make   like rockets druv by their own burnin all leap an light to leave a wake   mens

kettelopotomachia  preliminary mote  in the month of february 1866 the editors of the atlantic monthly received from the rev mr hitchcock of jaalam a letter enclosing the macaronic verses which follow and promising to send more if more should be communicated they were rapped out on the evening of thursday last past he says by what claimed to be the spirit of my late predecessor in the ministry here the rev dr wilbur through the medium of a young man at present domiciled in my family as to the possibility of such spiritual manifestations or whether they be properly so entitled i express no opinion as there is a division of sentiment on that subject in the parish and many persons of the highest respectability in social standing entertain opposing views the young man who was improved as a medium submitted himself to the experiment with manifest reluctance and is still unprepared to believe in the authenticity of the manifestations during his residence with me his deportment has always been exemplary he has been constant in his attendance upon our family devotions and the public ministrations of the word and has more than once privately stated to me that the latter had often brought him under deep concern of mind the table is an ordinary quadrupedal one weighing about thirty pounds three feet seven inches and a half in height four feet square on the top and of beech or maple i am not definitely prepared to say which it had once belonged to my respected predecessor and had been so far as i can learn upon careful inquiry of perfectly regular and correct habits up to the evening in question on that occasion the young man previously alluded to had been sitting with his hands resting carelessly upon it while i read over to him at his request certain portions of my last sabbaths discourse on a sudden the rappings as they are called commenced to render themselves audible at first faintly but in process of time more distinctly and with violent agitation of the table the young man expressed himself both surprised and pained by the wholly unexpected and so far as he was concerned unprecedented occurrence at the earnest solicitation however of several who happened to be present he consented to go on with the experiment and with the assistance of the alphabet commonly employed in similar emergencies the following communication was obtained and written down immediately by myself whether any and if so how much weight should be attached to it i venture no decision that dr wilbur had sometimes employed his leisure in latin versification i have ascertained to be the case though all that has been discovered of that nature among his papers consists of some fragmentary passages of a version into hexameters of portions of the song of solomon these i had communicated about a week or ten days previously to the young gentleman who officiated as medium in the communication afterwards received i have thus i believe stated all the material facts that have any elucidative bearing upon this mysterious occurrence  so far mr hitchcock who seems perfectly master of websters unabridged quarto and whose flowing style leads him into certain farther expatiations for which we have not room we have since learned that the young man he speaks of was a sophomore put under his care during a sentence of rustication from  college where he had distinguished himself rather by physical experiments on the comparative power of resistance in windowglass to various solid substances than in the more regular studies of the place in answer to a letter of inquiry the professor of latin says there was no harm in the boy that i know of beyond his loving mischief more than latin nor can i think of any spirits likely to possess him except those commonly called animal he was certainly not remarkable for his latinity but i see nothing in the verses you enclose that would lead me to think them beyond his capacity or the result of any special inspiration whether of beech or maple had that of birch been tried upon him earlier and more faithfully the verses would perhaps have been better in quality and certainly in quantity this exact and thorough scholar then goes on to point out many false quantities and barbarisms it is but fair to say however that the author whoever he was seems not to have been unaware of some of them himself as is shown by a great many notes appended to the verses as we received them and purporting to be by scaliger bentley and othersamong them the esprit de voltaire these we have omitted as clearly meant to be humorous and altogether failing therein  though entirely satisfied that the verses are altogether unworthy of mr wilbur who seems to slave been a tolerable latin scholar after the fashion of his day yet we have determined to print them here partly as belonging to the res gestæ of this collection and partly as a warning to their putative author which may keep him from such indecorous pranks for the future

letters of inquiry concerning the literary remains of the late mr wilbur mentioned by his colleague and successor rev jeduthun hitchcock in a communication from which we made some extracts in our number for february 1863 and have been so repeatedly urged to print some part of them for the gratification of the public that they felt it their duty at least to make some effort to satisfy so urgent a demand they have accordingly carefully examined the papers intrusted to them but find most of the productions of mr wilburs pen so fragmentary and even chaotic written as they are on the backs of letters in an exceedingly cramped chirographyhere a memorandum for a sermon there an observation of the weather now the measurement of an extraordinary head of cabbage and then of the cerebral capacity of some reverend brother deceased a calm inquiry into the state of modern literature ending in a method of detecting if milk be impoverished with water and the amount thereof one leaf beginning with a genealogy to be interrupted halfway down with an entry that the brindle cow had calvedthat any attempts at selection seemed desperate his only complete work an enquiry concerning the tenth horn of the beast even in the abstract of it given by mr hitchcock would by a rough computation of the printers fill five entire numbers of our journal and as he attempts by a new application of decimal fractions to identify it with the emperor julian seems hardly of immediate concern to the general reader even the tabletalk though doubtless originally highly interesting in the domestic circle is so largely made up of theological discussion and matters of local or preterite interest that we have found it hard to extract anything that would at all satisfy expectation but in order to silence further inquiry we subjoin a few passages as illustrations of its general character  i think i could go near to be a perfect christian if i were always a visitor as i have sometimes been at the house of some hospitable friend i can show a great deal of selfdenial where the best of everything is urged upon me with kindly importunity it is not so very hard to turn the other cheek for a kiss and when i meditate upon the pains taken for our entertainment in this life on the endless variety of seasons of human character and fortune on the costliness of the hangings and furniture of our dwelling here i sometimes feel a singular joy in looking upon myself as gods guest and cannot but believe that we should all be wiser and happier because more grateful if we were always mindful of our privilege in this regard and should we not rate more cheaply any honor that men could pay us if we remembered that every day we sat at the table of the great king yet must we not forget that we are in strictest bonds his servants also for there is no impiety so abject as that which expects to be deadheaded ut ita dicam through life and which calling itself trust in providence is in reality asking providence to trust us and taking up all our goods on false pretences it is a wise rule to take the world as we find it not always to leave it so  it has often set me thinking when i find that i can always pick up plenty of empty nuts under my shagbarktree the squirrels know them by their lightness and i have seldom seen one with the marks of their teeth in it what a schoolhouse is the world if our wits would only not play truant for i observe that men set most store by forms and symbols in proportion as they are mere shells it is the outside they want and not the kernel what stores of such do not many who in material things are as shrewd as the squirrels lay up for the spiritual wintersupply of themselves and their children i have seen churches that seemed to me garners of these withered nuts for it is wonderful how prosaic is the apprehension of symbols by the minds of most men it is not one sect nor another but all who like the dog of the fable have let drop the spiritual substance of symbols for their material shadow if one attribute miraculous virtues to mere holy water that beautiful emblem of inward purification at the door of gods house another cannot comprehend the significance of baptism without being ducked over head and ears in the liquid vehicle thereof   perhaps a word of historical comment may be permitted here my late reverend predecessor was i would humbly affirm as free from prejudice as falls to the lot of the most highly favored individuals of our species to be sure i have heard him say that what were called strong prejudices were in fact only the repulsion of sensitive organizations from that moral and even physical effluvium through which some natures by providential appointment like certain unsavory quadrupeds gave warning of their neighborhood better ten mistaken suspicions of this kind than one close encounter this he said somewhat in heat on being questioned as to his motives for always refusing his pulpit to those itinerant professors of vicarious benevolence who end their discourses by taking up a collection but at another time i remember his saying that there was one large thing which small minds always found room for and that was great prejudices this however by the way the statement which i purposed to make was simply this down to ad 1830 jaalam had consisted of a single parish with one house set apart for religions services in that year the foundations of a baptist society were laid by the labors of elder joash q balcom 2d as the members of the new body were drawn from the first parish mr wilbur was for a time considerably exercised in mind he even went so far as on one occasion to follow the reprehensible practice of the earlier puritan divines in choosing a punning text and preached from hebrews xiii 9 be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines he afterwards in accordance with one of his own maximsto get a dead injury out of the mind as soon as is decent bury it and then ventilatein accordance with this maxim i say he lived on very friendly terms with rev shearjashub scrimgour present pastor of the baptist society in jaalam yet i think it was never unpleasing to him that the church edifice of that society though otherwise a creditable specimen of architecture remained without a bell as indeed it does to this day so much seemed necessary to do away with any appearance of acerbity toward a respectable community of professing christians which might be suspected in the conclusion of the above paragraphjh   in lighter moods he was not averse from an innocent play upon words looking up from his newspaper one morning as i entered his study he said when i read a debate in congress i feel as if i were sitting at the feet of zeno in the shadow of the portico on my expressing a natural surprise he added smiling why at such times the only view which honorable members give me of what goes on in the world is through their intercalumniations i smiled at this after a moments reflection and he added gravely the most punctilious refinement of manners is the only salt that will keep a democracy from stinking and what are we to expect from the people if their representatives set them such lessons mr everetts whole life has been a sermon from this text there was at least this advantage in duelling that it set a certain limit on the tongue when society laid by the rapier it buckled on the more subtle blade of etiquette wherewith to keep obtrusive vulgarity at bay in this connection i may be permitted to recall a playful remark of his upon another occasion the painful divisions in the first parish ad 1844 occasioned by the wild notions in respect to the rights of what mr wilbur so far as concerned the reasoning faculty always called the unfairer part of creation put forth by miss parthenia almira fitz are too well known to need more than a passing allusion it was during these heats long since happily allayed that mr wilbur remarked that the church had more trouble in dealing with one sheresiarch than with twenty heresiarchs and that the mens conscia recti or certainty of being right was nothing to the womens  when i once asked his opinion of a poetical composition on which i had expended no little pains he read it attentively and then remarked unless ones thought pack more neatly in verse than in prose it is wiser to refrain commonplace gains nothing by being translated into rhyme for it is something which no hocuspocus can transubstantiate with the real presence of living thought you entitle your piece my mothers grave and expend four pages of useful paper in detailing your emotions there but my dear sir watering does not improve the quality of ink even though you should do it with tears to publish a sorrow to tom dick and harry is in some sort to advertise its unreality for i have observed in my intercourse with the afflicted that the deepest grief instinctively hides its face with its hands and is silent if your piece were printed i have no doubt it would be popular for people like to fancy that they feel much better than the trouble of feeling i would put all poets on oath whether they have striven to say everything they possibly could think of or to leave out all they could not help saying in your own case my worthy young friend what you have written is merely a deliberate exercise the gymnastic of sentiment for your excellent maternal relative is still alive and is to take tea with me this evening dv beware of simulated feeling it is hypocrisys first cousin it is especially dangerous to a preacher for he who says one day go to let me seem to be pathetic may be nearer than he thinks to saying go to let me seem to be virtuous or earnest or under sorrow for sin depend upon it sappho loved her verses more sincerely than she did phaon and petrarch his sonnets better than laura who was indeed but his poetical stalkinghorse after you shall have once heard that muffled rattle of clods on the coffinlid of an irreparable loss you will grow acquainted with a pathos that will make all elegies hateful when i was of your age i also for a time mistook my desire to write verses for an authentic call of my nature in that direction but one day as i was going forth for a walk with my head full of an elegy on the death of flirtilla and vainly groping after a rhyme for lily that should not be silly or chilly i saw my eldest boy homer busy over the rainwater hogshead in that childish experiment at parthenogenesis the changing a horsehair into a watersnake all immersion of six weeks showed no change in the obstinate filament here was a stroke of unintended sarcasm had i not been doing in my study precisely what my boy was doing out of doors had my thoughts any more chance of coming to life by being submerged in rhyme than his hair by soaking in water i burned my elegy and took a course of edwards on the will people do not make poetry it is made out of them by a process for which i do not find myself fitted nevertheless the writing of verses is a good rhetorical exercitation as teaching us what to shun most carefully in prose for prose bewitched is like windowglass with bubbles in it distorting what it should show with pellucid veracity   it is unwise to insist on doctrinal points as vital to religion the bread of life is wholesome and sufficing in itself but gulped down with these kickshaws cooked up by theologians it is apt to produce an indigestion nay eyen at last an incurable dyspepsia of scepticism   one of the most inexcusable weaknesses of americans is in signing their names to what are called credentials but for my interposition a person who shall be nameless would have taken from this town a recommendation for an office of trust subscribed by the selectmen and all the voters of both parties ascribing to him as many good qualities as if it had been his tombstone the excuse was that it would be well for the town to be rid of him as it would erelong be obliged to maintain him i would not refuse my name to modest merit but i would be as cautious as in signing a bond i trust i shall be subjected to no imputation of unbecoming vanity if i mention the fact that mr w indorsed my own qualifications as teacher of the highschool at pequash junction jh when i see a certificate of character with everybodys name to it i regard it as a letter of introduction from the devil never give a man your name unless you are willing to trust him with your reputation   there seem nowadays to be two sources of literary inspirationfulness of mind and emptiness of pocket   i am often struck especially in reading montaigne with the obviousness and familiarity of a great writers thoughts and the freshness they gain because said by him the truth is we mix their greatness with all they say and give it our best attention johannes faber sic cogitavit would be no enticing preface to a book but an accredited name gives credit like the signature to a note of hand it is the advantage of fame that it is always privileged to take the world by the button and a thing is weightier for shakespeares uttering it by the whole amount of his personality   it is singular how impatient men are with overpraise of others how patient with overpraise of themselves and yet the one does them no injury while the other may he their ruin   people are apt to confound mere alertness of mind with attention the one is but the flying abroad of all the faculties to the open doors and windows at every passing rumor the other is the concentration of every one of them in a single focus as in the alchemist over his alembic at the moment of expected projection attention is the stuff that memory is made of and memory is accumulated genius   do not look for the millennium as imminent one generation is apt to get all the wear it can out of the cast clothes of the last and is always sure to use up every paling of the old fence that will hold a nail in building the new   you suspect a kind of vanity in my genealogical enthusiasm perhaps you are right but it is a universal foible where it does not show itself in a personal and private way it becomes public and gregarious we flatter ourselves in the pilgrim fathers and the virginian offshoot of a transported convict swells with the fancy ef a cavalier ancestry pride of birth i have noticed takes two forms one complacently traces himself up to a coronet another defiantly to a lapstone the sentiment is precisely the same in both cases only that one is the positive and the other the negative pole of it   seeing a goat the other day kneeling in order to graze with less trouble it seemed to me a type of the common notion of prayer most people are ready enough to go down on their knees for material blessings but how few for those spiritual gifts which alone are an answer to our orisons if we but knew it   some people nowadays seem to have hit upon a new moralization of the moth and the candle they would lock up the light of truth lest poor psyche should put it out in her effort to draw nigh to it     no x  mr hosea biglow to the editor of the

applause and cries of go on dont stop     under the willows and other poems    to charles eliot norton  agro dolce  the wind is roistering out of doors my windows shake and my chimney roars my elmwood chimneys seem crooning to me as of old in their moody minor key and out of the past the hoarse wind blows as i sit in my armchair and toast my toes  ho ho nineandforty they seem to sing we saw you a little toddling thing we knew you child and youth and man a wonderful fellow to dream and plan with a great thing always to comewho knows well well tis some comfort to toast ones toes  how many times have you sat at gaze till the mouldering fire forgot to blaze shaping among the whimsical coals fancies and figures and shining goals what matters the ashes that cover those while hickory lasts you can toast your toes  o dreamshipbuilder where are they all your grand threedeckers deepchested and tall that should crush the waves under canvas piles and anchor at last by the fortunate isles theres gray in your beard the years turn foes while you muse in your armchair and toast your toes  i sit and dream that i hear as of yore my elmwood chimneys deepthroated roar if much be gone there is much remains by the embers of loss i count my gains you and yours with the best till the old hope glows in the fanciful flame as i toast my toes  instead of a fleet of broadbrowed ships to send a childs armada of chips instead of the great gun tier on tier a freight of pebbles and grassblades sere well maybe more love with the less gift goes i growl as half moody i toast my toes    under the willows  frankhearted hostess of the field and wood gypsy whose roof is every spreading tree june is the pearl of our new england year still a surprisal though expected long her coming startles long she lies in wait makes many a feint peeps forth draws coyly back then from some southern ambush in the sky with one great gush of blossom storms the world a week ago the sparrow was divine the bluebird shifting his light load of song        10 from post to post along the cheerless fence was as a rhymer ere the poet come but now oh rapture sunshine winged and voiced pipe blown through by the warm wild breath of the west shepherding his soft droves of fleecy cloud gladness of woods skies waters all in one the bobolink has come and like the soul of the sweet season vocal in a bird gurgles in ecstasy we know not what save june dear june now god be praised for june      20  may is a pious fraud of the almanac a ghastly parody of real spring shaped out of snow and breathed with eastern wind or if oerconfident she trust the date and with her handful of anemones herself as shivery steal into the sun the season need but turn his hourglass round and winter suddenly like crazy lear reels back and brings the dead may in his arms her budding breasts and wan dislustred front        30 with frosty streaks and drifts of his white beard all overblown then warmly walled with books while my woodfire supplies the suns defect whispering old forestsagas in its dreams i take my may down from the happy shelf where perch the worlds rare songbirds in a row waiting my choice to open with full breast and beg an alms of springtime neer denied indoors by vernal chaucer whose fresh woods throb thick with merle and mavis all the year      40  july breathes hot sallows the crispy fields curls up the wan leaves of the lilachedge and every eve cheats us with show of clouds that braze the horizons western rim or hang motionless with heaped canvas drooping idly like a dim fleet by starving men besieged conjectured half and half descried afar helpless of wind and seeming to slip back adown the smooth curve of the oily sea  but june is full of invitations sweet              50 forth from the chimneys yawn and thriceread tomes to leisurely delights and sauntering thoughts that brook no ceiling narrower than the blue the cherry drest for bridal at my pane brushes then listens will he come the bee all dusty as a miller takes his toll of powdery gold and grumbles what a day to sun me and do nothing nay i think merely to bask and ripen is sometimes the students wiser business the brain              60 that forages all climes to line its cells ranging both worlds on lightest wings of wish will not distil the juices it has sucked to the sweet substance of pellucid thought except for him who hath the secret learned to mix his blood with sunshine and to take the winds into his pulses hush tis he my oriole my glance of summer fire is come at last and ever on the watch twitches the packthread i had lightly wound          70 about the bough to help his housekeeping twitches and scouts by turns blessing his luck yet fearing me who laid it in his way nor more than wiser we in our affairs divines the providence that hides and helps heave ho heave ho he whistles as the twine slackens its hold once more now and a flash lightens across the sunlight to the elm where his mate dangles at her cup of felt nor all his booty is the thread he trails           80 my loosened thought with it along the air and i must follow would i ever find the inward rhyme to all this wealth of life  i care not how men trace their ancestry to ape or adam let them please their whim but i in june am midway to believe a tree among my far progenitors such sympathy is mine with all the race such mutual recognition vaguely sweet there is between us surely there are times          90 when they consent to own me of their kin and condescend to me and call me cousin murmuring faint lullabies of eldest time forgotten and yet dumbly felt with thrills moving the lips though fruitless of all words and i have many a lifelong leafy friend never estranged nor careful of my soul that knows i hate the axe and welcomes me within his tent as if i were a bird or other free companion of the earth               100 yet undegenerate to the shifts of men among them one an ancient willow spreads eight balanced limbs springing at once all round his deepridged trunk with upward slant diverse in outline like enormous beaker fit for hand of jotun where mid snow and mist he holds unwieldy revel this tree spared i know not by what gracefor in the blood of our new world subduers lingers yet hereditary feud with trees they being              110 they and the redman most our fathers foes is one of six a willow pleiades the seventh fallen that lean along the brink where the steep upland dips into the marsh their roots like molten metal cooled in flowing stiffened in coils and runnels down the bank the friend of all the winds widearmed he towers and glints his steely aglets in the sun or whitens fitfully with sudden bloom of leaves breezelifted much as when a shoal       120 of devious minnows wheel from where a pike lurks balanced neath the lilypads and whirl a rood of silver bellies to the day alas no acorn from the british oak neath which slim fairies tripping wrought those rings of greenest emerald wherewith fireside life did with the invisible spirit of nature wed was ever planted here no darnel fancy might choke one useful blade in puritan fields with horn and hoof the good old devil came         130 the witchs broomstick was not contraband but all that superstition had of fair or piety of native sweet was doomed and if there be who nurse unholy faiths fearing their god as if he were a wolf that snuffed round every home and was not seen there should be some to watch and keep alive all beautiful beliefs and such was that by solitary shepherd first surmised under thessalian oaks loved by some maid           140 of royal stirp that silent came and vanished as near her nest the hermit thrush nor dared confess a mortal namethat faith which gave a hamadryed to each tree and i will hold it true that in this willow dwells the openhanded spirit frank and blithe of ancient hospitality long since with ceremonious thrift bowed out of doors  in june tis good to lie beneath a tree while the blithe season comforts every sense       150 steeps all the brain in rest and heals the heart brimming it oer with sweetness unawares fragrant and silent as that rosy snow wherewith the pitying appletree fills up and tenderly lines some lastyear robins nest there muse i of old times old hopes old friends old friends the writing of those words has borne my fancy backward to the gracious past the generous past when all was possible for all was then untried the years between        160 have taught some sweet some bitter lessons none wiser than thisto spend in all things else but of old friends to be most miserly each year to ancient friendships adds a ring as to an oak and precious more and more without deservingness or help of ours they grow and silent wider spread each year their unbought ring of shelter or of shade sacred to me the lichens on the bark which natures milliners would scrape away        170 most dear and sacred every withered limb tis good to set them early for our faith pines as we age and after wrinkles come few plant but water dead ones with vain tears  this willow is as old to me as life and under it full often have i stretched feeling the warm earth like a thing alive and gathering virtue in at every pore till it possessed me wholly and thought ceased or was transfused in something to which thought     180 is coarse and dull of sense myself was lost gone from me like an ache and what remained become a part of the universal joy my soul went forth and mingling with the tree danced in the leaves or floating in the cloud saw its white double in the stream below or else sublimed to purer ecstasy dilated in the broad blue over all i was the wind that dappled the lush grass the tide that crept with coolness to its roots     190 the thinwinged swallow skating on the air the life that gladdened everything was mine was i then truly all that i beheld or is this stream of being but a glass where the mind sees its visionary self as when the kingfisher flits oer his bay across the rivers hollow heaven below his picture flitsanother yet the same but suddenly the sound of human voice or footfall like the drop a chemist pours         200 doth in opacous cloud precipitate the consciousness that seemed but now dissolved into an essence rarer than its own and i am narrowed to myself once more  for here not long is solitude secure nor fantasy left vacant to her spell here sometimes in this paradise of shade rippled with western winds the dusty tramp seeing the treeless causey burn beyond halts to unroll his bundle of strange food          210 and munch an unearned meal i cannot help liking this creature lavish summers bedesman who from the almshouse steals when nights grow warm himself his large estate and only charge to be the guest of haystack or of hedge nobly superior to the household gear that forfeits us our privilege of nature i bait him with my matchbox and my pouch nor grudge the uncostly sympathy of smoke his equal now divinely unemployed                 220 some smack of robin hood is in the man some secret league with wild woodwandering things he is our ragged duke our barefoot earl by right of birth exonerate from toil who levies rent from us his tenants all and serves the state by merely being here the scissorsgrinder pausing doffs his hat and lets the kind breeze with its delicate fan winnow the heat from out his dank gray hair a grimy ulysses a muchwandered man               230 whose feet are known to all the populous ways and many men and manners he hath seen not without fruit of solitary thought he as the habit is of lonely men unused to try the temper of their mind in fence with otherspositive and shy yet knows to put an edge upon his speech pithily saxon in unwilling talk him i entrap with my longsuffering knife and while its poor blade hums away in sparks      240 sharpen my wit upon his gritty mind in motion set obsequious to his wheel and in its quality not much unlike  nor wants my tree more punctual visitors the children they who are the only rich creating for the moment and possessing whateer they choose to feignfor still with them kind fancy plays the fairy godmother strewing their lives with cheap material for wingèd horses and aladdins lamps              250 pure elfingold by manhoods touch profane to dead leaves disenchantedlong ago between the branches of the tree fixed seats making an oerturned box their table oft the shrilling girls sit here between school hours and play at whats my thought like while the boys with whom the age chivalric ever bides pricked on by knightly spur of female eyes climb high to swing and shout on perilous boughs or from the willows armory equipped               260 with musket dumb green banner edgeless sword make good the rampart of their treeredoubt gainst eager british storming from below and keep alive the tale of bunkers hill  here too the men that mend our village ways vexing macadams ghost with pounded slate their nooning take much noisy talk they spend on horses and their ills and as john bull tells of lord this or that who was his friend so these make boast of intimacies long              270 with famous teams and add large estimates by competition swelled from mouth to mouth of how much they could draw till one ill pleased to have his legend overbid retorts you take and stretch truckhorses in a string from here to long wharf end one thing i know not heavy neither they could never draw ensigns long bow then laughter loud and long so they in their leafshadowed microcosm image the larger world for wheresoeer             280 ten men are gathered the observant eye will find mankind in little as the stars glide up and set and all the heavens revolve in the small welkin of a drop of dew  i love to enter pleasure by a postern not the broad popular gate that gulps the mob to find my theatres in roadside nooks where men are actors and suspect it not where nature all unconscious works her will and every passion moves with easy gait             290 unhampered by the buskin or the train hating the crowd where we gregarious men lead lonely lives i love society nor seldom find the best with simple souls unswerved by culture from their native bent the ground we meet on being primal man and nearer the deep bases of our lives  but oh half heavenly earthly half my soul canst thou from those late ecstasies descend thy lips still wet with the miraculous wine         300 that transubstantiates all thy baser stuff to such divinity that soul and sense once more commingled in their source are lost canst thou descend to quench a vulgar thirst with the mere dregs and rinsings of the world well if my nature find her pleasure so i am content nor need to blush i take my little gift of being clean from god not haggling for a better holding it good as was ever any in the world                  310 my days as good and full of miracle i pluck my nutriment from any bush finding out poison as the first men did by tasting and then suffering if i must sometimes my bush burns and sometimes it is a leafless wilding shivering by the wall but i have known when winter barberries pricked the effeminate palate with surprise of savor whose mere harshness seemed divine  oh benediction of the higher mood                  320 and humankindness of the lower for both i will be grateful while i live nor question the wisdom that hath made us what we are with such large range as from the alehouse bench can reach the stars and be with both at home they tell us we have fallen on prosy days condemned to glean the leavings of earths feast where gods and heroes took delight of old but though our lives moving in one dull round of repetition infinite become                      330 stale as a newspaper once read and though history herself seen in her workshop seem to have lost the art that dyed those glorious panes rich with memorial shapes of saint and sage that pave with splendor the pasts dusky aisles panes that enchant the light of common day with colors costly as the blood of kings till with ideal hues it edge our thought yet while the world is left while nature lasts and man the best of nature there shall be          340 somewhere contentment for these human hearts some freshness some unused material for wonder and for song i lose myself in other ways where solemn guideposts say this way to knowledge this way to repose but here here only i am neer betrayed for every bypath leads me to my love  gods passionless reformers influences that purify and heal and are not seen shall man say whence your virtue is or how         350 ye make medicinal the wayside weed i know that sunshine through whatever rift how shaped it matters not upon my walls paints discs as perfectrounded as its source and like its antitype the ray divine however finding entrance perfect still repeats the image unimpaired of god  we who by shipwreck only find the shores of divine wisdom can but kneel at first can but exult to feel beneath our feet             360 that long stretched vainly down the yielding deeps the shock and sustenance of solid earth inland afar we see what temples gleam through immemorial stems of sacred groves and we conjecture shining shapes therein yet for a space we love to wander here among the shells and seaweed of the beach  so mused i once within my willowtent one brave june morning when the bluff northwest thrusting aside a dank and snuffling day           370 that made us bitter at our neighbors sins brimmed the great cup of heaven with sparkling cheer and roared a lusty stave the sliding charles blue toward the west and bluer and more blue living and lustrous as a womans eyes look once and look no more with southward curve ran crinkling sunniness like helens hair glimpsed in elysium insubstantial gold from blossomclouded orchards far away the bobolink tinkled the deep meadows flowed      380 with multitudinous pulse of light and shade against the bases of the southern hills while here and there a drowsy island rick slept and its shadow slept the wooden bridge thundered and then was silent on the roofs the sunwarped shingles rippled with the heat summer on field and hill in heart and brain all life washed clean in this high tide of june    dara  when persias sceptre trembled in a hand wilted with haremheats and all the land was hovered over by those vulture ills that snuff decaying empire from afar then with a nature balanced as a star dara arose a shepherd of the hills  he who had governed fleecy subjects well made his own village by the selfsame spell secure and quiet as a guarded fold then gathering strength by slow and wise degrees     10 under his sway to neighbor villages order returned and faith and justice old  now when it fortuned that a king more wise endued the realm with brain and hands and eyes he sought on every side men brave and just and having heard our mountain shepherds praise how he refilled the mould of elder days to dara gave a satrapy in trust  so dara shepherded a province wide nor in his viceroys sceptre took more pride         20 than in his crook before but envy finds more food in cities than on mountains bare and the frank sun of natures clear and rare breeds poisonous fogs in low and marish minds  soon it was hissed into the royal ear that though wise daras province year by year like a great sponge sucked wealth and plenty up yet when he squeezed it at the kings behest some yellow drops more rich than all the rest went to the filling of his private cup              30  for proof they said that wheresoeer he went a chest beneath whose weight the camel bent went with him and no mortal eye had seen what was therein save only daras own but when twas opened all his tent was known to glow and lighten with heaped jewels sheen  the king set forth for daras province straight there as was fit outside the citys gate the viceroy met him with a stately train and there with archers circled close at hand      40 a camel with the chest was seen to stand the kings brow reddened for the guilt was plain  open me here he cried this treasurechest twas done and only a worn shepherds vest was found therein some blushed and hung the head not dara open as the skys blue roof he stood and o my lord behold the proof that i was faithful to my trust he said  to govern men lo all the spell i had my soul in these rude vestments ever clad            50 still to the unstained past kept true and leal still on these plains could breathe her mountain air and fortunes heaviest gifts serenely bear which bend men from their truth and make them reel  for ruling wisely i should have small skill were i not lord of simple dara still that sceptre kept i could not lose my way strange dew in royal eyes grew round and bright and strained the throbbing lids before twas night two added provinces blest daras sway               60    the first snowfall  the snow had begun in the gloaming   and busily all the night had been heaping field and highway   with a silence deep and white  every pine and fir and hemlock   wore ermine too dear for an earl and the poorest twig on the elmtree   was ridged inch deep with pearl  from sheds newroofed with carrara   came chanticleers muffled crow the stiff rails softened to swansdown   and still fluttered down the snow  i stood and watched by the window   the noiseless work of the sky and the sudden flurries of snowbirds   like brown leaves whirling by  i thought of a mound in sweet auburn   where a little headstone stood how the flakes were folding it gently   as did robins the babes in the wood  up spoke our own little mabel   saying father who makes it snow and i told of the good allfather   who cares for us here below  again i looked at the snowfall   and thought of the leaden sky that arched oer our first great sorrow   when that mound was heaped so high  i remembered the gradual patience   that fell from that cloud like snow flake by flake healing and hiding   the scar that renewed our woe  and again to the child i whispered   the snow that husheth all darling the merciful father   alone can make it fall  then with eyes that saw not i kissed her   and she kissing back could not know that my kiss was given to her sister   folded close under deepening snow    the singing leaves  a ballad  i  what fairings will ye that i bring   said the king to his daughters three for i to vanity fair am bound now say what shall they be  then up and spake the eldest daughter   that lady tall and grand oh bring me pearls and diamonds great   and gold rings for my hand  thereafter spake the second daughter   that was both white and red                     10 for me bring silks that will stand alone   and a gold comb for my head  then came the turn of the least daughter   that was whiter than thistledown and among the gold of her blithesome hair   dim shone the golden crown  there came a bird this morning   and sang neath my bower eaves till i dreamed as his music made me   ask thou for the singing leaves              20  then the brow of the king swelled crimson   with a flush of angry scorn well have ye spoken my two eldest   and chosen as ye were born  but she like a thing of peasant race   that is happy binding the sheaves then he saw her dead mother in her face   and said thou shalt have thy leaves   ii  he mounted and rode three days and nights   till he came to vanity fair                      30 and twas easy to buy the gems and the silk   but no singing leaves were there  then deep in the greenwood rode he   and asked of every tree oh if you have ever a singing leaf   i pray you give it me  but the trees all kept their counsel   and never a word said they only there sighed from the pinetops   a music of seas far away                        40  only the pattering aspen   made a sound of growing rain that fell ever faster and faster   then faltered to silence again  oh where shall i find a little footpage   that would win both hose and shoon and will bring to me the singing leaves   if they grow under the moon  then lightly turned him walter the page   by the stirrup as he ran                        50 now pledge you me the truesome word   of a king and gentleman  that you will give me the first first thing   you meet at your

70 she took the packet and the smile   deepened down beneath the tear  it deepened down till it reached her heart   and then gushed up again and lighted her tears as the sudden sun   transfigures the

  the finding of the lyre  there lay upon the oceans shore what once a tortoise served to cover a year and more with rush and roar the surf had rolled it over had played with it and flung it by as wind and weather might decide it then tossed it high where sanddrifts dry cheap burial might provide it  it rested there to bleach or tan the rains had soaked the suns had burned it with many a ban the fisherman had stumbled oer and spurned it and there the fishergirl would stay conjecturing with her brother how in their play the poor estray might serve some use or other  so there it lay through wet and dry as empty as the last new sonnet till by and by came mercury and having mused upon it why here cried he the thing of things in shape material and dimension give it but strings and lo it sings a wonderful invention  so said so done the chords he strained and as his fingers oer them hovered the shell disdained a soul had gained the lyre had been discovered o empty world that round us

whether twas dreamed or heard yet fragrant in my mind it clings   as blossoms after rain and builds of halfremembered things   this vision in my brain  through aisles of longdrawn centuries   my spirit walks in thought and to that symbol lifts its eyes   which gods own pity wrought from calvary shines the altars gleam   the churchs east is there the ages one great minster seem   that throbs with praise and prayer  and all the way from calvary down   the carven pavement shows their graves who won the martyrs crown   and safe in god repose the saints of many a warring creed   who now in heaven have learned that all paths to the father lead   where self the feet have spurned  and as the mystic aisles i pace   by aureoled workmen built lives ending at the cross i trace   alike through

years shot at a venture and then following on stood doubtful at the parting of the ways  there once i stood in dream and as i paused looking this way and that came forth to me the figure of a woman veiled that said my name is duty turn and follow me something there was that chilled me in her voice i felt youths hand grow slack and cold in mine     10 as if to be withdrawn and i exclaimed oh leave the hot wild heart within my breast duty comes soon enough too soon comes death this slippery globe of life whirls of itself hasting our youth away into the dark these senses quivering with electric heats too soon will show like nests on wintry boughs obtrusive emptiness too palpable wreck which whistling northwinds line with downy snow sometimes or fringe with foliaged rime in vain     20 thither the singing birds no more return  then glowed to me a maiden from the left with bosom half disclosed and naked arms more white and undulant than necks of swans and all before her steps an influence ran warm as the whispering south that opens buds and swells the laggard sails of northern may i am called pleasure come with me she said then laughed and shook out sunshine from her hair nor only that but so it seemed shook out         30 all memory too and all the moonlit past old loves old aspirations and old dreams more beautiful for being old and gone  so we two went together downward sloped the path through yellow meads or so i dreamed yellow with sunshine and young green but i saw naught nor heard shut up in one close joy i only felt the hand within my own transmuting all my blood to golden fire dissolving all my brain in throbbing mist          40  suddenly shrank the hand suddenly burst a cry that split the torpor of my brain and as the first sharp thrust of lightning loosens from the heaped cloud its rain loosened my sense save me it thrilled oh hide me there is death death the divider the unmerciful that digs his pitfalls under love and youth and covers beauty up in the cold ground horrible death bringer of endless dark let him not see me hide me in thy breast         50 thereat i strove to clasp her but my arms met only what slipped crumbling down and fell a handful of gray ashes at my feet  i would have fled i would have followed back that pleasant path we came but all was changed rocky the way abrupt and hard to find yet i toiled on and toiling on i thought that way lies youth and wisdom and all good for only by unlearning wisdom comes and climbing backward to diviner youth              60 what the world teaches profits to the world what the soul teaches profits to the soul which then first stands erect with godward face when she lets fall her pack of withered facts the gleanings of the outward eye and ear and looks and listens with her finer sense nor truth nor knowledge cometh from without  after long weary days i stood again and waited at the parting of the ways again the figure of a woman veiled                   70 stood forth and beckoned and i followed now down to no bower of roses led the path but through the streets of towns where chattering cold hewed wood for fires whose glow was owned and fenced where nakedness wove garments of warm wool not for itselfor through the fields it led where hunger reaped the unattainable grain where idleness enforced saw idle lands leagues of unpeopled soil the common earth walled round with paper against god and man        80 i cannot look i groaned at only these the heart grows hardened with perpetual wont and palters with a feigned necessity bargaining with itself to be content let me behold thy face                          the form replied men follow duty never overtake duty nor lifts her veil nor looks behind but as she spake a loosened lock of hair slipped from beneath her hood and i who looked to see it gray and thin saw amplest gold          90 not that dull metal dug from sordid earth but such as the retiring sunset flood leaves heaped on bays and capes of island cloud o guide divine i prayed although not yet i may repair the virtue which i feel gone out at touch of untuned things and foul with draughts of beauty yet declare how soon  faithless and faint of heart the voice returned thou seest no beauty save thou make it first man woman nature each is but a glass              100 where the soul sees the image of herself visible echoes offsprings of herself but since thou needst assurance of how soon wait till that angel comes who opens all the reconciler he who lifts the veil the reuniter the restbringer death  i waited and methought he came but how or in what shape i doubted for no sign by touch or mark he gave me as he passed only i knew a lily that i held                      110 snapt short below the head and shrivelled up then turned my guide and looked at me unveiled and i beheld no face of matron stern but that enchantment i had followed erst only more fair more clear to eye and brain heightened and chastened by a household charm she smiled and which is fairer said her eyes the hags unreal florimel or mine    aladdin  when i was a beggarly boy   and lived in a cellar damp i had not a friend nor a toy   but i had aladdins

the cloudbergs eastward blow from glow to gloom the hillsides shift their plumps of orchardtrees arow their lakes of rye that wave and flow their snowy whiteweeds summer drift               50  there have we watched the west unfurl a cloud byzantium newly born with flickering spires and domes of pearl and vapory surfs that crowd and curl into the sunsets golden horn  there as the flaming occident burned slowly down to ashes gray night pitched oerhead her silent tent and glimmering gold from hesper sprent upon the darkened river lay                        60  where a twin sky but just before deepened and double swallows skimmed and from a visionary shore hung visioned trees that more and more grew dusk as those above were dimmed  then eastward saw we slowly grow clearedged the lines of roof and spire while great elmmasses blacken slow and lindenricks their round heads show against a flush of widening fire                   70  doubtful at first and far away the moonflood creeps more wide and wide up a ridged beach of cloudy gray curved round the east as round a bay it slips and spreads its gradual tide  then suddenly in lurid mood the disk looms large oer town and field as upon adam red like blood tween him and edens happy wood glared the commissioned angels shield             80  or let us seek the seaside there to wander idly as we list whether on rocky headlands bare sharp cedarhorns like breakers tear the trailing fringes of gray mist  or whether under skies full flown the brightening surfs with foamy din their breezecaught forelocks backward blown against the

                110  thence climbs an influence more benign through pulse and nerve through heart and brain sacred to me those fibres fine that first clasped earth oh neer be mine the alien sun and alien rain  these nourish not like homelier glows or waterings of familiar skies and nature fairer blooms bestows on the heaped hush of wintry snows in pastures dear to childhoods eyes             120

nature makes in any mood to me is warranted for good though long before i learned to see she did not set us moral theses and scorned to have her sweet caprices straitwaistcoated in you or me  i who take root and firmly cling thought fixedness the only thing why nature made the butterflies those dreams of wings that float and hover         10 at noon the slumberous poppies over was something hidden from mine eyes  till once upon a rocks brown bosom bright as a thorny cactusblossom i saw a butterfly at rest then first of both i felt the beauty the airy whim the grimset duty each from the other took its best  clearer it grew than winter sky that nature still had reasons why                 20 and shifting sudden as a breeze my fancy found no satisfaction no antithetic sweet attraction so great as in the nomades  scythians with nature not at strife light arabs of our complex life they build no houses plant no mills to utilize times sliding river content that it flow waste forever if they like it may have their wills            30  an hour they pitch their shifting tents in thoughts in feelings and events beneath the palmtrees on the grass they sing they dance make love and chatter vex the grim temples with their clatter and make truths fount their lookingglass  a picnic life from love to love from faith to faith they lightly move and yet hardeyed philosopher the flightiest maid that ever hovered              40 to me your thoughtwebs fine discovered no lens to see them through like her  so witchingly her fingertips to wisdom as away she trips she kisses waves

works its problem out in thee nor dream that in thy breast alone the conscience of the changeful seasons the will that in the planets reasons with spacewide logic has its throne             60  thy virtue makes not vice of mine unlike but none the less divine thy toil adorns not chides my play nature of sameness is so chary with such wild whim the freakish fairy picks presents for the christeningday    selfstudy  a presence both by night and day   that made my life seem just begun yet scarce a presence rather say   the warning aureole of one  and yet i felt it everywhere   walked i the woodlands aisles along it seemed to brush me with its hair   bathed i i heard a mermaids song  how sweet it was a buttercup   could hold for me a days delight a bird could lift my fancy up   to ether free from cloud or blight  who was the nymph nay i will see   methought and i will know her near if such divined her charm can be   seen and possessed how triply dear  so every magic art i tried   and spells as numberless as sand until one evening by my side   i saw her glowing fulness stand  i turned to clasp her but farewell   parting she sighed we meet no more not by my hand the curtain fell   that leaves you conscious wise and poor  since you nave found me out i go   another lover i must find content his happiness to know   nor strive its secret to unwind    pictures from appledore  i  a heap of bare and splintery crags tumbled about by lightning and frost with rifts and chasms and stormbleached jags that wait and growl for a ship to be lost no island but rather the skeleton of a wrecked and vengeancesmitten one where æons ago with halfshut eye the sluggish saurian crawled to die gasping under titanic ferns ribs of rock that seaward jut                      10 granite shoulders and boulders and snags round which though the winds in heaven be shut the nightmared ocean murmurs and yearns welters and swashes and tosses and turns and the dreary black seaweed lolls and wags only rock from shore to shore only a moan through the bleak clefts blown with sobs in the rifts where the coarse kelp shifts falling and lifting tossing and drifting and under all a deep dull roar                     20 dying and swelling forevermore rock and moan and roar alone and the dread of some nameless thing unknown these make appledore  these make appledore by night then there are monsters left and right every rock is a different monster all you have read of fancied dreamed when you waked at night because you screamed there they lie for half a mile                     30 jumbled together in a pile and though you know they never once stir if you look long they seem to be moving just as plainly as plain can be crushing and crowding wading and shoving out into the awful sea where you can hear them snort and spout with pauses between as if they were listening then tumult anon when the surf breaks glistening in the blackness where they wallow about           40   ii  all this you would scarcely comprehend should you see the isle on a sunny day then it is simple enough in its way two rocky bulges one at each end with a smaller bulge and a hollow between patches of whortleberry and bay accidents of open green sprinkled with loose slabs square and gray like graveyards for ages deserted a few unsocial thistles an elder or two                 50 foamed over with blossoms white as spray and on the whole island never a tree save a score of sumachs high as your knee that crouch in hollows where they may the cellars where once stood a village men say huddling for warmth and never grew tall enough for a peep at the sea a general dazzle of open blue a breeze always blowing and playing rattat with the bow of the ribbon round your hat          60 a score of sheep that do nothing but stare up or down at you everywhere three or four cattle that chew the cud lying about in a listless despair a medrick that makes you look overhead with short sharp scream as he sights his prey and dropping straight and swift as lead splits the water with sudden thud this is appledore by day  a common island you will say                      70 but stay a moment only climb up to the highest rock of the isle stand there alone for a little while and with gentle approaches it grows sublime dilating slowly as you win a sense from the silence to take it in so wide the loneness so lucid the air the granite beneath you so savagely bare you well might think you were looking down from some skysilenced mountains crown            80 whose waistbelt of pines is wont to tear locks of wool from the topmost cloud only be sure you go alone for grandeur is inaccessibly proud and never yet has backward thrown her veil to feed the stare of a crowd to more than one was never shown that awful front nor is it fit that she cothurnusshod stand bowed until the selfapproving pit                        90 enjoy the gust of its own wit in babbling plaudits cheaply loud she hides her mountains and her sea from the harriers of scenery who hunt down sunsets and huddle and bay mouthing and mumbling the dying day  trust me tis something to be cast face to face with ones self at last to be taken out of the fuss and strife the endless clatter of plate and knife            100 the bore of books and the bores of the street from the singular mess we agree to call life where that is best which the most fools vote is and planted firm on ones own two feet so nigh to the great warm heart of god you almost seem to feel it beat down from the sunshine and up from the sod to be compelled as it were to notice all the beautiful changes and chances through which the landscape flits and glances      110 and to see how the face of common day is written all over with tender histories when you study it that intenser way in which a lover looks at his mistress  till now you dreamed not what could be done with a bit of rock and a ray of sun but look how fade the lights and shades of keen bare edge and crevice deep how doubtfully it fades and fades and glows again yon craggy steep                 120 oer which through colors dreamiest grades the musing sunbeams pause and creep now pink it blooms now glimmers gray now shadows to a filmy blue tries one tries all and will not stay but flits from opal hue to hue and runs through every tenderest range of change that seems not to be change so rare the sweep so nice the art that lays no stress on any part                   130 but shifts and lingers and persuades so soft that sunbrush in the west that asks no costlier pigments aids but mingling knobs flaws angles dints indifferent of worst or best enchants the cliffs with wraiths and hints and gracious preludings of tints where all seems fixed yet all evades and indefinably pervades perpetual movement with perpetual rest            140   iii  away northeast is boone island light you might mistake it for a ship only it stands too plumb upright and like the others does not slip behind the seas unsteady brink though if a cloudshade chance to dip upon it a moment twill suddenly sink levelled and lost in the darkened main till the sun builds it suddenly up again as if with a rub of aladdins lamp                150 on the mainland you see a misty camp of mountains pitched tumultuously that one looming so long and large is saddleback and that point you see over yon low and rounded marge like the boss of a sleeping giants targe laid over his breast is ossipee that shadow there may be kearsarge that must be great haystack i love these names wherewith the lonely farmer tames                   160 nature to mute companionship with his own minds domestic mood and strives the surly world to clip in the arms of familiar habitude tis well he could not contrive to make a saxon of agamenticus he glowers there to the north of us wrapt in his blanket of blue haze unconvertibly savage and scorns to take the white mans baptism or his ways                170 him first on shore the coaster divines through the early gray and sees him shake the morning mist from his scalplock of pines him first the skipper makes out in the west ere the earliest sunstreak shoots tremulous plashing with orange the palpitant lines of mutable billow crest after crest and murmurs agamenticus as if it were the name of a saint but is that a mountain playing cloud               180 or a cloud playing mountain just there so faint look along over the low right shoulder of agamenticus into that crowd of brassy thunderheads behind it now you have caught it but ere you are older by half an hour you will lose it and find it a score of times while you look tis gone and just as youve given it up anon it is there again till your weary eyes fancy they see it waver and rise                   190 with its brother clouds it is agiochook there if you seek not and gone if you look ninety miles off as the eagle flies  but mountains make not all the shore the mainland shows to appledore eight miles the heaving water spreads to a long low coast with beaches and heads that run through unimagined mazes as the lights and shades and magical hazes put them away or bring them near                   200 shimmering sketched out for thirty miles between two capes that waver like threads and sink in the ocean and reappear crumbled and melted to little isles with filmy trees that seem the mere halffancies of drowsy atmosphere and see the beach there where it is flat as a threshingfloor beaten and packed with the flashing flails of weariless seas how it lifts and looms to a precipice             210 oer whose square front a dream no more the steepened sandstripes seem to pour a murmurless vision of cataract you almost fancy you hear a roar fitful and faint from the distance wandering but tis only the blind old ocean maundering raking the shingle to and fro aimlessly clutching and letting go the kelphaired sedges of appledore slipping down with a sleepy forgetting            220 and anon his ponderous shoulder setting with a deep hoarse pant against appledore   iv  eastward as far as the eye can see still eastward eastward endlessly the sparkle and tremor of purple sea that rises before you a flickering hill on and on to the shut of the sky and beyond you fancy it sloping until the same multitudinous throb and thrill that vibrate under your dizzy eye                  230 in ripples of orange and pink are sent where the poppied sails doze on the yard and the clumsy junk and proa lie sunk deep with precious woods and nard mid the palmy isles of the orient those leaning towers of clouded white on the farthest brink of doubtful ocean that shorten and shorten out of sight yet seem on the selfsame spot to stay receding with a motionless motion                 240 fading to dubious films of gray lost dimly found then vanished wholly will rise again the great world under first films then towers then highheaped clouds whose nearing outlines sharpen slowly into tall ships with cobweb shrouds that fill long mongol eyes with wonder crushing the violet wave to spray past some low headland of cathay what was that sigh which seemed so near           250 chilling your fancy to the core tis only the sad old sea you hear that seems to seek forevermore something it cannot find and so sighing seeks on and tells its woe to the pitiless breakers of appledore   v  how looks appledore in a storm   i have seen it when its crags seemed frantic   butting against the mad atlantic when surge on surge would heap enorme              260   cliffs of emerald topped with snow   that lifted and lifted and then let go a great white avalanche of thunder   a grinding blinding deafening ire monadnock might have trembled under   and the island whose rockroots pierce below   to where they are warmed with the central fire you could feel its granite fibres racked   as it seemed to plunge with a shudder and thrill   right at the breast of the swooping hill         270 and to rise again snorting a cataract of ragefroth from every cranny and ledge   while the sea drew its breath in hoarse and deep and the next vast breaker curled its edge   gathering itself for a mightier leap  north east and south there are reefs and breakers   you would never dream of in smooth weather that toss and gore the sea for acres   bellowing and gnashing and snarling together look northward where duck island lies             280 and over its crown you will see arise against a background of slaty skies   a row of pillars still and white   that glimmer and then are gone from sight as if the moon should suddenly kiss   while you crossed the gusty desert by night the long colonnades of persepolis look southward for white island light   the lantern stands ninety feet oer the tide there is first a halfmile of tumult and fight     290 of dash and roar and tumble and fright   and surging bewilderment wild and wide where the breakers struggle left and right   then a mile or more of rushing sea and then the lighthouse slim and lone and whenever the weight of ocean is thrown full and fair on white island head   a great mistjotun you will see   lifting himself up silently high and huge oer the lighthouse top              300 with hands of wavering spray outspread   groping after the little tower   that seems to shrink and shorten and cower till the monsters arms of a sudden drop   and silently and fruitlessly   he sinks back into the sea  you meanwhile where drenched you stand   awaken once more to the rush and roar and on the rockpoint tighten your hand as you turn and see a valley deep                  310   that was not there a moment before suck rattling down between you and a heap   of toppling billow whose instant fall   must sink the whole island once for all or watch the silenter stealthier seas   feeling their way to you more and more if they once should clutch you high as the knees they would whirl you down like a sprig of kelp beyond all reach of hope or help   and such in a storm is appledore                320   vi  tis the sight of a lifetime to behold the great shorn sun as you see it now across eight miles of undulant gold that widens landward weltered and rolled with freaks of shadow and crimson stains to see the solid mountain brow as it notches the disk and gains and gains until there comes you scarce know when a tremble of fire oer the parted lips of cloud and mountain which vanishes then        330 from the body of day the sunsoul slips and the face of earth darkens but now the strips of western vapor straight and thin from which the horizons swervings win a grace of contrast take fire and burn like splinters of touchwood whose edges a mould of ashes oer feathers northward turn for an instant and let your eye grow cold on agamenticus and when once more you look tis as if the landbreeze growing      340 from the smouldering brands the film were blowing and brightening them down to the very core yet they momently cool and dampen and deaden the crimson turns golden the gold turns leaden hardening into one black bar oer which from the hollow heaven afar shoots a splinter of light like diamond half seen half fancied by and by beyond whatever is most beyond in the uttermost waste of desert sky              350 grows a star and over it visible spirit of dew ah stir not speak not hold your breath or surely the miracle vanisheth the new moon tranced in unspeakable blue no frail illusion this were true rather to call it the canoe hollowed out of a single pearl that floats us from the presents whirl back to those beings which were ours              360 when wishes were wingèd things like powers call it not light that mystery tender which broods upon the brooding ocean that flush of ecstasied surrender to indefinable emotion that glory mellower than a mist of pearl dissolved with amethyst which rims square rock like what they paint of mitigated heavenly splendor round the stern forehead of a saint               370  no more a vision reddened largened the moon dips toward her mountain nest and fringing it with palest argent slow sheathes herself behind the margent of that long cloudbar in the west whose nether edge erelong you see the silvery chrism in turn anoint and then the tiniest rosy point touched doubtfully and timidly into the dark blues chilly strip as some mute wondering thing below            381 awakened by the thrilling glow might looking up see dian dip one lucent foots delaying tip in latmian fountains long ago  knew you what silence was before here is no startle of dreaming bird that sings in his sleep or strives to sing here is no sough of branches stirred nor noise of any living thing                  390 such as one hears by night on shore only now and then a sigh with fickle intervals between sometimes far and sometimes nigh such as andromeda might have heard and fancied the huge seabeast unseen turning in sleep it is the sea that welters and wavers uneasily round the lonely reefs of appledore    the windharp   i treasure in secret some long fine hair   of tenderest brown but so inwardly golden i half used to fancy the sunshine there so shy so shifting so waywardly rare   was only caught for the moment and holden while i could say dearest and kiss it and then in pity let go to the summer again  i twisted this magic in gossamer strings   over a windharps delphian hollow then called to the idle breeze that swings all day in the pinetops and clings and sings   mid the musical leaves and said oh follow the will of those tears that deepen my words and fly to my window to waken these chords  so they trembled to life and doubtfully   feeling their way to my sense sang say whether they sit all day by the greenwood tree the lover and loved as it wont to be   when we but grief conquered and all together they swelled such weird murmur as haunts a shore of some planet dispeoplednevermore  then from deep in the past as seemed to me   the strings gathered sorrow and sang forsaken one lover still waits neath the greenwood tree but tis dark and they shuddered where lieth she   dark and cold forever must one be taken but i groaned o harp of all ruth bereft this scripture is sadderthe other left  there murmured as if one strove to speak   and tears came instead then the sad tones wandered and faltered among the uncertain chords in a troubled doubt between sorrow and words   at last with themselves they questioned and pondered hereafterwho knoweth and so they sighed down the long steps that lead to silence and died    auf wiedersehen  summer  the little gate was reached at last   half hid in lilacs down the lane she pushed it wide and as she past a wistful look she backward cast   and saidauf wiedersehen  with hand on latch a vision white   lingered reluctant and again half doubting if she did aright soft as the dews that fell that night   she saidauf wiedersehen  the lamps clear gleam

wiedersehen  somewhere is comfort somewhere faith   though thou in outer dark remain one sweet sad voice ennobles death and still for eighteen centuries saith   softlyauf wiedersehen  if earth another grave must bear   yet heaven hath won a sweeter strain and something whispers my despair that from an orient chamber there   floats down auf wiedersehen    after the burial   yes faith is a goodly anchor   when skies are sweet as a psalm at the bows it lolls so stalwart   in its bluff broadshouldered calm  and when over breakers to leeward   the tattered surges are hurled it may keep our head to the tempest   with its grip on the base of the world  but after the shipwreck tell me   what help in its iron thews still true to the broken hawser   deep down among seaweed and ooze  in the breaking gulfs of sorrow   when the helpless feet stretch out and find in the deeps of darkness   no footing so solid as doubt  then better one spar of memory   one broken plank of the past that our human heart may cling to   though hopeless of shore at last  to the spirit its splendid conjectures   to the flesh its sweet despair its tears oer the thinworn locket   with its anguish of deathless hair  immortal i feel it and know it   who doubts it of such as she but that is the pangs very secret   immortal away from me  theres a narrow ridge in the graveyard   would scarce stay a child in his race but to me and my thought it is wider   than the starsown vague of space  your logic my friend is perfect   your moral most drearily true but since the earth clashed on her coffin   i keep hearing that and not you  console if you will i can bear it   tis a wellmeant alms of breath but not all the preaching since adam   has made death other than death  it is pagan but wait till you feel it   that jar of our earth that dull shock when the ploughshare of deeper passion   tears down to our primitive rock  communion in spirit forgive me   but i who am earthly and weak would give all my incomes from dreamland   for a touch of her hand on my cheek that little shoe in the corner   so worn and wrinkled and brown with its emptiness confutes you   and argues your wisdom down    the dead house  here once my step was quickened   here beckoned the opening door and welcome thrilled from the threshold   to the foot it had known before  a glow came forth to meet me   from the flame that laughed in the grate and shadows adance on the ceiling   danced blither with mine for a mate  i claim you old friend yawned the armchair   this corner you know is your seat best your slippers on me beamed the fender   i brighten at touch of your feet  we know the practised finger   said the books that seems like brain and the shy page rustled the secret   it had kept till i came again  sang the pillow my down once quivered   on nightingales throats that flew through moonlit gardens of hafiz   to gather quaint dreams for you  ah me where the past sowed heartsease   the present plucks rue for us men i come back that scar unhealing   was not in the churchyard then  but i think the house is unaltered   i will go and beg to look at the rooms that were once familiar   to my life as its bed to a brook  unaltered alas for the sameness   that makes the change but more tis a dead man i see in the mirrors   tis his tread that chills the floor  to learn such a simple lesson   need i go to paris and rome that the many make the household   but only one the home  twas just a womanly presence   an influence unexprest but a rose she had worn on my gravesod   were more than long life with the rest  twas a smile twas a garments rustle   twas nothing that i can phrase but the whole dumb dwelling grew conscious   and put on her looks and ways  were it mine i would close the shutters   like lids when the life is fled and the funeral fire should wind it   this corpse of a home that is dead  for it died that autumn morning   when she its soul was borne to lie all dark on the hillside   that looks over woodland and corn    a mood  i go to the ridge in the forest i haunted in days gone by but thou o memory pourest no magical drop in mine eye nor the gleam of the secret restorest that hath faded from earth and sky a presence autumnal and sober invests every rock and tree and the aureole of october lights the maples but darkens me  pine in the distance patient through sun or rain meeting with graceful persistence with yielding but rooted resistance the northwinds wrench and strain no memory of past existence brings thee pain right for the zenith heading friendly with heat or cold thine arms to the influence spreading of the heavens just from of old thou only aspirest the more unregretful the old leaves shedding that fringed thee with music before and deeper thy roots embedding in the grace and the beauty of yore thou sighst not alas i am older the green of last summer is sear but loftier hopefuller bolder winnest broader horizons each year  to me tis not cheer thou art singing theres a sound of the sea o mournful tree in thy boughs forever clinging and the faroff roar of waves on the shore a shattered vessel flinging  as thou musest still of the ocean on which thou must float at last and seemst to foreknow the shipwrecks woe and the sailor wrenched from the broken mast do i in this vague emotion this sadness that will not pass though the air throb with wings and the field laughs and sings do i forebode alas the shipbuilding longer and wearier the voyages struggle and strife and then the darker and drearier wreck of a broken life    the voyage to vinland  i  biÖrns beckoners  now biörn the son of heriulf had ill days because the heart within him seethed with blood that would not be allayed with any toil whether of war or hunting or the oar but was anhungered for some joy untried for the brain grew not weary with the limbs but while they slept still hammered like a troll building all night a bridge of solid dream between him and some purpose of his soul or will to find a purpose with the dawn             10 the sleeplaid timbers crumbled to soft mist denied all foothold but the dream remained and every night with yellowbearded kings his sleep was hauntedmighty men of old once young as he now ancient like the gods and safe as stars in all mens memories strange sagas read he in their seablue eyes cold as the sea grandly compassionless like life they made him eager and then mocked nay broad awake they would not let him be           20 they shaped themselves gigantic in the mist they rose farbeckoning in the lamps of heaven they whispered invitation in the winds and breath came from them mightier than the wind to strain the lagging sails of his resolve till that grew passion which before was wish and youth seemed all too costly to be staked on the soiled cards wherewith men played their game letting time pocket up the larger life lost with base gain of raiment food and roof        30 what helpeth lightness of the feet they said oblivion runs with swifter foot than they or strength of sinew new men come as strong and those sleep nameless or renown in war swords grave no name on the longmemoried rock but moss shall hide it they alone who wring some secret purpose from the unwilling gods survive in song for yet a little while to vex like us the dreams of later men ourselves a dream and dreamlike all we did          40   ii  thorwalds lay  so biörn went comfortless but for his thought and by his thought the more discomforted till erle thurlson kept his yuletide feast and thither came he called among the rest silent loneminded a churchdoor to mirth but ere deep draughts forbade such serious song as the grave skald might chant nor after blush then eric looked at thorwald where he sat mute as a cloud amid the stormy hall and said o skald sing now an olden song            50 such as our fathers heard who led great lives and as the bravest on a shield is borne along the waving host that shouts him king so rode their thrones upon the thronging seas then the old man arose whitehaired he stood whitebearded and with eyes that looked afar from their still region of perpetual snow beyond the little smokes and stirs of men his head was bowed with gathered flakes of years as winter bends the seaforeboding pine                60 but something triumphed in his brow and eye which whoso saw it could not see and crouch loud rang the emptied beakers as he mused brooding his eyried thoughts then as an eagle circles smoothwinged above the windvexed woods so wheeled his soul into the air of song high oer the stormy hall and thus he sang the fletcher for his arrowshaft picks out wood closestgrained longseasoned straight as light and from a quiver full of such as these             70 the wary bowman matched against his peers long doubting singles yet once more the best who is it needs such flawless shafts as fate what archer of his arrows is so choice or hits the white so surely they are men the chosen of her quiver nor for her will every reed suffice or crossgrained stick at random from lifes vulgar fagot plucked such answer household ends but she will have souls straight and clear of toughest

sinew twang behold in the butts heart her trembling messenger        90  the song is old and simple that i sing but old and simple are despised as cheap though hardest to achieve of human things good

hastes opportunity seeking the hardy soul that seeks for her be not abroad nor deaf with household cares       100 that chatter loudest as they mean the least swiftwilled is thricewilled late means nevermore impatient is her foot nor turns again he ceased upon his bosom sank his beard sadly as one who oft had seen her pass nor stayed her and forthwith the frothy tide of interrupted wassail roared along but biörn the son of heriulf sat apart musing and with his eyes upon the fire saw shapes of arrows lost as soon as seen     110 a ship he mutteredis a wingèd bridge that leadeth every way to mans desire and ocean the wide gate to manful luck and then with that resolve his heart was bent which like a humming shaft through many a stripe of day and night across the unpathwayed seas shot the brave prow that cut on vinland sands the first rune in the saga of the west   iii  gudridas prophecy  four weeks they sailed a speck in skyshut seas life where was never life that knew itself        120 but tumbled lubberlike in blowing whales thought where the like had never been before since thought primeval brooded the abyss alone as men were never in the world they saw the icy foundlings of the sea white cliffs of silence beautiful by day or looming suddenperilous at night in monstrous hush or sometimes in the dark the waves broke ominous with paly gleams crushed by the prow in sparkles of cold fire       130 then came green stripes of sea that promised land but brought it not and on the thirtieth day low in the west were wooded shores like cloud they shouted as men shout with sudden hope but biörn was silent such strange loss there is between the dreams fulfilment and the dream such sad abatement in the goal attained then gudrida that was a prophetess rapt with strange influence

ashes confiding its joyance unconscious confiding then silent and glossy slips winding and hiding through alderstems mossy through gossamer roots fine as nerves                        20 that tremble as shoots through their magnetized curves the allurement delicious of the waters capricious thrills gushes and swerves  ii  tis a woodland enchanted i am writing no fiction and this fount its sole daughter to the woodland was granted to pour holy water                     30 and win benediction in summernoon flushes when all the wood hushes blue dragonflies knitting to and fro in the sun with sidelong jerk flitting sink down on the rashes and motionless sitting hear it bubble and run hear its low inward singing           40 with level wings swinging on green tasselled rushes to dream in the sun  iii  tis a woodland enchanted the great august noonlight through myriad rifts slanted leaf and bole thickly sprinkles with flickering gold there in warm august gloaming with quick silent brightenings       50 from meadowlands roaming the firefly twinkles his fitful heatlightnings there the magical moonlight with meek saintly glory steeps summit and wold there whippoorwills plain in the solitudes hoary with lone cries that wander now hither now yonder like souls doomed of old               60 to a mild purgatory but through noonlight and moonlight the little fount tinkles its silver saintsbells that no sprite illboding may make his abode in those innocent dells  iv  tis a woodland enchanted when the phebe scarce whistles once an hour to his fellow            70 and where red lilies flaunted balloons from the thistles tell summers disasters the butterflies yellow as caught in an eddy of airs silent ocean sink waver and steady oer goatsbeard and asters like souls of dead flowers with aimless emotion                   80 still lingering unready to leave their old bowers and the fount is no dumber but still gleams and flashes and gurgles and plashes to the measure of summer the butterflies hear it and spellbound are holden still balancing near it oer the goats beard so golden       90  v  tis a woodland enchanted a vast silver willow i know not how planted this wood is enchanted and full of surprises stands stemming a billow a motionless billow of ankledeep mosses two great roots it crosses to make a round basin                 100 and there the fount rises ah too pure a mirror for one sick of error to see his sad face in no dewdrop is stiller in its lupinleaf setting than this water mossbounded but a tiny sandpillar from the bottom keeps jetting and mermaid neer sounded              110 through the wreaths of a shell down amid crimson dulses in some cavern of ocean a melody sweeter than the delicate pulses the soft noiseless metre the pause and the swell of that musical motion i recall it not see it could vision be clearer               120 half im fain to draw nearer half tempted to flee it the sleeping past wake not beware one forward step take not ah break not that quietude rare by my step unaffrighted a thrush hops before it and oer it                            130 a birch hangs delighted dipping dipping dipping its tremulous hair pure as the fountain once i came to the place how dare i draw nearer i bent oer its mirror and saw a childs face mid locks of bright gold in it yes pure as this fountain once since bow much error                 140 too holy a mirror for the man to behold in it his harsh bearded countenance  vi  tis a woodland enchanted ah fly unreturning yet stay tis a woodland enchanted where wonderful chances have sway luck flees from the cold one          150 but leaps to the bold one halfway why should i be daunted still the smooth mirror glances still the amber sand dances one lookthen away o magical glass canst keep in thy bosom shades of leaf and of blossom when summer days pass                 160 so that when thy wave hardens it shapes as it pleases unharmed by the breezes its fine hanging gardens hast those in thy keeping and canst not uncover enchantedly sleeping the old shade of thy lover it is there i have found it he wakes the long sleeper            170 the pool is grown deeper the sand dance is ending the white floor sinks blending with skies that below me are deepening and bending and a childs face alone that seems not to know me with hair that fades golden in the heavenglow round it looks up at my own                    180 ah glimpse through the portal that leads to the throne that opes the childs olden regions elysian ah too holy vision for thy skirts to be holden by soiled hand of mortal it wavers it scatters tis gone past recalling a tears sudden falling                190 the magic cup shatters breaks the spell of the waters and the sand cone once more with a ceaseless renewing its dance is pursuing on the silvery floor oer and oer with a noiseless and ceaseless renewing  vii  tis a woodland enchanted if you ask me where is it     200 i can but make answer tis past my disclosing not to choice is it granted by sure paths to visit the still pool enclosing its blithe little dancer but in some day the rarest of many septembers when the pulses of air rest and all things lie dreaming            210 in drowsy haze steaming from the woods glowing embers then sometimes unheeding and asking not whither by a sweet inward leading my feet are drawn thither and looking with awe in the magical mirror i see through my tears half doubtful of seeing the face unperverted                  220 the warm golden being of a child of five years and spite of the mists and the error and the days overcast can feel that i walk undeserted but forever attended by the glad heavens that bended oer the innocent past toward fancy or truth doth the sweet vision win me          230 dare i think that i cast in the fountain of youth the fleeting reflection of some bygone perfection that still lingers in me    yussouf  a stranger came one night to yussoufs tent saying behold one outcast and in dread against whose life the bow of power is bent who flies and hath not where to lay his head i come to thee for shelter and for food to yussouf called through all our tribes the good  this tent is mine said yussouf but no more than it is gods come in and be at peace freely shall thou partake of all my store as i of his who buildeth over these our tents his glorious roof of night and day and at whose door none ever yet heard nay  so yussouf entertained his guest that night and waking him ere day said here is gold my swiftest horse is saddled for thy flight depart before the prying day grow bold as one lamp lights another nor grows less so nobleness enkindleth nobleness  that inward light the strangers face made grand which shines from all selfconquest kneeling low he bowed his forehead upon yussoufs hand sobbing o sheik i cannot leave thee so i will repay thee all this thou hast done unto that ibrahim who slew thy son  take thrice the gold said yussouf for with thee into the desert never to return my one black thought shall ride away from me firstborn for whom by day and night i yearn balanced and just are all of gods decrees thou art avenged my firstborn sleep in peace    the darkened mind  the fire is turning clear and blithely pleasantly whistles the winter wind we are about thee thy friends and kindred on us all flickers the firelight kind there thou sittest in thy wonted corner lone and awful in thy darkened mind  there thou sittest now and then thou moanest thou dost talk with what we cannot see lookest at us with an eye so doubtful it doth put us very far from thee there thou sittest we would fain be nigh thee but we know that it can never be  we can touch thee still we are no nearer gather round thee still thou art alone the wide chasm of reason is between us thou confutest kindness with a moan we can speak to thee and thou canst answer like two prisoners through a wall of stone  hardest heart would call it very awful when thou lookst at us and seestoh what if we move away thou sittest gazing with those vague eyes at the selfsame spot and thou mutterest thy hands thou wringest seeing somethingus thou seest not  strange it is that in this open brightness thou shouldst sit in such a narrow cell strange it is that thou shouldst be so lonesome where those are who love thee all so well not so much of thee is left among us as the hum outliving the hushed bell    what rabbi jehosha said  rabbi jehosha used to say that god made angels every day perfect as michael and the rest first brooded in creations nest whose only office was to cry hosanna once and then to die or rather with lifes essence blent to be led home from banishment  rabbi jehosha had the skill to know that heaven is in gods will and doing that though for a space one heartbeat long may win a grace as full of grandeur and of glow as princes of the chariot know  twere glorious no doubt to be one of the strongwinged hierarchy to burn with seraphs or to shine with cherubs deathlessly divine yet i perhaps poor earthly clod could i forget myself in god could i but find my natures clue simply as birds and blossoms do and but for one rapt moment know tis heaven must come not we must go should win my place as near the throne as the pearlangel of its zone and god would listen mid the throng for my one breath of perfect song that in its simple human way said all the host of heaven could say    allsaints  one feast of holy days the crest   i though no churchman love to keep allsaintsthe unknown good that rest   in gods still memory folded deep the bravely dumb that did their deed   and scorned to blot it with a name men of the plain heroic breed   that loved heavens silence more than fame  such lived not in

cup of water warms like wine   their speech is filled from heavenly urns  about their brows to me appears   an aureole traced in tenderest light the rainbowgleam of smiles through tears   in dying eyes by them made bright of souls that shivered on the edge   of that chill ford repassed no more and in their mercy felt the pledge  and sweetness of the farther shore    a winterevening hymn to my fire   i  beauty on my hearthstone blazing tonight the triple zoroaster shall my prophet be and master tonight will i pure magian be hymns to thy sole honor raising while thou leapest fast and faster wild with selfdelighted glee or sinkst low and glowest faintly as an aureole still and saintly keeping cadence to my praising         10 thee still thee and only thee   ii  elfish daughter of apollo thee from thy father stolen and bound to serve in vulcans clangorous smithy prometheus primal yankee found and when he had tampered with thee too confiding little maid in a reeds precarious hollow to our frozen earth conveyed for he swore i know not what          20 endless ease should be thy lot pleasure that should never falter lifelong play and not a duty save to hover oer the altar vision of celestial beauty fed with precious woods and spices then perfidious having got thee in the net of his devices sold thee into endless slavery made thee a drudge to boil the pot     30 thee helios daughter who dost bear his likeness in thy golden hair thee by nature wild and wavery palpitating evanescent as the shade of dians crescent life motion gladness everywhere   iii  fathom deep men bury thee in the furnace dark and still there with dreariest mockery     39 making thee eat against thy will blackest pennsylvanian stone but thou dost avenge thy doom for from out thy catacomb day and night thy wrath is blown in a withering simoom and adown that cavern drear thy black pitfall in the floor staggers the lusty antique cheer despairing and is seen no more   iv  elfish i may rightly name thee     50 we enslave but cannot tame thee with fierce snatches now and then thou pluckest at thy right again and thy downtrod instincts savage to stealthy insurrection creep while thy wittol masters sleep and burst in undiscerning ravage then how thou shakst thy bacchant locks while brazen pulses far and near throb thick and thicker wild with fear     60 and dread conjecture till the drear disordered clangor every steeple rocks   v  but when we make a friend of thee and admit thee to the hall on our nights of festival then cinderella who could see in thee the kitchens stunted thrall once more a princess lithe and tan thou dancest with a whispering tread while the bright marvel of thy head     70 in crinkling gold floats all abroad and gloriously dost vindicate the legend of thy lineage great earthexiled daughter of the pythian god now in the ample chimneyplace to honor thy acknowledged race we crown thee high with laurel good thy shining fathers sacred wood which guessing thy ancestral right sparkles and snaps its dumb delight     80 and at thy touch poor outcast one feels through its gladdened fibres go the tingle and thrill and vassal glow of instincts loyal to the sun   vi  o thou of home the guardian lar and when our earth hath wandered far into the cold and deep snow covers the walks of our new england lovers their sweet secluded eveningstar twas with thy rays the english muse     90 ripened her mild domestic hues twas by thy flicker that she conned the fireside wisdom that enrings with light from heaven familiar things by thee she found the homely faith in whose mild eyes thy comfort stayth when death extinguishing his torch gropes for the latchstring in the porch the love that wanders not beyond his earliest nest but sits and sings     100 while children smooth his patient wings therefore with thee i love to read our brave old poets at thy touch how stirs life in the withered words how swift recede times shadows and how glows again through its dead mass the incandescent verse as when upon the anvils of the brain it glittering lay cyclopically wrought by the fastthrobbing hammers of the poets thought thou murmurest too divinely stirred              110 the aspirations unattained the rhythms so rathe and delicate they bent and strained and broke beneath the sombre weight of any airiest mortal word   vii  what warm protection dost thou bend round curtained talk of friend with friend while the gray snowstorm held aloof to softest outline rounds the roof or the rude north with baffled strain     120 shoulders the froststarred windowpane now the kind nymph to bacchus born by morpheus daughter she that seems gifted opon her natal morn by him with fire by her with dreams nicotia dearer to the muse than all the grapes bewildering juice we worship unforbid of thee and as her incense floats and curls in airy spires and wayward whirls     130 or poises on its tremulous stalk a flower of frailest revery so winds and loiters idly free the current of unguided talk now laughterrippled and now caught in smooth dark pools of deeper thought meanwhile thou mellowest every word a sweetly unobtrusive third for thou hast magic beyond wine to unlock natures each to each     140 the unspoken thought thou canst divine thou fillst the pauses of the speech with whispers that to dreamland reach and frozen fancysprings unchain in arctic outskirts of the brain sun of all inmost confidences to thy rays doth the heart unclose its formal calyx of pretences that close against rude days offences and open its shy midnight rose     150   viii  thou holdest not the master key with which thy sire sets free the mystic gates of past and future not for common fates do they wide open fling and with a far heard ring swing back their willing valves melodiously only to ceremonial days and great processions of imperial song that set the world at gaze doth such high privilege belong     160 but thou a posterndoor canst ope to humbler chambers of the selfsame palace where memory lodges and her sister hope whose being is but as a crystal chalice which with her various mood the elder fills of joy or sorrow so coloring as she wills with hues of yesterday the unconscious morrow   ix  thou sinkest and my fancy sinks with thee for thee i took the idle shell                    170 and struck the unused chords again but they are gone who listened well some are in heaven and all are far from me even as i sing it turns to pain and with vain tears my eyelids throb and swell enough i come not of the race that hawk their sorrows in the marketplace earth stops the ears i best had loved to please then break ye untuned chords or rust in peace as if a whitehaired actor should come back        180 some midnight to the theatre void and black and there rehearse his youths great part mid thin applauses of the ghosts so seems it now ye crowd upon my heart and i bow down in silence shadowy hosts    fancys casuistry  how struggles with the tempests swells that warning of tumultuous bells the fire is loose and frantic knells     throb fast and faster as tower to tower confusedly tells     news of disaster  but on my faroff solitude no harsh alarums can intrude the terror comes to me subdued     and charmed by distance to deepen the habitual mood     of my existence  are those i muse the easter chimes and listen weaving careless rhymes while the loud citys griefs and crimes     pay gentle allegiance to the fine quiet that sublimes     these dreamy regions  and when the storm oerwhelms the shore i watch entranced as oer and oer the light revolves amid the roar     so still and saintly now large and near now more and more     withdrawing faintly  this too despairing sailors see flash out the breakers neath their lee in sudden snow then lingeringly     wane towrd eclipse while through the dark the shuddering sea     gropes for the ships  and is it right this mood of mind that thus in revery enshrined can in the world mere topics find     for musing stricture seeing the life of humankind     only as picture  the events in line of battle go in vain for me their trumpets blow as unto him that lieth low     in deaths dark arches and through the sod hears throbbing slow     the muffled marches  o duty am i dead to thee in this my cloistered ecstasy in this lone shallop on the sea     that drifts towrd silence and are those visioned shores i see     but sirens islands  my dante frowns with liplocked mien as who would say tis those i ween whom lifelong armorchafe makes lean     that

fame or gold but just to wear     unspotted raiment    to mr john bartlett  who had sent me a sevenpound trout  fit for an abbot of theleme   for the whole cardinals college or the pope himself to see in dream before his lenten vision gleam   he lies there the sogdologer  his precious flanks with stars besprent   worthy to swim in castaly the friend by whom such gifts are sent for him shall bumpers full be spent   his health be luck his fast ally  i see him trace the wayward brook   amid the forest mysteries where at their shades shy aspens look or where with many a gurgling crook   it croons its woodland histories  i see leafshade and sunfleck lend   their tremulous sweet vicissitude to smooth dark pool to crinkling bend oh stew him ann as twere your friend   with amorous solicitude  i see him step with caution due   soft as if shod with moccasins grave as in church for who plies you sweet craft is safe as in a pew   from all our common stock o sins  the unerring fly i see him cast   that as a roseleaf falls as soft a flash a whirl he has him fast we tyros how that struggle last   confuses and appalls us oft  unfluttered he calm as the sky   looks on our tragicomedies this way and that he lets him fly a sunbeamshuttle then to die   lands him with cool aplomb at ease  the friend who gave our board such gust   lifes care may he oerstep it half and when death hooks him as he

    10   while soul could still transfigure sense and thrill as with loves first caress at lifes mere unexpectedness   days when my blood would leap and run     as full of sunshine as a breeze     or spray tossed up by summer seas   that doubts if it be sea or sun days that flew swiftly like the band   that played in grecian games at strife and passed from eager hand to hand                  20

every mortal door  nymph of the unreturning feet   how may i win thee back but no   i do thee wrong to call thee so tis i am changed not thou art fleet the man thy presence feels again not in the blood but in the brain spirit that lovst the upper air serene and passionless and rare   such as on mountain heights we find                40   and wideviewed uplands of the mind or such as scorns to coil and sing round any but the eagles wing   of souls that with long upward beat   have won an undisturbed retreat where poised like wingèd victories they mirror in relentless eyes   the life broadbasking neath their feet man ever with his now at strife   pained with first gasps of earthly air            50   then praying death the last to spare still fearful of the ampler life  not unto them dost thou consent   who passionless can lead at ease a life of unalloyed content   a life like that of landlocked seas who feel no elemental gush of tidal forces no fierce rush   of storm

plunging vessel thrown   grazing the tusked lee shore the cliff that oer the abrupt gorge holds its breath   where the frail hairbreadth of an if is all that sunders life and death these too are cared for and round these bends her mild crook thy sister peace              70   these in unvexed dependence lie   each neath his strip of household sky oer these clouds wander and the blue hangs motionless the whole day through   stars rise for them and moons grow large and lessen in such tranquil wise as joys and sorrows do that rise   within their natures sheltered marge their hours into each other flit   like the leafshadows of the vine                 80 and figtree under which they sit   and their still lives to heaven incline with an unconscious habitude   unhistoried as smokes that rise from happy hearths and sight elude   in kindred blue of morning skies  wayward when once we feel thy lack tis worse than vain to woo thee back   yet there is one who seems to be thine elder sister in whose eyes                   90 a faint far northern light will rise   sometimes and bring a dream of thee she is not that for which youth hoped   but she hath blessings all her own thoughts pure as lilies newly oped   and faith to sorrow given alone almost i deem that it is thou come back with graver matron brow   with deepened eyes and bated breath   like one that somewhere hath met death          100 but no she answers i am she whom the gods love tranquillity   that other whom you seek forlorn   half earthly was but i am born of the immortals and our race wears still some sadness on its face   he wins me late but keeps me long who dowered with every gift of passion in that fierce flame can forge and fashion   of sin and self the anchor strong               110 can

flashed fainter then wholly faded   before we had passed the wood but the light of the face behind it   went with me and stayed for good  the vision of scarce a moment   and hardly marked at the time

lest he wrong the new moons mirrored skiff he slides along   full without noise and whispers in his reeds  with loving breath of all the winds his name   is blown about the world but to his friends a sweeter secret hides behind his fame and love steals shyly through the loud acclaim   to murmur a god bless you and there ends  as i muse backward up the checkered years   wherein so much was given so much was lost blessings in both kinds such as cheapen tears but hush this is not for profaner ears   let them drink molten pearls nor dream the cost  some suck up poison from a sorrows core   as naught but nightshade grew upon earths ground love turned all his to heartsease and the more fate tried his bastions she but forced a door   leading to sweeter manhood and more sound  even as a

went of a life lived somewhere i know not   in what diviner sphere of memories that stay not and go not   like music heard once by an ear     that cannot forget or reclaim it a something so shy it would shame it   to make it a show a something too vague could i name it   for others to know as if i had lived it or dreamed it as if i had acted or schemed it             long ago  and yet could i live it over   this life that stirs in my brain could i be both maiden and lover moon and tide bee and clover   as i seem to have been once again could i but speak it and show it   this pleasure more

frank delight in all it sees nor was earth voiceless nor the mystic sky to him the lifelong friend of fields and trees then came the prose of the suburban street its silence deepened by our echoing feet and converse such as rambling hazard finds     340 then he who many cities knew and many minds and men once worldnoised now mere ossian forms of misty memory bade them live anew as when they

ceremonious haze   forcing hard outlines mercilessly close   our social monotone of level days     might make our best seem banishment        but it was nothing so     haply this instinct might divine

wiser to credit   the fire in my feet than your nay    scherzo  when the down is on the chin and the goldgleam in the hair when the birds their sweethearts win and champagne is in the air love is here

half he seemed to let them half forbid and wrapped him so in humors sheath on sheath twas hard to guess the mellow soul beneath but once divined you took him to your heart while he appeared to bear with you as part of lifes impertinence and once a year betrayed his true self by a smile or tear           10 or rather something sweetly shy and loath withdrawn ere fully shown and mixed of both a cynic not precisely one who thrust against a heart too prone to love and trust who so despised false sentiment he knew scarce in himself to part the false and true and strove to hide by rougheningoer the skin those cobweb nerves he could not dull within gentle by birth but of a stem decayed he shunned lifes rivalries and hated trade         20 on a small patrimony and larger pride he lived uneaseful on the other side so he called europe only coming west to give his oldworld appetite new zest yet still the new world spooked it in his veins a ghost he could not lay with all his pains for never pilgrims offshoot scapes control of those old instincts that have shaped his soul a radical in thought he puffed away with shrewd contempt the dust of usage gray         30 yet loathed democracy as one who saw in what he longed to love some vulgar flaw and shocked through all his delicate reserves remained a tory by his taste and nerves his fancys thrall he drew all ergoes thence and thought himself the type of common sense misliking women not from cross or whim but that his mother shared too much in him and he half felt that what in them was grace made the unlucky weakness of his race              40 what powers he had he hardly cared to know but sauntered through the world as through a show a critic fine in his haphazard way a sort of mild la bruyère on halfpay for comic weaknesses he had an eye keen as an acid for an alkali yet you could feel through his sardonic tone he loved them all unless they were his own you might have called him with his humorous twist a kind of human entomologist     50 as these bring home from every walk they take their hatcrowns stuck with bugs of curious make so he filled all the lining of his head with characters impaled and ticketed and had a cabinet behind his eyes for all they caught of mortal oddities he might have been a poetmany worse but that he had or feigned contempt of verse called it tattooing language and held rhymes the young worlds lullaby of ruder times     60 bitter in words too indolent for gall he satirized himself the first of all in men and their affairs could find no law and was the ill logic that he thought he saw

the south with sweet concessions fell it dwelt retired and half had grown to be as aboriginal as rock or tree it nestled close to earth and seemed to brood oer homely thoughts in a halfconscious mood

place and pulled extempore a sunday face too smugly proper for a world of sin like boys on whom the minister comes in the table fronting you with icy stare strove to look witless that its legs were bare while the black sofa with its horsehair pall gloomed like a bier for comforts funeral          300 each piece appeared to do its chilly best to seem an utter stranger to the rest as if acquaintanceship were deadly sin like britons meeting in a foreign inn two portraits graced the wall in grimmest truth mister and mistress w in their youth new england youth that seems a sort of pill

investment in longprayer                470 a pious man and thrifty too he made the psalms and prophets partners in his trade and in his orthodoxy straitened more as it enlarged the business at his store he honored moses but when gain he planned had his own notion of the promised land  soon as the winter made the sledding good from far around the farmers hauled him wood for all the trade had

papers  lowell took occasion when collecting in a book the several numbers of the second series of biglow papers which had appeared in the atlantic monthly to prefix an essay which not only gave a personal narrative of the origin of the whole scheme but particularly dwelt upon the use in literature of the homely dialect in which the poems were couched in this cabinet edition it has seemed expedient to print the introduction here rather than in immediate connection with the poems themselves  though prefaces seem of late to have fallen under some reproach they have at least this advantage that they set us again on the feet of our personal consciousness and rescue us from the gregarious mockmodesty or cowardice of that we which shrills feebly throughout modern literature like the shrieking of mice in the walls of a house that has passed its prime having a few words to say to the many friends whom the biglow papers have won me i shall accordingly take the freedom of the first person singular of the personal pronoun let each of the goodnatured unknown who have cheered me by the written communication of their sympathy look upon this introduction as a private letter to himself  when more than twenty years ago i wrote the first of the series i had no definite plan and no intention of ever writing another thinking the mexican war as i think it still a national crime committed in behoof of slavery our common sin and wishing to put the feeling of those who thought as i did in a way that would tell i imagined to myself such an upcountry man as i had often seen at antislavery gatherings capable of districtschool english but always instinctively falling back into the natural stronghold of his homely dialect when heated to the point of selfforgetfulness when i began to carry out my conception and to write in my assumed character i found myself in a strait between two perils on the one hand i was in danger of being carried beyond the limit of my own opinions or at least of that temper with which every man should speak his mind in print and on the other i feared the risk of seeming to vulgarize a deep and sacred conviction i needed on occasion to rise above the level of mere patois and for this purpose conceived the rev mr wilbur who should express the more cautious element of the new england character and its pedantry as mr biglow should serve for its homely commonsense vivified and heated by conscience the parson was to be the complement rather than the antithesis of his parishioner and i felt or fancied a certain humorous element in the real identity of the two under a seeming incongruity mr wilburs fondness for scraps of latin though drawn from the life i adopted deliberately to heighten the contrast finding soon after that i needed some one as a mouthpiece of the mere drollery for i conceive that true humor is never divorced from moral conviction i invented mr sawin for the clown of my little puppetshow i meant to embody in him that halfconscious unmorality which i had noticed as the recoil in gross natures from a puritanism that still strove to keep in its creed the intense savor which had long gone out of its faith and life in the three i thought i should find room enough to express as it was my plan to do the popular feeling and opinion of the time for the names of two of my characters since i have received some remonstrances from very worthy persons who happen to bear them i would say that they were purely fortuitous probably mere unconscious memories of signboards or directories mr sawins sprang from the accident of a rhyme at the end of his first epistle and i purposely christened him by the impossible surname of birdofredum not more to stigmatize him as the incarnation of manifest destiny in other words of national recklessness as to right and wrong than to avoid the chance of wounding any private sensitiveness  the success of my experiment soon began not only to astonish me but to make me feel the responsibility of knowing that i held in my hand a weapon instead of the mere fencingstick i had supposed very far from being a popular author under my own name so far indeed as to be almost unread i found the verses of my pseudonym copied everywhere saw them pinned up in workshops i heard them quoted and their authorship debated i once even when rumor had at length caught up my name in one of its eddies had the satisfaction of overhearing it demonstrated in the pauses of a concert that i was utterly incompetent to have written anything of the kind i had read too much not to know the utter worthlessness of contemporary reputation especially as regards satire but i knew also that by giving a certain amount of influence it also had its worth if that influence were used on the right side i had learned too that the first requisite of good writing is to have an earnest and definite purpose whether æsthetic or moral and that even good writing to please long must have more than an average amount either of imagination or commonsense the first of these falls to the lot of scarcely one in several generations the last is within the reach of many in every one that passes and of this an author may fairly hope to become in part the mouthpiece if i put on the cap and bells and made myself one of the courtfools of king demos it was less to make his majesty laugh than to win a passage to his royal ears for certain serious things which i had deeply at heart i say this because there is no imputation that could be more galling to any mans selfrespect than that of being a mere jester i endeavored by generalising my satire to give it what value i could beyond the passing moment and the immediate application how far i have succeeded i cannot tell but i have had better luck than i ever looked for in seeing my verses survive to pass beyond their nonage  in choosing the yankee dialect i did not act without forethought it had long seemed to me that the great vice of american writing and speaking was a studied want of simplicity that we were in danger of coming to look on our mothertongue as a dead language to be sought in the grammar and dictionary rather than in the heart and that our only chance of escape was by seeking it at its living sources among those who were as scottowe says of majorgeneral gibbons divinely illiterate president lincoln the only really great public man whom these latter days have seen was great also in this that he was masterwitness his speech at gettysburgof a truly masculine english classic because it was of no special period and level at once to the highest and lowest of his countrymen i learn from the highest authority that his favorite reading was in shakespeare and milton to which of course the bible should be added but whoever should read the debates in congress might fancy himself present at a meeting of the city council of some city of southern gaul in the decline of the empire where barbarians with a latin varnish emulated each other in being more than ciceronian whether it be want of culture for the highest outcome of that is simplicity or for whatever reason it is certain that very few american writers or speakers wield their native language with the directness precision and force that are common as the day in the mother country we use it like scotsmen not as if it belonged to us but as if we wished to prove that we belonged to it by showing our intimacy with its written rather than with its spoken dialect and yet all the while our popular idiom is racy with life and vigor and originality bucksome as milton used the word to our new occasions and proves itself no mere graft by sending up new suckers from the old root in spite of us it is only from its roots in the living generations of men that a language can be reinforced with fresh vigor for its needs what may be called a literate dialect grows ever more and more pedantic and foreign till it becomes at last as unfitting a vehicle for living thought as monkish latin that we should all be made to talk like books is the danger with which we are threatened by the universal schoolmaster who does his best to enslave the minds and memories of his victims to what he esteems the best models of english composition that is to say to the writers whose style is faultily correct and has no bloodwarmth in it no language after it has faded into diction none that cannot suck up the feeding juices secreted for it in the rich motherearth of common folk can bring forth a sound and lusty book true vigor and heartiness of phrase do not pass from page to page but from man to man where the brain is kindled and the lips suppled by downright living interests and by passion in its very throe language is the soil of thought and our own especially is a rich

could bear no weight of meaning whatever nor is fine writing by any means confined to america all writers without imagination fall into it of necessity whenever they attempt the figurative i take two examples from mr merivales history of the romans under the empire which indeed is full of such the last years of the age familiarly styled the augustan were singularly barren of the literary glories from which its celebrity was chiefly derived one by one the stars in its firmament had been lost to the world virgil and horace etc had long since died the charm which the imagination of livy had thrown over the earlier annals of rome had ceased to shine on the details of almost contemporary history and if the flood of his eloquence still continued flowing we can hardly suppose that the stream was as rapid as fresh and as clear as ever i will not waste time in criticising the bad english or the mixture of metaphor in these sentences but will simply cite another from the same author which is even worse the shadowy phantom of the republic continued to flit before the eyes of the cæsar there was still he apprehended a germ of sentiment existing on which a scion of his own house or even a stranger might boldly throw himself and raise the standard of patrician independence now a ghost may haunt a murderer but hardly i should think to scare him with the threat of taking a new lease of its old tenement and fancy the scion of a house in the act of throwing itself upon a germ of sentiment to raise a standard i am glad since we have so much in the same kind to answer for that this bit of horticultural rhetoric is from beyond sea i would not be supposed to condemn truly imaginative prose there is a simplicity of splendor no less than of plainness and prose would be poor indeed if it could not find a tongue for that meaning of the mind which is behind the meaning of the words it has sometimes seemed to me that in england there was a growing tendency to curtail language into a mere convenience and to defecate it of all emotion as thoroughly as algebraic signs this has arisen no doubt in part from that healthy national contempt of humbug which is characteristic of englishmen in part from that sensitiveness to the ludicrous which makes them so shy of expressing feeling but in part also it is to be feared from a growing distrust one might almost say hatred of whatever is supermaterial there is something sad in the scorn with which their journalists treat the notion of there being such a thing as a national ideal seeming utterly to have forgotten that even in the affairs of this world the imagination is as much matteroffact as the understanding if we were to trust the impression made on us by some of the cleverest and most characteristic of their periodical literature we should think england hopelessly stranded on the goodhumored cynicism of welltodo middleage and should fancy it an enchanted nation doomed to sit forever with its feet under the mahogany in that afterdinner mood which follows conscientious repletion and which it is illmanners to disturb with any topics more exciting than the quality of the wines but there are already symptoms that a large class of englishmen are getting weary of the dominion of consols and divine commonsense and to believe that eternal three per cent is not the chief end of man nor the highest and only kind of interest to which the powers and opportunities of england are entitled  the quality of exaggeration has often been remarked on as typical of american character and especially o£ american humor in dr petris gedrängtes handbuch der fremdwörter we are told that the word humbug is commonly used for the exaggerations of the northamericans to be sure one would be tempted to think the dream of columbus half fulfilled and that europe had found in the west a nearer way to orientalism at least in diction but it seems tome that a great deal of what is set down as mere extravagance is more fitly to be called intensity and picturesqueness symptoms ol the imaginative faculty in full health and strength though producing as yet only the raw and formless material in which poetry is to work by and by perhaps the world will see it fashioned into poem and picture and europe which will be hard pushed for originality erelong may have to thank us for a new sensation the french continue to find shakespeare exaggerated because he treated english just as our countryfolk do when they speak of a steep price or say that they freeze to a thing the first postulate of an original literature is that a people should use their language instinctively and unconsciously as if it were a lively part of their growth and personality not as the mere torpid boon of education or inheritance even burns contrived to write very poor verse and prose in english vulgarisms are often only poetry in the egg the late mr horace mann in one of his public addresses commented at some length on the beauty and moral significance ol the french phrase sorienter and called on his young friends to practise upon it in life there was not a yankee in his audience whose problem had not always been to find out what was about east and to shape his course accordingly this charm which a familiar expression gains by being commented as it were and set in a new light by a foreign language is curious and instructive i cannot help thinking that mr matthew arnold forgets this a little too much sometimes when he writes of the beauties of french style it would not be hard to find in the works of french academicians phrases as coarse as those he cites from burke only they are veiled by the unfamiliarity of the language but however this may be it is certain that poets and peasants please us in the same way by translating words back again to their primal freshness and infusing them with a delightful strangeness which is anything but alienation what for example is miltons edge of battle but a doing into english of the latin acies was die gans gedacht das der schwan vollbracht what the goose but thought that the swan full brought or to desaxonize it a little what the goose conceived that the swan achieved and it may well be that the life invention and vigor shown by our popular speech and the freedom with which it is shaped to the instant want of those who use it are of the best omen for our having a swan at last the part i have taken on myself is that of the humbler bird  but it is affirmed that there is something innately vulgar in the yankee dialect m saintebeuve says with his usual neatness je définis un patois une ancienne langue qui a eu des malheurs ou encore une langue toute jeune st qui na pas fait fortune the first part of his definition applies to a dialect like the provençal the last to the tuscan before dante had lifted it into a classic and neither it seems to me will quite fit a patois which is not properly a dialect but rather certain archaisms proverbial phrases and modes of pronunciation which maintain themselves among the uneducated side by side with the finished and universally accepted language norman french for example or scotch down to the time of james vi could hardly be called patois while i should be half inclined to name the yankee a lingo rather than a dialect it has retained a few words now fallen into disuse in the mother country like to tarry to progress fleshy fall and some others it has changed the meaning of some as in freshet and it has clung to what i suspect to have been the broad norman pronunciation of e which molière puts into the mouth of his rustics in such words as sarvant parfect vartoo and the like it maintains something of the french sound of a also in words like chamber danger though the latter had certainly begun to take its present sound so early as 1636 when i find it sometimes spelt dainger but in general it may be said that nothing can be found in it which does not still survive in some one or other of the english provincial dialects there is perhaps a single exception in the verb to sleeve to sleeve silk means to divide or ravel out a thread of silk with the point of a needle till it becomes floss as sléfan to cleavedivide this i think explains the sleeveless errand in troilus and cressida so inadequately sometimes so ludicrously darkened by the commentators is not a sleeveless errand one that cannot be unravelled incomprehensible and therefore bootless  i am not speaking now of americanisms properly so called that is of words or phrases which have grown into use here either through necessity invention or accident such as a carry a onehorse affair a prairie to vamose even these are fewer than is sometimes taken for granted but i think some fair defence may be made against the charge of vulgarity properly speaking vulgarity is in the thought and not in the word or the way of pronouncing it modern french the most polite of languages is barbarously vulgar if compared with the latin out of which it has been corrupted or even with italian there is a wider gap and one implying greater boorishness between ministerium and métier or sapiens and sachant than between druv and drove or agin and against which last is plainly an arrant superlative our rustic coverlid is nearer its french original than the diminutive coverlet into which it has been ignorantly corrupted in politer speech i obtained from three cultivated englishmen at different times three diverse pronunciations of a single wordcowcumber coocumber and cucumber of these the first which is yankee also comes nearest to the nasality of concombre lord ossory assures us that voltaire saw the best society in england and voltaire tells his countrymen that handkerchief was pronounced hankercher i find it so spelt in hakluyt and elsewhere this enormity the yankee still persists in and as there is always a reason for such deviations from the sound as represented by the spelling may we not suspect two sources of derivation and find an ancestor for kercher in couverture rather than in couvrechef and what greater phonetic vagary which dryden by the way called fegary in our lingua rustica than this ker for couvre i copy from the flyleaves of my books where i have noted them from time to time a few examples of pronunciation and phrase which will show that the yankee often has antiquity and very respectable literary authority on his side my list might be largely increased by referring to glossaries but to them eyery one can go for himself and i have gathered enough for my purpose  i will take first those cases in which something like the french sound has been preserved in certain single letters and diphthongs and this opens a curious question as to how long this gallicism maintained itself in england sometimes a divergence in pronunciation has given as two words with different meanings as in genteel and jaunty which i find coming in toward the close of the seventeenth century and wavering between genteel and jantee it is usual in america to drop the u in words ending in oura very proper change recommended by howell two centuries ago and carried out by him so far as his printers would allow this and the corresponding changes in musique musick and the like which he also advocated show that in his time the french accent indicated by the superfluous letters for french had once nearly as strong an accent as italian had gone out of use there is plenty of french accent down to the end of elizabeths reign in daniel we have riches and counsel in bishop hall comet chapëlain in donne pictures virtue presence mortal merit hainous giant with many more and marstons satires are full of them the two latter however are not to be relied on as they may be suspected of chaucerizing herrick writes baptime the tendency to throw the accent backward began early but the incongruities are perplexing and perhaps mark the period of transition in warners albions england we have creator and crëature side by side with the modern creator and creature envy and envying occur in campion 1602 and yet envy survived milton in some cases we have gone back again nearer to the french as in revenue for revenue i had been so used to hearing imbecile pronounced with the accent on the first syllable which is in accordance with the general tendency in such matters that i was surprised to find imbecile in a verse of wordsworth the dictionaries all give it so i asked a highly cultivated englishman and he declared for imbeceel in general it may be assumed that accent will finally settle on the syllable dictated by greater ease and therefore quickness of utterance blasphemous for example is more rapidly pronounced than blasphemous to which our yankee clings following in this the usage of many of the older poets american is easier than american and therefore the false quantity has carried the day though the true one may be found in george herbert and even so late as cowley  to come back to the matter in hand our uplandish man retains the soft or thin sound of the u in some words such as rule truth sometimes also pronounced truth not trooth while he says noo for new and gives to view and few so indescribable a mixture of the two sounds with a slight nasal tincture that it may be called the yankee shibboleth voltaire says that the english pronounce true as if it rhymed with view and this is the sound our rustics give to it spenser writes deow dew which can only be pronounced with the yankee nasality in rule the least sound of a precedes the u i find reule in pecocks repressor he probably pronounced it rayoolë as the old french word from which it is derived was very likely to be sounded at first with a reminiscence of its original regula tindal has reuler and the coventry plays have preudent in the parlyament of byrdes i find reule as for noo may it not claim some sanction in its derivation whether from nouveau or neuf the ancient sound of which may very well have been noof as nearer novus beef would seem more like to have come from buffe than from boeuf unless the two were mere varieties of spelling the saxon few may have caught enough from its french cousin peu to claim the benefit of the same doubt as to sound and our slang phrase a few as i licked him a few may well appeal to un peu for sense and authority nay might not lick itself turn out to be the good old word lam in an english disguise it the latter should claim descent as perhaps he fairly might from the latin lambere the new england ferce for fierce and perce for pierce sometimes heard as fairce and pairce are also norman for its antiquity i cite the rhyme of verse and pierce in chapman and donne and in some commendatory verses by a mr berkenhead before the poems of francis beaumont our pairlous for perilous is of the same kind and is nearer shakespeares parlous than the modern pronunciation one other gallicism survives in our pronunciation perhaps i should rather call it a semigallicism for it is the result of a futile effort to reproduce a french sound with english lips thus for joint employ royal we have jynt emply ryle the last differing only from rile roil in a prolongation of the y sound i find royal so pronounced in the mirror for magistrates in walter de biblesworth i find solives englished by gistes this it is true may have been pronounced jeests but the pronunciation jystes must have preceded the present spelling which was no doubt adopted after the radical meaning was forgotten as analogical with other words in oi in the same way after normanfrench influence had softened the l out of would we already find woud for veut in nf poems should followed the example and then an l was foisted into could where it does not belong to satisfy the logic of the eye which has affected the pronunciation and even the spelling of english more than is commonly supposed i meet with eyster for oyster as early as the fourteenth century i find viage in bishop hall and middleton the dramatist bile for boil in donne and chrononhotonthologos line for loin in hall ryall and chyse for choice dystrye for destroy in the coventry plays in chapmans all fools is the misprint of employ for imply fairly inferring an identity of sound in the last syllable indeed this pronunciation was habitual till after pope and rogers tells us that the elegant gray said naise for noise just as our rustics still do our cornish which i find also in herrick remembers the french better than cornice does while clinging more closely to the anglosaxon in dropping the g from the end of the present participle the yankee now and then pleases himself with an experiment in french nasality in words ending in n it is not so far as my experience goes very common though it may formerly have been more so capting for instance i never heard save in jest the habitual form being keppn but at any rate it is no invention of ours in that delightful old volume ane compendious buke of godly and spirituall songs in which i know not whether the piety itself or the simplicity of its expression be more charming i find burding garding and cousing and in the state

sigh were as i am inclined to think so sounded shew is used by hector boece giles fletcher drummond of hawthornden and in the paston letters similar strong preterites like snew thew and even mew are not without example i find sew for sewed in piers ploughman indeed the anomalies in english preterites are perplexing we have probably transferred flew from flow as the preterite of which i have heard it to fly because we had another preterite in fled of weak preterites the yankee retains growed blowed for which he has good authority and less often knowed his sot is merely a broad sounding of sat no more inelegant than the common got for gat which he further degrades into gut when he says darst he uses a form as old as chaucer  the yankee has retained something of the long sound of the a in such words as axe wax pronouncing them exe wex shortened from aix waix he also says hev and hed have had for have and had in most cases he follows an anglosaxon usage in aix for axle he certainly does

english literature and why not illy mr bartlett says it is a word used by writers of an inferior class who do not seem to perceive that ill is itself an adverb without the termination ly and quotes dr mosser president of brown university as asking triumphantly why dont you say welly i should like to have had dr messer answer his own question it would be truer to say that it was used by people who still remembered that ill was an adjective the shortened form of evil out of which shakespeare and the translators of the bible ventured to make evilly this slurred evil is the dram of eale in hamlet i find illy in warner the objection to illy is not an etymological one but simply that it is contrary to good usagea very sufficient reason ill as an adverb was at first a vulgarism precisely like the rustics when he says i was treated bad may not the reason of this exceptional form be looked for in that tendency to dodge what is hard to pronounce to which i have already alluded if the letters were distinctly uttered as they should be it would take too much time to say illly wellly and it is to be observed that we have avoided smally26 and tally in the same way though we add ish to them without hesitation in smallish and tallish we have to be sure dully and fully but for the one we prefer stupidly and the other though this may have come from eliding the y before as is giving way to full the uneducated whose utterance is slower still make adverbs when they will by adding like to all manner of adjectives we have had big charged upon us because we use it where an englishman would now use

because it was once as universal in english as it still is in the neolatin languages where it does not strike us as vulgar i am not sure that the loss of it is not to be regretted but surely i shall admit the vulgarity of slurring or altogether eliding certain terminal consonants i admit that a clear and sharpcut enunciation is one of the crowning charms and elegances of speech words so uttered

the dropping of final consonants disagreeable in allan ramsay or burns nor do i believe that our literary ancestors were sensible of that inelegance in the fusing them together of which we are conscious how many educated men pronounce the t in chestnut how many say pentise for penthouse as they should when a yankee skipper says that he is boun for gloster not gloucester with the leave of

compliment to the verb bind with which it has nothing to do if we consider the root of the word though of course i grant that every race has a right to do what it will with what is so peculiarly its own as its speech the d has no more right there than at the end of gone where it is often put by children who are our best guides to the sources of linguistic corruption and the best teachers of its processes cromwell minister of henry viii writes worle for world chapman has wan for wand and lawn has rightfully displaced laund though with no thought i suspect of etymology rogers tells us that lady bathurst sent him some letters written to william iii by queen mary in which she addresses him as dear husban the old form expoun which our farmers use is more correct than the form with a barbarous d tacked on which has taken its place of the kind opposite to this like our gownd for gown and the london cockneys wind for wine i find drownd for drown in the misfortunes of arthur 1584 and in swift and by the way whence came the long sound of wind which our poets still retain and which survives in winding a horn a totally different word from winding a kitestring we say behind and hinder comparative and yet to hinder shakespeare pronounced kind kind or what becomes of his play on that word and kin in hamlet nay did he not even shall i dare to hint it drop the final d as the yankee still does john lilly plays in the same way on kindred and kindness     but to come to some other ancient instances warner rhymes bounds with crowns grounds with towns text with sex worst with crust interrupts with cups drayton defects with sex chapman amends with cleanse webster defects with checks ben jonson minds with combines marston trust and obsequious clothes and shows dryden gives the same sound to clothes and has also minds with designs of course i do not affirm that their ears may not have told them that these were imperfect rhymes though i am by no means sure even of that but they surely would never have tolerated any such had they suspected the least vulgarity in them prior has the rhyme first and trust but puts it into the mouth of a landlady swift has stunted and burnt it an intentionally imperfect rhyme no doubt but which i cite as giving precisely the yankee pronunciation of burned donne couples in unhallowed wedlock after and matter thus seeming to give to both the true yankee sound and it is not uncommon to find after and daughter worse than all in one of dodsleys old plays we have onions rhyming with minionsi have tears in my eyes while i record it and yet what is viler than the universal misses mrs for mistress this was once a vulgarism and in the miseries of inforced marriage the rhyme printed as prose in dodsleys old plays by collier  to make my young mistress delighting in kisses  is put into the mouth of the clown our people say injun for indian the tendency to make this change where i follows d is common the italian giorno and french jour from diurnus are familiar examples and yet injun is one of those depravations which the taste challenges peremptorily though it have the authority of charles cottonwho rhymes indies with cringesand four english lexicographers beginning with dr sheridan bid us say invidgeous yet after all it is no worse than the debasement which all our terminations in tion and tience have undergone which yet we hear with resignashun and payshunce though it might have aroused both impatience and indignation in shakespeares time when george herbert tells us that if the sermon be dull  god takes a text and preacheth patience  the prolongation of the word seems to convey some hint at the longanimity of the virtue consider what a poor curtal we have made of ocean there was something of his heave and expanse in ocean and fletcher knew how to use it when he wrote so fine a verse as the second of these the best deepsea verse i know    in desperate storms stem with a little rudder   the tumbling ruins of the oceän  oceanus was not then wholly shorn of his divine proportions and our modern oshun sounds like the gush of smallbeer in comparison some other contractions of ours have a vulgar air about them more n for more than as one of the worst may stand for a type of such yet our old dramatists are full of such obscurations elisions they can hardly be called of the th making wher of whether where of whither here of hither bror of brother smor of smother mor of mother and so on and dear brer rabbit can i forget him indeed it is this that explains the word rare which has drydens support and which we say of meat where an englishman would use underdone i do not believe with the dictionaries that it had ever anything to do with the icelandic hrar raw as it plainly has not in rareripe which means earlier ripepresident lincoln said of a precocious boy that he was a rareripe and i do not believe it for this reason that the earliest form of the word with us was and the commoner now in the inland parts still is so far as i can discover raredone golding has egs reererosted which whatever else it mean cannot mean rawroasted i find rather as a monosyllable in donne and still better as giving the sound rhyming with fair in warner there is an epigram of sir thomas browne in which the words rather than make a monosyllable    what furie ist to take deaths part   and rather than by nature die by art  the contraction moren i find in the old play fuimus troes in a verse where the measure is so strongly accented as to leave it beyond doubt    a golden crown whose heirs   more than half the world subdue  it may be however that the contraction is in thorld it is unmistakable in the second maidens tragedy                  it were but folly   dear soul to boast of more than i can perform  is our gin for given more violent than marl for marvel which was once common and which i find as late as herrick nay herrick has gin spelling it gen too as do the scotch who agree with us likewise in preferring chimly to chimney  i will now leave pronunciation and turn to words or phrases which have been supposed peculiar to us only pausing to pick up a single dropped stitch in the pronunciation of the word súpreme which i had thought native till i found it in the welllanguaged daniel i will begin with a word of which i have never met with any example in any english writer of authority we express the first stage of withering in a green plant suddenly cut down by the verb to wilt it is of course own cousin of the german welken but i have never come upon it in literary use and my own books of reference give me faint help graff gives welhèn marcescere and refers to weih weak and conjecturally to as hvelan the as wealwian to wither is nearer but not so near as two words in the icelandic which perhaps put us on the track of its ancestryvelgi tepefacere and velki with the derivative meaning contaminare wilt at any rate is a good word filling as it does a sensible gap between drooping and withering and the imaginative phrase he wilted right down like he caved right in is a true americanism wilt occurs in english provincial glossaries but is explained by wither which with us it does not mean we have a few words such as cache cohog carry portage shoot chute timber forest bushwhack to pull a boat along by the bushes on the edge of a stream buckeye a picturesque word for the horsechestnut but how many can we be said to have fairly brought into the language as alexander gill who first mentions americanisms meant it when he said sed et ab americanis nonnulla mutuamur ut maiz et canoa very few i suspect and those mostly by borrowing from the french german spanish or indian28 the dipper for the great bear strikes me as having a native air bogus in the sense of worthless is undoubtedly ours but is i more than suspect a corruption of the french bagasse from low latin bagasea which travelled up the mississippi from new orleans where it was used for the refuse of the sugarcane it is true we have modified the meaning of some words we use freshet in the sense of flood for which i have not chanced upon any authority our new england cross between ancient pistol and dugald dalgetty captain underhill uses the word 1638 to mean a current and i do not recollect it elsewhere in that sense i therefore leave it with a for future explorers crick for creek i find in captain john smith and in the dedication of fullers holy warre and run meaning a small stream in waymouths voyage 1605 humans for men which mr bartlett includes in his dictionary of americanisms is chapmans habitual phrase in his translation of homer i find it also in the old play of the hog hath lost his pearl dogs for andirons is still current in new england and in walter de biblesworth i find chiens glossed in the margin by andirons gunning for shooting is in drayton we once got credit for the poetical word fall for autumn but mr bartlett and the last edition of websters dictionary refer us to dryden it is even older for i find it in drayton and bishop hall has autumn fall middleton plays upon the word mayst thou have a reasonable good spring for thou art like to have many dangerous foul falls daniel does the same and coleridge uses it as we do gray uses the archaism picked for peaked and the word smudge as our backwoodsmen do for a smothered fire lord herbert of cherbury more properly perhaps than even sidney the last preux chevalier has the emperors folks just as a yankee would say it loan for lend with which we have hitherto been blackened i must retort upon the mother island for it appears so long ago as in albions england fleshy in the sense of stout may claim ben jonsons warrant and i find it also so lately as in francklins lucian chore is also jonsons word and i am inclined to prefer it to chare and char because i think that i see a more natural origin for it in the french jourwhence it might come to mean a days work and thence a jobthan anywhere else29 at onst for at once i thought a corruption of our own till i found it in the chester plays i am now inclined to suspect it no corruption at all but only an erratic and obsolete superlative at onest to progress was flung in our teeth till mr pickering retorted with shakespeares doth prógress down thy cheeks i confess that i was never satisfied with this answer because the accent was different and because the word might here be reckoned a substantive quite as well as a verb mr bartlett in his dictionary above cited adds a surrebutter in a verse from fords broken heart here the word is clearly a verb but with the accent unhappily still on the first syllable mr bartlett says that he cannot say whether the word was used in bacons time or not it certainly was and with the accent we give to it ben jonson in the alchemist had this verse    progress so from extreme unto extreme  and sir philip sidney    progressing then from fair turias golden place  surely we may now sleep in peace and our english cousins will forgive us since we have cleared ourselves from any suspicion of originality in the matter even after i had convinced myself that the chances were desperately against our having invented any of the americanisms with which we are faulted and which we are in the habit of voicing there were one or two which had so prevailingly indigenous an accent as to stagger me a little one of these was the biggest thing out alas even this slender comfort is denied me old gower has     so harde an herte was none oute  and    that such merveile was none oute  he also by the way says a sighte of flowres as naturally as our upcountry folk would say it poor for lean thirds for dower and dry for thirsty i find in middletons plays dry is also in skelton and in the world 1754 in a note on middleton mr dyce thinks it needful to explain the phrase i cant tell universal in america by the gloss i could not say middleton also uses sneeked which i had believed an americanism till i saw it there it is of course only another form of snatch analogous to theek and thatch cf the proper names dekker and thacher break brack and breach make still common with us and match long on for occasioned by who is this long on occurs constantly in gower and likewise in middleton cause why is in chaucer raising an english version of the french leaven for yeast is employed by gayton in his festivous notes on don quixote i have never seen an instance of our new england word emptins in the same sense nor can i divine its original gayton has limekill also shuts for shutters and the latter is used by mrs hutchinson in her life of colonel hutchinson bishop hall and purchas in his pilgrims have chist for chest and it is certainly nearer cista as well as to its form in the teutonic languages whence probably we got it we retain the old sound from cist but chest is as old as chaucer lovelace says wropt for wrapt musicianer i had always associated with the militiamusters of my boyhood and too hastily concluded it an abomination of our own but mr wright calls it a norfolk word and i find it to be as old as 1642 by an extract in collier not worth the time of day had passed with me for native till i saw it in shakespeares pericles for slick which is only a shorter sound of sleek like crick and the now universal britches for breeches i will only call chapman and jonson thats a sure card and thats a stinger both sound like modern slang but you will find the one in the old interlude of thersytes 1537 and the other in middleton right here a favorite phrase with our orators and with a certain class of our editors turns up passim in the chester and coventry plays mr dickens found something very ludicrous in what he considered our neologism right away but i find a phrase very like it and which i would gladly suspect to be a misprint for it in gammer gurton    lyght it and bring it tite away  but tite is the true word in this case after all what is it but another form of straightway cussedness meaning wickedness malignity and cuss a sneaking illnatured fellow in such phrases as he done it out o pure cussedness and he is a nateral cuss have been commonly thought yankeeisms to vent certain contemptuously indignant moods they are admirable in their roughandready way but neither is our own cursydnesse in the same sense of malignant wickedness occurs in the coventry plays and cuss may perhaps claim to have come in with the conqueror at least the term is also french saint simon uses it and confesses its usefulness speaking of the abbé dubois he says qui étoit en plein ce quun mauvais françois appelle un sacre mais qui ne se peut guere exprimer autrement not worth a cuss though supported by not worth a damn may be a mere corruption since not worth a cress is in piers ploughman i dont see it was the popular slang a year or two ago and seemed to spring from the soil but no it is in cibbers careless husband green sauce for vegetables i meet in beaumont and fletcher gayton and elsewhere our rustic pronunciation sahce for either the diphthong au was anciently pronounced ah or else we have followed abundant analogy in changing it to the latter sound as we have in chance dance and so many more may be the older one and at least gives some hint at its ancestor salsa warn in the sense of notify is i believe now peculiar to us but pecock so employs it i find primmer primer as we pronounce it in beaumont and fletcher and a square eater too compare our square meal heft for weight and muchness in the mirror for magistrates bankbill in swift and fielding and as for that i might say passim to cotton to is i rather think an americanism the nearest approach to it i have found is cotton together in congreves love for love to cotton or cotten in another sense is old and common our word means to cling and its origin possibly is to be sought in another direction perhaps in as cvead which means mud clay both proverbially clinging or better yet in the icelandic qvoda otherwise kód meaning resin and glue which are greek kat exochaen sticky substances to spit cotton is i think american and also perhaps to flax for to beat to the halves still survives among us though apparently obsolete in england it means either to let or to hire a piece of land receiving half the profit in money or in kind partibus locare i mention it because in a note by some english editor to which i have lost my reference i have seen it wrongly explained the editors of nares cite burton to put in the sense of to go as put for begone would seem our own and yet it is strictly analogous to the french se mettre à la voie and the italian mettersi in via indeed dante has a verse    io sarei for mi sarei già messo per lo sentiero  which but for the indignity might be translated    i should ere this have put along the way  i deprecate in advance any share in general bankss notions of international law but we may all take a just pride in his exuberant eloquence as something distinctively american when he spoke a few years ago of letting the union slide even those who for political purposes reproached him with the sentiment admired the indigenous virtue of his phrase yet i find let the world slide in heywoods edward iv and in beaumont and fletchers wit without money valentine says            will you go drink   and let the world slide  so also in sidneys arcadia    let his dominion slide  in the one case it is put into the mouth of a clown in the other of a gentleman and was evidently proverbial it has even higher sanction for chaucer writes    well nigh all other curës let he slide  mr bartlett gives above ones bend as an americanism but compare hamlets to the top of my bent in his tracks for immediately has acquired an american accent and passes where he can for a native but is an importation nevertheless for what is he but the latin e vestigio or at best the norman french eneslespas both which have the same meaning hotfoot provincial also in england i find in the old romance of tristan    si sen parti chaut pas  like for as is never used in new england but is universal in the south and west it has on its side the authority of two kings ego sum rex romanorum et supra grammaticam henry viii and charles i this were ample without throwing into the scale the scholar and poet daniel them was used as a nominative by the majesty of edward vi by sir p hoby and by lord paget in froudes history i have never seen any passage adduced where guess was used as the yankee uses it the word was familiar in the mouths of our ancestors but with a different shade of meaning from that we have given it which is something like rather think though the yankee implies a confident certainty by it when he says i guess i du there are two examples in otway one of which so in the struggle i guess the note was lost perhaps might serve our purpose and coleridges    i guess twas fearful there to see  certainly comes very near but i have a higher authority than either in selden who in one of his notes to the polyolbion writes the first inventor of them i guess you dislike not the addition was one berthold swartz here he must mean by it i take it for granted robert greene in his quip for an upstart courtier makes clothbreeches say but i gesse your maistership never tried what true honor meant in this case the word seems to be used with a meaning precisely like that which we give it another peculiarity almost as prominent is the beginning sentences especially in answer to questions with well put before such a phrase as how de do it is commonly short and has the sound of it wul but in reply it is deliberative and the various shades of meaning which can be conveyed by difference of intonation and by prolonging or abbreviating i should vainly attempt to describe i have heard ooaahl wahl ahl wal and something nearly approaching the sound of the le in able sometimes before i it dwindles to a mere l as l i dunno a friend of mine why should i not please myself though i displease him by brightening my page with the initials of the most exquisite of humorists jh told me that he once heard five wells like pioneers precede the answer to an inquiry about the price of land the first was the ordinary wul in deference to custom the second the long perpending ooahl with a falling inflection of the voice the third the same but with the voice rising as if in despair of a conclusion into a plaintively nasal whine the fourth wulh ending in the aspirate of a sigh and then fifth came a short sharp wal showing that a conclusion had been reached i have used this latter form in the biglow papers because if enough nasality be added it represents most nearly the average sound of what i may call the interjection  a locution prevails in the southern and middle states which is so curious that though never heard in new england i will give a few lines to its discussion the more readily because it is extinct elsewhere i mean the use of allow in the sense of affirm as i allow thats a good horse i find the word so used in 1558 by anthony jenkinson in hakluyt corne they sowe not neither doe eate any bread mocking the christians for the same and disabling our strengthe saying we live by eating the toppe of a weede and drinke a drinke made of the same allowing theyr great devouring of flesh and drinking of milke to be the increase of theyr strength that is they undervalued our strength and affirmed their own to be the result of a certain diet in another passage of the same narrative the word has its more common meaning of approving or praising the said king much allowing this declaration said ducange quotes bracton sub voce adlocare for the meaning to admit as proved and the transition from this to affirm is by no means violent izaak walton has lebault allows waterfrogs to be good meat and here the word is equivalent to affirms at the same time when we consider some of the meanings of allow in old english and of allouer in old french and also remember that the verbs prize and praise are from one root i think we must admit allaudare to a share in the paternity of allow the sentence from hakluyt would read equally well contemning our strengthe  and praising or valuing their great eating of flesh as the cause of their increase in strength after all if we confine ourselves to allocare it may turn out that the word was somewhere and somewhen used for to bet analogously to put up put down post cf spanish apostar and the like i hear boys in the street continually saying i bet thats a good horse or what not meaning by no means to risk anything beyond their opinion in the matter  the word improve in the sense of to occupy make use of employ as dr pickering defines it he long ago proved to be no neologism he would have done better i think had he substituted profit by for employ he cites dr franklin as saying that the word had never so far as he knew been used in new england before he left it in 1723 except in dr mathers bemarkable providences which he oddly calls a very old book franklin as dr pickering goes on to show was mistaken  mr bartlett in his dictionary merely abridges pickering both of them should have confined the application of the word to material things its extension to which is all that is peculiar in the supposed american use of it for surely complete letterwriters have been improving this opportunity time out of mind i will illustrate the word a little further because pickering cites no english authorities skelton has a passage in his phyllyp sparowe which i quote the rather as it contains also the word allowed and as it distinguishes improve from employ    his chaucers englysh well alowed   so as it is emprowed   for as it is employd   there is no english voyd  here the meaning is to profit by in fullers holy warre 1647 we have the egyptians standing on the firm ground were thereby enabled to improve and enforce their darts to the utmost here the word might certainly mean to make use of mrs hutchison life of colonel h uses the word in the same way and therefore did not emproove his interest to engage the country in the quarrel swift in one of his letters says there is not an acre of land in ireland turned to half its advantage yet it is better improved than the people i find it also in strength out of weakness 1652 and plutarchs morals1714 but i know of only one example of its use in the purely american sense and that is a very good improvement for a mill in the state trials speech of the attorney general in the lady ivys case 1864 in the sense of employ i could cite a dozen old english authorities  in running over the flyleaves of those delightful folios for this reference i find a note which reminds me of another word for our abuse of which we have been deservedly ridiculed i mean lady it is true i might cite the example of the italian donna30 domina which has been treated in the same way by a whole nation and not as lady among us by the uncultivated only it perhaps grew into use in the halfdemocratic republics of italy in the same way and for the same reasons as with us but i admit that our abuse of the word is villainous i know of an orator who once said in a public meeting where bonnets preponderated that the ladies were last at the cross and first at the tomb but similar sins were committed before our day and in the mother country in the harleian miscellany vol v p 455 i find this lady is my servant the hedgers daughter ioan in the state trials i learn of a gentlewoman that lives cook with such a one and i hear the lord high steward speaking of the wife of a waiter at a bagnio as a gentlewoman from the same authority by the way i can state that our vile habit of chewing tobacco had the somewhat unsavory example of titus oates and i know by tradition from an eyewitness that the elegant general burgoyne partook of the same vice howell in one of his letters dated 26 august 1623 speaks thus of another institution which many have thought american they speak much of that boisterous bishop of halverstadt for so they term him here that having taken a place where ther were two monasteries of nuns and friers he causd divers featherbeds to be ripd and all the feathers to be thrown in a great hall whither the nuns and friers were thrust naked with their bodies oild and pitchd and to tumble among the feathers howell speaks as if the thing were new to him and i know not if the boisterous bishop was the inventor of it but i find it practised in england before our revolution  before leaving the subject i will add a few comments made from time to time on the margin of mr bartletts excellent dictionary to which i am glad thus publicly to acknowledge my many obligations avails is good old english and the vails of sir joshua reynoldss porter are famous averse from averse to and in connection with them the english vulgarism different to the corrupt use of to in these cases as well as in the yankee he lives to salem to home and others must be a very old one for in the one case it plainly arose from confounding the two french prepositions à from latin ad and ab and in the other from translating the first of them i once thought different to a modern vulgarism and mr thackeray on my pointing it out to him in henry esmond confessed it to be an anachronism mr bartlett refers to the old writers quoted in richardsons dictionary for different to though in my edition of that work all the examples are with from but i

unquestionably german laufen is pronounced lofen in some parts of germany and i once heard one german student say to another ich lauf lofe hier bis du wiederkehrest and he began accordingly to saunter up and down in short to loaf to mull mr bartlett says means to soften to dispirit and quotes from margaretthere has been a pretty considerable mullin going on among the doctorswhere it surely cannot mean what he says it does we have always heard mulling used for stirring bustling sometimes in an underhand way it is a metaphor derived probably from mulling wine and the word itself must be a corruption of mell from of mesler pair of stairs is in hakluyt to pull up stakes is in curwens journal and therefore prerevolutionary i think i have met with it earlier raise under this word mr bartlett omits to raise a house that is the frame of a wooden one and also the substantive formed from it a raisin retire for go to bed is in fieldings amelia settingpoles cannot be new for i find some set the boats with long poles in hakluyt shoulderhitters i find that shoulderstriker is old though i have lost the reference to my authority snag is no new word though perhaps the western

drunken man  it is always worth while to note down the erratic words or phrases which one meets with in any dialect they may throw light on the meaning of other words on the relationship of languages or even on history itself in so composite a language as ours they often supply a different form to express a different shade of meaning as in viol and fiddle thrid and thread smother and smoulder where the l has crept in by a false analogy with would we have given back to england the excellent adjective lengthy formed honestly like earthy drouthy and others thus enabling their journalists to characterize our presidents messages by a word civilly compromising between long and tedious so as not to endanger the peace of the two countries by wounding our national sensitiveness to british criticism let me give two curious examples of the antiseptic property of dialects at which i have already glanced dante has dindi as a childish or low word for danari money and in shropshire small roman coins are still dug up which the peasants call dinders this can hardly be a chance coincidence but seems rather to carry the word back to the roman soldiery so our farmers say chuk chuk to their pigs and ciacco is one of the italian words for hog when a countryman tells us that he fell all of a heap i cannot help thinking that he unconsciously points to an affinity between our word tumble and the latin tumulus that is older than most others i believe that words or even the mere intonation of them have an astonishing vitality and power of propagation by the root like the gardeners pest quitchgrass31 while the application or combination of them may be new it is in these last that my countrymen seem to me full of humor invention quickness of wit and that sense of subtle analogy which needs only refining to become fancy and imagination prosaic as american life seems in many of its aspects to a european bleak and bare as it is on the side of tradition and utterly orphaned of the solemn inspiration of antiquity i cannot help thinking that the ordinary talk of unlettered men among us is fuller of metaphor and of phrases that suggest lively images than that of any other people i have seen very many such will be found in mr bartletts book though his short list of proverbs at the end seem to me with one or two exceptions as unamerican as possible most of them have no character at all but coarseness and are quite too longskirted for working proverbs in which language always takes off its coat to it as a yankee would say there are plenty that have a more native and puckery

of wood as the house whose underpinnin come up to the eaves and called hell the place where they didnt rake up their fires nights i once asked a stagedriver if the other side of a hill were as steep as the one we were climbing steep chain lightnin couldn go down it thout puttin the shoe on and this brings me back to the exaggeration of which i spoke before to me there is something very taking in the negro so black that charcoal made a chalkmark on him and the wooden shingle painted so like marble that it sank in water as if its very consciousness or its vanity had been overpersuaded by the cunning of the painter i heard a man in order to give a notion of some very cold weather say to another that a certain joe who had been taking mercury found a lump of quicksilver in each boot when he went home to dinner this power of rapidly dramatizing a dry fact into flesh and blood and the vivid conception of joe as a human thermometer strike me as showing a poetic sense that may be refined into faculty at any rate there is humor here and not mere quickness of witthe deeper and not the shallower quality the tendency of humor is always towards overplus of expression while the very essence of wit is its logical precision captain basil hall denied that our people had any humor deceived perhaps by their gravity of manner but this very seriousness is often the outward sign of that humorous quality of the mind which delights in finding an element of identity in things seemingly the most incongruous and then again in forcing an incongruity upon things identical perhaps captain hall had no humor himself and if so he would never find it did he always feel the point of what was said to himself i doubt it because i happen to know a chance he once had given him in vain the captain was walking up and down the veranda of a country tavern in massachusetts while the coach changed horses a thunderstorm was going on and with that pleasant european air of indirect selfcompliment in condescending to be surprised by american merit which we find so conciliating he said to a countryman lounging against the door pretty heavy thunder you have here the other who had divined at a glance his feeling of generous concession to a new country drawled gravely waal we du considerin the number of inhabitants this the more i analyze it the more humorous does it seem the same man was capable of wit also when he would he was a cabinetmaker and was once employed to make some commandmenttables for the parish meetinghouse the parson a very old man annoyed him by looking into his workshop every morning and cautioning him to be very sure to pick out clear mahogany without any knots in it at last wearied out he retorted one day wal dr b i guess ef i was to leave the nots out o some o the cmanments tould soot you full ez wal      if i had taken the pains to write down the proverbial or pithy phrases i have heard or if i had sooner thought of noting the yankeeisms i met with in my reading i might have been able to do more justice to my theme but i have done all i wished in respect to pronunciation if i have proved that where we are vulgar we have the countenance of very good company for as to the jus et norma loquendi i agree with horace and those who have paraphrased or commented him from boileau to gray i think that a good rule for style is galianis definition of sublime oratorylart de tout dire sans être mis à la bastille dans un pays où il est defendu de rien dire i profess myself a fanatical purist but with a hearty contempt for the speechgilders who affect purism without any thorough or even pedagogic knowledge of the engendure growth and affinities of the noble language about whose mésalliances they profess like dean alford to be so solicitous if they had their way doch es sey says lessing dass jene gotbische höflichkeit eine unentbehrliche tugend des heutigen umganges ist soll sie darum unsere schriften eben so schaal und falsch machen als unsern umgang and drayton was not far wrong in affirming that    tis possible to climb   to kindle or to slake     although in skeltons rhyme  cumberland in his memoirs tells us that when in the midst of admiral rodneys great seafight sir charles douglas said to him behold sir george the greeks and trojans contending for the body of patroclus the admiral answered peevishly damn the greeks and damn the trojans i have other things to think of after the battle was won rodney thus to sir charles now my dear friend i am at the service of your greeks and trojans and the whole of homers iliad or as much of it as you please i had some such feeling of the impertinence of our pseudoclassicality when i chose our homely dialect to work in should we be nothing because somebody had contrived to be something and that perhaps in a provincial dialect ages ago and to be nothing by our very attempt to be that something which they had already been and which therefore nobody could be again without being a bore is there no way left then i thought of being natural of being naïf which means nothing more than native of belonging to the age and country in which you are born the yankee at least is a new phenomenon let us try to be that it is perhaps a pis aller but is not no thoroughfare written up everywhere else in the literary world things seemed to me very much as they were in the latter half of the last century pope skimming the cream of good sense and expression wherever he could find it had made not exactly poetry but an honest salable butter of worldly wisdom which pleasantly lubricated some of the drier morsels of lifes daily bread and seeing this scores of harmlessly insane people went on for the next fifty years coaxing his buttermilk with the regular up and down of the pentameter churn and in our day do we not scent everywhere and even carry away in our clothes against our will that faint perfume of musk which mr tennyson has left behind him or worse of heines patchouli and might it not be possible to escape them by turning into one of our narrow new england lanes shut in though it were by bleak stone walls on either hand and where no better flowers were to be gathered than goldenrod and hardhack  beside the advantage of getting out of the beaten track our dialect offered others hardly inferior as i was about to make an endeavor to state them i remembered something that the clearsighted goethe had said about hebels allemannische gedichte which making proper deduction for special reference to the book under review expresses what i would have said far better than i could hope to do allen diesen innern guten eigenschaften kommt die behagliche naive sprache sehr zu statten man findet mehrere sinnlich bedeutende and wohlklingende worte  von einem zwei buchstaben abbreviationen contractionen viele kurze leichte sylben neue reime welches mehr als man glaubt ein vortheil für den dichter ist diese elemente werden durch glückliche constructionen und lebhafte formen zu einem styl zusammengedrängt der zu diesem zwecke vor unserer büchersprache grosse vorzüge hat of course i do not mean to imply that i have come near achieving any such success as the great critic here indicates but i think the success is there and to be plucked by some more fortunate hand  nevertheless i was encouraged by the approval of many whose opinions i valued with a feeling too tender and grateful to be mixed with any vanity i mention as one of these the late ah clough who more than any one of those i have known no longer living except hawthorne impressed me with the constant presence of that indefinable thing we call genius he often suggested that i should try my hand at some yankee pastorals which would admit of more sentiment and a higher tone without foregoing the advantage offered by the dialect i have never completed anything of the kind but in this second series both my remembrance of his counsel and the deeper feeling called up by the great interests at stake led me to venture some passages nearer to what is called poetical than could have been admitted without incongruity into the former series the time seemed calling to me with the old poet    leave then your wonted prattle     the oaten reed forbear   for i hear a sound of battle     and trumpets rend the air  the only attempt i had ever made at anything like a pastoral if that may be called an attempt which was the result almost of pure accident was in the courtin while the introduction to the first series was going through the press i received word from the printer that there was a blank page left which must be filled i sat down at once and improvised another fictitious notice of the press in which because verse would fill up space more cheaply than prose i inserted an extract from a supposed ballad of mr biglow i kept no copy of it and the printer as directed cut it off when the gap was filled presently i began to receive letters asking for the rest of it sometimes for the balance of it i had none but to answer such demands i patched a conclusion upon it in a later edition those who had only the first continued to importune me afterward being asked to write it out as an autograph for the baltimore sanitary commission fair i added other verses into some of which i fused a little more sentiment in a homely way and after a fashion completed it by sketching in the characters and making a connected story most likely i have spoiled it but i shall put it at the end of this introduction to answer once for all those kindly importunings  as i have seen extracts from what purported to be writings of mr biglow which were not genuine i may properly take this opportunity to say that the two volumes now published contain every line i ever printed under that pseudonyme and that i have never so far as i can remember written an anonymous article elsewhere than in the north american review and the atlantic monthly during my editorship of it except a review of mrs stowes ministers wooing and some twenty years ago a sketch of the antislavery movement in america for an english journal  a word more on pronunciation i have endeavored to express this so far as i could by the types taking such pains as i fear may sometimes make the reading harder than need be at the same time by studying uniformity i have sometimes been obliged to sacrifice minute exactness the emphasis often modifies the habitual sound for example for is commonly fer a shorter sound than fur for far but when emphatic it always becomes for as wut for so too is pronounced like to as it was anciently spelt and to like ta the sound as in the tou of touch but too when emphatic changes into tue and to sometimes in similar cases into toe as i didn hardly know wut toe du where vowels come together or one precedes another following an aspirate the two melt together as was common with the older poets who formed their versification on french or italian models drayton is thoroughly yankee when he says i xpect and pope when he says t inspire with becomes sometimes ith uth or th or even disappears wholly where it comes before the as i went along th square along with the squire the are sound being an archaism which i have noticed also in choir like the old scottish quhair33 herrick has of flowers neer sucked by th theeving bee without becomes athout and thout afterwards always retains its locative s and is pronounced always ahterwurds with a strong accent on the last syllable this oddity has some support in the erratic towards instead of towards which we find in the poets and sometimes hear the sound given to the first syllable of towards i may remark sustains the yankee lengthening of the o in to at the beginning of a sentence ahterwurds has the accent on the first syllable at the end of one on the last as ahterwurds he tol me he tol me ahterwurds the yankee never makes a mistake in his aspirates u changes in many words to e always in such brush tush hush rush blush seldom in much oftener in trust and crust never in mush gust bust tumble or  flush in the latter case probably to avoid confusion with flesh i have heard flush with the e sound however for the same reason i suspect never in gush at least i never heard it because we have already one gesh for gash a and i short frequently become e short u always becomes o in the prefix un except unto and o in return changes to u short in uv for of and in some words beginning with om t and d b and p v and w remain intact so much occurs to me in addition to what i said on this head in the preface to the former volume    of course in what i have said i wish to be understood as keeping in mind the difference between provincialisms properly so called and slang slang is always vulgar because it is not a natural but an affected way of talking and all mere tricks of speech or writing are offensive i do not think that mr biglow can be fairly charged with vulgarity and i should have entirely failed in my design if i had not made it appear that high and even refined sentiment may coexist with the shrewder and more comic elements of the yankee character i believe that what is essentially vulgar and meanspirited in politics seldom has its source in the body of the people but much rather among those who are made timid by their wealth or selfish by their love of power a democracy can afford much better than an aristocracy to follow out its convictions and is perhaps better qualified to build those convictions on plain principles of right and wrong rather than on the shifting sands of expediency i had always thought sam slick a libel on the yankee character and a complete falsification of yankee modes of speech though for aught i know it may be true in both respects so far as the british provinces are concerned to me the dialect was native was spoken all about me when a boy at a time when an irish daylaborer was as rare as an american one now since then i have made a study of it so far as opportunity allowed but when i write in it it is as in a mother tongue and i am carried back far beyond any studies of it to longago noonings in my fathers hayfields and to the talk of sam and job over their jug of blackstrap under the shadow of the ashtree which still dapples the grass whence they have been gone so long  but life is short and prefaces should be and so my good friends to whom this introductory epistle is addressed farewell though some of you have remonstrated with me i shall never write any more biglow papers however great the temptationgreat especially at the present timeunless it be to complete the original plan of this series by bringing out mr sawin as an original union man the very favor with which they have been received is a hindrance to me by forcing on me a selfconsciousness from which i was entirely free when i wrote the first series moreover i am no longer the same careless youth with nothing to do but live to myself my books and my friends that i was then i always hated politics in the ordinary sense of the word and i am not likely to grow fonder of them now that i have learned how rare it is to find a man who can keep principle clear from party and personal prejudice or can conceive the possibility of anothers doing so i feel as if i could in some sort claim to be an emeritus and i am sure that political satire will have full justice done it by that genuine and delightful humorist the rev petroleum v nasby i regret that i killed off mr wilbur so soon for he would have enabled me to bring into this preface a number of learned quotations which must now go abegging and also enabled me to dispersonalize myself into a vicarious egotism he would have helped me likewise in clearing myself from a charge which i shall briefly touch on because my friend mr hughes has found it needful to defend me in his preface to one of the english editions of the biglow papers i thank mr hughes heartily for his friendly care of my good name and were his preface accessible to my readers here as i am glad it is not for its partiality makes me blush i should leave the matter where he left it the charge is of profanity brought in by persons who proclaimed african slavery of divine institution and is based so far as i have heard on two passages in the first series    an youve gut to git up airly     ef you want to take in god  and    godll send the bill to you  and on some scriptural illustrations by mr sawin  now in the first place i was writing under an assumed character and must talk as the person would whose mouthpiece i made myself will any one familiar with the new england countryman venture to tell me that he does not speak of sacred things familiarly that biblical allusions allusions that is to the single book with whose language from his churchgoing habits he is intimate are not frequent on his lips if so he cannot have pursued his studies of the character on so many longago musterfields and at so many cattleshows as i but i scorn any such line of defence and will confess at once that one of the things i am proud of in my countrymen is i am not speaking now of such persons as i have assumed mr sawin to be that they do not put their maker away far from them or interpret the fear of god into being afraid of him the talmudists had conceived a deep truth when they said that all things were in the power of god save the fear of god and when people stand in great dread of an invisible power i suspect they mistake quite another personage for the deity i might justify myself for the passages criticised by many parallel ones from scripture but i need not the reverend homer wilburs notebooks supply me with three apposite quotations the first is from a father of the roman church the second from a father of the anglican and the third from a father of modern english poetry the puritan divines would furnish me with many more such st bernard says sapiens nummularius est deus nummum fictum non recipiet a cunning moneychanger is god he will take in no base coin latimer says you shall perceive that god by this example shaketh us by the noses and taketh us by the ears familiar enough both of them one would say but i should think mr biglow had verily stolen the last of the two maligned passages from drydens don sebastian where i find    and beg of heaven to charge the bill on me  and there i leave the matter being willing to believe that the saint the martyr and even the poet were as careful of gods honor as my critics are ever likely to be     ii glossary to the biglow papers
