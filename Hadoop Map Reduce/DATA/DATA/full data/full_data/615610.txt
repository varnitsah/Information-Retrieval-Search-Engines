615610	wessex tales   contents  preface an imaginative woman the three strangers the withered arm fellowtownsmen interlopers at the knap the distracted preacher     preface   an apology is perhaps needed for the neglect of contrast which is shown by presenting two consecutive stories of hangmen in such a small collection as the following  but in the neighbourhood of countytowns tales of executions used to form a large proportion of the local traditions and though never personally acquainted with any chief operator at such scenes the writer of these pages had as a boy the privilege of being on speaking terms with a man who applied for the office and who sank into an incurable melancholy because he failed to get it some slight mitigation of his grief being to dwell upon striking episodes in the lives of those happier ones who had held it with success and renown  his tale of disappointment used to cause some wonder why his ambition should have taken such an unfortunate form but its nobleness was never questioned  in those days too there was still living an old woman who for the cure of some eating disease had been taken in her youth to have her blood turned by a convicts corpse in the manner described in the withered arm  since writing this story some years ago i have been reminded by an aged friend who knew rhoda brook that in relating her dream my forgetfulness has weakened the facts our of which the tale grew  in reality it was while lying down on a hot afternoon that the incubus oppressed her and she flung it off with the results upon the body of the original as described  to my mind the occurrence of such a vision in the daytime is more impressive than if it had happened in a midnight dream readers are therefore asked to correct the misrelation which affords an instance of how our imperfect memories insensibly formalize the fresh originality of living factfrom whose shape they slowly depart as machinemade castings depart by degrees from the sharp handwork of the mould  among the many devices for concealing smuggled goods in caves and pits of the earth that of planting an appletree in a tray or box which was placed over the mouth of the pit is i believe unique and it is detailed in one of the tales precisely as described by an old carrier of tubsa man who was afterwards in my fathers employ for over thirty years  i never gathered from his reminiscences what means were adopted for lifting the tree which with its roots earth and receptacle must have been of considerable weight  there is no doubt however that the thing was done through many years  my informant often spoke too of the horribly suffocating sensation produced by the pair of spirittubs slung upon the chest and back after stumbling with the burden of them for several miles inland over a rough country and in darkness  he said that though years of his youth and young manhood were spent in this irregular business his profits from the same taken all together did not average the wages he might have earned in a steady employment whilst the fatigues and risks were excessive  i may add that the first story in the series turns upon a physical possibility that may attach to women of imaginative temperament and that is well supported by the experiences of medical men and other observers of such manifestations  t h april 1896     an imaginative woman   when william marchmill had finished his inquiries for lodgings at a well known wateringplace in upper wessex he returned to the hotel to find his wife  she with the children had rambled along the shore and marchmill followed in the direction indicated by the militarylooking hallporter  by jove how far youve gone  i am quite out of breath marchmill said rather impatiently when he came up with his wife who was reading as she walked the three children being considerably further ahead with the nurse  mrs marchmill started out of the reverie into which the book had thrown her  yes she said youve been such a long time  i was tired of staying in that dreary hotel  but i am sorry if you have wanted me will  well i have had trouble to suit myself  when you see the airy and comfortable rooms heard of you find they are stuffy and uncomfortable will you come and see if what ive fixed on will do  there is not much room i am afraid hut i can light on nothing better  the town is rather full  the pair left the children and nurse to continue their ramble and went back together  in age wellbalanced in personal appearance fairly matched and in domestic requirements conformable in temper this couple differed though even here they did not often clash he being equable if not lymphatic and she decidedly nervous and sanguine  it was to their tastes and fancies those smallest greatest particulars that no common denominator could be applied  marchmill considered his wifes likes and inclinations somewhat silly she considered his sordid and material  the husbands business was that of a gunmaker in a thriving city northwards and his soul was in that business always the lady was best characterized by that superannuated phrase of elegance a votary of the muse  an impressionable palpitating creature was ella shrinking humanely from detailed knowledge of her husbands trade whenever she reflected that everything he manufactured had for its purpose the destruction of life she could only recover her equanimity by assuring herself that some at least of his weapons were sooner or later used for the extermination of horrid vermin and animals almost as cruel to their inferiors in species as human beings were to theirs  she had never antecedently regarded this occupation of his as any objection to having him for a husband  indeed the necessity of getting lifeleased at all cost a cardinal virtue which all good mothers teach kept her from thinking of it at all till she had closed with william had passed the honeymoon and reached the reflecting stage  then like a person who has stumbled upon some object in the dark she wondered what she had got mentally walked round it estimated it whether it were rare or common contained gold silver or lead were a clog or a pedestal everything to her or nothing  she came to some vague conclusions and since then had kept her heart alive by pitying her proprietors obtuseness and want of refinement pitying herself and letting off her delicate and ethereal emotions in imaginative occupations daydreams and nightsighs which perhaps would not much have disturbed william if he had known of them  her figure was small elegant and slight in build tripping or rather bounding in movement  she was darkeyed and had that marvellously bright and liquid sparkle in each pupil which characterizes persons of ellas cast of soul and is too often a cause of heartache to the possessors male friends ultimately sometimes to herself  her husband was a tall longfeatured man with a brown beard he had a pondering regard and was it must be added usually kind and tolerant to her  he spoke in squarely shaped sentences and was supremely satisfied with a condition of sublunary things which made weapons a necessity  husband and wife walked till they had reached the house they were in search of which stood in a terrace facing the sea and was fronted by a small garden of windproof and saltproof evergreens stone steps leading up to the porch  it had its number in the row but being rather larger than the rest was in addition sedulously distinguished as coburg house by its landlady though everybody else called it thirteen new parade the spot was bright and lively now but in winter it became necessary to place sandbags against the door and to stuff up the keyhole against the wind and rain which had worn the paint so thin that the priming and knotting showed through  the householder who bad been watching for the gentlemans return met them in the passage and showed the rooms  she informed them that she was a professional mans widow left in needy circumstances by the rather sudden death of her husband and she spoke anxiously of the conveniences of the establishment  mrs marchmill said that she liked the situation and the house but it being small there would not be accommodation enough unless she could have all the rooms  the landlady mused with an air of disappointment  she wanted the visitors to be her tenants very badly she said with obvious honesty but unfortunately two of the rooms were occupied permanently by a bachelor gentleman  he did not pay season prices it was true but as he kept on his apartments all the year round and was an extremely nice and interesting young man who gave no trouble she did not like to turn him out for a months let even at a high figure  perhaps however she added he might offer to go for a time  they would not hear of this and went back to the hotel intending to proceed to the agents to inquire further  hardly had they sat down to tea when the landlady called  her gentleman she said had been so obliging as to offer to give up his rooms for three or four weeks rather than drive the newcomers away  it is very kind but we wont inconvenience him in that way said the marchmills  o it wont inconvenience him i assure you said the landlady eloquently  you see hes a different sort of young man from mostdreamy solitary rather melancholyand he cares more to be here when the southwesterly gales are beating against the door and the sea washes over the parade and theres not a soul in the place than he does now in the season  hed just as soon be where in fact hes going temporarily to a little cottage on the island opposite for a change she hoped therefore that they would come  the marchmill family accordingly took possession of the house next day and it seemed to suit them very well  after luncheon mr marchmill strolled out towards the pier and mrs marchmill having despatched the children to their outdoor amusements on the sands settled herself in more completely examining this and that article and testing the reflecting powers of the mirror in the wardrobe door  in the small back sittingroom which had been the young bachelors she found furniture of a more personal nature than in the rest  shabby books of correct rather than rare editions were piled up in a queerly reserved manner in corners as if the previous occupant had not conceived the possibility that any incoming person of the seasons bringing could care to look inside them  the landlady hovered on the threshold to rectify anything that mrs marchmill might not find to her satisfaction  ill make this my own little room said the latter because the books are here  by the way the person who has left seems to have a good many he wont mind my reading some of them mrs hooper i hope  o dear no maam  yes he has a good many  you see he is in the literary line himself somewhat  he is a poetyes really a poetand he has a little income of his own which is enough to write verses on but not enough for cutting a figure even if he cared to  a poet  o i did not know that  mrs marchmill opened one of the books and saw the owners name written on the titlepage  dear me she continued i know his name very wellrobert treweof course i do and his writings  and it is his rooms we have taken and him we have turned out of his home  ella marchmill sitting down alone a few minutes later thought with interested surprise of robert trewe  her own latter history will best explain that interest  herself the only daughter of a struggling man of letters she had during the last year or two taken to writing poems in an endeavour to find a congenial channel in which to let flow her painfully embayed emotions whose former limpidity and sparkle seemed departing in the stagnation caused by the routine of a practical household and the gloom of bearing children to a commonplace father these poems subscribed with a masculine pseudonym had appeared in various obscure magazines and in two cases in rather prominent ones  in the second of the latter the page which bore her effusion at the bottom in smallish print bore at the top in large print a few verses on the same subject by this very man robert trewe  both of them had in fact been struck by a tragic incident reported in the daily papers and had used it simultaneously as an inspiration the editor remarking in a note upon the coincidence and that the excellence of both poems prompted him to give them together  after that event ella otherwise john ivy had watched with much attention the appearance anywhere in print of verse bearing the signature of robert trewe who with a mans unsusceptibility on the question of sex had never once thought of passing himself off as a woman  to be sure mrs marchmill had satisfied herself with a sort of reason for doing the contrary in her case that nobody might believe in her inspiration if they found that the sentiments came from a pushing tradesmans wife from the mother of three children by a matteroffact smallarms manufacturer  trewes verse contrasted with that of the rank and file of recent minor poets in being impassioned rather than ingenious luxuriant rather than finished  neither symboliste nor decadent he was a pessimist in so far as that character applies to a man who looks at the worst contingencies as well as the best in the human condition  being little attracted by excellences of form and rhythm apart from content he sometimes when feeling outran his artistic speed perpetrated sonnets in the loosely rhymed elizabethan fashion which every rightminded reviewer said he ought not to have done  with sad and hopeless envy ella marchmill had often and often scanned the rival poets work so much stronger as it always was than her own feeble lines  she had imitated him and her inability to touch his level would send her into fits of despondency  months passed away thus till she observed from the publishers list that trewe had collected his fugitive pieces into a volume which was duly issued and was much or little praised according to chance and had a sale quite sufficient to pay for the printing  this step onward had suggested to john ivy the idea of collecting her pieces also or at any rate of making up a book of her rhymes by adding many in manuscript to the few that had seen the light for she had been able to get no great number into print  a ruinous charge was made for costs of publication a few reviews noticed her poor little volume but nobody talked of it nobody bought it and it fell dead in a fortnightif it had ever been alive  the authors thoughts were diverted to another groove just then by the discovery that she was going to have a third child and the collapse of her poetical venture had perhaps less effect upon her mind than it might have done if she had been domestically unoccupied  her husband had paid the publishers bill with the doctors and there it all had ended for the time  but though less than a poet of her century ella was more than a mere multiplier of her kind and latterly she had begun to feel the old afflatus once more  and now by an odd conjunction she found herself in the rooms of robert trewe  she thoughtfully rose from her chair and searched the apartment with the interest of a fellowtradesman  yes the volume of his own verse was among the rest  though quite familiar with its contents she read it here as if it spoke aloud to her then called up mrs hooper the landlady for some trivial service and inquired again about the young man  well im sure youd be interested in him maam if you could see him only hes so shy that i dont suppose you will  mrs hooper seemed nothing loth to minister to her tenants curiosity about her predecessor lived here long  yes nearly two years  he keeps on his rooms even when hes not here the soft air of this place suits his chest and he likes to be able to come back at any time  he is mostly writing or reading and doesnt see many people though for the matter of that he is such a good kind young fellow that folks would only be too glad to be friendly with him if they knew him  you dont meet kindhearted people every day  ah hes kindhearted    and good  yes hell oblige me in anything if i ask him  mr trewe i say to him sometimes you are rather out of spirits  well i am mrs hooper hell say though i dont know how you should find it out why not take a little change i ask  then in a day or two hell say that he will take a trip to paris or norway or somewhere and i assure you he comes back all the better for it  ah indeed  his is a sensitive nature no doubt  yes  still hes odd in some things  once when he had finished a poem of his composition late at night he walked up and down the room rehearsing it and the floors being so thinjerrybuilt houses you know though i say it myselfhe kept me awake up above him till i wished him further    but we get on very well  this was but the beginning of a series of conversations about the rising poet as the days went on  on one of these occasions mrs hooper drew ellas attention to what she had not noticed before minute scribblings in pencil on the wallpaper behind the curtains at the head of the bed  o let me look said mrs marchmill unable to conceal a rush of tender curiosity as she bent her pretty face close to the wall  these said mrs hooper with the manner of a woman who knew things are the very beginnings and first thoughts of his verses  he has tried to rub most of them out but you can read them still  my belief is that he wakes up in the night you know with some rhyme in his head and jots it down there on the wall lest he should forget it by the morning  some of these very lines you see here i have seen afterwards in print in the magazines  some are newer indeed i have not seen that one before  it must have been done only a few days ago  o yes      ella marchmill flushed without knowing why and suddenly wished her companion would go away now that the information was imparted  an indescribable consciousness of personal interest rather than literary made her anxious to read the inscription alone and she accordingly waited till she could do so with a sense that a great store of emotion would be enjoyed in the act  perhaps because the sea was choppy outside the island ellas husband found it much pleasanter to go sailing and steaming about without his wife who was a bad sailor than with her  he did not disdain to go thus alone on board the steamboats of the cheaptrippers where there was dancing by moonlight and where the couples would come suddenly down with a lurch into each others arms for as he blandly told her the company was too mixed for him to take her amid such scenes  thus while this thriving manufacturer got a great deal of change and seaair out of his sojourn here the life external at least of ella was monotonous enough and mainly consisted in passing a certain number of hours each day in bathing and walking up and down a stretch of shore  but the poetic impulse having again waxed strong she was possessed by an inner flame which left her hardly conscious of what was proceeding around her  she had read till she knew by heart trewes last little volume of verses and spent a great deal of time in vainly attempting to rival some of them till in her failure she burst into tears  the personal element in the magnetic attraction exercised by this circumambient unapproachable master of hers was so much stronger than the intellectual and abstract that she could not understand it  to be sure she was surrounded noon and night by his customary environment which literally whispered of him to her at every moment but he was a man she had never seen and that all that moved her was the instinct to specialize a waiting emotion on the first fit thing that came to hand did not of course suggest itself to ella  in the natural way of passion under the too practical conditions which civilization has devised for its fruition her husbands love for her had not survived except in the form of fitful friendship any more than or even so much as her own for him and being a woman of very living ardours that required sustenance of some sort they were beginning to feed on this chancing material which was indeed of a quality far better than chance usually offers  one day the children had been playing hideandseek in a closet whence in their excitement they pulled out some clothing  mrs hooper explained that it belonged to mr trewe and hung it up in the closet again  possessed of her fantasy ella went later in the afternoon when nobody was in that part of the house opened the closet unhitched one of the articles a mackintosh and put it on with the waterproof cap belonging to it  the mantle of elijah she said  would it might inspire me to rival him glorious genius that he is  her eyes always grew wet when she thought like that and she turned to look at herself in the glass  his heart had beat inside that coat and his brain had worked under that hat at levels of thought she would never reach  the consciousness of her weakness beside him made her feel quite sick  before she had got the things off her the door opened and her husband entered the room  what the devil  she blushed and removed them  i found them in the closet here she said and put them on in a freak what have i else to do  you are always away  always away  well      that evening she had a further talk with the landlady who might herself have nourished a halftender regard for the poet so ready was she to discourse ardently about him  you are interested in mr trewe i know maam she said and he has just sent to say that he is going to call tomorrow afternoon to look up some books of his that he wants if ill be in and he may select them from your room  o yes  you could very well meet mr trewe then if youd like to be in the way  she promised with secret delight and went to bed musing of him  next morning her husband observed ive been thinking of what you said ell that i have gone about a good deal and left you without much to amuse you  perhaps its true  today as theres not much sea ill take you with me on board the yacht  for the first time in her experience of such an offer ella was not glad but she accepted it for the moment  the time for setting out drew near and she went to get ready  she stood reflecting  the longing to see the poet she was now distinctly in love with overpowered all other considerations  i dont want to go she said to herself  i cant bear to be away  and i wont go  she told her husband that she had changed her mind about wishing to sail he was indifferent and went his way  for the rest of the day the house was quiet the children having gone out upon the sands  the blinds waved in the sunshine to the soft steady stroke of the sea beyond the wall and the notes of the green silesian band a troop of foreign gentlemen hired for the season had drawn almost all the residents and promenaders away from the vicinity of coburg house a knock was audible at the door  mrs marchmill did not hear any servant go to answer it and she became impatient  the books were in the room where she sat but nobody came up she rang the bell  there is some person waiting at the door she said  o no maam  hes gone long ago  i answered it  mrs hooper came in herself  so disappointing she said  mr trewe not coming after all  but i heard him knock i fancy  no that was somebody inquiring for lodgings who came to the wrong house  i forgot to tell you that mr trewe sent a note just before lunch to say i neednt get any tea for him as he should not require the books and wouldnt come to select them  ella was miserable and for a long time could not even reread his mournful ballad on severed lives so aching was her erratic little heart and so tearful her eyes  when the children came in with wet stockings and ran up to her to tell her of their adventures she could not feel that she cared about them half as much as usual        mrs hooper have you a photograph ofthe gentleman who lived here she was getting to be curiously shy in mentioning his name  why yes  its in the ornamental frame on the mantelpiece in your own bedroom maam  no the royal duke and duchess are in that  yes so they are but hes behind them  he belongs rightly to that frame which i bought on purpose but as he went away he said cover me up from those strangers that are coming for gods sake  i dont want them staring at me and i am sure they wont want me staring at them  so i slipped in the duke and duchess temporarily in front of him as they had no frame and royalties are more suitable for letting furnished than a private young man  if you take em out youll see him under  lord maam he wouldnt mind if he knew it  he didnt think the next tenant would be such an attractive lady as you or he wouldnt have thought of hiding himself perhaps  is he handsome she asked timidly  i call him so  some perhaps wouldnt  should i she asked with eagerness  i think you would though some would say hes more striking than handsome a largeeyed thoughtful fellow you know with a very electric flash in his eye when he looks round quickly such as youd expect a poet to be who doesnt get his living by it  how old is he  several years older than yourself maam about thirtyone or two i think  ella was as a matter of fact a few months over thirty herself but she did not look nearly so much  though so immature in nature she was entering on that tract of life in which emotional women begin to suspect that last love may be stronger than first love and she would soon alas enter on the still more melancholy tract when at least the vainer ones of her sex shrink from receiving a male visitor otherwise than with their backs to the window or the blinds half down  she reflected on mrs hoopers remark and said no more about age  just then a telegram was brought up  it came from her husband who had gone down the channel as far as budmouth with his friends in the yacht and would not be able to get back till next day  after her light dinner ella idled about the shore with the children till dusk thinking of the yet uncovered photograph in her room with a serene sense of something ecstatic to come  for with the subtle luxuriousness of fancy in which this young woman was an adept on learning that her husband was to be absent that night she had refrained from incontinently rushing upstairs and opening the pictureframe preferring to reserve the inspection till she could be alone and a more romantic tinge be imparted to the occasion by silence candles solemn sea and stars outside than was afforded by the garish afternoon sunlight  the children had been sent to bed and ella soon followed though it was not yet ten oclock  to gratify her passionate curiosity she now made her preparations first getting rid of superfluous garments and putting on her dressinggown then arranging a chair in front of the table and reading several pages of trewes tenderest utterances  then she fetched the portraitframe to the light opened the back took out the likeness and set it up before her  it was a striking countenance to look upon  the poet wore a luxuriant black moustache and imperial and a slouched hat which shaded the forehead  the large dark eyes described by the landlady showed an unlimited capacity for misery they looked out from beneath wellshaped brows as if they were reading the universe in the microcosm of the confronters face and were not altogether overjoyed at what the spectacle portended  ella murmured in her lowest richest tenderest tone and its you whove so cruelly eclipsed me these many times  as she gazed long at the portrait she fell into thought till her eyes filled with tears and she touched the cardboard with her lips  then she laughed with a nervous lightness and wiped her eyes  she thought how wicked she was a woman having a husband and three children to let her mind stray to a stranger in this unconscionable manner  no he was not a stranger  she knew his thoughts and feelings as well as she knew her own they were in fact the selfsame thoughts and feelings as hers which her husband distinctly lacked perhaps luckily for himself considering that he had to provide for family expenses  hes nearer my real self hes more intimate with the real me than will is after all even though ive never seen him she said  she laid his book and picture on the table at the bedside and when she was reclining on the pillow she reread those of robert trewes verses which she had marked from time to time as most touching and true  putting these aside she set up the photograph on its edge upon the coverlet and contemplated it as she lay  then she scanned again by the light of the candle the halfobliterated pencillings on the wallpaper beside her head  there they werephrases couplets boutsrimes beginnings and middles of lines ideas in the rough like shelleys scraps and the least of them so intense so sweet so palpitating that it seemed as if his very breath warm and loving fanned her cheeks from those walls walls that had surrounded his head times and times as they surrounded her own now  he must often have put up his hand sowith the pencil in it yes the writing was sideways as it would be if executed by one who extended his arm thus  these inscribed shapes of the poets world     forms more real than living man    nurslings of immortality  were no doubt the thoughts and spiritstrivings which had come to him in the dead of night when he could let himself go and have no fear of the frost of criticism  no doubt they had often been written up hastily by the light of the moon the rays of the lamp in the bluegrey dawn in full daylight perhaps never  and now her hair was dragging where his arm had lain when he secured the fugitive fancies she was sleeping on a poets lips immersed in the very essence of him permeated by his spirit as by an ether  while she was dreaming the minutes away thus a footstep came upon the stairs and in a moment she heard her husbands heavy step on the landing immediately without  ell where are you  what possessed her she could not have described but with an instinctive objection to let her husband know what she had been doing she slipped the photograph under the pillow just as he flung open the door with the air of a man who had dined not badly  o i beg pardon said william marchmill  have you a headache  i am afraid i have disturbed you  no ive not got a headache said she  how is it youve come  well we found we could get back in very good time after all and i didnt want to make another day of it because of going somewhere else to morrow  shall i come down again  o no  im as tired as a dog  ive had a good feed and i shall turn in straight off  i want to get out at six oclock tomorrow if i can    i shant disturb you by my getting up it will be long before you are awake  and he came forward into the room  while her eyes followed his movements ella softly pushed the photograph further out of sight  sure youre not ill he asked bending over her  no only wicked  never mind that  and he stooped and kissed her  next morning marchmill was called at six oclock and in waking and yawning she heard him muttering to himself what the deuce is this thats been crackling under me so  imagining her asleep he searched round him and withdrew something  through her halfopened eyes she perceived it to be mr trewe  well im damned her husband exclaimed  what dear said she  o you are awake  ha ha  what do you mean  some blokes photographa friend of our landladys i suppose  i wonder how it came here whisked off the table by accident perhaps when they were making the bed  i was looking at it yesterday and it must have dropped in then  o hes a friend of yours  bless his picturesque heart  ellas loyalty to the object of her admiration could not endure to hear him ridiculed  hes a clever man she said with a tremor in her gentle voice which she herself felt to be absurdly uncalled for  he is a rising poetthe gentleman who occupied two of these rooms before we came though ive never seen him  how do you know if youve never seen him  mrs hooper told me when she showed me the photograph  o well i must up and be off  i shall be home rather early  sorry i cant take you today dear  mind the children dont go getting drowned  that day mrs marchmill inquired if mr trewe were likely to call at any other time  yes said mrs hooper  hes coming this day week to stay with a friend near here till you leave  hell be sure to call  marchmill did return quite early in the afternoon and opening some letters which had arrived in his absence declared suddenly that he and his family would have to leave a week earlier than they had expected to doin short in three days  surely we can stay a week longer she pleaded  i like it here  i dont  it is getting rather slow  then you might leave me and the children  how perverse you are ell  whats the use  and have to come to fetch you  no well all return together and well make out our time in north wales or brighton a little later on  besides youve three days longer yet  it seemed to be her doom not to meet the man for whose rival talent she had a despairing admiration and to whose person she was now absolutely attached  yet she determined to make a last effort and having gathered from her landlady that trewe was living in a lonely spot not far from the fashionable town on the island opposite she crossed over in the packet from the neighbouring pier the following afternoon  what a useless journey it was  ella knew but vaguely where the house stood and when she fancied she had found it and ventured to inquire of a pedestrian if he lived there the answer returned by the man was that he did not know  and if he did live there how could she call upon him some women might have the assurance to do it but she had not  how crazy he would think her  she might have asked him to call upon her perhaps but she had not the courage for that either  she lingered mournfully about the picturesque seaside eminence till it was time to return to the town and enter the steamer for recrossing reaching home for dinner without having been greatly missed  at the last moment unexpectedly enough her husband said that he should have no objection to letting her and the children stay on till the end of the week since she wished to do so if she felt herself able to get home without him  she concealed the pleasure this extension of time gave her and marchmill went off the next morning alone  but the week passed and trewe did not call  on saturday morning the remaining members of the marchmill family departed from the place which had been productive of so much fervour in her  the dreary dreary train the sun shining in moted beams upon the hot cushions the dusty permanent way the mean rows of wirethese things were her accompaniment while out of the window the deep blue sea levels disappeared from her gaze and with them her poets home  heavy hearted she tried to read and wept instead  mr marchmill was in a thriving way of business and he and his family lived in a large new house which stood in rather extensive grounds a few miles outside the city wherein he carried on his trade  ellas life was lonely here as the suburban life is apt to be particularly at certain seasons and she had ample time to indulge her taste for lyric and elegiac composition  she had hardly got back when she encountered a piece by robert trewe in the new number of her favourite magazine which must have been written almost immediately before her visit to solentsea for it contained the very couplet she had seen pencilled on the wallpaper by the bed and mrs hooper had declared to be recent  ella could resist no longer but seizing a pen impulsively wrote to him as a brotherpoet using the name of john ivy congratulating him in her letter on his triumphant executions in metre and rhythm of thoughts that moved his soul as compared with her own browbeaten efforts in the same pathetic trade  to this address there came a response in a few days little as she had dared to hope for ita civil and brief note in which the young poet stated that though he was not well acquainted with mr ivys verse he recalled the name as being one he had seen attached to some very promising pieces that he was glad to gain mr ivys acquaintance by letter and should certainly look with much interest for his productions in the future  there must have been something juvenile or timid in her own epistle as one ostensibly coming from a man she declared to herself for trewe quite adopted the tone of an elder and superior in this reply  but what did it matter he had replied he had written to her with his own hand from that very room she knew so well for he was now back again in his quarters  the correspondence thus begun was continued for two months or more ella marchmill sending him from time to time some that she considered to be the best of her pieces which he very kindly accepted though he did not say he sedulously read them nor did he send her any of his own in return  ella would have been more hurt at this than she was if she had not known that trewe laboured under the impression that she was one of his own sex  yet the situation was unsatisfactory  a flattering little voice told her that were he only to see her matters would be otherwise  no doubt she would have helped on this by making a frank confession of womanhood to begin with if something had not happened to her delight to render it unnecessary  a friend of her husbands the editor of the most important newspaper in the city and county who was dining with them one day observed during their conversation about the poet that his the editors brother the landscapepainter was a friend of mr trewes and that the two men were at that very moment in wales together  ella was slightly acquainted with the editors brother  the next morning down she sat and wrote inviting him to stay at her house for a short time on his way back and requesting him to bring with him if practicable his companion mr trewe whose acquaintance she was anxious to make  the answer arrived after some few days  her correspondent and his friend trewe would have much satisfaction in accepting her invitation on their way southward which would be on such and such a day in the following week  ella was blithe and buoyant  her scheme had succeeded her beloved though as yet unseen one was coming  behold he standeth behind our wall he looked forth at the windows showing himself through the lattice she thought ecstatically  and lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land  but it was necessary to consider the details of lodging and feeding him this she did most solicitously and awaited the pregnant day and hour  it was about five in the afternoon when she heard a ring at the door and the editors brothers voice in the hall  poetess as she was or as she thought herself she had not been too sublime that day to dress with infinite trouble in a fashionable robe of rich material having a faint resemblance to the chiton of the greeks a style just then in vogue among ladies of an artistic and romantic turn which had been obtained by ella of her bond street dressmaker when she was last in london  her visitor entered the drawingroom  she looked towards his rear nobody else came through the door  where in the name of the god of love was robert trewe  o im sorry said the painter after their introductory words had been spoken  trewe is a curious fellow you know mrs marchmill  he said hed come then he said he couldnt  hes rather dusty  weve been doing a few miles with knapsacks you know and he wanted to get on home  hehes not coming  hes not and he asked me to make his apologies  when did you pppart from him she asked her nether lip starting off quivering so much that it was like a tremolostop opened in her speech she longed to run away from this dreadful bore and cry her eyes out  just now in the turnpike road yonder there  what he has actually gone past my gates  yes  when we got to themhandsome gates they are too the finest bit of modern wroughtiron work i have seenwhen we came to them we stopped talking there a little while and then he wished me goodbye and went on the truth is hes a little bit depressed just now and doesnt want to see anybody  hes a very good fellow and a warm friend but a little uncertain and gloomy sometimes he thinks too much of things  his poetry is rather too erotic and passionate you know for some tastes and he has just come in for a terrible slating from the  review that was published yesterday he saw a copy of it at the station by accident perhaps youve read it  no  so much the better  o it is not worth thinking of just one of those articles written to order to please the narrowminded set of subscribers upon whom the circulation depends  but hes upset by it  he says it is the misrepresentation that hurts him so that though he can stand a fair attack he cant stand lies that hes powerless to refute and stop from spreading  thats just trewes weak point  he lives so much by himself that these things affect him much more than they would if he were in the bustle of fashionable or commercial life  so he wouldnt come here making the excuse that it all looked so new and moniedif youll pardon  buthe must have knownthere was sympathy here  has he never said anything about getting letters from this address  yes yes he has from john ivyperhaps a relative of yours he thought visiting here at the time  did helike ivy did he say  well i dont know that he took any great interest in ivy  or in his poems  or in his poemsso far as i know that is  robert trewe took no interest in her house in her poems or in their writer  as soon as she could get away she went into the nursery and tried to let off her emotion by unnecessarily kissing the children till she had a sudden sense of disgust at being reminded how plainlooking they were like their father  the obtuse and singleminded landscapepainter never once perceived from her conversation that it was only trewe she wanted and not himself  he made the best of his visit seeming to enjoy the society of ellas husband who also took a great fancy to him and showed him everywhere about the neighbourhood neither of them noticing ellas mood  the painter had been gone only a day or two when while sitting upstairs alone one morning she glanced over the london paper just arrived and read the following paragraph     suicide of a poet     mr robert trewe who has been favourably known for some years as one    of our rising lyrists committed suicide at his lodgings at solentsea    on saturday evening last by shooting himself in the right temple with    a revolver  readers hardly need to be reminded that mr trewe has    recently attracted the attention of a much wider public than had    hitherto known him by his new volume of verse mostly of an    impassioned kind entitled lyrics to a woman unknown which has been    already favourably noticed in these pages for the extraordinary gamut    of feeling it traverses and which has been made the subject of a    severe if not ferocious criticism in the  review  it is    supposed though not certainly known that the article may have    partially conduced to the sad act as a copy of the review in question    was found on his writingtable and he has been observed to be in a    somewhat depressed state of mind since the critique appeared  then came the report of the inquest at which the following letter was read it having been addressed to a friend at a distance     dear before these lines reach your hands i shall be delivered    from the inconveniences of seeing hearing and knowing more of the    things around me  i will not trouble you by giving my reasons for the    step i have taken though i can assure you they were sound and    logical  perhaps had i been blessed with a mother or a sister or a    female friend of another sort tenderly devoted to me i might have    thought it worth while to continue my present existence  i have long    dreamt of such an unattainable creature as you know and she this    undiscoverable elusive one inspired my last volume the imaginary    woman alone for in spite of what has been said in some quarters    there is no real woman behind the title  she has continued to the    last unrevealed unmet unwon  i think it desirable to mention this    in order that no blame may attach to any real woman as having been the    cause of my decease by cruel or cavalier treatment of me  tell my    landlady that i am sorry to have caused her this unpleasantness but    my occupancy of the rooms will soon be forgotten  there are ample    funds in my name at the bank to pay all expenses  r trewe  ella sat for a while as if stunned then rushed into the adjoining chamber and flung herself upon her face on the bed  her grief and distraction shook her to pieces and she lay in this frenzy of sorrow for more than an hour  broken words came every now and then from her quivering lips o if he had only known of meknown of meme    o if i had only once met himonly once and put my hand upon his hot foreheadkissed himlet him know how i loved himthat i would have suffered shame and scorn would have lived and died for him  perhaps it would have saved his dear life    but noit was not allowed  god is a jealous god and that happiness was not for him and me  all possibilities were over the meeting was stultified  yet it was almost visible to her in her fantasy even now though it could never be substantiated      the hour which might have been yet might not be    which mans and womans heart conceived and bore    yet whereof life was barren        she wrote to the landlady at solentsea in the third person in as subdued a style as she could command enclosing a postal order for a sovereign and informing mrs hooper that mrs marchmill had seen in the papers the sad account of the poets death and having been as mrs hooper was aware much interested in mr trewe during her stay at coburg house she would be obliged if mrs hooper could obtain a small portion of his hair before his coffin was closed down and send it her as a memorial of him as also the photograph that was in the frame  by the returnpost a letter arrived containing what had been requested ella wept over the portrait and secured it in her private drawer the lock of hair she tied with white ribbon and put in her bosom whence she drew it and kissed it every now and then in some unobserved nook  whats the matter said her husband looking up from his newspaper on one of these occasions  crying over something  a lock of hair  whose is it  hes dead she murmured  who  i dont want to tell you will just now unless you insist she said a sob hanging heavy in her voice  o all right  do you mind my refusing  i will tell you some day  it doesnt matter in the least of course  he walked away whistling a few bars of no tune in particular and when he had got down to his factory in the city the subject came into marchmills head again  he too was aware that a suicide had taken place recently at the house they had occupied at solentsea  having seen the volume of poems in his wifes hand of late and heard fragments of the landladys conversation about trewe when they were her tenants he all at once said to himself why of course its he  how the devil did she get to know him  what sly animals women are  then he placidly dismissed the matter and went on with his daily affairs  by this time ella at home had come to a determination  mrs hooper in sending the hair and photograph had informed her of the day of the funeral and as the morning and noon wore on an overpowering wish to know where they were laying him took possession of the sympathetic woman  caring very little now what her husband or any one else might think of her eccentricities she wrote marchmill a brief note stating that she was called away for the afternoon and evening but would return on the following morning  this she left on his desk and having given the same information to the servants went out of the house on foot  when mr marchmill reached home early in the afternoon the servants looked anxious  the nurse took him privately aside and hinted that her mistresss sadness during the past few days had been such that she feared she had gone out to drown herself  marchmill reflected  upon the whole he thought that she had not done that  without saying whither he was bound he also started off telling them not to sit up for him  he drove to the railwaystation and took a ticket for solentsea  it was dark when he reached the place though he had come by a fast train and he knew that if his wife had preceded him thither it could only have been by a slower train arriving not a great while before his own  the season at solentsea was now past the parade was gloomy and the flys were few and cheap  he asked the way to the cemetery and soon reached it  the gate was locked but the keeper let him in declaring however that there was nobody within the precincts  although it was not late the autumnal darkness had now become intense and he found some difficulty in keeping to the serpentine path which led to the quarter where as the man had told him the one or two interments for the day had taken place  he stepped upon the grass and stumbling over some pegs stooped now and then to discern if possible a figure against the sky  he could see none but lighting on a spot where the soil was trodden beheld a crouching object beside a newly made grave  she heard him and sprang up  ell how silly this is he said indignantly  running away from homei never heard such a thing  of course i am not jealous of this unfortunate man but it is too ridiculous that you a married woman with three children and a fourth coming should go losing your head like this over a dead lover    do you know you were locked in  you might not have been able to get out all night  she did not answer  i hope it didnt go far between you and him for your own sake  dont insult me will  mind i wont have any more of this sort of thing do you hear  very well she said  he drew her arm within his own and conducted her out of the cemetery  it was impossible to get back that night and not wishing to be recognized in their present sorry condition he took her to a miserable little coffeehouse close to the station whence they departed early in the morning travelling almost without speaking under the sense that it was one of those dreary situations occurring in married life which words could not mend and reaching their own door at noon  the months passed and neither of the twain ever ventured to start a conversation upon this episode  ella seemed to be only too frequently in a sad and listless mood which might almost have been called pining  the time was approaching when she would have to undergo the stress of childbirth for a fourth time and that apparently did not tend to raise her spirits  i dont think i shall get over it this time she said one day  pooh what childish foreboding  why shouldnt it be as well now as ever  she shook her head  i feel almost sure i am going to die and i should be glad if it were not for nelly and frank and tiny  and me  youll soon find somebody to fill my place she murmured with a sad smile  and youll have a perfect right to i assure you of that  ell you are not thinking still about thatpoetical friend of yours  she neither admitted nor denied the charge  i am not going to get over my illness this time she reiterated  something tells me i shant  this view of things was rather a bad beginning as it usually is and in fact six weeks later in the month of may she was lying in her room pulseless and bloodless with hardly strength enough left to follow up one feeble breath with another the infant for whose unnecessary life she was slowly parting with her own being fat and well  just before her death she spoke to marchmill softly  will i want to confess to you the entire circumstances of thatabout you know whatthat time we visited solentsea  i cant tell what possessed mehow i could forget you so my husband  but i had got into a morbid state i thought you had been unkind that you had neglected me that you werent up to my intellectual level while he was and far above it  i wanted a fuller appreciator perhaps rather than another lover  she could get no further then for very exhaustion and she went off in sudden collapse a few hours later without having said anything more to her husband on the subject of her love for the poet  william marchmill in truth like most husbands of several years standing was little disturbed by retrospective jealousies and had not shown the least anxiety to press her for confessions concerning a man dead and gone beyond any power of inconveniencing him more  but when she had been buried a couple of years it chanced one day that in turning over some forgotten papers that he wished to destroy before his second wife entered the house he lighted on a lock of hair in an envelope with the photograph of the deceased poet a date being written on the back in his late wifes hand  it was that of the time they spent at solentsea  marchmill looked long and musingly at the hair and portrait for something struck him  fetching the little boy who had been the death of his mother now a noisy toddler he took him on his knee held the lock of hair against the childs head and set up the photograph on the table behind so that he could closely compare the features each countenance presented  there were undoubtedly strong traces of resemblance the dreamy and peculiar expression of the poets face sat as the transmitted idea upon the childs and the hair was of the same hue  im damned if i didnt think so murmured marchmill  then she did play me false with that fellow at the lodgings  let me see the datesthe second week in august    the third week in may    yes    yes    get away you poor little brat  you are nothing to me  1893     the three strangers   among the few features of agricultural england which retain an appearance but little modified by the lapse of centuries may be reckoned the high grassy and furzy downs coombs or eweleases as they are indifferently called that fill a large area of certain counties in the south and south west  if any mark of human occupation is met with hereon it usually takes the form of the solitary cottage of some shepherd  fifty years ago such a lonely cottage stood on such a down and may possibly be standing there now  in spite of its loneliness however the spot by actual measurement was not more than five miles from a county town  yet that affected it little  five miles of irregular upland during the long inimical seasons with their sleets snows rains and mists afford withdrawing space enough to isolate a timon or a nebuchadnezzar much less in fair weather to please that less repellent tribe the poets philosophers artists and others who conceive and meditate of pleasant things  some old earthen camp or barrow some clump of trees at least some starved fragment of ancient hedge is usually taken advantage of in the erection of these forlorn dwellings  but in the present case such a kind of shelter had been disregarded  higher crowstairs as the house was called stood quite detached and undefended  the only reason for its precise situation seemed to be the crossing of two footpaths at right angles hard by which may have crossed there and thus for a good five hundred years  hence the house was exposed to the elements on all sides but though the wind up here blew unmistakably when it did blow and the rain hit hard whenever it fell the various weathers of the winter season were not quite so formidable on the coomb as they were imagined to be by dwellers on low ground  the raw rimes were not so pernicious as in the hollows and the frosts were scarcely so severe  when the shepherd and his family who tenanted the house were pitied for their sufferings from the exposure they said that upon the whole they were less inconvenienced by wuzzes and flames hoarses and phlegms than when they had lived by the stream of a snug neighbouring valley  the night of march 28 182 was precisely one of the nights that were wont to call forth these expressions of commiseration  the level rainstorm smote walls slopes and hedges like the clothyard shafts of senlac and crecy  such sheep and outdoor animals as had no shelter stood with their buttocks to the winds while the tails of little birds trying to roost on some scraggy thorn were blown insideout like umbrellas  the gableend of the cottage was stained with wet and the eavesdroppings flapped against the wall  yet never was commiseration for the shepherd more misplaced  for that cheerful rustic was entertaining a large party in glorification of the christening of his second girl  the guests had arrived before the rain began to fall and they were all now assembled in the chief or living room of the dwelling  a glance into the apartment at eight oclock on this eventful evening would have resulted in the opinion that it was as cosy and comfortable a nook as could be wished for in boisterous weather  the calling of its inhabitant was proclaimed by a number of highlypolished sheepcrooks without stems that were hung ornamentally over the fireplace the curl of each shining crook varying from the antiquated type engraved in the patriarchal pictures of old family bibles to the most approved fashion of the last local sheepfair  the room was lighted by halfadozen candles having wicks only a trifle smaller than the grease which enveloped them in candlesticks that were never used but at highdays holydays and family feasts  the lights were scattered about the room two of them standing on the chimneypiece  this position of candles was in itself significant  candles on the chimneypiece always meant a party  on the hearth in front of a backbrand to give substance blazed a fire of thorns that crackled like the laughter of the fool  nineteen persons were gathered here  of these five women wearing gowns of various bright hues sat in chairs along the wall girls shy and not shy filled the windowbench four men including charley jake the hedge carpenter elijah new the parishclerk and john pitcher a neighbouring dairyman the shepherds fatherinlaw lolled in the settle a young man and maid who were blushing over tentative pourparlers on a lifecompanionship sat beneath the cornercupboard and an elderly engaged man of fifty or upward moved restlessly about from spots where his betrothed was not to the spot where she was  enjoyment was pretty general and so much the more prevailed in being unhampered by conventional restrictions  absolute confidence in each others good opinion begat perfect ease while the finishing stroke of manner amounting to a truly princely serenity was lent to the majority by the absence of any expression or trait denoting that they wished to get on in the world enlarge their minds or do any eclipsing thing whateverwhich nowadays so generally nips the bloom and bonhomie of all except the two extremes of the social scale  shepherd fennel had married well his wife being a dairymans daughter from a vale at a distance who brought fifty guineas in her pocketand kept them there till they should be required for ministering to the needs of a coming family  this frugal woman had been somewhat exercised as to the character that should be given to the gathering  a sitstill party had its advantages but an undisturbed position of ease in chairs and settles was apt to lead on the men to such an unconscionable deal of toping that they would sometimes fairly drink the house dry  a dancing party was the alternative but this while avoiding the foregoing objection on the score of good drink had a counterbalancing disadvantage in the matter of good victuals the ravenous appetites engendered by the exercise causing immense havoc in the buttery  shepherdess fennel fell back upon the intermediate plan of mingling short dances with short periods of talk and singing so as to hinder any ungovernable rage in either  but this scheme was entirely confined to her own gentle mind the shepherd himself was in the mood to exhibit the most reckless phases of hospitality  the fiddler was a boy of those parts about twelve years of age who had a wonderful dexterity in jigs and reels though his fingers were so small and short as to necessitate a constant shifting for the high notes from which he scrambled back to the first position with sounds not of unmixed purity of tone  at seven the shrill tweedledee of this youngster had begun accompanied by a booming groundbass from elijah new the parish clerk who had thoughtfully brought with him his favourite musical instrument the serpent  dancing was instantaneous mrs fennel privately enjoining the players on no account to let the dance exceed the length of a quarter of an hour  but elijah and the boy in the excitement of their position quite forgot the injunction  moreover oliver giles a man of seventeen one of the dancers who was enamoured of his partner a fair girl of thirtythree rolling years had recklessly handed a new crownpiece to the musicians as a bribe to keep going as long as they had muscle and wind  mrs fennel seeing the steam begin to generate on the countenances of her guests crossed over and touched the fiddlers elbow and put her hand on the serpents mouth  but they took no notice and fearing she might lose her character of genial hostess if she were to interfere too markedly she retired and sat down helpless  and so the dance whizzed on with cumulative fury the performers moving in their planetlike courses direct and retrograde from apogee to perigee till the hand of the well kicked clock at the bottom of the room had travelled over the circumference of an hour  while these cheerful events were in course of enactment within fennels pastoral dwelling an incident having considerable bearing on the party had occurred in the gloomy night without  mrs fennels concern about the growing fierceness of the dance corresponded in point of time with the ascent of a human figure to the solitary hill of higher crowstairs from the direction of the distant town  this personage strode on through the rain without a pause following the littleworn path which further on in its course skirted the shepherds cottage  it was nearly the time of full moon and on this account though the sky was lined with a uniform sheet of dripping cloud ordinary objects out of doors were readily visible  the sad wan light revealed the lonely pedestrian to be a man of supple frame his gait suggested that he had somewhat passed the period of perfect and instinctive agility though not so far as to be otherwise than rapid of motion when occasion required  at a rough guess he might have been about forty years of age  he appeared tall but a recruiting sergeant or other person accustomed to the judging of mens heights by the eye would have discerned that this was chiefly owing to his gauntness and that he was not more than fivefeet eight or nine  notwithstanding the regularity of his tread there was caution in it as in that of one who mentally feels his way and despite the fact that it was not a black coat nor a dark garment of any sort that he wore there was something about him which suggested that he naturally belonged to the blackcoated tribes of men  his clothes were of fustian and his boots hobnailed yet in his progress he showed not the mudaccustomed bearing of hobnailed and fustianed peasantry  by the time that he had arrived abreast of the shepherds premises the rain came down or rather came along with yet more determined violence the outskirts of the little settlement partially broke the force of wind and rain and this induced him to stand still  the most salient of the shepherds domestic erections was an empty sty at the forward corner of his hedgeless garden for in these latitudes the principle of masking the homelier features of your establishment by a conventional frontage was unknown  the travellers eye was attracted to this small building by the pallid shine of the wet slates that covered it  he turned aside and finding it empty stood under the pentroof for shelter  while he stood the boom of the serpent within the adjacent house and the lesser strains of the fiddler reached the spot as an accompaniment to the surging hiss of the flying rain on the sod its louder beating on the cabbageleaves of the garden on the eight or ten beehives just discernible by the path and its dripping from the eaves into a row of buckets and pans that had been placed under the walls of the cottage  for at higher crowstairs as at all such elevated domiciles the grand difficulty of housekeeping was an insufficiency of water and a casual rainfall was utilized by turning out as catchers every utensil that the house contained  some queer stories might be told of the contrivances for economy in suds and dishwaters that are absolutely necessitated in upland habitations during the droughts of summer  but at this season there were no such exigencies a mere acceptance of what the skies bestowed was sufficient for an abundant store  at last the notes of the serpent ceased and the house was silent  this cessation of activity aroused the solitary pedestrian from the reverie into which he had lapsed and emerging from the shed with an apparently new intention he walked up the path to the housedoor  arrived here his first act was to kneel down on a large stone beside the row of vessels and to drink a copious draught from one of them  having quenched his thirst he rose and lifted his hand to knock but paused with his eye upon the panel  since the dark surface of the wood revealed absolutely nothing it was evident that he must be mentally looking through the door as if he wished to measure thereby all the possibilities that a house of this sort might include and how they might bear upon the question of his entry  in his indecision he turned and surveyed the scene around  not a soul was anywhere visible  the gardenpath stretched downward from his feet gleaming like the track of a snail the roof of the little well mostly dry the wellcover the top rail of the gardengate were varnished with the same dull liquid glaze while far away in the vale a faint whiteness of more than usual extent showed that the rivers were high in the meads  beyond all this winked a few bleared lamplights through the beating dropslights that denoted the situation of the countytown from which he had appeared to come  the absence of all notes of life in that direction seemed to clinch his intentions and he knocked at the door  within a desultory chat had taken the place of movement and musical sound  the hedgecarpenter was suggesting a song to the company which nobody just then was inclined to undertake so that the knock afforded a not unwelcome diversion  walk in said the shepherd promptly  the latch clicked upward and out of the night our pedestrian appeared upon the doormat  the shepherd arose snuffed two of the nearest candles and turned to look at him  their light disclosed that the stranger was dark in complexion and not unprepossessing as to feature  his hat which for a moment he did not remove hung low over his eyes without concealing that they were large open and determined moving with a flash rather than a glance round the room  he seemed pleased with his survey and baring his shaggy head said in a rich deep voice the rain is so heavy friends that i ask leave to come in and rest awhile  to be sure stranger said the shepherd  and faith youve been lucky in choosing your time for we are having a bit of a fling for a glad causethough to be sure a man could hardly wish that glad cause to happen more than once a year  nor less spoke up a woman  for tis best to get your family over and done with as soon as you can so as to be all the earlier out of the fag ot  and what may be this glad cause asked the stranger  a birth and christening said the shepherd  the stranger hoped his host might not be made unhappy either by too many or too few of such episodes and being invited by a gesture to a pull at the mug he readily acquiesced  his manner which before entering had been so dubious was now altogether that of a careless and candid man  late to be traipsing athwart this coombhey said the engaged man of fifty  late it is master as you sayill take a seat in the chimneycorner if you have nothing to urge against it maam for i am a little moist on the side that was next the rain  mrs shepherd fennel assented and made room for the selfinvited comer who having got completely inside the chimneycorner stretched out his legs and his arms with the expansiveness of a person quite at home  yes i am rather cracked in the vamp he said freely seeing that the eyes of the shepherds wife fell upon his boots and i am not well fitted either  i have had some rough times lately and have been forced to pick up what i can get in the way of wearing but i must find a suit better fit for workingdays when i reach home  one of hereabouts she inquired  not quite thatfurther up the country  i thought so  and so be i and by your tongue you come from my neighbourhood  but you would hardly have heard of me he said quickly  my time would be long before yours maam you see  this testimony to the youthfulness of his hostess had the effect of stopping her crossexamination  there is only one thing more wanted to make me happy continued the new comer  and that is a little baccy which i am sorry to say i am out of  ill fill your pipe said the shepherd  i must ask you to lend me a pipe likewise  a smoker and no pipe about ee  i have dropped it somewhere on the road  the shepherd filled and handed him a new clay pipe saying as he did so hand me your baccyboxill fill that too now i am about it  the man went through the movement of searching his pockets  lost that too said his entertainer with some surprise  i am afraid so said the man with some confusion  give it to me in a screw of paper  lighting his pipe at the candle with a suction that drew the whole flame into the bowl he resettled himself in the corner and bent his looks upon the faint steam from his damp legs as if he wished to say no more  meanwhile the general body of guests had been taking little notice of this visitor by reason of an absorbing discussion in which they were engaged with the band about a tune for the next dance  the matter being settled they were about to stand up when an interruption came in the shape of another knock at the door  at sound of the same the man in the chimneycorner took up the poker and began stirring the brands as if doing it thoroughly were the one aim of his existence and a second time the shepherd said walk in  in a moment another man stood upon the strawwoven doormat  he too was a stranger  this individual was one of a type radically different from the first there was more of the commonplace in his manner and a certain jovial cosmopolitanism sat upon his features  he was several years older than the first arrival his hair being slightly frosted his eyebrows bristly and his whiskers cut back from his cheeks  his face was rather full and flabby and yet it was not altogether a face without power  a few grog blossoms marked the neighbourhood of his nose  he flung back his long drab greatcoat revealing that beneath it he wore a suit of cindergray shade throughout large heavy seals of some metal or other that would take a polish dangling from his fob as his only personal ornament shaking the waterdrops from his lowcrowned glazed hat he said i must ask for a few minutes shelter comrades or i shall be wetted to my skin before i get to casterbridge  make yourself at home master said the shepherd perhaps a trifle less heartily than on the first occasion  not that fennel had the least tinge of niggardliness in his composition but the room was far from large spare chairs were not numerous and damp companions were not altogether desirable at close quarters for the women and girls in their brightcoloured gowns  however the second comer after taking off his greatcoat and hanging his hat on a nail in one of the ceilingbeams as if he had been specially invited to put it there advanced and sat down at the table  this had been pushed so closely into the chimneycorner to give all available room to the dancers that its inner edge grazed the elbow of the man who had ensconced himself by the fire and thus the two strangers were brought into close companionship  they nodded to each other by way of breaking the ice of unacquaintance and the first stranger handed his neighbour the family muga huge vessel of brown ware having its upper edge worn away like a threshold by the rub of whole generations of thirsty lips that had gone the way of all flesh and bearing the following inscription burnt upon its rotund side in yellow letters     there is no fun    untill i cum  the other man nothing loth raised the mug to his lips and drank on and on and ontill a curious blueness overspread the countenance of the shepherds wife who had regarded with no little surprise the first strangers free offer to the second of what did not belong to him to dispense  i knew it said the toper to the shepherd with much satisfaction  when i walked up your garden before coming in and saw the hives all of a row i said to myself where theres bees theres honey and where theres honey theres mead  but mead of such a truly comfortable sort as this i really didnt expect to meet in my older days  he took yet another pull at the mug till it assumed an ominous elevation  glad you enjoy it said the shepherd warmly  it is goodish mead assented mrs fennel with an absence of enthusiasm which seemed to say that it was possible to buy praise for ones cellar at too heavy a price  it is trouble enough to makeand really i hardly think we shall make any more  for honey sells well and we ourselves can make shift with a drop o small mead and metheglin for common use from the combwashings  o but youll never have the heart reproachfully cried the stranger in cindergray after taking up the mug a third time and setting it down empty  i love mead when tis old like this as i love to go to church o sundays or to relieve the needy any day of the week  ha ha ha said the man in the chimneycorner who in spite of the taciturnity induced by the pipe of tobacco could not or would not refrain from this slight testimony to his comrades humour  now the old mead of those days brewed of the purest firstyear or maiden honey four pounds to the gallonwith its due complement of white of eggs cinnamon ginger cloves mace rosemary yeast and processes of working bottling and cellaringtasted remarkably strong but it did not taste so strong as it actually was  hence presently the stranger in cindergray at the table moved by its creeping influence unbuttoned his waistcoat threw himself back in his chair spread his legs and made his presence felt in various ways  well well as i say he resumed i am going to casterbridge and to casterbridge i must go  i should have been almost there by this time but the rain drove me into your dwelling and im not sorry for it  you dont live in casterbridge said the shepherd  not as yet though i shortly mean to move there  going to set up in trade perhaps  no no said the shepherds wife  it is easy to see that the gentleman is rich and dont want to work at anything  the cindergray stranger paused as if to consider whether he would accept that definition of himself  he presently rejected it by answering rich is not quite the word for me dame  i do work and i must work  and even if i only get to casterbridge by midnight i must begin work there at eight tomorrow morning  yes het or wet blow or snow famine or sword my days work tomorrow must be done  poor man  then in spite o seeming you be worse off than we replied the shepherds wife  tis the nature of my trade men and maidens  tis the nature of my trade more than my poverty    but really and truly i must up and off or i shant get a lodging in the town  however the speaker did not move and directly added theres time for one more draught of friendship before i go and id perform it at once if the mug were not dry  heres a mug o small said mrs fennel  small we call it though to be sure tis only the first wash o the combs  no said the stranger disdainfully  i wont spoil your first kindness by partaking o your second  certainly not broke in fennel  we dont increase and multiply every day and ill fill the mug again  he went away to the dark place under the stairs where the barrel stood  the shepherdess followed him  why should you do this she said reproachfully as soon as they were alone  hes emptied it once though it held enough for ten people and now hes not contented wi the small but must needs call for more o the strong  and a stranger unbeknown to any of us  for my part i dont like the look o the man at all  but hes in the house my honey and tis a wet night and a christening  daze it whats a cup of mead more or less  therell be plenty more next beeburning  very wellthis time then she answered looking wistfully at the barrel  but what is the mans calling and where is he one of that he should come in and join us like this  i dont know  ill ask him again  the catastrophe of having the mug drained dry at one pull by the stranger in cindergray was effectually guarded against this time by mrs fennel she poured out his allowance in a small cup keeping the large one at a discreet distance from him  when he had tossed off his portion the shepherd renewed his inquiry about the strangers occupation  the latter did not immediately reply and the man in the chimneycorner with sudden demonstrativeness said anybody may know my tradeim a wheelwright  a very good trade for these parts said the shepherd  and anybody may know mineif theyve the sense to find it out said the stranger in cindergray  you may generally tell what a man is by his claws observed the hedge carpenter looking at his own hands  my fingers be as full of thorns as an old pincushion is of pins  the hands of the man in the chimneycorner instinctively sought the shade and he gazed into the fire as he resumed his pipe  the man at the table took up the hedgecarpenters remark and added smartly true but the oddity of my trade is that instead of setting a mark upon me it sets a mark upon my customers  no observation being offered by anybody in elucidation of this enigma the shepherds wife once more called for a song  the same obstacles presented themselves as at the former timeone had no voice another had forgotten the first verse  the stranger at the table whose soul had now risen to a good working temperature relieved the difficulty by exclaiming that to start the company he would sing himself  thrusting one thumb into the armhole of his waistcoat he waved the other hand in the air and with an extemporizing gaze at the shining sheepcrooks above the mantelpiece began        o my trade it is the rarest one             simple shepherds all           my trade is a sight to see    for my customers i tie and take them up on high          and waft em to a far countree  the room was silent when he had finished the versewith one exception that of the man in the chimneycorner who at the singers word chorus joined him in a deep bass voice of musical relish      and waft em to a far countree  oliver giles john pitcher the dairyman the parishclerk the engaged man of fifty the row of young women against the wall seemed lost in thought not of the gayest kind  the shepherd looked meditatively on the ground the shepherdess gazed keenly at the singer and with some suspicion she was doubting whether this stranger were merely singing an old song from recollection or was composing one there and then for the occasion  all were as perplexed at the obscure revelation as the guests at belshazzars feast except the man in the chimneycorner who quietly said second verse stranger and smoked on  the singer thoroughly moistened himself from his lips inwards and went on with the next stanza as requested        my tools are but common ones             simple shepherds all           my tools are no sight to see    a little hempen string and a post whereon to swing          are implements enough for me  shepherd fennel glanced round  there was no longer any doubt that the stranger was answering his question rhythmically  the guests one and all started back with suppressed exclamations  the young woman engaged to the man of fifty fainted halfway and would have proceeded but finding him wanting in alacrity for catching her she sat down trembling  o hes the whispered the people in the background mentioning the name of an ominous public officer  hes come to do it  tis to be at casterbridge jail tomorrowthe man for sheepstealingthe poor clock maker we heard of who used to live away at shottsford and had no work to dotimothy summers whose family were astarving and so he went out of shottsford by the highroad and took a sheep in open daylight defying the farmer and the farmers wife and the farmers lad and every man jack among em  he and they nodded towards the stranger of the deadly trade is come from up the country to do it because theres not enough to do in his own countytown and hes got the place here now our own county mans dead hes going to live in the same cottage under the prison wall  the stranger in cindergray took no notice of this whispered string of observations but again wetted his lips  seeing that his friend in the chimneycorner was the only one who reciprocated his joviality in any way he held out his cup towards that appreciative comrade who also held out his own  they clinked together the eyes of the rest of the room hanging upon the singers actions  he parted his lips for the third verse but at that moment another knock was audible upon the door  this time the knock was faint and hesitating  the company seemed scared the shepherd looked with consternation towards the entrance and it was with some effort that he resisted his alarmed wifes deprecatory glance and uttered for the third time the welcoming words walk in  the door was gently opened and another man stood upon the mat  he like those who had preceded him was a stranger  this time it was a short small personage of fair complexion and dressed in a decent suit of dark clothes  can you tell me the way to he began when gazing round the room to observe the nature of the company amongst whom he had fallen his eyes lighted on the stranger in cindergray  it was just at the instant when the latter who had thrown his mind into his song with such a will that he scarcely heeded the interruption silenced all whispers and inquiries by bursting into his third verse        tomorrow is my working day             simple shepherds all          tomorrow is a working day for me    for the farmers sheep is slain and the lad who did it taen         and on his soul may god ha mercy  the stranger in the chimneycorner waving cups with the singer so heartily that his mead splashed over on the hearth repeated in his bass voice as before     and on his soul may god ha mercy  all this time the third stranger had been standing in the doorway finding now that he did not come forward or go on speaking the guests particularly regarded him  they noticed to their surprise that he stood before them the picture of abject terrorhis knees trembling his hand shaking so violently that the doorlatch by which he supported himself rattled audibly his white lips were parted and his eyes fixed on the merry officer of justice in the middle of the room  a moment more and he had turned closed the door and fled  what a man can it be said the shepherd  the rest between the awfulness of their late discovery and the odd conduct of this third visitor looked as if they knew not what to think and said nothing  instinctively they withdrew further and further from the grim gentleman in their midst whom some of them seemed to take for the prince of darkness himself till they formed a remote circle an empty space of floor being left between them and him          circulus cujus centrum diabolus  the room was so silentthough there were more than twenty people in itthat nothing could be heard but the patter of the rain against the windowshutters accompanied by the occasional hiss of a stray drop that fell down the chimney into the fire and the steady puffing of the man in the corner who had now resumed his pipe of long clay  the stillness was unexpectedly broken  the distant sound of a gun reverberated through the airapparently from the direction of the county town  be jiggered cried the stranger who had sung the song jumping up  what does that mean asked several  a prisoner escaped from the jailthats what it means  all listened  the sound was repeated and none of them spoke but the man in the chimneycorner who said quietly ive often been told that in this county they fire a gun at such times but i never heard it till now  i wonder if it is my man murmured the personage in cindergray  surely it is said the shepherd involuntarily  and surely weve zeed him  that little man who looked in at the door by now and quivered like a leaf when he zeed ye and heard your song  his teeth chattered and the breath went out of his body said the dairyman  and his heart seemed to sink within him like a stone said oliver giles  and he bolted as if hed been shot at said the hedgecarpenter  truehis teeth chattered and his heart seemed to sink and he bolted as if hed been shot at slowly summed up the man in the chimneycorner  i didnt notice it remarked the hangman  we were all awondering what made him run off in such a fright faltered one of the women against the wall and now tis explained  the firing of the alarmgun went on at intervals low and sullenly and their suspicions became a certainty  the sinister gentleman in cinder gray roused himself  is there a constable here he asked in thick tones  if so let him step forward  the engaged man of fifty stepped quavering out from the wall his betrothed beginning to sob on the back of the chair  you are a sworn constable  i be sir  then pursue the criminal at once with assistance and bring him back here  he cant have gone far  i will sir i willwhen ive got my staff  ill go home and get it and come sharp here and start in a body  staffnever mind your staff the manll be gone  but i cant do nothing without my staffcan i william and john and charles jake  no for theres the kings royal crown a painted on en in yaller and gold and the lion and the unicorn so as when i raise en up and hit my prisoner tis made a lawful blow thereby  i wouldnt tempt to take up a man without my staffno not i  if i hadnt the law to gie me courage why instead o my taking up him he might take up me  now im a kings man myself and can give you authority enough for this said the formidable officer in gray  now then all of ye be ready  have ye any lanterns  yeshave ye any lanternsi demand it said the constable  and the rest of you ablebodied  ablebodied menyesthe rest of ye said the constable  have you some good stout staves and pitchforks  staves and pitchforksin the name o the law  and take em in yer hands and go in quest and do as we in authority tell ye  thus aroused the men prepared to give chase  the evidence was indeed though circumstantial so convincing that but little argument was needed to show the shepherds guests that after what they had seen it would look very much like connivance if they did not instantly pursue the unhappy third stranger who could not as yet have gone more than a few hundred yards over such uneven country  a shepherd is always well provided with lanterns and lighting these hastily and with hurdlestaves in their hands they poured out of the door taking a direction along the crest of the hill away from the town the rain having fortunately a little abated  disturbed by the noise or possibly by unpleasant dreams of her baptism the child who had been christened began to cry heartbrokenly in the room overhead  these notes of grief came down through the chinks of the floor to the ears of the women below who jumped up one by one and seemed glad of the excuse to ascend and comfort the baby for the incidents of the last halfhour greatly oppressed them  thus in the space of two or three minutes the room on the groundfloor was deserted quite  but it was not for long  hardly had the sound of footsteps died away when a man returned round the corner of the house from the direction the pursuers had taken  peeping in at the door and seeing nobody there he entered leisurely  it was the stranger of the chimneycorner who had gone out with the rest  the motive of his return was shown by his helping himself to a cut piece of skimmercake that lay on a ledge beside where he had sat and which he had apparently forgotten to take with him he also poured out half a cup more mead from the quantity that remained ravenously eating and drinking these as he stood  he had not finished when another figure came in just as quietlyhis friend in cindergray  oyou here said the latter smiling  i thought you had gone to help in the capture  and this speaker also revealed the object of his return by looking solicitously round for the fascinating mug of old mead  and i thought you had gone said the other continuing his skimmercake with some effort  well on second thoughts i felt there were enough without me said the first confidentially and such a night as it is too  besides tis the business o the government to take care of its criminalsnot mine  true so it is  and i felt as you did that there were enough without me  i dont want to break my limbs running over the humps and hollows of this wild country  nor i neither between you and me  these shepherdpeople are used to itsimpleminded souls you know stirred up to anything in a moment  theyll have him ready for me before the morning and no trouble to me at all  theyll have him and we shall have saved ourselves all labour in the matter  true true  well my way is to casterbridge and tis as much as my legs will do to take me that far  going the same way  no i am sorry to say  i have to get home over there he nodded indefinitely to the right and i feel as you do that it is quite enough for my legs to do before bedtime  the other had by this time finished the mead in the mug after which shaking hands heartily at the door and wishing each other well they went their several ways  in the meantime the company of pursuers had reached the end of the hogs back elevation which dominated this part of the down  they had decided on no particular plan of action and finding that the man of the baleful trade was no longer in their company they seemed quite unable to form any such plan now  they descended in all directions down the hill and straightway several of the party fell into the snare set by nature for all misguided midnight ramblers over this part of the cretaceous formation  the lanchets or flint slopes which belted the escarpment at intervals of a dozen yards took the less cautious ones unawares and losing their footing on the rubbly steep they slid sharply downwards the lanterns rolling from their hands to the bottom and there lying on their sides till the horn was scorched through  when they had again gathered themselves together the shepherd as the man who knew the country best took the lead and guided them round these treacherous inclines  the lanterns which seemed rather to dazzle their eyes and warn the fugitive than to assist them in the exploration were extinguished due silence was observed and in this more rational order they plunged into the vale  it was a grassy briery moist defile affording some shelter to any person who had sought it but the party perambulated it in vain and ascended on the other side  here they wandered apart and after an interval closed together again to report progress  at the second time of closing in they found themselves near a lonely ash the single tree on this part of the coomb probably sown there by a passing bird some fifty years before  and here standing a little to one side of the trunk as motionless as the trunk itself appeared the man they were in quest of his outline being well defined against the sky beyond  the band noiselessly drew up and faced him  your money or your life said the constable sternly to the still figure  no no whispered john pitcher  tisnt our side ought to say that thats the doctrine of vagabonds like him and we be on the side of the law  well well replied the constable impatiently i must say something mustnt i and if you had all the weight o this undertaking upon your mind perhaps youd say the wrong thing tooprisoner at the bar surrender in the name of the fatherthe crown i mane  the man under the tree seemed now to notice them for the first time and giving them no opportunity whatever for exhibiting their courage he strolled slowly towards them  he was indeed the little man the third stranger but his trepidation had in a great measure gone  well travellers he said did i hear ye speak to me  you did youve got to come and be our prisoner at once said the constable  we arrest ee on the charge of not biding in casterbridge jail in a decent proper manner to be hung tomorrow morning  neighbours do your duty and seize the culpet  on hearing the charge the man seemed enlightened and saying not another word resigned himself with preternatural civility to the search party who with their staves in their hands surrounded him on all sides and marched him back towards the shepherds cottage  it was eleven oclock by the time they arrived  the light shining from the open door a sound of mens voices within proclaimed to them as they approached the house that some new events had arisen in their absence  on entering they discovered the shepherds living room to be invaded by two officers from casterbridge jail and a wellknown magistrate who lived at the nearest countryseat intelligence of the escape having become generally circulated  gentlemen said the constable i have brought back your mannot without risk and danger but every one must do his duty  he is inside this circle of ablebodied persons who have lent me useful aid considering their ignorance of crown work  men bring forward your prisoner  and the third stranger was led to the light  who is this said one of the officials  the man said the constable  certainly not said the turnkey and the first corroborated his statement  but how can it be otherwise asked the constable  or why was he so terrified at sight o the singing instrument of the law who sat there here he related the strange behaviour of the third stranger on entering the house during the hangmans song  cant understand it said the officer coolly  all i know is that it is not the condemned man  hes quite a different character from this one a gauntish fellow with dark hair and eyes rather goodlooking and with a musical bass voice that if you heard it once youd never mistake as long as you lived  why soulstwas the man in the chimneycorner  heywhat said the magistrate coming forward after inquiring particulars from the shepherd in the background  havent you got the man after all  well sir said the constable hes the man we were in search of thats true and yet hes not the man we were in search of  for the man we were in search of was not the man we wanted sir if you understand my everyday way for twas the man in the chimneycorner  a pretty kettle of fish altogether said the magistrate  you had better start for the other man at once  the prisoner now spoke for the first time  the mention of the man in the chimneycorner seemed to have moved him as nothing else could do  sir he said stepping forward to the magistrate take no more trouble about me  the time is come when i may as well speak  i have done nothing my crime is that the condemned man is my brother  early this afternoon i left home at shottsford to tramp it all the way to casterbridge jail to bid him farewell  i was benighted and called here to rest and ask the way  when i opened the door i saw before me the very man my brother that i thought to see in the condemned cell at casterbridge  he was in this chimneycorner and jammed close to him so that he could not have got out if he had tried was the executioner whod come to take his life singing a song about it and not knowing that it was his victim who was close by joining in to save appearances  my brother looked a glance of agony at me and i knew he meant dont reveal what you see my life depends on it  i was so terrorstruck that i could hardly stand and not knowing what i did i turned and hurried away  the narrators manner and tone had the stamp of truth and his story made a great impression on all around  and do you know where your brother is at the present time asked the magistrate  i do not  i have never seen him since i closed this door  i can testify to that for weve been between ye ever since said the constable  where does he think to fly towhat is his occupation  hes a watchandclockmaker sir  a said a was a wheelwrighta wicked rogue said the constable  the wheels of clocks and watches he meant no doubt said shepherd fennel  i thought his hands were palish fors trade  well it appears to me that nothing can be gained by retaining this poor man in custody said the magistrate your business lies with the other unquestionably  and so the little man was released offhand but he looked nothing the less sad on that account it being beyond the power of magistrate or constable to raze out the written troubles in his brain for they concerned another whom he regarded with more solicitude than himself when this was done and the man had gone his way the night was found to be so far advanced that it was deemed useless to renew the search before the next morning  next day accordingly the quest for the clever sheepstealer became general and keen to all appearance at least  but the intended punishment was cruelly disproportioned to the transgression and the sympathy of a great many countryfolk in that district was strongly on the side of the fugitive  moreover his marvellous coolness and daring in hobandnobbing with the hangman under the unprecedented circumstances of the shepherds party won their admiration  so that it may be questioned if all those who ostensibly made themselves so busy in exploring woods and fields and lanes were quite so thorough when it came to the private examination of their own lofts and outhouses  stories were afloat of a mysterious figure being occasionally seen in some old overgrown trackway or other remote from turnpike roads but when a search was instituted in any of these suspected quarters nobody was found  thus the days and weeks passed without tidings  in brief the bassvoiced man of the chimneycorner was never recaptured some said that he went across the sea others that he did not but buried himself in the depths of a populous city  at any rate the gentleman in cindergray never did his mornings work at casterbridge nor met anywhere at all for business purposes the genial comrade with whom he had passed an hour of relaxation in the lonely house on the coomb  the grass has long been green on the graves of shepherd fennel and his frugal wife the guests who made up the christening party have mainly followed their entertainers to the tomb the baby in whose honour they all had met is a matron in the sere and yellow leaf  but the arrival of the three strangers at the shepherds that night and the details connected therewith is a story as well known as ever in the country about higher crowstairs  march 1883     the withered arm   chapter ia lorn milkmaid   it was an eightycow dairy and the troop of milkers regular and supernumerary were all at work for though the time of year was as yet but early april the feed lay entirely in watermeadows and the cows were in full pail  the hour was about six in the evening and three fourths of the large red rectangular animals having been finished off there was opportunity for a little conversation  he do bring home his bride tomorrow i hear  theyve come as far as anglebury today  the voice seemed to proceed from the belly of the cow called cherry but the speaker was a milkingwoman whose face was buried in the flank of that motionless beast  hav anybody seen her said another  there was a negative response from the first  though they say shes a rosycheeked tistytosty little body enough she added and as the milkmaid spoke she turned her face so that she could glance past her cows tail to the other side of the barton where a thin fading woman of thirty milked somewhat apart from the rest  years younger than he they say continued the second with also a glance of reflectiveness in the same direction  how old do you call him then  thirty or so  more like forty broke in an old milkman near in a long white pinafore or wropper and with the brim of his hat tied down so that he looked like a woman  a was born before our great weir was builded and i hadnt mans wages when i laved water there  the discussion waxed so warm that the purr of the milkstreams became jerky till a voice from another cows belly cried with authority now then what the turk do it matter to us about farmer lodges age or farmer lodges new misess  i shall have to pay him nine pound a year for the rent of every one of these milchers whatever his age or hers get on with your work or twill be dark afore we have done  the evening is pinking in aready  this speaker was the dairyman himself by whom the milkmaids and men were employed  nothing more was said publicly about farmer lodges wedding but the first woman murmured under her cow to her next neighbour tis hard for she signifying the thin worn milkmaid aforesaid  o no said the second  he hant spoke to rhoda brook for years  when the milking was done they washed their pails and hung them on a many forked stand made of the peeled limb of an oaktree set upright in the earth and resembling a colossal antlered horn  the majority then dispersed in various directions homeward  the thin woman who had not spoken was joined by a boy of twelve or thereabout and the twain went away up the field also  their course lay apart from that of the others to a lonely spot high above the watermeads and not far from the border of egdon heath whose dark countenance was visible in the distance as they drew nigh to their home  theyve just been saying down in barton that your father brings his young wife home from anglebury tomorrow the woman observed  i shall want to send you for a few things to market and youll be pretty sure to meet em  yes mother said the boy  is father married then  yes    you can give her a look and tell me whats shes like if you do see her  yes mother  if shes dark or fair and if shes tallas tall as i  and if she seems like a woman who has ever worked for a living or one that has been always well off and has never done anything and shows marks of the lady on her as i expect she do  yes  they crept up the hill in the twilight and entered the cottage  it was built of mudwalls the surface of which had been washed by many rains into channels and depressions that left none of the original flat face visible while here and there in the thatch above a rafter showed like a bone protruding through the skin  she was kneeling down in the chimneycorner before two pieces of turf laid together with the heather inwards blowing at the redhot ashes with her breath till the turves flamed  the radiance lit her pale cheek and made her dark eyes that had once been handsome seem handsome anew yes she resumed see if she is dark or fair and if you can notice if her hands be white if not see if they look as though she had ever done housework or are milkers hands like mine  the boy again promised inattentively this time his mother not observing that he was cutting a notch with his pocketknife in the beechbacked chair    chapter iithe young wife   the road from anglebury to holmstoke is in general level but there is one place where a sharp ascent breaks its monotony  farmers homeward bound from the former markettown who trot all the rest of the way walk their horses up this short incline  the next evening while the sun was yet bright a handsome new gig with a lemoncoloured body and red wheels was spinning westward along the level highway at the heels of a powerful mare  the driver was a yeoman in the prime of life cleanly shaven like an actor his face being toned to that bluishvermilion hue which so often graces a thriving farmers features when returning home after successful dealings in the town beside him sat a woman many years his junioralmost indeed a girl her face too was fresh in colour but it was of a totally different qualitysoft and evanescent like the light under a heap of rosepetals  few people travelled this way for it was not a main road and the long white riband of gravel that stretched before them was empty save of one small scarcemoving speck which presently resolved itself into the figure of boy who was creeping on at a snails pace and continually looking behind himthe heavy bundle he carried being some excuse for if not the reason of his dilatoriness  when the bouncing gigparty slowed at the bottom of the incline above mentioned the pedestrian was only a few yards in front  supporting the large bundle by putting one hand on his hip he turned and looked straight at the farmers wife as though he would read her through and through pacing along abreast of the horse  the low sun was full in her face rendering every feature shade and contour distinct from the curve of her little nostril to the colour of her eyes  the farmer though he seemed annoyed at the boys persistent presence did not order him to get out of the way and thus the lad preceded them his hard gaze never leaving her till they reached the top of the ascent when the farmer trotted on with relief in his lineamentshaving taken no outward notice of the boy whatever  how that poor lad stared at me said the young wife  yes dear i saw that he did  he is one of the village i suppose  one of the neighbourhood  i think he lives with his mother a mile or two off  he knows who we are no doubt  o yes  you must expect to be stared at just at first my pretty gertrude  i dothough i think the poor boy may have looked at us in the hope we might relieve him of his heavy load rather than from curiosity  o no said her husband offhandedly  these country lads will carry a hundredweight once they get it on their backs besides his pack had more size than weight in it  now then another mile and i shall be able to show you our house in the distanceif it is not too dark before we get there  the wheels spun round and particles flew from their periphery as before till a white house of ample dimensions revealed itself with farmbuildings and ricks at the back  meanwhile the boy had quickened his pace and turning up a bylane some mile and half short of the white farmstead ascended towards the leaner pastures and so on to the cottage of his mother  she had reached home after her days milking at the outlying dairy and was washing cabbage at the doorway in the declining light  hold up the net a moment she said without preface as the boy came up  he flung down his bundle held the edge of the cabbagenet and as she filled its meshes with the dripping leaves she went on well did you see her  yes quite plain  is she ladylike  yes and more  a lady complete  is she young  well shes growed up and her ways be quite a womans  of course  what colour is her hair and face  her hair is lightish and her face as comely as a live dolls  her eyes then are not dark like mine  noof a bluish turn and her mouth is very nice and red and when she smiles her teeth show white  is she tall said the woman sharply  i couldnt see  she was sitting down  then do you go to holmstoke church tomorrow morning shes sure to be there  go early and notice her walking in and come home and tell me if shes taller than i  very well mother  but why dont you go and see for yourself  i go to see her  i wouldnt look up at her if she were to pass my window this instant  she was with mr lodge of course  what did he say or do  just the same as usual  took no notice of you  none  next day the mother put a clean shirt on the boy and started him off for holmstoke church  he reached the ancient little pile when the door was just being opened and he was the first to enter  taking his seat by the font he watched all the parishioners file in  the welltodo farmer lodge came nearly last and his young wife who accompanied him walked up the aisle with the shyness natural to a modest woman who had appeared thus for the first time  as all other eyes were fixed upon her the youths stare was not noticed now  when he reached home his mother said well before he had entered the room  she is not tall  she is rather short he replied  ah said his mother with satisfaction  but shes very prettyvery  in fact shes lovely  the youthful freshness of the yeomans wife had evidently made an impression even on the somewhat hard nature of the boy  thats all i want to hear said his mother quickly  now spread the tablecloth  the hare you caught is very tender but mind that nobody catches youyouve never told me what sort of hands she had  i have never seen em  she never took off her gloves  what did she wear this morning  a white bonnet and a silvercoloured gownd  it whewed and whistled so loud when it rubbed against the pews that the lady coloured up more than ever for very shame at the noise and pulled it in to keep it from touching but when she pushed into her seat it whewed more than ever mr lodge he seemed pleased and his waistcoat stuck out and his great golden seals hung like a lords but she seemed to wish her noisy gownd anywhere but on her  not she  however that will do now  these descriptions of the newlymarried couple were continued from time to time by the boy at his mothers request after any chance encounter he had had with them  but rhoda brook though she might easily have seen young mrs lodge for herself by walking a couple of miles would never attempt an excursion towards the quarter where the farmhouse lay  neither did she at the daily milking in the dairymans yard on lodges outlying second farm ever speak on the subject of the recent marriage  the dairyman who rented the cows of lodge and knew perfectly the tall milkmaids history with manly kindliness always kept the gossip in the cowbarton from annoying rhoda  but the atmosphere thereabout was full of the subject during the first days of mrs lodges arrival and from her boys description and the casual words of the other milkers rhoda brook could raise a mental image of the unconscious mrs lodge that was realistic as a photograph    chapter iiia vision   one night two or three weeks after the bridal return when the boy was gone to bed rhoda sat a long time over the turf ashes that she had raked out in front of her to extinguish them  she contemplated so intently the new wife as presented to her in her minds eye over the embers that she forgot the lapse of time  at last wearied with her days work she too retired  but the figure which had occupied her so much during this and the previous days was not to be banished at night  for the first time gertrude lodge visited the supplanted woman in her dreams  rhoda brook dreamedsince her assertion that she really saw before falling asleep was not to be believedthat the young wife in the pale silk dress and white bonnet but with features shockingly distorted and wrinkled as by age was sitting upon her chest as she lay  the pressure of mrs lodges person grew heavier the blue eyes peered cruelly into her face and then the figure thrust forward its left hand mockingly so as to make the weddingring it wore glitter in rhodas eyes  maddened mentally and nearly suffocated by pressure the sleeper struggled the incubus still regarding her withdrew to the foot of the bed only however to come forward by degrees resume her seat and flash her left hand as before  gasping for breath rhoda in a last desperate effort swung out her right hand seized the confronting spectre by its obtrusive left arm and whirled it backward to the floor starting up herself as she did so with a low cry  o merciful heaven she cried sitting on the edge of the bed in a cold sweat that was not a dreamshe was here  she could feel her antagonists arm within her grasp even nowthe very flesh and bone of it as it seemed  she looked on the floor whither she had whirled the spectre but there was nothing to be seen  rhoda brook slept no more that night and when she went milking at the next dawn they noticed how pale and haggard she looked  the milk that she drew quivered into the pail her hand had not calmed even yet and still retained the feel of the arm  she came home to breakfast as wearily as if it had been suppertime  what was that noise in your chimmer mother last night said her son you fell off the bed surely  did you hear anything fall  at what time  just when the clock struck two  she could not explain and when the meal was done went silently about her household work the boy assisting her for he hated going afield on the farms and she indulged his reluctance  between eleven and twelve the gardengate clicked and she lifted her eyes to the window  at the bottom of the garden within the gate stood the woman of her vision rhoda seemed transfixed  ah she said she would come exclaimed the boy also observing her  said sowhen  how does she know us  i have seen and spoken to her  i talked to her yesterday  i told you said the mother flushing indignantly never to speak to anybody in that house or go near the place  i did not speak to her till she spoke to me  and i did not go near the place  i met her in the road  what did you tell her  nothing  she said are you the poor boy who had to bring the heavy load from market  and she looked at my boots and said they would not keep my feet dry if it came on wet because they were so cracked  i told her i lived with my mother and we had enough to do to keep ourselves and thats how it was and she said then ill come and bring you some better boots and see your mother  she gives away things to other folks in the meads besides us  mrs lodge was by this time close to the doornot in her silk as rhoda had seen her in the bedchamber but in a morning hat and gown of common light material which became her better than silk  on her arm she carried a basket  the impression remaining from the nights experience was still strong brook had almost expected to see the wrinkles the scorn and the cruelty on her visitors face  she would have escaped an interview had escape been possible  there was however no backdoor to the cottage and in an instant the boy had lifted the latch to mrs lodges gentle knock  i see i have come to the right house said she glancing at the lad and smiling  but i was not sure till you opened the door  the figure and action were those of the phantom but her voice was so indescribably sweet her glance so winning her smile so tender so unlike that of rhodas midnight visitant that the latter could hardly believe the evidence of her senses  she was truly glad that she had not hidden away in sheer aversion as she had been inclined to do  in her basket mrs lodge brought the pair of boots that she had promised to the boy and other useful articles  at these proofs of a kindly feeling towards her and hers rhodas heart reproached her bitterly  this innocent young thing should have her blessing and not her curse  when she left them a light seemed gone from the dwelling  two days later she came again to know if the boots fitted and less than a fortnight after that paid rhoda another call  on this occasion the boy was absent  i walk a good deal said mrs lodge and your house is the nearest outside our own parish  i hope you are well  you dont look quite well  rhoda said she was well enough and indeed though the paler of the two there was more of the strength that endures in her welldefined features and large frame than in the softcheeked young woman before her  the conversation became quite confidential as regarded their powers and weaknesses and when mrs lodge was leaving rhoda said i hope you will find this air agree with you maam and not suffer from the damp of the watermeads  the younger one replied that there was not much doubt of it her general health being usually good  though now you remind me she added i have one little ailment which puzzles me  it is nothing serious but i cannot make it out  she uncovered her left hand and arm and their outline confronted rhodas gaze as the exact original of the limb she had beheld and seized in her dream  upon the pink round surface of the arm were faint marks of an unhealthy colour as if produced by a rough grasp  rhodas eyes became riveted on the discolorations she fancied that she discerned in them the shape of her own four fingers  how did it happen she said mechanically  i cannot tell replied mrs lodge shaking her head  one night when i was sound asleep dreaming i was away in some strange place a pain suddenly shot into my arm there and was so keen as to awaken me  i must have struck it in the daytime i suppose though i dont remember doing so  she added laughing i tell my dear husband that it looks just as if he had flown into a rage and struck me there  o i daresay it will soon disappear  ha ha  yes    on what night did it come  mrs lodge considered and said it would be a fortnight ago on the morrow  when i awoke i could not remember where i was she added till the clock striking two reminded me  she had named the night and the hour of rhodas spectral encounter and brook felt like a guilty thing  the artless disclosure startled her she did not reason on the freaks of coincidence and all the scenery of that ghastly night returned with double vividness to her mind  o can it be she said to herself when her visitor had departed that i exercise a malignant power over people against my own will  she knew that she had been slily called a witch since her fall but never having understood why that particular stigma had been attached to her it had passed disregarded  could this be the explanation and had such things as this ever happened before    chapter iva suggestion   the summer drew on and rhoda brook almost dreaded to meet mrs lodge again notwithstanding that her feeling for the young wife amounted well nigh to affection  something in her own individuality seemed to convict rhoda of crime  yet a fatality sometimes would direct the steps of the latter to the outskirts of holmstoke whenever she left her house for any other purpose than her daily work and hence it happened that their next encounter was out of doors  rhoda could not avoid the subject which had so mystified her and after the first few words she stammered i hope yourarm is well again maam  she had perceived with consternation that gertrude lodge carried her left arm stiffly  no it is not quite well  indeed it is no better at all it is rather worse  it pains me dreadfully sometimes  perhaps you had better go to a doctor maam  she replied that she had already seen a doctor  her husband had insisted upon her going to one  but the surgeon had not seemed to understand the afflicted limb at all he had told her to bathe it in hot water and she had bathed it but the treatment had done no good  will you let me see it said the milkwoman  mrs lodge pushed up her sleeve and disclosed the place which was a few inches above the wrist  as soon as rhoda brook saw it she could hardly preserve her composure  there was nothing of the nature of a wound but the arm at that point had a shrivelled look and the outline of the four fingers appeared more distinct than at the former time  moreover she fancied that they were imprinted in precisely the relative position of her clutch upon the arm in the trance the first finger towards gertrudes wrist and the fourth towards her elbow  what the impress resembled seemed to have struck gertrude herself since their last meeting  it looks almost like fingermarks she said adding with a faint laugh my husband says it is as if some witch or the devil himself had taken hold of me there and blasted the flesh  rhoda shivered  thats fancy she said hurriedly  i wouldnt mind it if i were you  i shouldnt so much mind it said the younger with hesitation ifif i hadnt a notion that it makes my husbanddislike meno love me less men think so much of personal appearance  some dohe for one  yes and he was very proud of mine at first  keep your arm covered from his sight  ahhe knows the disfigurement is there  she tried to hide the tears that filled her eyes  well maam i earnestly hope it will go away soon  and so the milkwomans mind was chained anew to the subject by a horrid sort of spell as she returned home  the sense of having been guilty of an act of malignity increased affect as she might to ridicule her superstition  in her secret heart rhoda did not altogether object to a slight diminution of her successors beauty by whatever means it had come about but she did not wish to inflict upon her physical pain  for though this pretty young woman had rendered impossible any reparation which lodge might have made rhoda for his past conduct everything like resentment at the unconscious usurpation had quite passed away from the elders mind  if the sweet and kindly gertrude lodge only knew of the scene in the bed chamber what would she think  not to inform her of it seemed treachery in the presence of her friendliness but tell she could not of her own accordneither could she devise a remedy  she mused upon the matter the greater part of the night and the next day after the morning milking set out to obtain another glimpse of gertrude lodge if she could being held to her by a gruesome fascination by watching the house from a distance the milkmaid was presently able to discern the farmers wife in a ride she was taking aloneprobably to join her husband in some distant field  mrs lodge perceived her and cantered in her direction  good morning rhoda gertrude said when she had come up  i was going to call  rhoda noticed that mrs lodge held the reins with some difficulty  i hopethe bad arm said rhoda  they tell me there is possibly one way by which i might be able to find out the cause and so perhaps the cure of it replied the other anxiously  it is by going to some clever man over in egdon heath  they did not know if he was still aliveand i cannot remember his name at this moment but they said that you knew more of his movements than anybody else hereabout and could tell me if he were still to be consulted  dear mewhat was his name  but you know  not conjuror trendle said her thin companion turning pale  trendleyes  is he alive  i believe so said rhoda with reluctance  why do you call him conjuror  wellthey saythey used to say he was ahe had powers other folks have not  o how could my people be so superstitious as to recommend a man of that sort  i thought they meant some medical man  i shall think no more of him  rhoda looked relieved and mrs lodge rode on  the milkwoman had inwardly seen from the moment she heard of her having been mentioned as a reference for this man that there must exist a sarcastic feeling among the workfolk that a sorceress would know the whereabouts of the exorcist  they suspected her then  a short time ago this would have given no concern to a woman of her commonsense  but she had a haunting reason to be superstitious now and she had been seized with sudden dread that this conjuror trendle might name her as the malignant influence which was blasting the fair person of gertrude and so lead her friend to hate her for ever and to treat her as some fiend in human shape  but all was not over  two days after a shadow intruded into the window pattern thrown on rhoda brooks floor by the afternoon sun  the woman opened the door at once almost breathlessly  are you alone said gertrude  she seemed to be no less harassed and anxious than brook herself  yes said rhoda  the place on my arm seems worse and troubles me the young farmers wife went on  it is so mysterious  i do hope it will not be an incurable wound  i have again been thinking of what they said about conjuror trendle  i dont really believe in such men but i should not mind just visiting him from curiositythough on no account must my husband know  is it far to where he lives  yesfive miles said rhoda backwardly  in the heart of egdon  well i should have to walk  could not you go with me to show me the waysay tomorrow afternoon  o not ithat is the milkwoman murmured with a start of dismay again the dread seized her that something to do with her fierce act in the dream might be revealed and her character in the eyes of the most useful friend she had ever had be ruined irretrievably  mrs lodge urged and rhoda finally assented though with much misgiving sad as the journey would be to her she could not conscientiously stand in the way of a possible remedy for her patrons strange affliction  it was agreed that to escape suspicion of their mystic intent they should meet at the edge of the heath at the corner of a plantation which was visible from the spot where they now stood    chapter vconjuror trendle   by the next afternoon rhoda would have done anything to escape this inquiry  but she had promised to go  moreover there was a horrid fascination at times in becoming instrumental in throwing such possible light on her own character as would reveal her to be something greater in the occult world than she had ever herself suspected  she started just before the time of day mentioned between them and half anhours brisk walking brought her to the southeastern extension of the egdon tract of country where the fir plantation was  a slight figure cloaked and veiled was already there  rhoda recognized almost with a shudder that mrs lodge bore her left arm in a sling  they hardly spoke to each other and immediately set out on their climb into the interior of this solemn country which stood high above the rich alluvial soil they had left halfanhour before  it was a long walk thick clouds made the atmosphere dark though it was as yet only early afternoon and the wind howled dismally over the hills of the heathnot improbably the same heath which had witnessed the agony of the wessex king ina presented to afterages as lear  gertrude lodge talked most rhoda replying with monosyllabic preoccupation  she had a strange dislike to walking on the side of her companion where hung the afflicted arm moving round to the other when inadvertently near it  much heather had been brushed by their feet when they descended upon a carttrack beside which stood the house of the man they sought  he did not profess his remedial practices openly or care anything about their continuance his direct interests being those of a dealer in furze turf sharp sand and other local products  indeed he affected not to believe largely in his own powers and when warts that had been shown him for cure miraculously disappearedwhich it must be owned they infallibly didhe would say lightly o i only drink a glass of grog upon emperhaps its all chance and immediately turn the subject  he was at home when they arrived having in fact seen them descending into his valley  he was a graybearded man with a reddish face and he looked singularly at rhoda the first moment he beheld her  mrs lodge told him her errand and then with words of selfdisparagement he examined her arm  medicine cant cure it he said promptly  tis the work of an enemy  rhoda shrank into herself and drew back  an enemy  what enemy asked mrs lodge  he shook his head  thats best known to yourself he said  if you like i can show the person to you though i shall not myself know who it is  i can do no more and dont wish to do that  she pressed him on which he told rhoda to wait outside where she stood and took mrs lodge into the room  it opened immediately from the door and as the latter remained ajar rhoda brook could see the proceedings without taking part in them  he brought a tumbler from the dresser nearly filled it with water and fetching an egg prepared it in some private way after which he broke it on the edge of the glass so that the white went in and the yolk remained  as it was getting gloomy he took the glass and its contents to the window and told gertrude to watch them closely  they leant over the table together and the milkwoman could see the opaline hue of the eggfluid changing form as it sank in the water but she was not near enough to define the shape that it assumed  do you catch the likeness of any face or figure as you look demanded the conjuror of the young woman  she murmured a reply in tones so low as to be inaudible to rhoda and continued to gaze intently into the glass  rhoda turned and walked a few steps away  when mrs lodge came out and her face was met by the light it appeared exceedingly paleas pale as rhodasagainst the sad dun shades of the uplands garniture  trendle shut the door behind her and they at once started homeward together  but rhoda perceived that her companion had quite changed  did he charge much she asked tentatively  o nonothing  he would not take a farthing said gertrude  and what did you see inquired rhoda  nothing icare to speak of  the constraint in her manner was remarkable her face was so rigid as to wear an oldened aspect faintly suggestive of the face in rhodas bedchamber  was it you who first proposed coming here mrs lodge suddenly inquired after a long pause  how very odd if you did  no  but i am not sorry we have come all things considered she replied  for the first time a sense of triumph possessed her and she did not altogether deplore that the young thing at her side should learn that their lives had been antagonized by other influences than their own  the subject was no more alluded to during the long and dreary walk home but in some way or other a story was whispered about the manydairied lowland that winter that mrs lodges gradual loss of the use of her left arm was owing to her being overlooked by rhoda brook  the latter kept her own counsel about the incubus but her face grew sadder and thinner and in the spring she and her boy disappeared from the neighbourhood of holmstoke    chapter via second attempt   halfadozen years passed away and mr and mrs lodges married experience sank into prosiness and worse  the farmer was usually gloomy and silent the woman whom he had wooed for her grace and beauty was contorted and disfigured in the left limb moreover she had brought him no child which rendered it likely that he would be the last of a family who had occupied that valley for some two hundred years  he thought of rhoda brook and her son and feared this might be a judgment from heaven upon him  the once blithehearted and enlightened gertrude was changing into an irritable superstitious woman whose whole time was given to experimenting upon her ailment with every quack remedy she came across she was honestly attached to her husband and was ever secretly hoping against hope to win back his heart again by regaining some at least of her personal beauty  hence it arose that her closet was lined with bottles packets and ointmentpots of every descriptionnay bunches of mystic herbs charms and books of necromancy which in her schoolgirl time she would have ridiculed as folly  damned if you wont poison yourself with these apothecary messes and witch mixtures some time or other said her husband when his eye chanced to fall upon the multitudinous array  she did not reply but turned her sad soft glance upon him in such heart swollen reproach that he looked sorry for his words and added i only meant it for your good you know gertrude  ill clear out the whole lot and destroy them said she huskily and try such remedies no more  you want somebody to cheer you he observed  i once thought of adopting a boy but he is too old now  and he is gone away i dont know where  she guessed to whom he alluded for rhoda brooks story had in the course of years become known to her though not a word had ever passed between her husband and herself on the subject  neither had she ever spoken to him of her visit to conjuror trendle and of what was revealed to her or she thought was revealed to her by that solitary heathman  she was now fiveandtwenty but she seemed older  six years of marriage and only a few months of love she sometimes whispered to herself  and then she thought of the apparent cause and said with a tragic glance at her withering limb if i could only again be as i was when he first saw me  she obediently destroyed her nostrums and charms but there remained a hankering wish to try something elsesome other sort of cure altogether she had never revisited trendle since she had been conducted to the house of the solitary by rhoda against her will but it now suddenly occurred to gertrude that she would in a last desperate effort at deliverance from this seeming curse again seek out the man if he yet lived  he was entitled to a certain credence for the indistinct form he had raised in the glass had undoubtedly resembled the only woman in the world whoas she now knew though not thencould have a reason for bearing her ill will  the visit should be paid  this time she went alone though she nearly got lost on the heath and roamed a considerable distance out of her way  trendles house was reached at last however he was not indoors and instead of waiting at the cottage she went to where his bent figure was pointed out to her at work a long way off  trendle remembered her and laying down the handful of furzeroots which he was gathering and throwing into a heap he offered to accompany her in her homeward direction as the distance was considerable and the days were short  so they walked together his head bowed nearly to the earth and his form of a colour with it  you can send away warts and other excrescences i know she said why cant you send away this  and the arm was uncovered  you think too much of my powers said trendle and i am old and weak now too  no no it is too much for me to attempt in my own person what have ye tried  she named to him some of the hundred medicaments and counterspells which she had adopted from time to time  he shook his head  some were good enough he said approvingly but not many of them for such as this  this is of the nature of a blight not of the nature of a wound and if you ever do throw it off it will be all at once  if i only could  there is only one chance of doing it known to me  it has never failed in kindred afflictionsthat i can declare  but it is hard to carry out and especially for a woman  tell me said she  you must touch with the limb the neck of a man whos been hanged  she started a little at the image he had raised  before hes coldjust after hes cut down continued the conjuror impassively  how can that do good  it will turn the blood and change the constitution  but as i say to do it is hard  you must get into jail and wait for him when hes brought off the gallows  lots have done it though perhaps not such pretty women as you  i used to send dozens for skin complaints  but that was in former times  the last i sent was in 13near twenty years ago  he had no more to tell her and when he had put her into a straight track homeward turned and left her refusing all money as at first    chapter viia ride   the communication sank deep into gertrudes mind  her nature was rather a timid one and probably of all remedies that the white wizard could have suggested there was not one which would have filled her with so much aversion as this not to speak of the immense obstacles in the way of its adoption  casterbridge the countytown was a dozen or fifteen miles off and though in those days when men were executed for horsestealing arson and burglary an assize seldom passed without a hanging it was not likely that she could get access to the body of the criminal unaided  and the fear of her husbands anger made her reluctant to breathe a word of trendles suggestion to him or to anybody about him  she did nothing for months and patiently bore her disfigurement as before  but her womans nature craving for renewed love through the medium of renewed beauty she was but twentyfive was ever stimulating her to try what at any rate could hardly do her any harm  what came by a spell will go by a spell surely she would say  whenever her imagination pictured the act she shrank in terror from the possibility of it then the words of the conjuror it will turn your blood were seen to be capable of a scientific no less than a ghastly interpretation the mastering desire returned and urged her on again  there was at this time but one county paper and that her husband only occasionally borrowed  but oldfashioned days had oldfashioned means and news was extensively conveyed by word of mouth from market to market or from fair to fair so that whenever such an event as an execution was about to take place few within a radius of twenty miles were ignorant of the coming sight and so far as holmstoke was concerned some enthusiasts had been known to walk all the way to casterbridge and back in one day solely to witness the spectacle  the next assizes were in march and when gertrude lodge heard that they had been held she inquired stealthily at the inn as to the result as soon as she could find opportunity  she was however too late  the time at which the sentences were to be carried out had arrived and to make the journey and obtain admission at such short notice required at least her husbands assistance  she dared not tell him for she had found by delicate experiment that these smouldering village beliefs made him furious if mentioned partly because he half entertained them himself  it was therefore necessary to wait for another opportunity  her determination received a fillip from learning that two epileptic children had attended from this very village of holmstoke many years before with beneficial results though the experiment had been strongly condemned by the neighbouring clergy  april may june passed and it is no overstatement to say that by the end of the lastnamed month gertrude wellnigh longed for the death of a fellowcreature  instead of her formal prayers each night her unconscious prayer was o lord hang some guilty or innocent person soon  this time she made earlier inquiries and was altogether more systematic in her proceedings  moreover the season was summer between the haymaking and the harvest and in the leisure thus afforded him her husband had been holidaytaking away from home  the assizes were in july and she went to the inn as before  there was to be one executiononly onefor arson  her greatest problem was not how to get to casterbridge but what means she should adopt for obtaining admission to the jail  though access for such purposes had formerly never been denied the custom had fallen into desuetude and in contemplating her possible difficulties she was again almost driven to fall back upon her husband  but on sounding him about the assizes he was so uncommunicative so more than usually cold that she did not proceed and decided that whatever she did she would do alone  fortune obdurate hitherto showed her unexpected favour  on the thursday before the saturday fixed for the execution lodge remarked to her that he was going away from home for another day or two on business at a fair and that he was sorry he could not take her with him  she exhibited on this occasion so much readiness to stay at home that he looked at her in surprise  time had been when she would have shown deep disappointment at the loss of such a jaunt  however he lapsed into his usual taciturnity and on the day named left holmstoke  it was now her turn  she at first had thought of driving but on reflection held that driving would not do since it would necessitate her keeping to the turnpikeroad and so increase by tenfold the risk of her ghastly errand being found out  she decided to ride and avoid the beaten track notwithstanding that in her husbands stables there was no animal just at present which by any stretch of imagination could be considered a ladys mount in spite of his promise before marriage to always keep a mare for her  he had however many carthorses fine ones of their kind and among the rest was a serviceable creature an equine amazon with a back as broad as a sofa on which gertrude had occasionally taken an airing when unwell  this horse she chose  on friday afternoon one of the men brought it round  she was dressed and before going down looked at her shrivelled arm  ah she said to it if it had not been for you this terrible ordeal would have been saved me  when strapping up the bundle in which she carried a few articles of clothing she took occasion to say to the servant i take these in case i should not get back tonight from the person i am going to visit  dont be alarmed if i am not in by ten and close up the house as usual  i shall be at home tomorrow for certain  she meant then to privately tell her husband the deed accomplished was not like the deed projected he would almost certainly forgive her  and then the pretty palpitating gertrude lodge went from her husbands homestead but though her goal was casterbridge she did not take the direct route thither through stickleford  her cunning course at first was in precisely the opposite direction  as soon as she was out of sight however she turned to the left by a road which led into egdon and on entering the heath wheeled round and set out in the true course due westerly  a more private way down the county could not be imagined and as to direction she had merely to keep her horses head to a point a little to the right of the sun  she knew that she would light upon a furzecutter or cottager of some sort from time to time from whom she might correct her bearing  though the date was comparatively recent egdon was much less fragmentary in character than now  the attemptssuccessful and otherwiseat cultivation on the lower slopes which intrude and break up the original heath into small detached heaths had not been carried far enclosure acts had not taken effect and the banks and fences which now exclude the cattle of those villagers who formerly enjoyed rights of commonage thereon and the carts of those who had turbary privileges which kept them in firing all the year round were not erected  gertrude therefore rode along with no other obstacles than the prickly furze bushes the mats of heather the white watercourses and the natural steeps and declivities of the ground  her horse was sure if heavyfooted and slow and though a draught animal was easypaced had it been otherwise she was not a woman who could have ventured to ride over such a bit of country with a halfdead arm  it was therefore nearly eight oclock when she drew rein to breathe the mare on the last outlying high point of heathland towards casterbridge previous to leaving egdon for the cultivated valleys  she halted before a pool called rushypond flanked by the ends of two hedges a railing ran through the centre of the pond dividing it in half  over the railing she saw the low green country over the green trees the roofs of the town over the roofs a white flat facade denoting the entrance to the county jail  on the roof of this front specks were moving about they seemed to be workmen erecting something  her flesh crept  she descended slowly and was soon amid cornfields and pastures in another halfhour when it was almost dusk gertrude reached the white hart the first inn of the town on that side  little surprise was excited by her arrival farmers wives rode on horseback then more than they do now though for that matter mrs lodge was not imagined to be a wife at all the innkeeper supposed her some harumskarum young woman who had come to attend hangfair next day neither her husband nor herself ever dealt in casterbridge market so that she was unknown  while dismounting she beheld a crowd of boys standing at the door of a harnessmakers shop just above the inn looking inside it with deep interest  what is going on there she asked of the ostler  making the rope for tomorrow  she throbbed responsively and contracted her arm  tis sold by the inch afterwards the man continued  i could get you a bit miss for nothing if youd like  she hastily repudiated any such wish all the more from a curious creeping feeling that the condemned wretchs destiny was becoming interwoven with her own and having engaged a room for the night sat down to think  up to this time she had formed but the vaguest notions about her means of obtaining access to the prison  the words of the cunningman returned to her mind  he had implied that she should use her beauty impaired though it was as a passkey  in her inexperience she knew little about jail functionaries she had heard of a highsheriff and an undersheriff but dimly only  she knew however that there must be a hangman and to the hangman she determined to apply    chapter viiia waterside hermit   at this date and for several years after there was a hangman to almost every jail  gertrude found on inquiry that the casterbridge official dwelt in a lonely cottage by a deep slow river flowing under the cliff on which the prison buildings were situatethe stream being the selfsame one though she did not know it which watered the stickleford and holmstoke meads lower down in its course  having changed her dress and before she had eaten or drunkfor she could not take her ease till she had ascertained some particularsgertrude pursued her way by a path along the waterside to the cottage indicated  passing thus the outskirts of the jail she discerned on the level roof over the gateway three rectangular lines against the sky where the specks had been moving in her distant view she recognized what the erection was and passed quickly on  another hundred yards brought her to the executioners house which a boy pointed out it stood close to the same stream and was hard by a weir the waters of which emitted a steady roar  while she stood hesitating the door opened and an old man came forth shading a candle with one hand  locking the door on the outside he turned to a flight of wooden steps fixed against the end of the cottage and began to ascend them this being evidently the staircase to his bedroom  gertrude hastened forward but by the time she reached the foot of the ladder he was at the top  she called to him loudly enough to be heard above the roar of the weir he looked down and said what dye want here  to speak to you a minute  the candlelight such as it was fell upon her imploring pale upturned face and davies as the hangman was called backed down the ladder  i was just going to bed he said early to bed and early to rise but i dont mind stopping a minute for such a one as you  come into house  he reopened the door and preceded her to the room within  the implements of his daily work which was that of a jobbing gardener stood in a corner and seeing probably that she looked rural he said if you want me to undertake country work i cant come for i never leave casterbridge for gentle nor simplenot i  my real calling is officer of justice he added formally  yes yes  thats it  tomorrow  ah  i thought so  well whats the matter about that  tis no use to come here about the knotfolks do come continually but i tell em one knot is as merciful as another if ye keep it under the ear  is the unfortunate man a relation or i should say perhaps looking at her dress a person whos been in your employ  no  what time is the execution  the same as usualtwelve oclock or as soon after as the london mail coach gets in  we always wait for that in case of a reprieve  oa reprievei hope not she said involuntarily  wellhee heeas a matter of business so do i  but still if ever a young fellow deserved to be let off this one does only just turned eighteen and only present by chance when the rick was fired  howsomever theres not much risk of it as they are obliged to make an example of him there having been so much destruction of property that way lately  i mean she explained that i want to touch him for a charm a cure of an affliction by the advice of a man who has proved the virtue of the remedy  o yes miss  now i understand  ive had such people come in past years  but it didnt strike me that you looked of a sort to require bloodturning  whats the complaint  the wrong kind for this ill be bound  my arm  she reluctantly showed the withered skin  ahtis all ascram said the hangman examining it  yes said she  well he continued with interest that is the class o subject im bound to admit  i like the look of the place it is truly as suitable for the cure as any i ever saw  twas a knowingman that sent ee whoever he was  you can contrive for me all thats necessary she said breathlessly  you should really have gone to the governor of the jail and your doctor with ee and given your name and addressthats how it used to be done if i recollect  still perhaps i can manage it for a trifling fee  o thank you  i would rather do it this way as i should like it kept private  lover not to know eh  nohusband  aha  very well  ill get ee a touch of the corpse  where is it now she said shuddering  ithe you mean hes living yet  just inside that little small winder up there in the glum  he signified the jail on the cliff above  she thought of her husband and her friends  yes of course she said and how am i to proceed  he took her to the door  now do you be waiting at the little wicket in the wall that youll find up there in the lane not later than one oclock  i will open it from the inside as i shant come home to dinner till hes cut down  goodnight  be punctual and if you dont want anybody to know ee wear a veil  ahonce i had such a daughter as you  she went away and climbed the path above to assure herself that she would be able to find the wicket next day  its outline was soon visible to hera narrow opening in the outer wall of the prison precincts  the steep was so great that having reached the wicket she stopped a moment to breathe and looking back upon the waterside cot saw the hangman again ascending his outdoor staircase  he entered the loft or chamber to which it led and in a few minutes extinguished his light  the town clock struck ten and she returned to the white hart as she had come    chapter ixa rencounter   it was one oclock on saturday  gertrude lodge having been admitted to the jail as above described was sitting in a waitingroom within the second gate which stood under a classic archway of ashlar then comparatively modern and bearing the inscription covnty jail 1793 this had been the facade she saw from the heath the day before  near at hand was a passage to the roof on which the gallows stood  the town was thronged and the market suspended but gertrude had seen scarcely a soul  having kept her room till the hour of the appointment she had proceeded to the spot by a way which avoided the open space below the cliff where the spectators had gathered but she could even now hear the multitudinous babble of their voices out of which rose at intervals the hoarse croak of a single voice uttering the words last dying speech and confession  there had been no reprieve and the execution was over but the crowd still waited to see the body taken down  soon the persistent girl heard a trampling overhead then a hand beckoned to her and following directions she went out and crossed the inner paved court beyond the gatehouse her knees trembling so that she could scarcely walk  one of her arms was out of its sleeve and only covered by her shawl  on the spot at which she had now arrived were two trestles and before she could think of their purpose she heard heavy feet descending stairs somewhere at her back  turn her head she would not or could not and rigid in this position she was conscious of a rough coffin passing her shoulder borne by four men  it was open and in it lay the body of a young man wearing the smockfrock of a rustic and fustian breeches  the corpse had been thrown into the coffin so hastily that the skirt of the smockfrock was hanging over  the burden was temporarily deposited on the trestles  by this time the young womans state was such that a gray mist seemed to float before her eyes on account of which and the veil she wore she could scarcely discern anything it was as though she had nearly died but was held up by a sort of galvanism  now said a voice close at hand and she was just conscious that the word had been addressed to her  by a last strenuous effort she advanced at the same time hearing persons approaching behind her  she bared her poor curst arm and davies uncovering the face of the corpse took gertrudes hand and held it so that her arm lay across the dead mans neck upon a line the colour of an unripe blackberry which surrounded it  gertrude shrieked the turn o the blood predicted by the conjuror had taken place  but at that moment a second shriek rent the air of the enclosure it was not gertrudes and its effect upon her was to make her start round  immediately behind her stood rhoda brook her face drawn and her eyes red with weeping  behind rhoda stood gertrudes own husband his countenance lined his eyes dim but without a tear  dn you what are you doing here he said hoarsely  hussyto come between us and our child now cried rhoda  this is the meaning of what satan showed me in the vision  you are like her at last  and clutching the bare arm of the younger woman she pulled her unresistingly back against the wall  immediately brook had loosened her hold the fragile young gertrude slid down against the feet of her husband  when he lifted her up she was unconscious  the mere sight of the twain had been enough to suggest to her that the dead young man was rhodas son  at that time the relatives of an executed convict had the privilege of claiming the body for burial if they chose to do so and it was for this purpose that lodge was awaiting the inquest with rhoda  he had been summoned by her as soon as the young man was taken in the crime and at different times since and he had attended in court during the trial  this was the holiday he had been indulging in of late  the two wretched parents had wished to avoid exposure and hence had come themselves for the body a waggon and sheet for its conveyance and covering being in waiting outside  gertrudes case was so serious that it was deemed advisable to call to her the surgeon who was at hand  she was taken out of the jail into the town but she never reached home alive  her delicate vitality sapped perhaps by the paralyzed arm collapsed under the double shock that followed the severe strain physical and mental to which she had subjected herself during the previous twentyfour hours  her blood had been turned indeedtoo far  her death took place in the town three days after  her husband was never seen in casterbridge again once only in the old marketplace at anglebury which he had so much frequented and very seldom in public anywhere  burdened at first with moodiness and remorse he eventually changed for the better and appeared as a chastened and thoughtful man  soon after attending the funeral of his poor young wife he took steps towards giving up the farms in holmstoke and the adjoining parish and having sold every head of his stock he went away to port bredy at the other end of the county living there in solitary lodgings till his death two years later of a painless decline  it was then found that he had bequeathed the whole of his not inconsiderable property to a reformatory for boys subject to the payment of a small annuity to rhoda brook if she could be found to claim it  for some time she could not be found but eventually she reappeared in her old parishabsolutely refusing however to have anything to do with the provision made for her  her monotonous milking at the dairy was resumed and followed for many long years till her form became bent and her once abundant dark hair white and worn away at the foreheadperhaps by long pressure against the cows  here sometimes those who knew her experiences would stand and observe her and wonder what sombre thoughts were beating inside that impassive wrinkled brow to the rhythm of the alternating milkstreams  blackwoods magazine january 1888     fellowtownsmen   chapter i   the shepherd on the east hill could shout out lambing intelligence to the shepherd on the west hill over the intervening town chimneys without great inconvenience to his voice so nearly did the steep pastures encroach upon the burghers backyards  and at night it was possible to stand in the very midst of the town and hear from their native paddocks on the lower levels of greensward the mild lowing of the farmers heifers and the profound warm blowings of breath in which those creatures indulge  but the community which had jammed itself in the valley thus flanked formed a veritable town with a real mayor and corporation and a staple manufacture  during a certain damp evening fiveandthirty years ago before the twilight was far advanced a pedestrian of professional appearance carrying a small bag in his hand and an elevated umbrella was descending one of these hills by the turnpike road when he was overtaken by a phaeton  hullo downeis that you said the driver of the vehicle a young man of pale and refined appearance  jump up here with me and ride down to your door  the other turned a plump cheery rather selfindulgent face over his shoulder towards the hailer  o good evening mr barnetthanks he said and mounted beside his acquaintance  they were fellowburgesses of the town which lay beneath them but though old and very good friends they were differently circumstanced  barnet was a richer man than the struggling young lawyer downe a fact which was to some extent perceptible in downes manner towards his companion though nothing of it ever showed in barnets manner towards the solicitor  barnets position in the town was none of his own making his father had been a very successful flaxmerchant in the same place where the trade was still carried on as briskly as the small capacities of its quarters would allow  having acquired a fair fortune old mr barnet had retired from business bringing up his son as a gentlemanburgher and it must be added as a welleducated liberalminded young man  how is mrs barnet asked downe  mrs barnet was very well when i left home the other answered constrainedly exchanging his meditative regard of the horse for one of selfconsciousness  mr downe seemed to regret his inquiry and immediately took up another thread of conversation  he congratulated his friend on his election as a councilman he thought he had not seen him since that event took place mrs downe had meant to call and congratulate mrs barnet but he feared that she had failed to do so as yet  barnet seemed hampered in his replies  we should have been glad to see you  imy wife would welcome mrs downe at any time as you know    yes i am a member of the corporationrather an inexperienced member some of them say  it is quite true and i should have declined the honour as prematurehaving other things on my hands just now tooif it had not been pressed upon me so very heartily  there is one thing you have on your hands which i can never quite see the necessity for said downe with goodhumoured freedom  what the deuce do you want to build that new mansion for when you have already got such an excellent house as the one you live in  barnets face acquired a warmer shade of colour but as the question had been idly asked by the solicitor while regarding the surrounding flocks and fields he answered after a moment with no apparent embarrassment   well we wanted to get out of the town you know the house i am living in is rather old and inconvenient  mr downe declared that he had chosen a pretty site for the new building  they would be able to see for miles and miles from the windows  was he going to give it a name  he supposed so  barnet thought not  there was no other house near that was likely to be mistaken for it  and he did not care for a name  but i think it has a name  downe observed i went pastwhen was itthis morning and i saw somethingchateau ringdale i think it was stuck up on a board  it was an idea shewe had for a short time said barnet hastily  but we have decided finally to do without a nameat any rate such a name as that  it must have been a week ago that you saw it  it was taken down last saturday    upon that matter i am firm he added grimly  downe murmured in an unconvinced tone that he thought he had seen it yesterday  talking thus they drove into the town  the street was unusually still for the hour of seven in the evening an increasing drizzle had prevailed since the afternoon and now formed a gauze across the yellow lamps and trickled with a gentle rattle down the heavy roofs of stone tile that bent the houseridges hollowbacked with its weight and in some instances caused the walls to bulge outwards in the upper story  their route took them past the little townhall the blackbull hotel and onward to the junction of a small street on the right consisting of a row of those twoandtwo windowed brick residences of no particular age which are exactly alike wherever found except in the people they contain  waitill drive you up to your door said barnet when downe prepared to alight at the corner  he thereupon turned into the narrow street when the faces of three little girls could be discerned close to the panes of a lighted window a few yards ahead surmounted by that of a young matron the gaze of all four being directed eagerly up the empty street  you are a fortunate fellow downe barnet continued as mother and children disappeared from the window to run to the door  you must be happy if any man is  i would give a hundred such houses as my new one to have a home like yours  wellyes we get along pretty comfortably replied downe complacently  that house downe is none of my ordering barnet broke out revealing a bitterness hitherto suppressed and checking the horse a moment to finish his speech before delivering up his passenger  the house i have already is good enough for me as you supposed  it is my own freehold it was built by my grandfather and is stout enough for a castle  my father was born there lived there and died there  i was born there and have always lived there yet i must needs build a new one  why do you said downe  why do i  to preserve peace in the household  i do anything for that but i dont succeed  i was firm in resisting chateau ringdale however not that i would not have put up with the absurdity of the name but it was too much to have your house christened after lord ringdale because your wife once had a fancy for him  if you only knew everything you would think all attempt at reconciliation hopeless  in your happy home you have had no such experiences and god forbid that you ever should  see here they are all ready to receive you  of course  and so will your wife be waiting to receive you said downe  take my word for it she will  and with a dinner prepared for you far better than mine  i hope so barnet replied dubiously  he moved on to downes door which the solicitors family had already opened  downe descended but being encumbered with his bag and umbrella his foot slipped and he fell upon his knees in the gutter  o my dear charles said his wife running down the steps and quite ignoring the presence of barnet she seized hold of her husband pulled him to his feet and kissed him exclaiming i hope you are not hurt darling  the children crowded round chiming in piteously poor papa  hes all right said barnet perceiving that downe was only a little muddy and looking more at the wife than at the husband  almost at any other timecertainly during his fastidious bachelor yearshe would have thought her a too demonstrative woman but those recent circumstances of his own life to which he had just alluded made mrs downes solicitude so affecting that his eye grew damp as he witnessed it  bidding the lawyer and his family goodnight he left them and drove slowly into the main street towards his own house  the heart of barnet was sufficiently impressionable to be influenced by downes parting prophecy that he might not be so unwelcome home as he imagined the dreary night might at least on this one occasion make downes forecast true  hence it was in a suspense that he could hardly have believed possible that he halted at his door  on entering his wife was nowhere to be seen and he inquired for her  the servant informed him that her mistress had the dressmaker with her and would be engaged for some time  dressmaker at this time of day  she dined early sir and hopes you will excuse her joining you this evening  but she knew i was coming tonight  o yes sir  go up and tell her i am come  the servant did so but the mistress of the house merely transmitted her former words  barnet said nothing more and presently sat down to his lonely meal which was eaten abstractedly the domestic scene he had lately witnessed still impressing him by its contrast with the situation here  his mind fell back into past years upon a certain pleasing and gentle being whose face would loom out of their shades at such times as these  barnet turned in his chair and looked with unfocused eyes in a direction southward from where he sat as if he saw not the room but a long way beyond  i wonder if she lives there still he said    chapter ii   he rose with a sudden rebelliousness put on his hat and coat and went out of the house pursuing his way along the glistening pavement while eight oclock was striking from st marys tower and the apprentices and shopmen were slamming up the shutters from end to end of the town  in two minutes only those shops which could boast of no attendant save the master or the mistress remained with open eyes  these were ever somewhat less prompt to exclude customers than the others for their owners ears the closing hour had scarcely the cheerfulness that it possessed for the hired servants of the rest  yet the night being dreary the delay was not for long and their windows too blinked together one by one  during this time barnet had proceeded with decided step in a direction at right angles to the broad main thoroughfare of the town by a long street leading due southward  here though his family had no more to do with the flax manufacture his own name occasionally greeted him on gates and warehouses being used allusively by small rising tradesmen as a recommendation in such words as smith from barnet  corobinson late manager at barnets  the sight led him to reflect upon his fathers busy life and he questioned if it had not been far happier than his own  the houses along the road became fewer and presently open ground appeared between them on either side the track on the right hand rising to a higher level till it merged in a knoll  on the summit a row of builders scaffoldpoles probed the indistinct sky like spears and at their bases could be discerned the lower courses of a building lately begun  barnet slackened his pace and stood for a few moments without leaving the centre of the road apparently not much interested in the sight till suddenly his eye was caught by a post in the fore part of the ground bearing a white board at the top  he went to the rails vaulted over and walked in far enough to discern painted upon the board chateau ringdale  a dismal irony seemed to lie in the words and its effect was to irritate him  downe then had spoken truly  he stuck his umbrella into the sod and seized the post with both hands as if intending to loosen and throw it down  then like one bewildered by an opposition which would exist none the less though its manifestations were removed he allowed his arms to sink to his side  let it be he said to himself  i have declared there shall be peaceif possible  taking up his umbrella he quietly left the enclosure and went on his way still keeping his back to the town  he had advanced with more decision since passing the new building and soon a hoarse murmur rose upon the gloom it was the sound of the sea  the road led to the harbour at a distance of a mile from the town from which the trade of the district was fed  after seeing the obnoxious nameboard barnet had forgotten to open his umbrella and the rain tapped smartly on his hat and occasionally stroked his face as he went on  though the lamps were still continued at the roadside they stood at wider intervals than before and the pavement had given place to common road  every time he came to a lamp an increasing shine made itself visible upon his shoulders till at last they quite glistened with wet the murmur from the shore grew stronger but it was still some distance off when he paused before one of the smallest of the detached houses by the wayside standing in its own garden the latter being divided from the road by a row of wooden palings  scrutinizing the spot to ensure that he was not mistaken he opened the gate and gently knocked at the cottage door  when he had patiently waited minutes enough to lead any man in ordinary cases to knock again the door was heard to open though it was impossible to see by whose hand there being no light in the passage barnet said at random does miss savile live here  a youthful voice assured him that she did live there and by a sudden afterthought asked him to come in  it would soon get a light it said but the night being wet mother had not thought it worth while to trim the passage lamp  dont trouble yourself to get a light for me said barnet hastily it is not necessary at all  which is miss saviles sittingroom  the young person whose white pinafore could just be discerned signified a door in the side of the passage and barnet went forward at the same moment so that no light should fall upon his face  on entering the room he closed the door behind him pausing till he heard the retreating footsteps of the child  he found himself in an apartment which was simply and neatly though not poorly furnished everything from the miniature chiffonnier to the shining little daguerreotype which formed the central ornament of the mantelpiece being in scrupulous order  the picture was enclosed by a frame of embroidered cardboardevidently the work of feminine handsand it was the portrait of a thin faced elderly lieutenant in the navy  from behind the lamp on the table a female form now rose into view that of a young girl and a resemblance between her and the portrait was early discoverable  she had been so absorbed in some occupation on the other side of the lamp as to have barely found time to realize her visitors presence  they both remained standing for a few seconds without speaking  the face that confronted barnet had a beautiful outline the raffaelesque oval of its contour was remarkable for an english countenance and that countenance housed in a remote countryroad to an unheardof harbour  but her features did not do justice to this splendid beginning nature had recollected that she was not in italy and the young ladys lineaments though not so inconsistent as to make her plain would have been accepted rather as pleasing than as correct  the preoccupied expression which like images on the retina remained with her for a moment after the state that caused it had ceased now changed into a reserved halfproud and slightly indignant look in which the blood diffused itself quickly across her cheek and additional brightness broke the shade of her rather heavy eyes  i know i have no business here he said answering the look  but i had a great wish to see you and inquire how you were  you can give your hand to me seeing how often i have held it in past days  i would rather forget than remember all that mr barnet she answered as she coldly complied with the request  when i think of the circumstances of our last meeting i can hardly consider it kind of you to allude to such a thing as our pastor indeed to come here at all  there was no harm in it surely  i dont trouble you often lucy  i have not had the honour of a visit from you for a very long time certainly and i did not expect it now she said with the same stiffness in her air  i hope mrs barnet is very well  yes yes he impatiently returned  at least i suppose sothough i only speak from inference  but she is your wife sir said the young girl tremulously  the unwonted tones of a mans voice in that feminine chamber had startled a canary that was roosting in its cage by the window the bird awoke hastily and fluttered against the bars  she went and stilled it by laying her face against the cage and murmuring a coaxing sound  it might partly have been done to still herself  i didnt come to talk of mrs barnet he pursued i came to talk of you of yourself alone to inquire how you are getting on since your great loss  and he turned towards the portrait of her father  i am getting on fairly well thank you  the force of her utterance was scarcely borne out by her look but barnet courteously reproached himself for not having guessed a thing so natural and to dissipate all embarrassment added as he bent over the table what were you doing when i camepainting flowers and by candlelight  o no she said not painting themonly sketching the outlines  i do that at night to save timei have to get three dozen done by the end of the month  barnet looked as if he regretted it deeply  you will wear your poor eyes out he said with more sentiment than he had hitherto shown  you ought not to do it  there was a time when i should have said you must not  welli almost wish i had never seen light with my own eyes when i think of that  is this a time or place for recalling such matters she asked with dignity  you used to have a gentlemanly respect for me and for yourself  dont speak any more as you have spoken and dont come again i cannot think that this visit is serious or was closely considered by you  considered well i came to see you as an old and good friendnot to mince matters to visit a woman i loved  dont be angry  i could not help doing it so many things brought you into my mind    this evening i fell in with an acquaintance and when i saw how happy he was with his wife and family welcoming him home though with only onetenth of my income and chances and thought what might have been in my case it fairly broke down my discretion and off i came here  now i am here i feel that i am wrong to some extent  but the feeling that i should like to see you and talk of those we used to know in common was very strong  before that can be the case a little more time must pass said miss savile quietly a time long enough for me to regard with some calmness what at present i remember far too impatientlythough it may be you almost forget it  indeed you must have forgotten it long before you acted as you did  her voice grew stronger and more vivacious as she added but i am doing my best to forget it too and i know i shall succeed from the progress i have made already  she had remained standing till now when she turned and sat down facing half away from him  barnet watched her moodily  yes it is only what i deserve he said ambition pricked me onno it was not ambition it was wrongheadedness had i but reflected      he broke out vehemently but always remember this lucy if you had written to me only one little line after that misunderstanding i declare i should have come back to you  that ruined me he slowly walked as far as the little room would allow him to go and remained with his eyes on the skirting  but mr barnet how could i write to you  there was no opening for my doing so  then there ought to have been said barnet turning  that was my fault  well i dont know anything about that but as there had been nothing said by me which required any explanation by letter i did not send one everything was so indefinite and feeling your position to be so much wealthier than mine i fancied i might have mistaken your meaning  and when i heard of the other ladya woman of whose family even you might be proudi thought how foolish i had been and said nothing  then i suppose it was destinyaccidenti dont know what that separated us dear lucy  anyhow you were the woman i ought to have made my wifeand i let you slip like the foolish man that i was  o mr barnet she said almost in tears dont revive the subject to me i am the wrong one to console youthink siryou should not be hereit would be so bad for me if it were known  it wouldit would indeed he said hastily  i am not right in doing this and i wont do it again  it is a very common folly of human nature you know to think the course you did not adopt must have been the best she continued with gentle solicitude as she followed him to the door of the room  and you dont know that i should have accepted you even if you had asked me to be your wife  at this his eye met hers and she dropped her gaze  she knew that her voice belied her  there was a silence till she looked up to add in a voice of soothing playfulness my family was so much poorer than yours even before i lost my dear father thatperhaps your companions would have made it unpleasant for us on account of my deficiencies  your disposition would soon have won them round said barnet  she archly expostulated now never mind my disposition try to make it up with your wife  those are my commands to you  and now you are to leave me at once  i will  i must make the best of it all i suppose he replied more cheerfully than he had as yet spoken  but i shall never again meet with such a dear girl as you  and he suddenly opened the door and left her alone  when his glance again fell on the lamps that were sparsely ranged along the dreary level road his eyes were in a state which showed straw like motes of light radiating from each flame into the surrounding air  on the other side of the way barnet observed a man under an umbrella walking parallel with himself  presently this man left the footway and gradually converged on barnets course  the latter then saw that it was charlson a surgeon of the town who owed him money  charlson was a man not without ability yet he did not prosper  sundry circumstances stood in his way as a medical practitioner he was needy he was not a coddle he gossiped with men instead of with women he had married a stranger instead of one of the town young ladies and he was given to conversational buffoonery  moreover his look was quite erroneous  those only proper features in the family doctor the quiet eye and the thin straight passionless lips which never curl in public either for laughter or for scorn were not his he had a fullcurved mouth and a bold black eye that made timid people nervous  his companions were what in old times would have been called boon companionsan expression which though of irreproachable root suggests fraternization carried to the point of unscrupulousness  all this was against him in the little town of his adoption  charlson had been in difficulties and to oblige him barnet had put his name to a bill and as he had expected was called upon to meet it when it fell due  it had been only a matter of fifty pounds which barnet could well afford to lose and he bore no illwill to the thriftless surgeon on account of it  but charlson had a little too much brazen indifferentism in his composition to be altogether a desirable acquaintance  i hope to be able to make that little billbusiness right with you in the course of three weeks mr barnet said charlson with hailfellow friendliness  barnet replied goodnaturedly that there was no hurry  this particular three weeks had moved on in advance of charlsons present with the precision of a shadow for some considerable time  ive had a dream charlson continued  barnet knew from his tone that the surgeon was going to begin his characteristic nonsense and did not encourage him  ive had a dream repeated charlson who required no encouragement  i dreamed that a gentleman who has been very kind to me married a haughty lady in haste before he had quite forgotten a nice little girl he knew before and that one wet evening like the present as i was walking up the harbourroad i saw him come out of that dear little girls present abode  barnet glanced towards the speaker  the rays from a neighbouring lamp struck through the drizzle under charlsons umbrella so as just to illumine his face against the shade behind and show that his eye was turned up under the outer corner of its lid whence it leered with impish jocoseness as he thrust his tongue into his cheek  come said barnet gravely well have no more of that  no noof course not charlson hastily answered seeing that his humour had carried him too far as it had done many times before  he was profuse in his apologies but barnet did not reply  of one thing he was certainthat scandal was a plant of quick root and that he was bound to obey lucys injunction for lucys own sake    chapter iii   he did so to the letter and though as the crocus followed the snowdrop and the daffodil the crocus in lucys garden the harbourroad was a not unpleasant place to walk in barnets feet never trod its stones much less approached her door  he avoided a saunter that way as he would have avoided a dangerous dram and took his airings a long distance northward among severely square and brown ploughed fields where no other townsman came  sometimes he went round by the lower lanes of the borough where the ropewalks stretched in which his family formerly had share and looked at the ropemakers walking backwards overhung by appletrees and bushes and intruded on by cows and calves as if trade had established itself there at considerable inconvenience to nature  one morning when the sun was so warm as to raise a steam from the south eastern slopes of those flanking hills that looked so lovely above the old roofs but made every lowchimneyed house in the town as smoky as tophet barnet glanced from the windows of the towncouncil room for lack of interest in what was proceeding within  several members of the corporation were present but there was not much business doing and in a few minutes downe came leisurely across to him saying that he seldom saw barnet now  barnet owned that he was not often present  downe looked at the crimson curtain which hung down beside the panes reflecting its hot hues into their faces and then out of the window  at that moment there passed along the street a tall commanding lady in whom the solicitor recognized barnets wife  barnet had done the same thing and turned away  it will be all right some day said downe with cheering sympathy  you have heard then of her last outbreak  downe depressed his cheerfulness to its very reverse in a moment  no i have not heard of anything serious he said with as long a face as one naturally round could be turned into at short notice  i only hear vague reports of such things  you may think it will be all right said barnet drily  but i have a different opinion    no downe we must look the thing in the face not poppy nor mandragorahowever how are your wife and children  downe said that they were all well thanks they were out that morning somewhere he was just looking to see if they were walking that way  ah there they were just coming down the street and downe pointed to the figures of two children with a nursemaid and a lady walking behind them  you will come out and speak to her he asked  not this morning  the fact is i dont care to speak to anybody just now  you are too sensitive mr barnet  at school i remember you used to get as red as a rose if anybody uttered a word that hurt your feelings  barnet mused  yes he admitted there is a grain of truth in that  it is because of that i often try to make peace at home  life would be tolerable then at any rate even if not particularly bright  i have thought more than once of proposing a little plan to you said downe with some hesitation  i dont know whether it will meet your views but take it or leave it as you choose  in fact it was my wife who suggested it that she would be very glad to call on mrs barnet and get into her confidence  she seems to think that mrs barnet is rather alone in the town and without advisers  her impression is that your wife will listen to reason  emily has a wonderful way of winning the hearts of people of her own sex  and of the other sex too i think  she is a charming woman and you were a lucky fellow to find her  well perhaps i was simpered downe trying to wear an aspect of being the last man in the world to feel pride  however she will be likely to find out what ruffles mrs barnet  perhaps it is some misunderstanding you knowsomething that she is too proud to ask you to explain or some little thing in your conduct that irritates her because she does not fully comprehend you  the truth is emily would have been more ready to make advances if she had been quite sure of her fitness for mrs barnets society who has of course been accustomed to london people of good position which made emily fearful of intruding  barnet expressed his warmest thanks for the wellintentioned proposition there was reason in mrs downes fearthat he owned  but do let her call he said  there is no woman in england i would so soon trust on such an errand  i am afraid there will not be any brilliant result still i shall take it as the kindest and nicest thing if she will try it and not be frightened at a repulse  when barnet and downe had parted the former went to the town savings bank of which he was a trustee and endeavoured to forget his troubles in the contemplation of low sums of money and figures in a network of red and blue lines  he sat and watched the workingpeople making their deposits to which at intervals he signed his name  before he left in the afternoon downe put his head inside the door  emily has seen mrs barnet he said in a low voice  she has got mrs barnets promise to take her for a drive down to the shore tomorrow if it is fine  good afternoon  barnet shook downe by the hand without speaking and downe went away    chapter iv   the next day was as fine as the arrangement could possibly require  as the sun passed the meridian and declined westward the tall shadows from the scaffoldpoles of barnets rising residence streaked the ground as far as to the middle of the highway  barnet himself was there inspecting the progress of the works for the first time during several weeks  a building in an oldfashioned town fiveandthirty years ago did not as in the modern fashion rise from the sod like a booth at a fair  the foundations and lower courses were put in and allowed to settle for many weeks before the superstructure was built up and a whole summer of drying was hardly sufficient to do justice to the important issues involved  barnet stood within a windowniche which had as yet received no frame and thence looked down a slope into the road  the wheels of a chaise were heard and then his handsome xantippe in the company of mrs downe drove past on their way to the shore  they were driving slowly there was a pleasing light in mrs downes face which seemed faintly to reflect itself upon the countenance of her companionthat politesse du coeur which was so natural to her having possibly begun already to work results  but whatever the situation barnet resolved not to interfere or do anything to hazard the promise of the day  he might well afford to trust the issue to another when he could never direct it but to ill himself  his wifes clenched reinhand in its lemoncoloured glove her stiff erect figure clad in velvet and lace and her boldlyoutlined face passed on exhibiting their owner as one fixed for ever above the level of her companionsocially by her early breeding and materially by her higher cushion  barnet decided to allow them a proper time to themselves and then stroll down to the shore and drive them home  after lingering on at the house for another hour he started with this intention  a few hundred yards below chateau ringdale stood the cottage in which the late lieutenants daughter had her lodging  barnet had not been so far that way for a long time and as he approached the forbidden ground a curious warmth passed into him which led him to perceive that unless he were careful he might have to fight the battle with himself about lucy over again  a tenth of his present excuse would however have justified him in travelling by that road today  he came opposite the dwelling and turned his eyes for a momentary glance into the little garden that stretched from the palings to the door  lucy was in the enclosure she was walking and stooping to gather some flowers possibly for the purpose of painting them for she moved about quickly as if anxious to save time  she did not see him he might have passed unnoticed but a sensation which was not in strict unison with his previous sentiments that day led him to pause in his walk and watch her she went nimbly round and round the beds of anemones tulips jonquils polyanthuses and other oldfashioned flowers looking a very charming figure in her halfmourning bonnet and with an incomplete nosegay in her left hand  raising herself to pull down a lilac blossom she observed him  mr barnet she said innocently smiling  why i have been thinking of you many times since mrs barnet went by in the ponycarriage and now here you are  yes lucy he said  then she seemed to recall particulars of their last meeting and he believed that she flushed though it might have been only the fancy of his own supersensitivenesss  i am going to the harbour he added  are you lucy remarked simply  a great many people begin to go there now the summer is drawing on  her face had come more into his view as she spoke and he noticed how much thinner and paler it was than when he had seen it last  lucy how weary you look tell me can i help you he was going to cry outif i do he thought it will be the ruin of us both  he merely said that the afternoon was fine and went on his way  as he went a sudden blast of air came over the hill as if in contradiction to his words and spoilt the previous quiet of the scene the wind had already shifted violently and now smelt of the sea  the harbourroad soon began to justify its name  a gap appeared in the rampart of hills which shut out the sea and on the left of the opening rose a vertical cliff coloured a burning orange by the sunlight the companion cliff on the right being livid in shade  between these cliffs like the libyan bay which sheltered the shipwrecked trojans was a little haven seemingly a beginning made by nature herself of a perfect harbour which appealed to the passerby as only requiring a little human industry to finish it and make it famous the ground on each side as far back as the daisied slopes that bounded the interior valley being a mere layer of blown sand  but the portbredy burgesses a mile inland had in the course of ten centuries responded many times to that mute appeal with the result that the tides had invariably choked up their works with sand and shingle as soon as completed  there were but few houses here a rough pier a few boats some stores an inn a residence or two a ketch unloading in the harbour were the chief features of the settlement  on the open ground by the shore stood his wifes ponycarriage empty the boy in attendance holding the horse  when barnet drew nearer he saw an indigocoloured spot moving swiftly along beneath the radiant base of the eastern cliff which proved to be a man in a jersey running with all his might  he held up his hand to barnet as it seemed and they approached each other  the man was local but a stranger to him  what is it my man said barnet  a terrible calamity the boatman hastily explained  two ladies had been capsized in a boatthey were mrs downe and mrs barnet of the old town they had driven down there that afternoonthey had alighted and it was so fine that after walking about a little while they had been tempted to go out for a short sail round the cliff  just as they were putting in to the shore the wind shifted with a sudden gust the boat listed over and it was thought they were both drowned  how it could have happened was beyond his mind to fathom for john green knew how to sail a boat as well as any man there  which is the way to the place said barnet  it was just round the cliff  run to the carriage and tell the boy to bring it to the place as soon as you can  then go to the harbour inn and tell them to ride to town for a doctor  have they been got out of the water  one lady has  which  mrs barnet  mrs downe it is feared has fleeted out to sea  barnet ran on to that part of the shore which the cliff had hitherto obscured from his view and there discerned a long way ahead a group of fishermen standing  as soon as he came up one or two recognized him and not liking to meet his eye turned aside with misgiving  he went amidst them and saw a small sailingboat lying draggled at the waters edge and on the sloping shingle beside it a soaked and sandy womans form in the velvet dress and yellow gloves of his wife    chapter v   all had been done that could be done  mrs barnet was in her own house under medical hands but the result was still uncertain  barnet had acted as if devotion to his wife were the dominant passion of his existence  there had been much to decidewhether to attempt restoration of the apparently lifeless body as it lay on the shorewhether to carry her to the harbour innwhether to drive with her at once to his own house  the first course with no skilled help or appliances near at hand had seemed hopeless  the second course would have occupied nearly as much time as a drive to the town owing to the intervening ridges of shingle and the necessity of crossing the harbour by boat to get to the house added to which much time must have elapsed before a doctor could have arrived down there  by bringing her home in the carriage some precious moments had slipped by but she had been laid in her own bed in seven minutes a doctor called to her side and every possible restorative brought to bear upon her  at what a tearing pace he had driven up that road through the yellow evening sunlight the shadows flapping irksomely into his eyes as each wayside object rushed past between him and the west  tired workmen with their baskets at their backs had turned on their homeward journey to wonder at his speed  halfway between the shore and portbredy town he had met charlson who had been the first surgeon to hear of the accident he was accompanied by his assistant in a gig  barnet had sent on the latter to the coast in case that downes poor wife should by that time have been reclaimed from the waves and had brought charlson back with him to the house  barnets presence was not needed here and he felt it to be his next duty to set off at once and find downe that no other than himself might break the news to him  he was quite sure that no chance had been lost for mrs downe by his leaving the shore  by the time that mrs barnet had been laid in the carriage a much larger group had assembled to lend assistance in finding her friend rendering his own help superfluous  but the duty of breaking the news was made doubly painful by the circumstance that the catastrophe which had befallen mrs downe was solely the result of her own and her husbands lovingkindness towards himself  he found downe in his office  when the solicitor comprehended the intelligence he turned pale stood up and remained for a moment perfectly still as if bereft of his faculties then his shoulders heaved he pulled out his handkerchief and began to cry like a child  his sobs might have been heard in the next room  he seemed to have no idea of going to the shore or of doing anything but when barnet took him gently by the hand and proposed to start at once he quietly acquiesced neither uttering any further word nor making any effort to repress his tears  barnet accompanied him to the shore where finding that no trace had as yet been seen of mrs downe and that his stay would be of no avail he left downe with his friends and the young doctor and once more hastened back to his own house  at the door he met charlson  well  barnet said  i have just come down said the doctor we have done everything but without result  i sympathize with you in your bereavement  barnet did not much appreciate charlsons sympathy which sounded to his ears as something of a mockery from the lips of a man who knew what charlson knew about their domestic relations  indeed there seemed an odd spark in charlsons full black eye as he said the words but that might have been imaginary  and mr barnet charlson resumed that little matter between usi hope to settle it finally in three weeks at least  never mind that now said barnet abruptly  he directed the surgeon to go to the harbour in case his services might even now be necessary there and himself entered the house  the servants were coming from his wifes chamber looking helplessly at each other and at him  he passed them by and entered the room where he stood mutely regarding the bed for a few minutes after which he walked into his own dressingroom adjoining and there paced up and down  in a minute or two he noticed what a strange and total silence had come over the upper part of the house his own movements muffled as they were by the carpet seemed noisy and his thoughts to disturb the air like articulate utterances  his eye glanced through the window  far down the road to the harbour a roof detained his gaze out of it rose a red chimney and out of the red chimney a curl of smoke as from a fire newly kindled  he had often seen such a sight before  in that house lived lucy savile and the smoke was from the fire which was regularly lighted at this time to make her tea  after that he went back to the bedroom and stood there some time regarding his wifes silent form  she was a woman some years older than himself but had not by any means overpassed the maturity of good looks and vigour  her passionate features welldefined firm and statuesque in life were doubly so now her mouth and brow beneath her purplish black hair showed only too clearly that the turbulency of character which had made a beargarden of his house had been no temporary phase of her existence  while he reflected he suddenly said to himself i wonder if all has been done  the thought was led up to by his having fancied that his wifes features lacked in its complete form the expression which he had been accustomed to associate with the faces of those whose spirits have fled for ever the effacement of life was not so marked but that entering uninformed he might have supposed her sleeping  her complexion was that seen in the numerous faded portraits by sir joshua reynolds it was pallid in comparison with life but there was visible on a close inspection the remnant of what had once been a flush the keeping between the cheeks and the hollows of the face being thus preserved although positive colour was gone  long orange rays of evening sun stole in through chinks in the blind striking on the large mirror and being thence reflected upon the crimson hangings and woodwork of the heavy bedstead so that the general tone of light was remarkably warm and it was probable that something might be due to this circumstance  still the fact impressed him as strange  charlson had been gone more than a quarter of an hour could it be possible that he had left too soon and that his attempts to restore her had operated so sluggishly as only now to have made themselves felt barnet laid his hand upon her chest and fancied that ever and anon a faint flutter of palpitation gentle as that of a butterflys wing disturbed the stillness thereceasing for a time then struggling to go on then breaking down in weakness and ceasing again  barnets mother had been an active practitioner of the healing art among her poorer neighbours and her inspirations had all been derived from an octavo volume of domestic medicine which at this moment was lying as it had lain for many years on a shelf in barnets dressingroom  he hastily fetched it and there read under the head drowning     exertions for the recovery of any person who has not been immersed    for a longer period than halfanhour should be continued for at least    four hours as there have been many cases in which returning life has    made itself visible even after a longer interval     should however a weak action of any of the organs show itself when    the case seems almost hopeless our efforts must be redoubled the    feeble spark in this case requires to be solicited it will certainly    disappear under a relaxation of labour  barnet looked at his watch it was now barely two hours and a half from the time when he had first heard of the accident  he threw aside the book and turned quickly to reach a stimulant which had previously been used  pulling up the blind for more light his eye glanced out of the window  there he saw that red chimney still smoking cheerily and that roof and through the roof that somebody  his mechanical movements stopped his hand remained on the blindcord and he seemed to become breathless as if he had suddenly found himself treading a high rope  while he stood a sparrow lighted on the windowsill saw him and flew away  next a man and a dog walked over one of the green hills which bulged above the roofs of the town  but barnet took no notice  we may wonder what were the exact images that passed through his mind during those minutes of gazing upon lucy saviles house the sparrow the man and the dog and lucy saviles house again  there are honest men who will not admit to their thoughts even as idle hypotheses views of the future that assume as done a deed which they would recoil from doing and there are other honest men for whom morality ends at the surface of their own heads who will deliberate what the first will not so much as suppose  barnet had a wife whose pretence distracted his home she now lay as in death by merely doing nothingby letting the intelligence which had gone forth to the world lie undisturbedhe would effect such a deliverance for himself as he had never hoped for and open up an opportunity of which till now he had never dreamed  whether the conjuncture had arisen through any unscrupulous illconsidered impulse of charlson to help out of a strait the friend who was so kind as never to press him for what was due could not be told there was nothing to prove it and it was a question which could never be asked  the triangular situationhimselfhis wifelucy savilewas the one clear thing  from barnets actions we may infer that he supposed such and such a result for a moment but did not deliberate  he withdrew his hazel eyes from the scene without calmly turned rang the bell for assistance and vigorously exerted himself to learn if life still lingered in that motionless frame  in a short time another surgeon was in attendance and then barnets surmise proved to be true  the slow life timidly heaved again but much care and patience were needed to catch and retain it and a considerable period elapsed before it could be said with certainty that mrs barnet lived  when this was the case and there was no further room for doubt barnet left the chamber  the blue evening smoke from lucys chimney had died down to an imperceptible stream and as he walked about downstairs he murmured to himself my wife was dead and she is alive again  it was not so with downe  after three hours immersion his wifes body had been recovered life of course being quite extinct  barnet on descending went straight to his friends house and there learned the result  downe was helpless in his wild grief occasionally even hysterical  barnet said little but finding that some guiding hand was necessary in the sorrowstricken household took upon him to supervise and manage till downe should be in a state of mind to do so for himself    chapter vi   one september evening four months later when mrs barnet was in perfect health and mrs downe but a weakening memory an errandboy paused to rest himself in front of mr barnets old house depositing his basket on one of the windowsills  the street was not yet lighted but there were lights in the house and at intervals a flitting shadow fell upon the blind at his elbow  words also were audible from the same apartment and they seemed to be those of persons in violent altercation  but the boy could not gather their purport and he went on his way  ten minutes afterwards the door of barnets house opened and a tall closelyveiled lady in a travellingdress came out and descended the freestone steps  the servant stood in the doorway watching her as she went with a measured tread down the street  when she had been out of sight for some minutes barnet appeared at the door from within  did your mistress leave word where she was going he asked  no sir  is the carriage ordered to meet her anywhere  no sir  did she take a latchkey  no sir  barnet went in again sat down in his chair and leaned back  then in solitude and silence he brooded over the bitter emotions that filled his heart  it was for this that he had gratuitously restored her to life and made his union with another impossible  the evening drew on and nobody came to disturb him  at bedtime he told the servants to retire that he would sit up for mrs barnet himself and when they were gone he leaned his head upon his hand and mused for hours  the clock struck one two still his wife came not and with impatience added to depression he went from room to room till another weary hour had passed  this was not altogether a new experience for barnet but she had never before so prolonged her absence  at last he sat down again and fell asleep  he awoke at six oclock to find that she had not returned  in searching about the rooms he discovered that she had taken a case of jewels which had been hers before her marriage  at eight a note was brought him it was from his wife in which she stated that she had gone by the coach to the house of a distant relative near london and expressed a wish that certain boxes articles of clothing and so on might be sent to her forthwith  the note was brought to him by a waiter at the blackbull hotel and had been written by mrs barnet immediately before she took her place in the stage  by the evening this order was carried out and barnet with a sense of relief walked out into the town  a fair had been held during the day and the large clear moon which rose over the most prominent hill flung its light upon the booths and standings that still remained in the street mixing its rays curiously with those from the flaring naphtha lamps  the town was full of countrypeople who had come in to enjoy themselves and on this account barnet strolled through the streets unobserved  with a certain recklessness he made for the harbourroad and presently found himself by the shore where he walked on till he came to the spot near which his friend the kindly mrs downe had lost her life and his own wifes life had been preserved  a tremulous pathway of bright moonshine now stretched over the water which had engulfed them and not a living soul was near  here he ruminated on their characters and next on the young girl in whom he now took a more sensitive interest than at the time when he had been free to marry her  nothing so far as he was aware had ever appeared in his own conduct to show that such an interest existed  he had made it a point of the utmost strictness to hinder that feeling from influencing in the faintest degree his attitude towards his wife and this was made all the more easy for him by the small demand mrs barnet made upon his attentions for which she ever evinced the greatest contempt thus unwittingly giving him the satisfaction of knowing that their severance owed nothing to jealousy or indeed to any personal behaviour of his at all  her concern was not with him or his feelings as she frequently told him but that she had in a moment of weakness thrown herself away upon a common burgher when she might have aimed at and possibly brought down a peer of the realm  her frequent depreciation of barnet in these terms had at times been so intense that he was sorely tempted to retaliate on her egotism by owning that he loved at the same low level on which he lived but prudence had prevailed for which he was now thankful  something seemed to sound upon the shingle behind him over and above the raking of the wave  he looked round and a slight girlish shape appeared quite close to him he could not see her face because it was in the direction of the moon  mr barnet the rambler said in timid surprise  the voice was the voice of lucy savile  yes said barnet  how can i repay you for this pleasure  i only came because the night was so clear  i am now on my way home  i am glad we have met  i want to know if you will let me do something for you to give me an occupation as an idle man  i am sure i ought to help you for i know you are almost without friends  she hesitated  why should you tell me that she said  in the hope that you will be frank with me  i am not altogether without friends here  but i am going to make a little change in my lifeto go out as a teacher of freehand drawing and practical perspective of course i mean on a comparatively humble scale because i have not been specially educated for that profession  but i am sure i shall like it much  you have an opening  i have not exactly got it but i have advertised for one  lucy you must let me help you  not at all  you need not think it would compromise you or that i am indifferent to delicacy  i bear in mind how we stand  it is very unlikely that you will succeed as teacher of the class you mention so let me do something of a different kind for you  say what you would like and it shall be done  no if i cant be a drawingmistress or governess or something of that sort i shall go to india and join my brother  i wish i could go abroad anywhere everywhere with you lucy and leave this place and its associations for ever  she played with the end of her bonnetstring and hastily turned aside dont ever touch upon that kind of topic again she said with a quick severity not free from anger  it simply makes it impossible for me to see you much less receive any guidance from you  no thank you mr barnet you can do nothing for me at present and as i suppose my uncertainty will end in my leaving for india i fear you never will  if ever i think you can do anything i will take the trouble to ask you till then goodbye  the tone of her latter words was equivocal and while he remained in doubt whether a gentle irony was or was not inwrought with their sound she swept lightly round and left him alone  he saw her form get smaller and smaller along the damp belt of seasand between ebb and flood and when she had vanished round the cliff into the harbourroad he himself followed in the same direction  that her hopes from an advertisement should be the single thread which held lucy savile in england was too much for barnet  on reaching the town he went straight to the residence of downe now a widower with four children  the young motherless brood had been sent to bed about a quarter of an hour earlier and when barnet entered he found downe sitting alone  it was the same room as that from which the family had been looking out for downe at the beginning of the year when downe had slipped into the gutter and his wife had been so enviably tender towards him  the old neatness had gone from the house articles lay in places which could show no reason for their presence as if momentarily deposited there some months ago and forgotten ever since there were no flowers things were jumbled together on the furniture which should have been in cupboards and the place in general had that stagnant unrenovated air which usually pervades the maimed home of the widower  downe soon renewed his customary fullworded lament over his wife and even when he had worked himself up to tears went on volubly as if a listener were a luxury to be enjoyed whenever he could be caught  she was a treasure beyond compare mr barnet  i shall never see such another  nobody now to nurse menobody to console me in those daily troubles you know barnet which make consolation so necessary to a nature like mine  it would be unbecoming to repine for her spirits home was elsewherethe tender light in her eyes always showed it but it is a long dreary time that i have before me and nobody else can ever fill the void left in my heart by her lossnobodynobody  and downe wiped his eyes again  she was a good woman in the highest sense gravely answered barnet who though downes words drew genuine compassion from his heart could not help feeling that a tender reticence would have been a finer tribute to mrs downes really sterling virtues than such a secondclass lament as this  i have something to show you downe resumed producing from a drawer a sheet of paper on which was an elaborate design for a canopied tomb this has been sent me by the architect but it is not exactly what i want  you have got jones to do it i see the man who is carrying out my house said barnet as he glanced at the signature to the drawing  yes but it is not quite what i want  i want something more strikingmore like a tomb i have seen in st pauls cathedral  nothing less will do justice to my feelings and how far short of them that will fall  barnet privately thought the design a sufficiently imposing one as it stood even extravagantly ornate but feeling that he had no right to criticize he said gently downe should you not live more in your childrens lives at the present time and soften the sharpness of regret for your own past by thinking of their future  yes yes but what can i do more asked downe wrinkling his forehead hopelessly  it was with anxious slowness that barnet produced his replythe secret object of his visit tonight  did you not say one day that you ought by rights to get a governess for the children  downe admitted that he had said so but that he could not see his way to it  the kind of woman i should like to have he said would be rather beyond my means  no i think i shall send them to school in the town when they are old enough to go out alone  now i know of something better than that  the late lieutenant saviles daughter lucy wants to do something for herself in the way of teaching she would be inexpensive and would answer your purpose as well as anybody for six or twelve months  she would probably come daily if you were to ask her and so your housekeeping arrangements would not be much affected  i thought she had gone away said the solicitor musing  where does she live  barnet told him and added that if downe should think of her as suitable he would do well to call as soon as possible or she might be on the wing  if you do see her he said it would be advisable not to mention my name  she is rather stiff in her ideas of me and it might prejudice her against a course if she knew that i recommended it  downe promised to give the subject his consideration and nothing more was said about it just then  but when barnet rose to go which was not till nearly bedtime he reminded downe of the suggestion and went up the street to his own solitary home with a sense of satisfaction at his promising diplomacy in a charitable cause    chapter vii   the walls of his new house were carried up nearly to their full height by a curious though not infrequent reaction barnets feelings about that unnecessary structure had undergone a change he took considerable interest in its progress as a longneglected thing his wife before her departure having grown quite weary of it as a hobby  moreover it was an excellent distraction for a man in the unhappy position of having to live in a provincial town with nothing to do  he was probably the first of his line who had ever passed a day without toil and perhaps something like an inherited instinct disqualifies such men for a life of pleasant inaction such as lies in the power of those whose leisure is not a personal accident but a vast historical accretion which has become part of their natures  thus barnet got into a way of spending many of his leisure hours on the site of the new building and he might have been seen on most days at this time trying the temper of the mortar by punching the joints with his stick looking at the grain of a floorboard and meditating where it grew or picturing under what circumstances the last fire would be kindled in the at present sootless chimneys  one day when thus occupied he saw three children pass by in the company of a fair young woman whose sudden appearance caused him to flush perceptibly  ah she is there he thought  thats a blessed thing  casting an interested glance over the rising building and the busy workmen lucy savile and the little downes passed by and after that time it became a regular though almost unconscious custom of barnet to stand in the halfcompleted house and look from the ungarnished windows at the governess as she tripped towards the seashore with her young charges which she was in the habit of doing on most fine afternoons  it was on one of these occasions when he had been loitering on the firstfloor landing near the hole left for the staircase not yet erected that there appeared above the edge of the floor a little hat followed by a little head  barnet withdrew through a doorway and the child came to the top of the ladder stepping on to the floor and crying to her sisters and miss savile to follow  another head rose above the floor and another and then lucy herself came into view  the troop ran hither and thither through the empty shavingstrewn rooms and barnet came forward  lucy uttered a small exclamation she was very sorry that she had intruded she had not the least idea that mr barnet was there the children had come up and she had followed  barnet replied that he was only too glad to see them there  and now let me show you the rooms he said  she passively assented and he took her round  there was not much to show in such a bare skeleton of a house but he made the most of it and explained the different ornamental fittings that were soon to be fixed here and there  lucy made but few remarks in reply though she seemed pleased with her visit and stole away down the ladder followed by her companions  after this the new residence became yet more of a hobby for barnet downes children did not forget their first visit and when the windows were glazed and the handsome staircase spread its broad low steps into the hall they came again prancing in unwearied succession through every room from groundfloor to attics while lucy stood waiting for them at the door  barnet who rarely missed a day in coming to inspect progress stepped out from the drawingroom  i could not keep them out she said with an apologetic blush  i tried to do so very much but they are rather wilful and we are directed to walk this way for the sea air  do let them make the house their regular playground and you yours said barnet  there is no better place for children to romp and take their exercise in than an empty house particularly in muddy or damp weather such as we shall get a good deal of now and this place will not be furnished for a long long timeperhaps never  i am not at all decided about it  o but it must replied lucy looking round at the hall  the rooms are excellent twice as high as ours and the views from the windows are so lovely  i daresay i daresay he said absently  will all the furniture be new she asked  all the furniture be newthats a thing i have not thought of  in fact i only come here and look on  my fathers house would have been large enough for me but another person had a voice in the matter and it was settled that we should build  however the place grows upon me its recent associations are cheerful and i am getting to like it fast  a certain uneasiness in lucys manner showed that the conversation was taking too personal a turn for her  still as modern tastes develop people require more room to gratify them in she said withdrawing to call the children and serenely bidding him good afternoon she went on her way  barnets life at this period was singularly lonely and yet he was happier than he could have expected  his wifes estrangement and absence which promised to be permanent left him free as a boy in his movements and the solitary walks that he took gave him ample opportunity for chastened reflection on what might have been his lot if he had only shown wisdom enough to claim lucy savile when there was no bar between their lives and she was to be had for the asking  he would occasionally call at the house of his friend downe but there was scarcely enough in common between their two natures to make them more than friends of that excellent sort whose personal knowledge of each others history and character is always in excess of intimacy whereby they are not so likely to be severed by a clash of sentiment as in cases where intimacy springs up in excess of knowledge  lucy was never visible at these times being either engaged in the schoolroom or in taking an airing out of doors but knowing that she was now comfortable and had given up the to him depressing idea of going off to the other side of the globe he was quite content  the new house had so far progressed that the gardeners were beginning to grass down the front  during an afternoon which he was passing in marking the curve for the carriagedrive he beheld her coming in boldly towards him from the road  hitherto barnet had only caught her on the premises by stealth and this advance seemed to show that at last her reserve had broken down  a smile gained strength upon her face as she approached and it was quite radiant when she came up and said without a trace of embarrassment i find i owe you a hundred thanksand it comes to me quite as a surprise it was through your kindness that i was engaged by mr downe  believe me mr barnet i did not know it until yesterday or i should have thanked you long and long ago  i had offended youjust a trifleat the time i think said barnet smiling and it was best that you should not know  yes yes she returned hastily  dont allude to that it is past and over and we will let it be  the house is finished almost is it not how beautiful it will look when the evergreens are grown  do you call the style palladian mr barnet  ireally dont quite know what it is  yes it must be palladian certainly  but ill ask jones the architect for to tell the truth i had not thought much about the style i had nothing to do with choosing it i am sorry to say  she would not let him harp on this gloomy refrain and talked on bright matters till she said producing a small roll of paper which he had noticed in her hand all the while mr downe wished me to bring you this revised drawing of the late mrs downes tomb which the architect has just sent him  he would like you to look it over  the children came up with their hoops and she went off with them down the harbourroad as usual  barnet had been glad to get those words of thanks he had been thinking for many months that he would like her to know of his share in finding her a home such as it was and what he could not do for himself downe had now kindly done for him  he returned to his desolate house with a lighter tread though in reason he hardly knew why his tread should be light  on examining the drawing barnet found that instead of the vast altar tomb and canopy downe had determined on at their last meeting it was to be a more modest memorial even than had been suggested by the architect a coped tomb of good solid construction with no useless elaboration at all  barnet was truly glad to see that downe had come to reason of his own accord and he returned the drawing with a note of approval  he followed up the housework as before and as he walked up and down the rooms occasionally gazing from the windows over the bulging green hills and the quiet harbour that lay between them he murmured words and fragments of words which if listened to would have revealed all the secrets of his existence  whatever his reason in going there lucy did not call again the walk to the shore seemed to be abandoned he must have thought it as well for both that it should be so for he did not go anywhere out of his accustomed ways to endeavour to discover her    chapter viii   the winter and the spring had passed and the house was complete  it was a fine morning in the early part of june and barnet though not in the habit of rising early had taken a long walk before breakfast returning by way of the new building  a sufficiently exciting cause of his restlessness today might have been the intelligence which had reached him the night before that lucy savile was going to india after all and notwithstanding the representations of her friends that such a journey was unadvisable in many ways for an unpractised girl unless some more definite advantage lay at the end of it than she could show to be the case  barnets walk up the slope to the building betrayed that he was in a dissatisfied mood  he hardly saw that the dewy time of day lent an unusual freshness to the bushes and trees which had so recently put on their summer habit of heavy leafage and made his newlylaid lawn look as well established as an old manorial meadow  the house had been so adroitly placed between six tall elms which were growing on the site beforehand that they seemed like real ancestral trees and the rooks young and old cawed melodiously to their visitor  the door was not locked and he entered  no workmen appeared to be present and he walked from sunny window to sunny window of the empty rooms with a sense of seclusion which might have been very pleasant but for the antecedent knowledge that his almost paternal care of lucy savile was to be thrown away by her wilfulness  footsteps echoed through an adjoining room and bending his eyes in that direction he perceived mr jones the architect  he had come to look over the building before giving the contractor his final certificate  they walked over the house together  everything was finished except the papering there were the latest improvements of the period in bellhanging ventilating smoke jacks firegrates and french windows  the business was soon ended and jones having directed barnets attention to a roll of wallpaper patterns which lay on a bench for his choice was leaving to keep another engagement when barnet said is the tomb finished yet for mrs downe  wellyes it is at last said the architect coming back and speaking as if he were in a mood to make a confidence  i have had no end of trouble in the matter and to tell the truth i am heartily glad it is over  barnet expressed his surprise  i thought poor downe had given up those extravagant notions of his then he has gone back to the altar and canopy after all  well he is to be excused poor fellow  o nohe has not at all gone back to themquite the reverse jones hastened to say  he has so reduced design after design that the whole thing has been nothing but waste labour for me till in the end it has become a common headstone which a mason put up in half a day  a common headstone said barnet  yes  i held out for some time for the addition of a footstone at least but he said o nohe couldnt afford it  ah wellhis family is growing up poor fellow and his expenses are getting serious  yes exactly said jones as if the subject were none of his  and again directing barnets attention to the wallpapers the bustling architect left him to keep some other engagement  a common headstone murmured barnet left again to himself  he mused a minute or two and next began looking over and selecting from the patterns but had not long been engaged in the work when he heard another footstep on the gravel without and somebody enter the open porch  barnet went to the doorit was his manservant in search of him  i have been trying for some time to find you sir he said  this letter has come by the post and it is marked immediate  and theres this one from mr downe who called just now wanting to see you  he searched his pocket for the second  barnet took the first letterit had a black border and bore the london postmark  it was not in his wifes handwriting or in that of any person he knew but conjecture soon ceased as he read the page wherein he was briefly informed that mrs barnet had died suddenly on the previous day at the furnished villa she had occupied near london  barnet looked vaguely round the empty hall at the blank walls out of the doorway  drawing a long palpitating breath and with eyes downcast he turned and climbed the stairs slowly like a man who doubted their stability  the fact of his wife having as it were died once already and lived on again had entirely dislodged the possibility of her actual death from his conjecture  he went to the landing leant over the balusters and after a reverie of whose duration he had but the faintest notion turned to the window and stretched his gaze to the cottage further down the road which was visible from his landing and from which lucy still walked to the solicitors house by a cross path  the faint words that came from his moving lips were simply at last  then almost involuntarily barnet fell down on his knees and murmured some incoherent words of thanksgiving  surely his virtue in restoring his wife to life had been rewarded  but as if the impulse struck uneasily on his conscience he quickly rose brushed the dust from his trousers and set himself to think of his next movements  he could not start for london for some hours and as he had no preparations to make that could not be made in halfanhour he mechanically descended and resumed his occupation of turning over the wallpapers  they had all got brighter for him those papers  it was all changedwho would sit in the rooms that they were to line  he went on to muse upon lucys conduct in so frequently coming to the house with the children her occasional blush in speaking to him her evident interest in him  what woman can in the long run avoid being interested in a man whom she knows to be devoted to her  if human solicitation could ever effect anything there should be no going to india for lucy now  all the papers previously chosen seemed wrong in their shades and he began from the beginning to choose again  while entering on the task he heard a forced ahem from without the porch evidently uttered to attract his attention and footsteps again advancing to the door  his man whom he had quite forgotten in his mental turmoil was still waiting there  i beg your pardon sir the man said from round the doorway but heres the note from mr downe that you didnt take  he called just after you went out and as he couldnt wait he wrote this on your study table  he handed in the letterno blackbordered one now but a practicallooking note in the wellknown writing of the solicitor     dear barnetit ranperhaps you will be prepared for the    information i am about to givethat lucy savile and myself are going    to be married this morning  i have hitherto said nothing as to my    intention to any of my friends for reasons which i am sure you will    fully appreciate  the crisis has been brought about by her expressing    her intention to join her brother in india  i then discovered that i    could not do without her     it is to be quite a private wedding but it is my particular wish    that you come down here quietly at ten and go to church with us it    will add greatly to the pleasure i shall experience in the ceremony    and i believe to lucys also  i have called on you very early to    make the request in the belief that i should find you at home but    you are beforehand with me in your early risingyours sincerely c    downe  need i wait sir said the servant after a dead silence  that will do william  no answer said barnet calmly  when the man had gone barnet reread the letter  turning eventually to the wallpapers which he had been at such pains to select he deliberately tore them into halves and quarters and threw them into the empty fireplace  then he went out of the house locked the door and stood in the front awhile  instead of returning into the town he went down the harbourroad and thoughtfully lingered about by the sea near the spot where the body of downes late wife had been found and brought ashore  barnet was a man with a rich capacity for misery and there is no doubt that he exercised it to its fullest extent now  the events that had as it were dashed themselves together into one halfhour of this day showed that curious refinement of cruelty in their arrangement which often proceeds from the bosom of the whimsical god at other times known as blind circumstance  that his few minutes of hope between the reading of the first and second letters had carried him to extraordinary heights of rapture was proved by the immensity of his suffering now  the sun blazing into his face would have shown a close watcher that a horizontal line which he had never noticed before but which was never to be gone thereafter was somehow gradually forming itself in the smooth of his forehead  his eyes of a light hazel had a curious look which can only be described by the word bruised the sorrow that looked from them being largely mixed with the surprise of a man taken unawares  the secondary particulars of his present position too were odd enough though for some time they appeared to engage little of his attention  not a soul in the town knew as yet of his wifes death and he almost owed downe the kindness of not publishing it till the day was over the conjuncture taken with that which had accompanied the death of mrs downe being so singular as to be quite sufficient to darken the pleasure of the impressionable solicitor to a cruel extent if made known to him but as barnet could not set out on his journey to london where his wife lay for some hours there being at this date no railway within a distance of many miles no great reason existed why he should leave the town  impulse in all its forms characterized barnet and when he heard the distant clock strike the hour of ten his feet began to carry him up the harbourroad with the manner of a man who must do something to bring himself to life  he passed lucy saviles old house his own new one and came in view of the church  now he gave a perceptible start and his mechanical condition went away  before the churchgate were a couple of carriages and barnet then could perceive that the marriage between downe and lucy was at that moment being solemnized within  a feeling of sudden proud selfconfidence an indocile wish to walk unmoved in spite of grim environments plainly possessed him and when he reached the wicketgate he turned in without apparent effort  pacing up the paved footway he entered the church and stood for a while in the nave passage a group of people was standing round the vestry door barnet advanced through these and stepped into the vestry  there they were busily signing their names  seeing downe about to look round barnet averted his somewhat disturbed face for a second or two when he turned again front to front he was calm and quite smiling it was a creditable triumph over himself and deserved to be remembered in his native town  he greeted downe heartily offering his congratulations  it seemed as if barnet expected a halfguilty look upon lucys face but no save the natural flush and flurry engendered by the service just performed there was nothing whatever in her bearing which showed a disturbed mind her graybrown eyes carried in them now as at other times the wellknown expression of commonsensed rectitude which never went so far as to touch on hardness  she shook hands with him and downe said warmly i wish you could have come sooner i called on purpose to ask you  youll drive back with us now  no no said barnet i am not at all prepared but i thought i would look in upon you for a moment even though i had not time to go home and dress  ill stand back and see you pass out and observe the effect of the spectacle upon myself as one of the public  then lucy and her husband laughed and barnet laughed and retired and the quiet little party went gliding down the nave and towards the porch lucys new silk dress sweeping with a smart rustle round the basemouldings of the ancient font and downes little daughters following in a state of roundeyed interest in their position and that of lucy their teacher and friend  so downe was comforted after his emilys death which had taken place twelve months two weeks and three days before that time  when the two flys had driven off and the spectators had vanished barnet followed to the door and went out into the sun  he took no more trouble to preserve a spruce exterior his step was unequal hesitating almost convulsive and the slight changes of colour which went on in his face seemed refracted from some inward flame  in the churchyard he became pale as a summer cloud and finding it not easy to proceed he sat down on one of the tombstones and supported his head with his hand  hard by was a sexton filling up a grave which he had not found time to finish on the previous evening  observing barnet he went up to him and recognizing him said shall i help you home sir  o no thank you said barnet rousing himself and standing up  the sexton returned to his grave followed by barnet who after watching him awhile stepped into the grave now nearly filled and helped to tread in the earth  the sexton apparently thought his conduct a little singular but he made no observation and when the grave was full barnet suddenly stopped looked far away and with a decided step proceeded to the gate and vanished  the sexton rested on his shovel and looked after him for a few moments and then began banking up the mound  in those short minutes of treading in the dead man barnet had formed a design but what it was the inhabitants of that town did not for some long time imagine  he went home wrote several letters of business called on his lawyer an old man of the same place who had been the legal adviser of barnets father before him and during the evening overhauled a large quantity of letters and other documents in his possession  by eleven oclock the heap of papers in and before barnets grate had reached formidable dimensions and he began to burn them  this owing to their quantity it was not so easy to do as he had expected and he sat long into the night to complete the task  the next morning barnet departed for london leaving a note for downe to inform him of mrs barnets sudden death and that he was gone to bury her but when a thricesufficient time for that purpose had elapsed he was not seen again in his accustomed walks or in his new house or in his old one  he was gone for good nobody knew whither  it was soon discovered that he had empowered his lawyer to dispose of all his property real and personal in the borough and pay in the proceeds to the account of an unknown person at one of the large london banks  the person was by some supposed to be himself under an assumed name but few if any had certain knowledge of that fact  the elegant new residence was sold with the rest of his possessions and its purchaser was no other than downe now a thriving man in the borough and one whose growing family and new wife required more roomy accommodation than was afforded by the little house up the narrow side street  barnets old habitation was bought by the trustees of the congregational baptist body in that town who pulled down the timehonoured dwelling and built a new chapel on its site  by the time the last hour of that to barnet eventful year had chimed every vestige of him had disappeared from the precincts of his native place and the name became extinct in the borough of portbredy after having been a living force therein for more than two hundred years    chapter ix   twentyone years and six months do not pass without setting a mark even upon durable stone and triple brass upon humanity such a period works nothing less than transformation  in barnets old birthplace vivacious young children with bones like indiarubber had grown up to be stable men and women men and women had dried in the skin stiffened withered and sunk into decrepitude while selections from every class had been consigned to the outlying cemetery  of inorganic differences the greatest was that a railway had invaded the town tying it on to a main line at a junction a dozen miles off  barnets house on the harbourroad once so insistently new had acquired a respectable mellowness with ivy virginia creepers lichens damp patches and even constitutional infirmities of its own like its elder fellows  its architecture once so very improved and modern had already become stale in style without having reached the dignity of being oldfashioned trees about the harbourroad had increased in circumference or disappeared under the saw while the church had had such a tremendous practical joke played upon it by some facetious restorer or other as to be scarce recognizable by its dearest old friends  during this long interval george barnet had never once been seen or heard of in the town of his fathers  it was the evening of a marketday and some halfdozen middleaged farmers and dairymen were lounging round the bar of the blackbull hotel occasionally dropping a remark to each other and less frequently to the two barmaids who stood within the pewtertopped counter in a perfunctory attitude of attention these latter sighing and making a private observation to one another at odd intervals on more interesting experiences than the present  days get shorter said one of the dairymen as he looked towards the street and noticed that the lamplighter was passing by  the farmers merely acknowledged by their countenances the propriety of this remark and finding that nobody else spoke one of the barmaids said yes in a tone of painful duty  come fairday we shall have to light up before we start for homealong  thats true his neighbour conceded with a gaze of blankness  and after that we shant see much further difference alls winter  the rest were not unwilling to go even so far as this  the barmaid sighed again and raised one of her hands from the counter on which they rested to scratch the smallest surface of her face with the smallest of her fingers  she looked towards the door and presently remarked i think i hear the bus coming in from station  the eyes of the dairymen and farmers turned to the glass door dividing the hall from the porch and in a minute or two the omnibus drew up outside  then there was a lumbering down of luggage and then a man came into the hall followed by a porter with a portmanteau on his poll which he deposited on a bench  the stranger was an elderly person with curly ashen white hair a deeply creviced outer corner to each eyelid and a countenance baked by innumerable suns to the colour of terracotta its hue and that of his hair contrasting like heat and cold respectively  he walked meditatively and gently like one who was fearful of disturbing his own mental equilibrium  but whatever lay at the bottom of his breast had evidently made him so accustomed to its situation there that it caused him little practical inconvenience  he paused in silence while with his dubious eyes fixed on the barmaids he seemed to consider himself  in a moment or two he addressed them and asked to be accommodated for the night  as he waited he looked curiously round the hall but said nothing  as soon as invited he disappeared up the staircase preceded by a chambermaid and candle and followed by a lad with his trunk  not a soul had recognized him  a quarter of an hour later when the farmers and dairymen had driven off to their homesteads in the country he came downstairs took a biscuit and one glass of wine and walked out into the town where the radiance from the shopwindows had grown so in volume of late years as to flood with cheerfulness every standing cart barrow stall and idler that occupied the wayside whether shabby or genteel  his chief interest at present seemed to lie in the names painted over the shopfronts and on doorways as far as they were visible these now differed to an ominous extent from what they had been oneandtwenty years before  the traveller passed on till he came to the booksellers where he looked in through the glass door  a freshfaced young man was standing behind the counter otherwise the shop was empty  the grayhaired observer entered asked for some periodical by way of paying for admission and with his elbow on the counter began to turn over the pages he had bought though that he read nothing was obvious  at length he said is old mr watkins still alive in a voice which had a curious youthful cadence in it even now  my father is dead sir said the young man  ah i am sorry to hear it said the stranger  but it is so many years since i last visited this town that i could hardly expect it should be otherwise  after a short silence he continuedand is the firm of barnet browse and company still in existencethey used to be large flaxmerchants and twinespinners here  the firm is still going on sir but they have dropped the name of barnet  i believe that was a sort of fancy nameat least i never knew of any living barnet  tis now browse and co  and does andrew jones still keep on as architect  hes dead sir  and the vicar of st marysmr melrose  hes been dead a great many years  dear me  he paused yet longer and cleared his voice  is mr downe the solicitor still in practice  no sir hes dead  he died about seven years ago  here it was a longer silence still and an attentive observer would have noticed that the paper in the strangers hand increased its imperceptible tremor to a visible shake  that grayhaired gentleman noticed it himself and rested the paper on the counter  is mrs downe still alive he asked closing his lips firmly as soon as the words were out of his mouth and dropping his eyes  yes sir shes alive and well  shes living at the old place  in east street  o no at chateau ringdale  i believe it has been in the family for some generations  she lives with her children perhaps  no she has no children of her own  there were some miss downes i think they were mr downes daughters by a former wife but they are married and living in other parts of the town  mrs downe lives alone  quite alone  yes sir quite alone  the newlyarrived gentleman went back to the hotel and dined after which he made some change in his dress shaved back his beard to the fashion that had prevailed twenty years earlier when he was young and interesting and once more emerging bent his steps in the direction of the harbourroad  just before getting to the point where the pavement ceased and the houses isolated themselves he overtook a shambling stooping unshaven man who at first sight appeared like a professional tramp his shoulders having a perceptible greasiness as they passed under the gaslight  each pedestrian momentarily turned and regarded the other and the tramplike gentleman started back  goodwhyis that mr barnet  tis mr barnet surely  yes and you are charlson  yesahyou notice my appearance  the fates have rather illused me bythebye that fifty pounds  i never paid it did i    but i was not ungrateful  here the stooping man laid one hand emphatically on the palm of the other  i gave you a chance mr george barnet which many men would have thought full value receivedthe chance to marry your lucy  as far as the world was concerned your wife was a drowned woman hey  heaven forbid all that charlson  well well twas a wrong way of showing gratitude i suppose  and now a drop of something to drink for old acquaintance sake  and mr barnet shes again freetheres a chance now if you care for itha ha  and the speaker pushed his tongue into his hollow cheek and slanted his eye in the old fashion  i know all said barnet quickly and slipping a small present into the hands of the needy saddening man he stepped ahead and was soon in the outskirts of the town  he reached the harbourroad and paused before the entrance to a well known house  it was so highly bosomed in trees and shrubs planted since the erection of the building that one would scarcely have recognized the spot as that which had been a mere neglected slope till chosen as a site for a dwelling  he opened the swinggate closed it noiselessly and gently moved into the semicircular drive which remained exactly as it had been marked out by barnet on the morning when lucy savile ran in to thank him for procuring her the post of governess to downes children but the growth of trees and bushes which revealed itself at every step was beyond all expectation sunproof and moonproof bowers vaulted the walks and the walls of the house were uniformly bearded with creeping plants as high as the firstfloor windows  after lingering for a few minutes in the dusk of the bending boughs the visitor rang the doorbell and on the servant appearing he announced himself as an old friend of mrs downes  the hall was lighted but not brightly the gas being turned low as if visitors were rare  there was a stagnation in the dwelling it seemed to be waiting  could it really be waiting for him  the partitions which had been probed by barnets walkingstick when the mortar was green were now quite brown with the antiquity of their varnish and the ornamental woodwork of the staircase which had glistened with a pale yellow newness when first erected was now of a rich winecolour  during the servants absence the following colloquy could be dimly heard through the nearly closed door of the drawingroom  he didnt give his name  he only said an old friend maam  what kind of gentleman is he  a staidish gentleman with gray hair  the voice of the second speaker seemed to affect the listener greatly after a pause the lady said very well i will see him  and the stranger was shown in face to face with the lucy who had once been lucy savile  the round cheek of that formerly young lady had of course alarmingly flattened its curve in her modern representative a pervasive grayness overspread her once dark brown hair like morning rime on heather  the parting down the middle was wide and jagged once it had been a thin white line a narrow crevice between two high banks of shade but there was still enough left to form a handsome knob behind and some curls beneath inwrought with a few hairs like silver wires were very becoming  in her eyes the only modification was that their originally mild rectitude of expression had become a little more stringent than heretofore  yet she was still girlisha girl who had been gratuitously weighted by destiny with a burden of fiveandforty years instead of her proper twenty  lucy dont you know me he said when the servant had closed the door  i knew you the instant i saw you she returned cheerfully  i dont know why but i always thought you would come back to your old town again  she gave him her hand and then they sat down  they said you were dead continued lucy but i never thought so  we should have heard of it for certain if you had been  it is a very long time since we met  yes what you must have seen mr barnet in all these roving years in comparison with what i have seen in this quiet place  her face grew more serious  you know my husband has been dead a long time  i am a lonely old woman now considering what i have been though mr downes daughtersall marriedmanage to keep me pretty cheerful  and i am a lonely old man and have been any time these twenty years  but where have you kept yourself  and why did you go off so mysteriously  well lucy i have kept myself a little in america and a little in australia a little in india a little at the cape and so on i have not stayed in any place for a long time as it seems to me and yet more than twenty years have flown  but when people get to my age two years go like oneyour second question why did i go away so mysteriously is surely not necessary  you guessed why didnt you  no i never once guessed she said simply nor did charles nor did anybody as far as i know  well indeed  now think it over again and then look at me and say if you cant guess  she looked him in the face with an inquiring smile  surely not because of me she said pausing at the commencement of surprise  barnet nodded and smiled again but his smile was sadder than hers  because i married charles she asked  yes solely because you married him on the day i was free to ask you to marry me  my wife died fourandtwenty hours before you went to church with downe  the fixing of my journey at that particular moment was because of her funeral but once away i knew i should have no inducement to come back and took my steps accordingly  her face assumed an aspect of gentle reflection and she looked up and down his form with great interest in her eyes  i never thought of it she said  i knew of course that you had once implied some warmth of feeling towards me but i concluded that it passed off  and i have always been under the impression that your wife was alive at the time of my marriage  was it not stupid of mebut you will have some tea or something  i have never dined late you know since my husbands death i have got into the way of making a regular meal of tea  you will have some tea with me will you not  the travelled man assented quite readily and tea was brought in  they sat and chatted over the meal regardless of the flying hour  well well said barnet presently as for the first time he leisurely surveyed the room how like it all is and yet how different  just where your piano stands was a board on a couple of trestles bearing the patterns of wallpapers when i was last here  i was choosing themstanding in this way as it might be  then my servant came in at the door and handed me a note so  it was from downe and announced that you were just going to be married to him  i chose no more wallpaperstore up all those i had selected and left the house  i never entered it again till now  ah at last i understand it all she murmured  they had both risen and gone to the fireplace  the mantel came almost on a level with her shoulder which gently rested against it and barnet laid his hand upon the shelf close beside her shoulder  lucy he said better late than never  will you marry me now  she started back and the surprise which was so obvious in her wrought even greater surprise in him that it should be so  it was difficult to believe that she had been quite blind to the situation and yet all reason and common sense went to prove that she was not acting  you take me quite unawares by such a question she said with a forced laugh of uneasiness  it was the first time she had shown any embarrassment at all  why she added i couldnt marry you for the world  not after all this  why not  it isi wouldi really think i may say iti would upon the whole rather marry you mr barnet than any other man i have ever met if i ever dreamed of marriage again  but i dont dream of itit is quite out of my thoughts i have not the least intention of marrying again  buton my accountcouldnt you alter your plans a little  come  dear mr barnet she said with a little flutter i would on your account if on anybodys in existence  but you dont know in the least what it is you are askingsuch an impracticable thingi wont say ridiculous of course because i see that you are really in earnest and earnestness is never ridiculous to my mind  well yes said barnet more slowly dropping her hand which he had taken at the moment of pleading i am in earnest  the resolve two months ago at the cape to come back once more was it is true rather sudden and as i see now not well considered  but i am in earnest in asking  and i in declining  with all good feeling and all kindness let me say that i am quite opposed to the idea of marrying a second time  well no harm has been done he answered with the same subdued and tender humorousness that he had shown on such occasions in early life if you really wont accept me i must put up with it i suppose  his eye fell on the clock as he spoke  had you any notion that it was so late he asked  how absorbed i have been  she accompanied him to the hall helped him to put on his overcoat and let him out of the house herself  goodnight said barnet on the doorstep as the lamp shone in his face  you are not offended with me  certainly not  nor you with me  ill consider whether i am or not he pleasantly replied  goodnight  she watched him safely through the gate and when his footsteps had died away upon the road closed the door softly and returned to the room  here the modest widow long pondered his speeches with eyes dropped to an unusually low level  barnets urbanity under the blow of her refusal greatly impressed her  after having his long period of probation rendered useless by her decision he had shown no anger and had philosophically taken her words as if he deserved no better ones  it was very gentlemanly of him certainly it was more than gentlemanly it was heroic and grand  the more she meditated the more she questioned the virtue of her conduct in checking him so peremptorily and went to her bedroom in a mood of dissatisfaction  on looking in the glass she was reminded that there was not so much remaining of her former beauty as to make his frank declaration an impulsive natural homage to her cheeks and eyes it must undoubtedly have arisen from an old staunch feeling of his deserving tenderest consideration  she recalled to her mind with much pleasure that he had told her he was staying at the blackbull hotel so that if after waiting a day or two he should not in his modesty call again she might then send him a nice little note  to alter her views for the present was far from her intention but she would allow herself to be induced to reconsider the case as any generous woman ought to do  the morrow came and passed and mr barnet did not drop in  at every knock light youthful hues flew across her cheek and she was abstracted in the presence of her other visitors  in the evening she walked about the house not knowing what to do with herself the conditions of existence seemed totally different from those which ruled only fourand twenty short hours ago  what had been at first a tantalizing elusive sentiment was getting acclimatized within her as a definite hope and her person was so informed by that emotion that she might almost have stood as its emblematical representative by the time the clock struck ten  in short an interest in barnet precisely resembling that of her early youth led her present heart to belie her yesterdays words to him and she longed to see him again  the next day she walked out early thinking she might meet him in the street  the growing beauty of her romance absorbed her and she went from the street to the fields and from the fields to the shore without any consciousness of distance till reminded by her weariness that she could go no further  he had nowhere appeared  in the evening she took a step which under the circumstances seemed justifiable she wrote a note to him at the hotel inviting him to tea with her at six precisely and signing her note lucy  in a quarter of an hour the messenger came back  mr barnet had left the hotel early in the morning of the day before but he had stated that he would probably return in the course of the week  the note was sent back to be given to him immediately on his arrival  there was no sign from the inn that this desired event had occurred either on the next day or the day following  on both nights she had been restless and had scarcely slept halfanhour  on the saturday putting off all diffidence lucy went herself to the blackbull and questioned the staff closely  mr barnet had cursorily remarked when leaving that he might return on the thursday or friday but they were directed not to reserve a room for him unless he should write  he had left no address  lucy sorrowfully took back her note went home and resolved to wait  she did waityears and yearsbut barnet never reappeared  april 1880     interlopers at the knap   chapter i   the north road from casterbridge is tedious and lonely especially in wintertime  along a part of its course it connects with longash lane a monotonous track without a village or hamlet for many miles and with very seldom a turning  unapprized wayfarers who are too old or too young or in other respects too weak for the distance to be traversed but who nevertheless have to walk it say as they look wistfully ahead once at the top of that hill and i must surely see the end of longash lane  but they reach the hilltop and longash lane stretches in front as mercilessly as before  some few years ago a certain farmer was riding through this lane in the gloom of a winter evening  the farmers friend a dairyman was riding beside him  a few paces in the rear rode the farmers man  all three were well horsed on strong roundbarrelled cobs and to be well horsed was to be in better spirits about longash lane than poor pedestrians could attain to during its passage  but the farmer did not talk much to his friend as he rode along  the enterprise which had brought him there filled his mind for in truth it was important  not altogether so important was it perhaps when estimated by its value to society at large but if the true measure of a deed be proportionate to the space it occupies in the heart of him who undertakes it farmer charles dartons business tonight could hold its own with the business of kings  he was a large farmer  his turnover as it is called was probably thirty thousand pounds a year  he had a great many draught horses a great many milch cows and of sheep a multitude  this comfortable position was however none of his own making  it had been created by his father a man of a very different stamp from the present representative of the line  darton the father had been a oneidead character with a buttonedup pocket and a chinklike eye brimming with commercial subtlety  in darton the son this trade subtlety had become transmuted into emotional and the harshness had disappeared he would have been called a sad man but for his constant care not to divide himself from lively friends by piping notes out of harmony with theirs  contemplative he allowed his mind to be a quiet meetingplace for memories and hopes  so that naturally enough since succeeding to the agricultural calling and up to his present age of thirtytwo he had neither advanced nor receded as a capitalista stationary result which did not agitate one of his unambitious unstrategic nature since he had all that he desired  the motive of his expedition tonight showed the same absence of anxious regard for number one  the party rode on in the slow safe trot proper to nighttime and bad roads farmer dartons head jigging rather unromantically up and down against the sky and his motions being repeated with bolder emphasis by his friend japheth johns while those of the latter were travestied in jerks still less softened by art in the person of the lad who attended them  a pair of whitish objects hung one on each side of the latter bumping against him at each step and still further spoiling the grace of his seat  on close inspection they might have been perceived to be open rush basketsone containing a turkey and the other some bottles of wine  dye feel ye can meet your fate like a man neighbour darton asked johns breaking a silence which had lasted while fiveandtwenty hedgerow trees had glided by  mr darton with a halflaugh murmured aycall it my fate  hanging and wiving go by destiny  and then they were silent again  the darkness thickened rapidly at intervals shutting down on the land in a perceptible flap like the wave of a wing  the customary close of day was accelerated by a simultaneous blurring of the air  with the fall of night had come a mist just damp enough to incommode but not sufficient to saturate them  countrymen as they wereborn as may be said with only an open door between them and the four seasonsthey regarded the mist but as an added obscuration and ignored its humid quality  they were travelling in a direction that was enlivened by no modern current of traffic the place of dartons pilgrimage being an oldfashioned villageone of the hintocks several villages of that name with a distinctive prefix or affix lying thereaboutwhere the people make the best cider and ciderwine in all wessex and where the dunghills smell of pomace instead of stable refuse as elsewhere  the lane was sometimes so narrow that the brambles of the hedge which hung forward like anglers rods over a stream scratched their hats and curry combed their whiskers as they passed  yet this neglected lane had been a highway to queen elizabeths subjects and the cavalcades of the past  its day was over now and its history as a national artery done for ever  why i have decided to marry her resumed darton in a measured musical voice of confidence which revealed a good deal of his composition as he glanced round to see that the lad was not too near is not only that i like her but that i can do no better even from a fairly practical point of view  that i might ha looked higher is possibly true though it is really all nonsense  i have had experience enough in looking above me no more superior women for me said iyou know when  sally is a comely independent simple character with no makeup about her wholl think me as much a superior to her as i used to thinkyou know who i meanwas to me  ay said johns  however i shouldnt call sally hall simple  primary because no sally is secondary because if some could be this one wouldnt  tis a wrong denomination to apply to a woman charles and affects me as your best man like cold water  tis like recommending a stage play by saying theres neither murder villainy nor harm of any sort in it when thats what youve paid your halfcrown to see  well may your opinion do you good  mines a different one  and turning the conversation from the philosophical to the practical darton expressed a hope that the said sally had received what hed sent on by the carrier that day  johns wanted to know what that was  it is a dress said darton  not exactly a weddingdress though she may use it as one if she likes  it is rather serviceable than showysuitable for the winter weather  good said johns  serviceable is a wise word in a bridegroom  i commend ye charles  for said darton why should a woman dress up like a ropedancer because shes going to do the most solemn deed of her life except dying  faith why  but she will because she will i suppose said dairyman johns  hm said darton  the lane they followed had been nearly straight for several miles but it now took a turn and winding uncertainly for some distance forked into two  by night country roads are apt to reveal ungainly qualities which pass without observation during day and though darton had travelled this way before he had not done so frequently sally having been wooed at the house of a relative near his own  he never remembered seeing at this spot a pair of alternative ways looking so equally probable as these two did now  johns rode on a few steps  dont be out of heart sonny he cried  heres a handpost  enochcome and climm this post and tell us the way  the lad dismounted and jumped into the hedge where the post stood under a tree  unstrap the baskets or youll smash up that wine cried darton as the young man began spasmodically to climb the post baskets and all  was there ever less head in a brainless world said johns  here simple nocky ill do it  he leapt off and with much puffing climbed the post striking a match when he reached the top and moving the light along the arm the lad standing and gazing at the spectacle  i have faced tantalization these twenty years with a temper as mild as milk said japheth but such things as this dont come short of devilry  and flinging the match away he slipped down to the ground  whats the matter asked darton  not a letter sacred or heathennot so much as would tell us the way to the great fireplaceever i should sin to say it  either the moss and mildew have eat away the words or we have arrived in a land where the natyves have lost the art o writing and should ha brought our compass like christopher columbus  let us take the straightest road said darton placidly i shant be sorry to get theretis a tiresome ride  i would have driven if i had known  nor i neither sir said enoch  these straps plough my shoulder like a zull  if tis much further to your ladys home maister darton i shall ask to be let carry half of these good things in my innerdshee hee  dont you be such a reforming radical enoch said johns sternly here ill take the turkey  this being done they went forward by the righthand lane which ascended a hill the left winding away under a plantation  the pitapat of their horses hoofs lessened up the slope and the ironical directingpost stood in solitude as before holding out its blank arms to the raw breeze which brought a snore from the wood as if skrymir the giant were sleeping there    chapter ii   three miles to the left of the travellers along the road they had not followed rose an old house with mullioned windows of hamhill stone and chimneys of lavish solidity  it stood at the top of a slope beside kingshintock villagestreet and immediately in front of it grew a large sycamoretree whose bared roots formed a convenient staircase from the road below to the front door of the dwelling  its situation gave the house what little distinctive name it possessed namely the knap  some forty yards off a brook dribbled past which for its size made a great deal of noise  at the back was a dairy barton accessible for vehicles and livestock by a side drong  thus much only of the character of the homestead could be divined out of doors at this shady eveningtime  but within there was plenty of light to see by as plenty was construed at hintock  beside a tudor fireplace whose moulded fourcentred arch was nearly hidden by a figured bluecloth blower were seated two womenmother and daughtermrs hall and sarah or sally for this was a part of the world where the latter modification had not as yet been effaced as a vulgarity by the march of intellect  the owner of the name was the young woman by whose means mr darton proposed to put an end to his bachelor condition on the approaching day  the mothers bereavement had been so long ago as not to leave much mark of its occurrence upon her now either in face or clothes  she had resumed the mobcap of her early married life enlivening its whiteness by a few rosedubarry ribbons  sally required no such aids to pinkness roseate goodnature lit up her gaze her features showed curves of decision and judgment and she might have been regarded without much mistake as a warmhearted quickspirited handsome girl  she did most of the talking her mother listening with a halfabsent air as she picked up fragments of redhot wood ember with the tongs and piled them upon the brands  but the number of speeches that passed was very small in proportion to the meanings exchanged  long experience together often enabled them to see the course of thought in each others minds without a word being spoken  behind them in the centre of the room the table was spread for supper certain whiffs of air laden with fat vapours which ever and anon entered from the kitchen denoting its preparation there  the new gown he was going to send you stays about on the way like himself sallys mother was saying  yes not finished i daresay cried sally independently  lord i shouldnt be amazed if it didnt come at all  young men make such kind promises when they are near you and forget em when they go away  but he doesnt intend it as a weddinggownhe gives it to me merely as a gown to wear when i likea travellingdress is what it would be called by some  come rathe or come late it dont much matter as i have a dress of my own to fall back upon  but what time is it  she went to the family clock and opened the glass for the hour was not otherwise discernible by night and indeed at all times was rather a thing to be investigated than beheld so much more wall than window was there in the apartment  it is nearly eight said she  eight oclock and neither dress nor man said mrs hall  mother if you think to tantalize me by talking like that you are much mistaken  let him be as late as he willor stay away altogetheri dont care said sally  but a tender minute quaver in the negation showed that there was something forced in that statement  mrs hall perceived it and drily observed that she was not so sure about sally not caring  but perhaps you dont care so much as i do after all she said  for i see what you dont that it is a good and flourishing match for you a very honourable offer in mr darton  and i think i see a kind husband in him  so pray god twill go smooth and wind up well  sally would not listen to misgivings  of course it would go smoothly she asserted  how you are up and down mother she went on  at this moment whatever hinders him we are not so anxious to see him as he is to be here and his thought runs on before him and settles down upon us like the star in the east  hark she exclaimed with a breath of relief her eyes sparkling  i heard something  yeshere they are  the next moment her mothers slower ear also distinguished the familiar reverberation occasioned by footsteps clambering up the roots of the sycamore  yes it sounds like them at last she said  well it is not so very late after all considering the distance  the footfall ceased and they arose expecting a knock  they began to think it might have been after all some neighbouring villager under bacchic influence giving the centre of the road a wide berth when their doubts were dispelled by the newcomers entry into the passage  the door of the room was gently opened and there appeared not the pair of travellers with whom we have already made acquaintance but a palefaced man in the garb of extreme povertyalmost in rags  o its a trampgracious me said sally starting back  his cheeks and eyeorbits were deep concavesrather it might be from natural weakness of constitution than irregular living though there were indications that he had led no careful life  he gazed at the two women fixedly for a moment then with an abashed humiliated demeanour dropped his glance to the floor and sank into a chair without uttering a word  sally was in advance of her mother who had remained standing by the fire  she now tried to discern the visitor across the candles  whymother said sally faintly turning back to mrs hall  it is phil from australia  mrs hall started and grew pale and a fit of coughing seized the man with the ragged clothes  to come home like this she said  o philipare you ill  no no mother replied he impatiently as soon as he could speak  but for gods sake how do you come hereand just now too  well i am here said the man  how it is i hardly know  ive come home mother because i was driven to it  things were against me out there and went from bad to worse  then why didnt you let us knowyouve not writ a line for the last two or three years  the son admitted sadly that he had not  he said that he had hoped and thought he might fetch up again and be able to send good news  then he had been obliged to abandon that hope and had finally come home from sheer necessitypreviously to making a new start  yes things are very bad with me he repeated perceiving their commiserating glances at his clothes  they brought him nearer the fire took his hat from his thin hand which was so small and smooth as to show that his attempts to fetch up again had not been in a manual direction  his mother resumed her inquiries and dubiously asked if he had chosen to come that particular night for any special reason  for no reason he told her  his arrival had been quite at random  then philip hall looked round the room and saw for the first time that the table was laid somewhat luxuriously and for a larger number than themselves and that an air of festivity pervaded their dress  he asked quickly what was going on  sally is going to be married in a day or two replied the mother and she explained how mr darton sallys intended husband was coming there that night with the groomsman mr johns and other details  we thought it must be their step when we heard you said mrs hall  the needy wanderer looked again on the floor  i seei see he murmured  why indeed should i have come tonight  such folk as i are not wanted here at these times naturally  and i have no business herespoiling other peoples happiness  phil said his mother with a tear in her eye but with a thinness of lip and severity of manner which were presumably not more than past events justified since you speak like that to me ill speak honestly to you  for these three years you have taken no thought for us  you left home with a good supply of money and strength and education and you ought to have made good use of it all  but you come back like a beggar and that you come in a very awkward time for us cannot be denied your return tonight may do us much harm  but mindyou are welcome to this home as long as it is mine  i dont wish to turn you adrift  we will make the best of a bad job and i hope you are not seriously ill  o no  i have only this infernal cough  she looked at him anxiously  i think you had better go to bed at once she said  welli shall be out of the way there said the son wearily  having ruined myself dont let me ruin you by being seen in these togs for heavens sake  who do you say sally is going to be married toa farmer darton  yesa gentlemanfarmerquite a wealthy man  far better in station than she could have expected  it is a good thing altogether  well done little sal said her brother brightening and looking up at her with a smile  i ought to have written but perhaps i have thought of you all the more  but let me get out of sight  i would rather go and jump into the river than be seen here  but have you anything i can drink  i am confoundedly thirsty with my long tramp  yes yes we will bring something upstairs to you said sally with grief in her face  ay that will do nicely  but sally and mother  he stopped and they waited  mother i have not told you all he resumed slowly still looking on the floor between his knees  sad as what you see of me is theres worse behind  his mother gazed upon him in grieved suspense and sally went and leant upon the bureau listening for every sound and sighing  suddenly she turned round saying let them come i dont care  philip tell the worst and take your time  well then said the unhappy phil i am not the only one in this mess would to heaven i were  but  o phil  i have a wife as destitute as i  a wife said his mother  unhappily  a wife  yes that is the way with sons  and besides said he  besides  o philip surely  i have two little children  wife and children whispered mrs hall sinking down confounded  poor little things said sally involuntarily  his mother turned again to him  i suppose these helpless beings are left in australia  no  they are in england  well i can only hope youve left them in a respectable place  i have not left them at all  they are herewithin a few yards of us in short they are in the stable  where  in the stable  i did not like to bring them indoors till i had seen you mother and broken the bad news a bit to you  they were very tired and are resting out there on some straw  mrs halls fortitude visibly broke down  she had been brought up not without refinement and was even more moved by such a collapse of genteel aims as this than a substantial dairymans widow would in ordinary have been moved  well it must be borne she said in a low voice with her hands tightly joined  a starving son a starving wife starving children  let it be  but why is this come to us now today tonight could no other misfortune happen to helpless women than this which will quite upset my poor girls chance of a happy life  why have you done us this wrong philip  what respectable man will come here and marry open eyed into a family of vagabonds  nonsense mother said sally vehemently while her face flushed charley isnt the man to desert me  but if he should be and wont marry me because phils come let him go and marry elsewhere  i wont be ashamed of my own flesh and blood for any man in englandnot i  and then sally turned away and burst into tears  wait till you are twenty years older and you will tell a different tale replied her mother  the son stood up  mother he said bitterly as i have come so i will go  all i ask of you is that you will allow me and mine to lie in your stable tonight  i give you my word that well be gone by break of day and trouble you no further  mrs hall the mother changed at that  o no she answered hastily never shall it be said that i sent any of my own family from my door bring em in philip or take me out to them  we will put em all into the large bedroom said sally brightening and make up a large fire  lets go and help them in and call rebekah rebekah was the woman who assisted at the dairy and housework she lived in a cottage hard by with her husband who attended to the cows  sally went to fetch a lantern from the backkitchen but her brother said you wont want a light  i lit the lantern that was hanging there  what must we call your wife asked mrs hall  helena said philip  with shawls over their heads they proceeded towards the back door  one minute before you go interrupted philip  ii havent confessed all  then heaven help us said mrs hall pushing to the door and clasping her hands in calm despair  we passed through evershead as we came he continued and i just looked in at the sowandacorn to see if old mike still kept on there as usual  the carrier had come in from sherton abbas at that moment and guessing that i was bound for this placefor i think he knew mehe asked me to bring on a dressmakers parcel for sally that was marked immediate  my wife had walked on with the children  twas a flimsy parcel and the paper was torn and i found on looking at it that it was a thick warm gown  i didnt wish you to see poor helena in a shabby state  i was ashamed that you shouldtwas not what she was born to  i untied the parcel in the road took it on to her where she was waiting in the lower barn and told her i had managed to get it for her and that she was to ask no question  she poor thing must have supposed i obtained it on trust through having reached a place where i was known for she put it on gladly enough  she has it on now  sally has other gowns i daresay  sally looked at her mother speechless  you have others i daresay repeated phil with a sick mans impatience  i thought to myself better sally cry than helena freeze well is the dress of great consequence  twas nothing very ornamental as far as i could see  nono not of consequence returned sally sadly adding in a gentle voice you will not mind if i lend her another instead of that one will you  philips agitation at the confession had brought on another attack of the cough which seemed to shake him to pieces  he was so obviously unfit to sit in a chair that they helped him upstairs at once and having hastily given him a cordial and kindled the bedroom fire they descended to fetch their unhappy new relations    chapter iii   it was with strange feelings that the girl and her mother lately so cheerful passed out of the back door into the open air of the barton laden with hay scents and the herby breath of cows  a fine sleet had begun to fall and they trotted across the yard quickly  the stabledoor was open a light shone from itfrom the lantern which always hung there and which philip had lighted as he said  softly nearing the door mrs hall pronounced the name helena  there was no answer for the moment  looking in she was taken by surprise  two people appeared before her  for one instead of the drabbish woman she had expected mrs hall saw a pale darkeyed ladylike creature whose personality ruled her attire rather than was ruled by it  she was in a new and handsome gown of course and an old bonnet  she was standing up agitated her hand was held by her companionnone else than sallys affianced farmer charles darton upon whose fine figure the pale strangers eyes were fixed as his were fixed upon her  his other hand held the rein of his horse which was standing saddled as if just led in  at sight of mrs hall they both turned looking at her in a way neither quite conscious nor unconscious and without seeming to recollect that words were necessary as a solution to the scene  in another moment sally entered also when mr darton dropped his companions hand led the horse aside and came to greet his betrothed and mrs hall  ah he said smilingwith something like forced composurethis is a roundabout way of arriving you will say my dear mrs hall  but we lost our way which made us late  i saw a light here and led in my horse at oncemy friend johns and my man have gone back to the little inn with theirs not to crowd you too much  no sooner had i entered than i saw that this lady had taken temporary shelter hereand found i was intruding  she is my daughterinlaw said mrs hall calmly  my son too is in the house but he has gone to bed unwell  sally had stood staring wonderingly at the scene until this moment hardly recognizing dartons shake of the hand  the spell that bound her was broken by her perceiving the two little children seated on a heap of hay  she suddenly went forward spoke to them and took one on her arm and the other in her hand  and two children said mr darton showing thus that he had not been there long enough as yet to understand the situation  my grandchildren said mrs hall with as much affected ease as before  philip halls wife in spite of this interruption to her first rencounter seemed scarcely so much affected by it as to feel any ones presence in addition to mr dartons  however arousing herself by a quick reflection she threw a sudden critical glance of her sad eyes upon mrs hall and apparently finding her satisfactory advanced to her in a meek initiative  then sally and the stranger spoke some friendly words to each other and sally went on with the children into the house  mrs hall and helena followed and mr darton followed these looking at helenas dress and outline and listening to her voice like a man in a dream  by the time the others reached the house sally had already gone upstairs with the tired children  she rapped against the wall for rebekah to come in and help to attend to them rebekahs house being a little spitand dab cabin leaning against the substantial stonework of mrs halls taller erection  when she came a bed was made up for the little ones and some supper given to them  on descending the stairs after seeing this done sally went to the sittingroom  young mrs hall entered it just in advance of her having in the interim retired with her motherin law to take off her bonnet and otherwise make herself presentable  hence it was evident that no further communication could have passed between her and mr darton since their brief interview in the stable  mr japheth johns now opportunely arrived and broke up the restraint of the company after a few orthodox meteorological commentaries had passed between him and mrs hall by way of introduction  they at once sat down to supper the present of wine and turkey not being produced for consumption tonight lest the premature display of those gifts should seem to throw doubt on mrs halls capacities as a provider  drink hearty mr johnsdrink hearty said that matron magnanimously such as it is theres plenty of  but perhaps ciderwine is not to your tastethough theres body in it  quite the contrairy maamquite the contrairy said the dairyman for though i inherit the maltliquor principle from my father i am a ciderdrinker on my mothers side  she came from these parts you know and theres this to be said forttis a more peaceful liquor and dont lie about a man like your hotter drinks  with care one may live on it a twelvemonth without knocking down a neighbour or getting a black eye from an old acquaintance  the general conversation thus begun was continued briskly though it was in the main restricted to mrs hall and japheth who in truth required but little help from anybody  there being slight call upon sallys tongue she had ample leisure to do what her heart most desired namely watch her intended husband and her sisterinlaw with a view of elucidating the strange momentary scene in which her mother and herself had surprised them in the stable  if that scene meant anything it meant at least that they had met before  that there had been no time for explanations sally could see for their manner was still one of suppressed amazement at each others presence there  dartons eyes too fell continually on the gown worn by helena as if this were an added riddle to his perplexity though to sally it was the one feature in the case which was no mystery  he seemed to feel that fate had impishly changed his visavis in the lovers jig he was about to foot that while the gown had been expected to enclose a sally a helenas face looked out from the bodice that some longlost hand met his own from the sleeves  sally could see that whatever helena might know of darton she knew nothing of how the dress entered into his embarrassment  and at moments the young girl would have persuaded herself that dartons looks at her sisterinlaw were entirely the fruit of the clothes query  but surely at other times a more extensive range of speculation and sentiment was expressed by her lovers eye than that which the changed dress would account for  sallys independence made her one of the least jealous of women  but there was something in the relations of these two visitors which ought to be explained  japheth johns continued to converse in his wellknown style interspersing his talk with some private reflections on the position of darton and sally which though the sparkle in his eye showed them to be highly entertaining to himself were apparently not quite communicable to the company  at last he withdrew for the night going off to the roadside inn halfamile back whither darton promised to follow him in a few minutes  halfanhour passed and then mr darton also rose to leave sally and her sisterinlaw simultaneously wishing him goodnight as they retired upstairs to their rooms  but on his arriving at the front door with mrs hall a sharp shower of rain began to come down when the widow suggested that he should return to the fireside till the storm ceased  darton accepted her proposal but insisted that as it was getting late and she was obviously tired she should not sit up on his account since he could let himself out of the house and would quite enjoy smoking a pipe by the hearth alone  mrs hall assented and darton was left by himself  he spread his knees to the brands lit up his tobacco as he had said and sat gazing into the fire and at the notches of the chimney crook which hung above  an occasional drop of rain rolled down the chimney with a hiss and still he smoked on but not like a man whose mind was at rest  in the long run however despite his meditations early hours afield and a long ride in the open air produced their natural result  he began to doze  how long he remained in this halfunconscious state he did not know  he suddenly opened his eyes  the backbrand had burnt itself in two and ceased to flame the light which he had placed on the mantelpiece had nearly gone out  but in spite of these deficiencies there was a light in the apartment and it came from elsewhere  turning his head he saw philip halls wife standing at the entrance of the room with a bedcandle in one hand a small brass teakettle in the other and his gown as it certainly seemed still upon her  helena said darton starting up  her countenance expressed dismay and her first words were an apology idid not know you were here mr darton she said while a blush flashed to her cheek  i thought every one had retiredi was coming to make a little water boil my husband seems to be worse  but perhaps the kitchen fire can be lighted up again  dont go on my account  by all means put it on here as you intended said darton  allow me to help you  he went forward to take the kettle from her hand but she did not allow him and placed it on the fire herself  they stood some way apart one on each side of the fireplace waiting till the water should boil the candle on the mantel between them and helena with her eyes on the kettle  darton was the first to break the silence  shall i call sally he said  o no she quickly returned  we have given trouble enough already  we have no right here  but we are the sport of fate and were obliged to come  no right here said he in surprise  none  i cant explain it now answered helena  this kettle is very slow  there was another pause the proverbial dilatoriness of watched pots was never more clearly exemplified  helenas face was of that sort which seems to ask for assistance without the owners knowledgethe very antipodes of sallys which was selfreliance expressed  dartons eyes travelled from the kettle to helenas face then back to the kettle then to the face for rather a longer time  so i am not to know anything of the mystery that has distracted me all the evening he said  how is it that a woman who refused me because as i supposed my position was not good enough for her taste is found to be the wife of a man who certainly seems to be worse off than i  he had the prior claim said she  what you knew him at that time  yes yes  please say no more she implored  whatever my errors i have paid for them during the last five years  the heart of darton was subject to sudden overflowings  he was kind to a fault  i am sorry from my soul he said involuntarily approaching her  helena withdrew a step or two at which he became conscious of his movement and quickly took his former place  here he stood without speaking and the little kettle began to sing  well you might have been my wife if you had chosen he said at last but thats all past and gone  however if you are in any trouble or poverty i shall be glad to be of service and as your relation by marriage i shall have a right to be  does your uncle know of your distress  my uncle is dead  he left me without a farthing  and now we have two children to maintain  what left you nothing  how could he be so cruel as that  i disgraced myself in his eyes  now said darton earnestly let me take care of the children at least while you are so unsettled  you belong to another so i cannot take care of you  yes you can said a voice and suddenly a third figure stood beside them  it was sally  you can since you seem to wish to she repeated she no longer belongs to another    my poor brother is dead  her face was red her eyes sparkled and all the woman came to the front i have heard it she went on to him passionately  you can protect her now as well as the children  she turned then to her agitated sisterin law  i heard something said sally in a gentle murmur differing much from her previous passionate words and i went into his room  it must have been the moment you left  he went off so quickly and weakly and it was so unexpected that i couldnt leave even to call you  darton was just able to gather from the confused discourse which followed that during his sleep by the fire this brother whom he had never seen had become worse and that during helenas absence for water the end had unexpectedly come  the two young women hastened upstairs and he was again left alone        after standing there a short time he went to the front door and looked out till softly closing it behind him he advanced and stood under the large sycamoretree  the stars were flickering coldly and the dampness which had just descended upon the earth in rain now sent up a chill from it  darton was in a strange position and he felt it  the unexpected appearance in deep poverty of helenaa young lady daughter of a deceased naval officer who had been brought up by her uncle a solicitor and had refused darton in marriage years agothe passionate almost angry demeanour of sally at discovering them the abrupt announcement that helena was a widow all this coming together was a conjuncture difficult to cope with in a moment and made him question whether he ought to leave the house or offer assistance  but for sallys manner he would unhesitatingly have done the latter  he was still standing under the tree when the door in front of him opened and mrs hall came out  she went round to the gardengate at the side without seeing him  darton followed her intending to speak  pausing outside as if in thought she proceeded to a spot where the sun came earliest in springtime and where the north wind never blew it was where the row of beehives stood under the wall  discerning her object he waited till she had accomplished it  it was the universal custom thereabout to wake the bees by tapping at their hives whenever a death occurred in the household under the belief that if this were not done the bees themselves would pine away and perish during the ensuing year  as soon as an interior buzzing responded to her tap at the first hive mrs hall went on to the second and thus passed down the row  as soon as she came back he met her  what can i do in this trouble mrs hall he said  onothing thank you nothing she said in a tearful voice now just perceiving him  we have called rebekah and her husband and they will do everything necessary  she told him in a few words the particulars of her sons arrival broken in healthindeed at deaths very door though they did not suspect itand suggested as the result of a conversation between her and her daughter that the wedding should be postponed  yes of course said darton  i think now to go straight to the inn and tell johns what has happened  it was not till after he had shaken hands with her that he turned hesitatingly and added will you tell the mother of his children that as they are now left fatherless i shall be glad to take the eldest of them if it would be any convenience to her and to you  mrs hall promised that her sons widow should he told of the offer and they parted  he retired down the rooty slope and disappeared in the direction of the inn where he informed johns of the circumstances meanwhile mrs hall had entered the house sally was downstairs in the sittingroom alone and her mother explained to her that darton had readily assented to the postponement  no doubt he has said sally with sad emphasis  it is not put off for a week or a month or a year  i shall never marry him and she will    chapter iv   time passed and the household on the knap became again serene under the composing influences of daily routine  a desultory very desultory correspondence dragged on between sally hall and darton who not quite knowing how to take her petulant words on the night of her brothers death had continued passive thus long  helena and her children remained at the dairyhouse almost of necessity and darton therefore deemed it advisable to stay away  one day seven months later on when mr darton was as usual at his farm twenty miles from hintock a note reached him from helena  she thanked him for his kind offer about her children which her motherinlaw had duly communicated and stated that she would be glad to accept it as regarded the eldest the boy  helena had in truth good need to do so for her uncle had left her penniless and all application to some relatives in the north had failed  there was besides as she said no good school near hintock to which she could send the child  on a fine summer day the boy came  he was accompanied halfway by sally and his motherto the white horse at chalk newtonwhere he was handed over to dartons bailiff in a shining springcart who met them there  he was entered as a dayscholar at a popular school at casterbridge three or four miles from dartons having first been taught by darton to ride a forestpony on which he cantered to and from the aforesaid fount of knowledge and as darton hoped brought away a promising headful of the same at each diurnal expedition  the thoughtful taciturnity into which darton had latterly fallen was quite dissipated by the presence of this boy  when the christmas holidays came it was arranged that he should spend them with his mother  the journey was for some reason or other performed in two stages as at his coming except that darton in person took the place of the bailiff and that the boy and himself rode on horseback  reaching the renowned white horse darton inquired if miss and young mrs hall were there to meet little philip as they had agreed to be  he was answered by the appearance of helena alone at the door  at the last moment sally would not come she faltered  that meeting practically settled the point towards which these longsevered persons were converging  but nothing was broached about it for some time yet  sally hall had in fact imparted the first decisive motion to events by refusing to accompany helena  she soon gave them a second move by writing the following note     private     dear charlesliving here so long and intimately with helena i have    naturally learnt her history especially that of it which refers to    you  i am sure she would accept you as a husband at the proper time    and i think you ought to give her the opportunity  you inquire in an    old note if i am sorry that i showed temper which it wasnt that    night when i heard you talking to her  no charles i am not sorry at    all for what i said thenyours sincerely sally hall  thus set in train the transfer of dartons heart back to its original quarters proceeded by mere lapse of time  in the following july darton went to his friend japheth to ask him at last to fulfil the bridal office which had been in abeyance since the previous january twelvemonths  with all my heart man o constancy said dairyman johns warmly  ive lost most of my genteel fair complexion haymaking this hot weather tis true but ill do your business as well as them that look better  there be scents and good hairoil in the world yet thank god and theyll take off the roughest o my edge  ill compliment her  better late than never sally hall ill say  it is not sally said darton hurriedly  it is young mrs hall  japheths face as soon as he really comprehended became a picture of reproachful dismay  not sally he said  why not sally  i cant believe it  young mrs hall  well wellwheres your wisdom  darton shortly explained particulars but johns would not be reconciled she was a woman worth having if ever woman was he cried  and now to let her go  but i suppose i can marry where i like said darton  hm replied the dairyman lifting his eyebrows expressively  this dont become you charlesit really do not  if i had done such a thing you would have sworn i was a curst nothern fool to be drawn off the scent by such a redherring dollolloll  farmer darton responded in such sharp terms to this laconic opinion that the two friends finally parted in a way they had never parted before johns was to be no groomsman to darton after all  he had flatly declined  darton went off sorry and even unhappy particularly as japheth was about to leave that side of the county so that the words which had divided them were not likely to be explained away or softened down  a short time after the interview darton was united to helena at a simple matterof fact wedding and she and her little girl joined the boy who had already grown to look on dartons house as home  for some months the farmer experienced an unprecedented happiness and satisfaction  there had been a flaw in his life and it was as neatly mended as was humanly possible  but after a season the stream of events followed less clearly and there were shades in his reveries  helena was a fragile woman of little staying power physically or morally and since the time that he had originally known hereight or ten years beforeshe had been severely tried  she had loved herself out in short and was now occasionally given to moping  sometimes she spoke regretfully of the gentilities of her early life and instead of comparing her present state with her condition as the wife of the unlucky hall she mused rather on what it had been before she took the first fatal step of clandestinely marrying him  she did not care to please such people as those with whom she was thrown as a thriving farmers wife  she allowed the pretty trifles of agricultural domesticity to glide by her as sorry details and had it not been for the children dartons house would have seemed but little brighter than it had been before  this led to occasional unpleasantness until darton sometimes declared to himself that such endeavours as his to rectify early deviations of the heart by harking back to the old point mostly failed of success  perhaps johns was right he would say  i should have gone on with sally better go with the tide and make the best of its course than stem it at the risk of a capsize  but he kept these unmelodious thoughts to himself and was outwardly considerate and kind  this somewhat barren tract of his life had extended to less than a year and a half when his ponderings were cut short by the loss of the woman they concerned  when she was in her grave he thought better of her than when she had been alive the farm was a worse place without her than with her after all  no woman short of divine could have gone through such an experience as hers with her first husband without becoming a little soured  her stagnant sympathies her sometimes unreasonable manner had covered a heart frank and well meaning and originally hopeful and warm she left him a tiny red infant in white wrappings  to make life as easy as possible to this touching object became at once his care  as this child learnt to walk and talk darton learnt to see feasibility in a scheme which pleased him  revolving the experiment which he had hitherto made upon life he fancied he had gained wisdom from his mistakes and caution from his miscarriages  what the scheme was needs no penetration to discover  once more he had opportunity to recast and rectify his illwrought situations by returning to sally hall who still lived quietly on under her mothers roof at hintock  helena had been a woman to lend pathos and refinement to a home sally was the woman to brighten it  she would not as helena did despise the rural simplicities of a farmers fireside  moreover she had a preeminent qualification for dartons household no other woman could make so desirable a mother to her brothers two children and dartons one as sallywhile darton now that helena had gone was a more promising husband for sally than he had ever been when liable to reminders from an uncured sentimental wound  darton was not a man to act rapidly and the working out of his reparative designs might have been delayed for some time  but there came a winter evening precisely like the one which had darkened over that former ride to hintock and he asked himself why he should postpone longer when the very landscape called for a repetition of that attempt  he told his man to saddle the mare booted and spurred himself with a younger horsemans nicety kissed the two youngest children and rode off  to make the journey a complete parallel to the first he would fain have had his old acquaintance japheth johns with him  but johns alas was missing  his removal to the other side of the county had left unrepaired the breach which had arisen between him and darton and though darton had forgiven him a hundred times as johns had probably forgiven darton the effort of reunion in present circumstances was one not likely to be made  he screwed himself up to as cheerful a pitch as he could without his former crony and became content with his own thoughts as he rode instead of the words of a companion  the sun went down the boughs appeared scratched in like an etching against the sky old crooked men with faggots at their backs said goodnight sir and darton replied goodnight right heartily  by the time he reached the forking roads it was getting as dark as it had been on the occasion when johns climbed the directingpost  darton made no mistake this time  nor shall i be able to mistake thank heaven when i arrive he murmured  it gave him peculiar satisfaction to think that the proposed marriage like his first was of the nature of setting in order things long awry and not a momentary freak of fancy  nothing hindered the smoothness of his journey which seemed not half its former length  though dark it was only between five and six oclock when the bulky chimneys of mrs halls residence appeared in view behind the sycamoretree  on second thoughts he retreated and put up at the ale house as in former time and when he had plumed himself before the inn mirror called for something to drink and smoothed out the incipient wrinkles of care he walked on to the knap with a quick step    chapter v   that evening sally was making pinners for the milkers who were now increased by two for her mother and herself no longer joined in milking the cows themselves  but upon the whole there was little change in the household economy and not much in its appearance beyond such minor particulars as that the crack over the window which had been a hundred years coming was a trifle wider that the beams were a shade blacker that the influence of modernism had supplanted the open chimney corner by a grate that rebekah who had worn a cap when she had plenty of hair had left it off now she had scarce any because it was reported that caps were not fashionable and that sallys face had naturally assumed a more womanly and experienced cast  mrs hall was actually lifting coals with the tongs as she had used to do  five years ago this very night if i am not mistaken she said laying on an ember  not this very nightthough twas one night this week said the correct sally  well tis near enough  five years ago mr darton came to marry you and my poor boy phil came home to die  she sighed  ah sally she presently said if you had managed well mr darton would have had you helena or none  dont be sentimental about that mother begged sally  i didnt care to manage well in such a case  though i liked him i wasnt so anxious i would never have married the man in the midst of such a hitch as that was she added with decision and i dont think i would if he were to ask me now  i am not sure about that unless you have another in your eye  i wouldnt and ill tell you why  i could hardly marry him for love at this time o day  and as weve quite enough to live on if we give up the dairy tomorrow i should have no need to marry for any meaner reason    i am quite happy enough as i am and theres an end of it  now it was not long after this dialogue that there came a mild rap at the door and in a moment there entered rebekah looking as though a ghost had arrived  the fact was that that accomplished skimmer and churner now a resident in the house had overheard the desultory observations between mother and daughter and on opening the door to mr darton thought the coincidence must have a grisly meaning in it  mrs hall welcomed the farmer with warm surprise as did sally and for a moment they rather wanted words  can you push up the chimneycrook for me mr darton the notches hitch said the matron  he did it and the homely little act bridged over the awkward consciousness that he had been a stranger for four years  mrs hall soon saw what he had come for and left the principals together while she went to prepare him a late tea smiling at sallys recent hasty assertions of indifference when she saw how civil sally was  when tea was ready she joined them  she fancied that darton did not look so confident as when he had arrived but sally was quite lighthearted and the meal passed pleasantly  about seven he took his leave of them  mrs hall went as far as the door to light him down the slope  on the doorstep he said franklyi came to ask your daughter to marry me chose the night and everything with an eye to a favourable answer  but she wont  then shes a very ungrateful girl emphatically said mrs hall  darton paused to shape his sentence and asked ii suppose theres nobody else more favoured  i cant say that there is or that there isnt answered mrs hall shes private in some things  im on your side however mr darton and ill talk to her  thank ee thank ee said the farmer in a gayer accent and with this assurance the not very satisfactory visit came to an end  darton descended the roots of the sycamore the light was withdrawn and the door closed  at the bottom of the slope he nearly ran against a man about to ascend  can a jackolent believe his few senses on such a dark night or cant he exclaimed one whose utterance darton recognized in a moment despite its unexpectedness  i dare not swear he can though i fain would  the speaker was johns  darton said he was glad of this opportunity bad as it was of putting an end to the silence of years and asked the dairyman what he was travelling that way for  japheth showed the old jovial confidence in a moment  im going to see yourrelationsas they always seem to me he saidmrs hall and sally  well charles the fact is i find the natural barbarousness of man is much increased by a bachelor life and as your leavings were always good enough for me im trying civilization here  he nodded towards the house  not with sallyto marry her said darton feeling something like a rill of ice water between his shoulders  yes by the help of providence and my personal charms  and i think i shall get her  i am this road every weekmy present dairy is only four miles off you know and i see her through the window  tis rather odd that i was going to speak practical tonight to her for the first time youve just called  yes for a short while  but she didnt say a word about you  a good sign a good sign  now that decides me  ill swing the mallet and get her answer this very night as i planned  a few more remarks and darton wishing his friend joy of sally in a slightly hollow tone of jocularity bade him goodbye  johns promised to write particulars and ascended and was lost in the shade of the house and tree  a rectangle of light appeared when johns was admitted and all was dark again  happy japheth said darton  this then is the explanation  he determined to return home that night  in a quarter of an hour he passed out of the village and the next day went about his swedelifting and storing as if nothing had occurred  he waited and waited to hear from johns whether the weddingday was fixed but no letter came  he learnt not a single particular till meeting johns one day at a horseauction darton exclaimed geniallyrather more genially than he feltwhen is the joyful day to be  to his great surprise a reciprocity of gladness was not conspicuous in johns  not at all he said in a very subdued tone  tis a bad job she wont have me  darton held his breath till he said with treacherous solicitude try againtis coyness  o no said johns decisively  theres been none of that  we talked it over dozens of times in the most fair and square way  she tells me plainly i dont suit her  twould be simply annoying her to ask her again  ah charles you threw a prize away when you let her slip five years ago  i didi did said darton  he returned from that auction with a new set of feelings in play  he had certainly made a surprising mistake in thinking johns his successful rival  it really seemed as if he might hope for sally after all  this time being rather pressed by business darton had recourse to pen andink and wrote her as manly and straightforward a proposal as any woman could wish to receive  the reply came promptly     dear mr dartoni am as sensible as any woman can be of the    goodness that leads you to make me this offer a second time  better    women than i would be proud of the honour for when i read your nice    long speeches on mangoldwurzel and such like topics at the    casterbridge farmers club i do feel it an honour i assure you  but    my answer is just the same as before  i will not try to explain what    in truth i cannot explainmy reasons i will simply say that i must    decline to be married to you  with good wishes as in former times i    am your faithful friend     sally hall  darton dropped the letter hopelessly  beyond the negative there was just a possibility of sarcasm in itnice long speeches on mangoldwurzel had a suspicious sound  however sarcasm or none there was the answer and he had to be content  he proceeded to seek relief in a business which at this time engrossed much of his attentionthat of clearing up a curious mistake just current in the county that he had been nearly ruined by the recent failure of a local bank  a farmer named darton had lost heavily and the similarity of name had probably led to the error  belief in it was so persistent that it demanded several days of letterwriting to set matters straight and persuade the world that he was as solvent as ever he had been in his life  he had hardly concluded this worrying task when to his delight another letter arrived in the handwriting of sally  darton tore it open it was very short     dear mr dartonwe have been so alarmed these last few days by the    report that you were ruined by the stoppage of s bank that now it    is contradicted i hasten by my mothers wish to say how truly glad    we are to find there is no foundation for the report  after your    kindness to my poor brothers children i can do no less than write at    such a moment  we had a letter from each of them a few days agoyour    faithful friend     sally hall  mercenary little woman said darton to himself with a smile  then that was the secret of her refusal this timeshe thought i was ruined  now such was darton that as hours went on he could not help feeling too generously towards sally to condemn her in this  what did he want in a wife he asked himself  love and integrity  what next  worldly wisdom and was there really more than worldly wisdom in her refusal to go aboard a sinking ship  she now knew it was otherwise  begad he said ill try her again  the fact was he had so set his heart upon sally and sally alone that nothing was to be allowed to baulk him and his reasoning was purely formal  anniversaries having been unpropitious he waited on till a bright day late in maya day when all animate nature was fancying in its trusting foolish way that it was going to bask out of doors for evermore  as he rode through longash lane it was scarce recognizable as the track of his two winter journeys  no mistake could be made now even with his eyes shut  the cuckoos note was at its best between april tentativeness and midsummer decrepitude and the reptiles in the sun behaved as winningly as kittens on a hearth  though afternoon and about the same time as on the last occasion it was broad day and sunshine when he entered hintock and the details of the knap dairyhouse were visible far up the road  he saw sally in the garden and was set vibrating  he had first intended to go on to the inn but no he said ill tie my horse to the garden gate  if all goes well it can soon be taken round if not i mount and ride away  the tall shade of the horseman darkened the room in which mrs hall sat and made her start for he had ridden by a side path to the top of the slope where riders seldom came  in a few seconds he was in the garden with sally  fiveay three minutesdid the business at the back of that row of bees  though spring had come and heavenly blue consecrated the scene darton succeeded not  no said sally firmly  i will never never marry you mr darton  i would have done it once but now i never can  butimplored mr darton  and with a burst of real eloquence he went on to declare all sorts of things that he would do for her  he would drive her to see her mother every weektake her to londonsettle so much money upon herheaven knows what he did not promise suggest and tempt her with  but it availed nothing  she interposed with a stout negative which closed the course of his argument like an iron gate across a highway  darton paused  then said he simply you hadnt heard of my supposed failure when you declined last time  i had not she said  but if i had twould have been all the same  and tis not because of any soreness from my slighting you years ago  no  that soreness is long past  ahthen you despise me sally  no she slowly answered  i dont altogether despise you  i dont think you quite such a hero as i once didthats all  the truth is i am happy enough as i am and i dont mean to marry at all  now may i ask a favour sir  she spoke with an ineffable charm which whenever he thought of it made him curse his loss of her as long as he lived  to any extent  please do not put this question to me any more  friends as long as you like but lovers and married never  i never will said darton  not if i live a hundred years  and he never did  that he had worn out his welcome in her heart was only too plain  when his stepchildren had grown up and were placed out in life all communication between darton and the hall family ceased  it was only by chance that years after he learnt that sally notwithstanding the solicitations her attractions drew down upon her had refused several offers of marriage and steadily adhered to her purpose of leading a single life  may 1884     the distracted preacher   chapter ihow his cold was cured   something delayed the arrival of the wesleyan minister and a young man came temporarily in his stead  it was on the thirteenth of january 183 that mr stockdale the young man in question made his humble entry into the village unknown and almost unseen  but when those of the inhabitants who styled themselves of his connection became acquainted with him they were rather pleased with the substitute than otherwise though he had scarcely as yet acquired ballast of character sufficient to steady the consciences of the hundredandforty methodists of pure blood who at this time lived in nethermoynton and to give in addition supplementary support to the mixed race which went to church in the morning and chapel in the evening or when there was a teaas many as a hundredandten people more all told and including the parishclerk in the wintertime when it was too dark for the vicar to observe who passed up the street at seven oclockwhich to be just to him he was never anxious to do  it was owing to this overlapping of creeds that the celebrated population puzzle arose among the denser gentry of the district around nethermoynton how could it be that a parish containing fifteen score of strong fullgrown episcopalians and nearly thirteen score of wellmatured dissenters numbered barely twoandtwenty score adults in all  the young man being personally interesting those with whom he came in contact were content to waive for a while the graver question of his sufficiency  it is said that at this time of his life his eyes were affectionate though without a ray of levity that his hair was curly and his figure tall that he was in short a very lovable youth who won upon his female hearers as soon as they saw and heard him and caused them to say why didnt we know of this before he came that we might have gied him a warmer welcome  the fact was that knowing him to be only provisionally selected and expecting nothing remarkable in his person or doctrine they and the rest of his flock in nethermoynton had felt almost as indifferent about his advent as if they had been the soundest churchgoing parishioners in the country and he their true and appointed parson  thus when stockdale set foot in the place nobody had secured a lodging for him and though his journey had given him a bad cold in the head he was forced to attend to that business himself  on inquiry he learnt that the only possible accommodation in the village would be found at the house of one mrs lizzy newberry at the upper end of the street  it was a youth who gave this information and stockdale asked him who mrs newberry might be  the boy said that she was a widowwoman who had got no husband because he was dead  mr newberry he added had been a welltodo man enough as the saying was and a farmer but he had gone off in a decline  as regarded mrs newberrys serious side stockdale gathered that she was one of the trimmers who went to church and chapel both  ill go there said stockdale feeling that in the absence of purely sectarian lodgings he could do no better  shes a little particular and wont hae goverment folks or curates or the pasons friends or such like said the lad dubiously  ah that may be a promising sign ill call  or no just you go up and ask first if she can find room for me  i have to see one or two persons on another matter  you will find me down at the carriers  in a quarter of an hour the lad came back and said that mrs newberry would have no objection to accommodate him whereupon stockdale called at the house  it stood within a gardenhedge and seemed to be roomy and comfortable he saw an elderly woman with whom he made arrangements to come the same night since there was no inn in the place and he wished to house himself as soon as possible the village being a local centre from which he was to radiate at once to the different small chapels in the neighbourhood  he forthwith sent his luggage to mrs newberrys from the carriers where he had taken shelter and in the evening walked up to his temporary home  as he now lived there stockdale felt it unnecessary to knock at the door and entering quietly he had the pleasure of hearing footsteps scudding away like mice into the back quarters  he advanced to the parlour as the front room was called though its stone floor was scarcely disguised by the carpet which only overlaid the trodden areas leaving sandy deserts under the bulging mouldings of the tablelegs playing with brass furniture  but the room looked snug and cheerful  the firelight shone out brightly trembling on the knobs and handles and lurking in great strength on the under surface of the chimneypiece  a deep armchair covered with horsehair and studded with a countless throng of brass nails was pulled up on one side of the fireplace  the teathings were on the table the teapot cover was open and a little handbell had been laid at that precise point towards which a person seated in the great chair might be expected instinctively to stretch his hand  stockdale sat down not objecting to his experience of the room thus far and began his residence by tinkling the bell  a little girl crept in at the summons and made tea for him  her name she said was marther sarer and she lived out there nodding towards the road and village generally  before stockdale had got far with his meal a tap sounded on the door behind him and on his telling the inquirer to come in a rustle of garments caused him to turn his head  he saw before him a fine and extremely wellmade young woman with dark hair a wide sensible beautiful forehead eyes that warmed him before he knew it and a mouth that was in itself a picture to all appreciative souls  can i get you anything else for tea she said coming forward a step or two an expression of liveliness on her features and her hand waving the door by its edge  nothing thank you said stockdale thinking less of what he replied than of what might be her relation to the household  you are quite sure said the young woman apparently aware that he had not considered his answer  he conscientiously examined the teathings and found them all there quite sure miss newberry he said  it is mrs newberry she said  lizzy newberry i used to be lizzy simpkins  o i beg your pardon mrs newberry  and before he had occasion to say more she left the room  stockdale remained in some doubt till martha sarah came to clear the table  whose house is this my little woman said he  mrs lizzy newberrys sir  then mrs newberry is not the old lady i saw this afternoon  no  thats mrs newberrys mother  it was mrs newberry who comed in to you just by now because she wanted to see if you was goodlooking  later in the evening when stockdale was about to begin supper she came again  i have come myself mr stockdale she said  the minister stood up in acknowledgment of the honour  i am afraid little marther might not make you understand  what will you have for suppertheres cold rabbit and theres a ham uncut  stockdale said he could get on nicely with those viands and supper was laid  he had no more than cut a slice when taptap came to the door again  the minister had already learnt that this particular rhythm in taps denoted the fingers of his enkindling landlady and the doomed young fellow buried his first mouthful under a look of receptive blandness  we have a chicken in the house mr stockdalei quite forgot to mention it just now  perhaps you would like marther sarer to bring it up  stockdale had advanced far enough in the art of being a young man to say that he did not want the chicken unless she brought it up herself but when it was uttered he blushed at the daring gallantry of the speech perhaps a shade too strong for a serious man and a minister  in three minutes the chicken appeared but to his great surprise only in the hands of martha sarah  stockdale was disappointed which perhaps it was intended that he should be  he had finished supper and was not in the least anticipating mrs newberry again that night when she tapped and entered as before stockdales gratified look told that she had lost nothing by not appearing when expected  it happened that the cold in the head from which the young man suffered had increased with the approach of night and before she had spoken he was seized with a violent fit of sneezing which he could not anyhow repress  mrs newberry looked full of pity  your cold is very bad tonight mr stockdale  stockdale replied that it was rather troublesome  and ive a good mindshe added archly looking at the cheerless glass of water on the table which the abstemious minister was going to drink  yes mrs newberry  ive a good mind that you should have something more likely to cure it than that cold stuff  well said stockdale looking down at the glass as there is no inn here and nothing better to be got in the village of course it will do  to this she replied there is something better not far off though not in the house  i really think you must try it or you may be ill  yes mr stockdale you shall  she held up her finger seeing that he was about to speak  dont ask what it is wait and you shall see  lizzy went away and stockdale waited in a pleasant mood  presently she returned with her bonnet and cloak on saying i am so sorry but you must help me to get it  mother has gone to bed  will you wrap yourself up and come this way and please bring that cup with you  stockdale a lonely young fellow who had for weeks felt a great craving for somebody on whom to throw away superfluous interest and even tenderness was not sorry to join her and followed his guide through the back door across the garden to the bottom where the boundary was a wall  this wall was low and beyond it stockdale discerned in the night shades several grey headstones and the outlines of the church roof and tower  it is easy to get up this way she said stepping upon a bank which abutted on the wall then putting her foot on the top of the stonework and descending a spring inside where the ground was much higher as is the manner of graveyards to be  stockdale did the same and followed her in the dusk across the irregular ground till they came to the tower door which when they had entered she softly closed behind them  you can keep a secret she said in a musical voice  like an iron chest said he fervently  then from under her cloak she produced a small lighted lantern which the minister had not noticed that she carried at all  the light showed them to be close to the singinggallery stairs under which lay a heap of lumber of all sorts but consisting mostly of decayed framework pews panels and pieces of flooring that from time to time had been removed from their original fixings in the body of the edifice and replaced by new  perhaps you will drag some of those boards aside she said holding the lantern over her head to light him better  or will you take the lantern while i move them  i can manage it said the young man and acting as she ordered he uncovered to his surprise a row of little barrels bound with wood hoops each barrel being about as large as the nave of a heavy waggon wheel  when they were laid open lizzy fixed her eyes on him as if she wondered what he would say  you know what they are she asked finding that he did not speak  yes barrels said stockdale simply  he was an inland man the son of highly respectable parents and brought up with a single eye to the ministry and the sight suggested nothing beyond the fact that such articles were there  you are quite right they are barrels she said in an emphatic tone of candour that was not without a touch of irony  stockdale looked at her with an eye of sudden misgiving  not smugglers liquor he said  yes said she  they are tubs of spirit that have accidentally come over in the dark from france  in nethermoynton and its vicinity at this date people always smiled at the sort of sin called in the outside world illicit trading and these little kegs of gin and brandy were as well known to the inhabitants as turnips  so that stockdales innocent ignorance and his look of alarm when he guessed the sinister mystery seemed to strike lizzy first as ludicrous and then as very awkward for the good impression that she wished to produce upon him  smuggling is carried on here by some of the people she said in a gentle apologetic voice  it has been their practice for generations and they think it no harm  now will you roll out one of the tubs  what to do with it said the minister  to draw a little from it to cure your cold she answered  it is so nation strong that it drives away that sort of thing in a jiffy  o it is all right about our taking it  i may have what i like the owner of the tubs says so  i ought to have had some in the house and then i shouldnt ha been put to this trouble but i drink none myself and so i often forget to keep it indoors  you are allowed to help yourself i suppose that you may not inform where their hidingplace is  well no not that particularly but i may take any if i want it  so help yourself  i will to oblige you since you have a right to it murmured the minister and though he was not quite satisfied with his part in the performance he rolled one of the tubs out from the corner into the middle of the tower floor  how do you wish me to get it outwith a gimlet i suppose  no ill show you said his interesting companion and she held up with her other hand a shoemakers awl and a hammer  you must never do these things with a gimlet because the wooddust gets in and when the buyers pour out the brandy that would tell them that the tub had been broached an awl makes no dust and the hole nearly closes up again  now tap one of the hoops forward  stockdale took the hammer and did so  now make the hole in the part that was covered by the hoop  he made the hole as directed  it wont run out he said  o yes it will said she  take the tub between your knees and squeeze the heads and ill hold the cup  stockdale obeyed and the pressure taking effect upon the tub which seemed to be thin the spirit spirted out in a stream  when the cup was full he ceased pressing and the flow immediately stopped  now we must fill up the keg with water said lizzy or it will cluck like forty hens when it is handled and show that tis not full  but they tell you you may take it  yes the smugglers but the buyers must not know that the smugglers have been kind to me at their expense  i see said stockdale doubtfully  i much question the honesty of this proceeding  by her direction he held the tub with the hole upwards and while he went through the process of alternately pressing and ceasing to press she produced a bottle of water from which she took mouthfuls conveying each to the keg by putting her pretty lips to the hole where it was sucked in at each recovery of the cask from pressure  when it was again full he plugged the hole knocked the hoop down to its place and buried the tub in the lumber as before  arent the smugglers afraid that you will tell he asked as they recrossed the churchyard  o no they are not afraid of that  i couldnt do such a thing  they have put you into a very awkward corner said stockdale emphatically  you must of course as an honest person sometimes feel that it is your duty to informreally you must  well i have never particularly felt it as a duty and besides my first husband  she stopped and there was some confusion in her voice stockdale was so honest and unsophisticated that he did not at once discern why she paused but at last he did perceive that the words were a slip and that no woman would have uttered first husband by accident unless she had thought pretty frequently of a second  he felt for her confusion and allowed her time to recover and proceed  my husband she said in a selfcorrected tone used to know of their doings and so did my father and kept the secret  i cannot inform in fact against anybody  i see the hardness of it he continued like a man who looked far into the moral of things  and it is very cruel that you should be tossed and tantalized between your memories and your conscience  i do hope mrs newberry that you will soon see your way out of this unpleasant position  well i dont just now she murmured  by this time they had passed over the wall and entered the house where she brought him a glass and hot water and left him to his own reflections  he looked after her vanishing form asking himself whether he as a respectable man and a minister and a shining light even though as yet only of the halfpennycandle sort were quite justified in doing this thing  a sneeze settled the question and he found that when the fiery liquor was lowered by the addition of twice or thrice the quantity of water it was one of the prettiest cures for a cold in the head that he had ever known particularly at this chilly time of the year  stockdale sat in the deep chair about twenty minutes sipping and meditating till he at length took warmer views of things and longed for the morrow when he would see mrs newberry again  he then felt that though chronologically at a short distance it would in an emotional sense be very long before tomorrow came and walked restlessly round the room  his eye was attracted by a framed and glazed sampler in which a running ornament of firtrees and peacocks surrounded the following pretty bit of sentiment     roseleaves smell when roses thrive    heres my work while im alive    roseleaves smell when shrunk and shed    heres my work when i am dead     lizzy simpkins  fear god  honour the king     aged 11 years  tis hers he said to himself  heavens how i like that name  before he had done thinking that no other name from abigail to zenobia would have suited his young landlady so well taptap came again upon the door and the minister started as her face appeared yet another time looking so disinterested that the most ingenious would have refrained from asserting that she had come to affect his feelings by her seductive eyes  would you like a fire in your room mr stockdale on account of your cold  the minister being still a little pricked in the conscience for countenancing her in watering the spirits saw here a way to selfchastisement  no i thank you he said firmly it is not necessary  i have never been used to one in my life and it would be giving way to luxury too far  then i wont insist she said and disconcerted him by vanishing instantly  wondering if she was vexed by his refusal he wished that he had chosen to have a fire even though it should have scorched him out of bed and endangered his selfdiscipline for a dozen days  however he consoled himself with what was in truth a rare consolation for a budding lover that he was under the same roof with lizzy her guest in fact to take a poetical view of the term lodger and that he would certainly see her on the morrow  the morrow came and stockdale rose early his cold quite gone  he had never in his life so longed for the breakfast hour as he did that day and punctually at eight oclock after a short walk to reconnoitre the premises he reentered the door of his dwelling  breakfast passed and martha sarah attended but nobody came voluntarily as on the night before to inquire if there were other wants which he had not mentioned and which she would attempt to gratify  he was disappointed and went out hoping to see her at dinner  dinner time came he sat down to the meal finished it lingered on for a whole hour although two new teachers were at that moment waiting at the chapeldoor to speak to him by appointment it was useless to wait longer and he slowly went his way down the lane cheered by the thought that after all he would see her in the evening and perhaps engage again in the delightful tubbroaching in the neighbouring church tower which proceeding he resolved to render more moral by steadfastly insisting that no water should be introduced to fill up though the tub should cluck like all the hens in christendom  but nothing could disguise the fact that it was a queer business and his countenance fell when he thought how much more his mind was interested in that matter than in his serious duties  however compunction vanished with the decline of day  night came and his tea and supper but no lizzy newberry and no sweet temptations  at last the minister could bear it no longer and said to his quaint little attendant where is mrs newberry today judiciously handing a penny as he spoke  shes busy said martha  anything serious happened he asked handing another penny and revealing yet additional pennies in the background  o nonothing at all said she with breathless confidence  nothing ever happens to her  shes only biding upstairs in bed because tis her way sometimes  being a young man of some honour he would not question further and assuming that lizzy must have a bad headache or other slight ailment in spite of what the girl had said he went to bed dissatisfied not even setting eyes on old mrs simpkins  i said last night that i should see her tomorrow he reflected but that was not to be  next day he had better fortune or worse meeting her at the foot of the stairs in the morning and being favoured by a visit or two from her during the dayonce for the purpose of making kindly inquiries about his comfort as on the first evening and at another time to place a bunch of winterviolets on his table with a promise to renew them when they drooped  on these occasions there was something in her smile which showed how conscious she was of the effect she produced though it must be said that it was rather a humorous than a designing consciousness and savoured more of pride than of vanity  as for stockdale he clearly perceived that he possessed unlimited capacity for backsliding and wished that tutelary saints were not denied to dissenters  he set a watch upon his tongue and eyes for the space of one hour and a half after which he found it was useless to struggle further and gave himself up to the situation  the other minister will be here in a month he said to himself when sitting over the fire  then i shall be off and she will distract my mind no more    and then shall i go on living by myself for ever  no when my two years of probation are finished i shall have a furnished house to live in with a varnished door and a brass knocker and ill march straight back to her and ask her flat as soon as the last plate is on the dresser  thus a titillating fortnight was passed by young stockdale during which time things proceeded much as such matters have done ever since the beginning of history  he saw the object of attachment several times one day did not see her at all the next met her when he least expected to do so missed her when hints and signs as to where she should be at a given hour almost amounted to an appointment  this mild coquetry was perhaps fair enough under the circumstances of their being so closely lodged and stockdale put up with it as philosophically as he was able being in her own house she could after vexing him or disappointing him of her presence easily win him back by suddenly surrounding him with those little attentions which her position as his landlady put it in her power to bestow  when he had waited indoors half the day to see her and on finding that she would not be seen had gone off in a huff to the dreariest and dampest walk he could discover she would restore equilibrium in the evening with mr stockdale i have fancied you must feel draught o nights from your bedroom window and so i have been putting up thicker curtains this afternoon while you were out or i noticed that you sneezed twice again this morning mr stockdale  depend upon it that cold is hanging about you yet i am sure it isi have thought of it continually and you must let me make a posset for you  sometimes in coming home he found his sittingroom rearranged chairs placed where the table had stood and the table ornamented with the few fresh flowers and leaves that could be obtained at this season so as to add a novelty to the room  at times she would be standing on a chair outside the house trying to nail up a branch of the monthly rose which the winter wind had blown down and of course he stepped forward to assist her when their hands got mixed in passing the shreds and nails thus they became friends again after a disagreement  she would utter on these occasions some pretty and deprecatory remark on the necessity of her troubling him anew and he would straightway say that he would do a hundred times as much for her if she should so require    chapter iihow he saw two other men   matters being in this advancing state stockdale was rather surprised one cloudy evening while sitting in his room at hearing her speak in low tones of expostulation to some one at the door  it was nearly dark but the shutters were not yet closed nor the candles lighted and stockdale was tempted to stretch his head towards the window  he saw outside the door a young man in clothes of a whitish colour and upon reflection judged their wearer to be the wellbuilt and rather handsome miller who lived below  the millers voice was alternately low and firm and sometimes it reached the level of positive entreaty but what the words were stockdale could in no way hear  before the colloquy had ended the ministers attention was attracted by a second incident  opposite lizzys home grew a clump of laurels forming a thick and permanent shade  one of the laurel boughs now quivered against the light background of sky and in a moment the head of a man peered out and remained still  he seemed to be also much interested in the conversation at the door and was plainly lingering there to watch and listen  had stockdale stood in any other relation to lizzy than that of a lover he might have gone out and investigated the meaning of this but being as yet but an unprivileged ally he did nothing more than stand up and show himself against the firelight whereupon the listener disappeared and lizzy and the miller spoke in lower tones  stockdale was made so uneasy by the circumstance that as soon as the miller was gone he said mrs newberry are you aware that you were watched just now and your conversation heard  when she said  when you were talking to that miller  a man was looking from the laurel tree as jealously as if he could have eaten you  she showed more concern than the trifling event seemed to demand and he added perhaps you were talking of things you did not wish to be overheard  i was talking only on business she said  lizzy be frank said the young man  if it was only on business why should anybody wish to listen to you  she looked curiously at him  what else do you think it could be then  wellthe only talk between a young woman and man that is likely to amuse an eavesdropper  ah yes she said smiling in spite of her preoccupation  well my cousin owlett has spoken to me about matrimony every now and then thats true but he was not speaking of it then  i wish he had been speaking of it with all my heart  it would have been much less serious for me  o mrs newberry  it would  not that i should ha chimed in with him of course  i wish it for other reasons  i am glad mr stockdale that you have told me of that listener  it is a timely warning and i must see my cousin again  but dont go away till i have spoken said the minister  ill out with it at once and make no more ado  let it be yes or no between us lizzy please do  and he held out his hand in which she freely allowed her own to rest but without speaking  you mean yes by that he asked after waiting a while  you may be my sweetheart if you will  why not say at once you will wait for me until i have a house and can come back to marry you  because i am thinkingthinking of something else she said with embarrassment  it all comes upon me at once and i must settle one thing at a time  at any rate dear lizzy you can assure me that the miller shall not be allowed to speak to you except on business you have never directly encouraged him  she parried the question by saying you see he and his party have been in the habit of leaving things on my premises sometimes and as i have not denied him it makes him rather forward  thingswhat things  tubsthey are called things here  but why dont you deny him my dear lizzy  i cannot well  you are too timid  it is unfair of him to impose so upon you and get your good name into danger by his smuggling tricks  promise me that the next time he wants to leave his tubs here you will let me roll them into the street  she shook her head  i would not venture to offend the neighbours so much as that said she or do anything that would be so likely to put poor owlett into the hands of the excisemen  stockdale sighed and said that he thought hers a mistaken generosity when it extended to assisting those who cheated the king of his dues  at any rate you will let me make him keep his distance as your lover and tell him flatly that you are not for him  please not at present she said  i dont wish to offend my old neighbours  it is not only owlett who is concerned  this is too bad said stockdale impatiently  on my honour i wont encourage him as my lover lizzy answered earnestly  a reasonable man will be satisfied with that  well so i am said stockdale his countenance clearing    chapter iiithe mysterious greatcoat   stockdale now began to notice more particularly a feature in the life of his fair landlady which he had casually observed but scarcely ever thought of before  it was that she was markedly irregular in her hours of rising  for a week or two she would be tolerably punctual reaching the groundfloor within a few minutes of halfpast seven  then suddenly she would not be visible till twelve at noon perhaps for three or four days in succession and twice he had certain proof that she did not leave her room till halfpast three in the afternoon  the second time that this extreme lateness came under his notice was on a day when he had particularly wished to consult with her about his future movements and he concluded as he always had done that she had a cold headache or other ailment unless she had kept herself invisible to avoid meeting and talking to him which he could hardly believe  the former supposition was disproved however by her innocently saying some days later when they were speaking on a question of health that she had never had a moments heaviness headache or illness of any kind since the previous january twelvemonth  i am glad to hear it said he  i thought quite otherwise  what do i look sickly she asked turning up her face to show the impossibility of his gazing on it and holding such a belief for a moment  not at all i merely thought so from your being sometimes obliged to keep your room through the best part of the day  o as for thatit means nothing she murmured with a look which some might have called cold and which was the worst look that he liked to see upon her  it is pure sleepiness mr stockdale  never  it is i tell you  when i stay in my room till halfpast three in the afternoon you may always be sure that i slept soundly till three or i shouldnt have stayed there  it is dreadful said stockdale thinking of the disastrous effects of such indulgence upon the household of a minister should it become a habit of everyday occurrence  but then she said divining his good and prescient thoughts it only happens when i stay awake all night  i dont go to sleep till five or six in the morning sometimes  ah thats another matter said stockdale  sleeplessness to such an alarming extent is real illness  have you spoken to a doctor  o nothere is no need for doing thatit is all natural to me  and she went away without further remark  stockdale might have waited a long time to know the real cause of her sleeplessness had it not happened that one dark night he was sitting in his bedroom jotting down notes for a sermon which occupied him perfunctorily for a considerable time after the other members of the household had retired  he did not get to bed till one oclock  before he had fallen asleep he heard a knocking at the front door first rather timidly performed and then louder  nobody answered it and the person knocked again  as the house still remained undisturbed stockdale got out of bed went to his window which overlooked the door and opening it asked who was there  a young womans voice replied that susan wallis was there and that she had come to ask if mrs newberry could give her some mustard to make a plaster with as her father was taken very ill on the chest  the minister having neither bell nor servant was compelled to act in person  i will call mrs newberry he said  partly dressing himself he went along the passage and tapped at lizzys door  she did not answer and thinking of her erratic habits in the matter of sleep he thumped the door persistently when he discovered by its moving ajar under his knocking that it had only been gently pushed to  as there was now a sufficient entry for the voice he knocked no longer but said in firm tones mrs newberry you are wanted  the room was quite silent not a breathing not a rustle came from any part of it  stockdale now sent a positive shout through the open space of the door mrs newberrystill no answer or movement of any kind within  then he heard sounds from the opposite room that of lizzys mother as if she had been aroused by his uproar though lizzy had not and was dressing herself hastily  stockdale softly closed the younger womans door and went on to the other which was opened by mrs simpkins before he could reach it  she was in her ordinary clothes and had a light in her hand  whats the person calling about she said in alarm  stockdale told the girls errand adding seriously i cannot wake mrs newberry  it is no matter said her mother  i can let the girl have what she wants as well as my daughter  and she came out of the room and went downstairs  stockdale retired towards his own apartment saying however to mrs simpkins from the landing as if on second thoughts i suppose there is nothing the matter with mrs newberry that i could not wake her  o no said the old lady hastily  nothing at all  still the minister was not satisfied  will you go in and see he said i should be much more at ease  mrs simpkins returned up the staircase went to her daughters room and came out again almost instantly  there is nothing at all the matter with lizzy she said and descended again to attend to the applicant who having seen the light had remained quiet during this interval  stockdale went into his room and lay down as before  he heard lizzys mother open the front door admit the girl and then the murmured discourse of both as they went to the storecupboard for the medicament required  the girl departed the door was fastened mrs simpkins came upstairs and the house was again in silence  still the minister did not fall asleep  he could not get rid of a singular suspicion which was all the more harassing in being if true the most unaccountable thing within his experience  that lizzy newberry was in her bedroom when he made such a clamour at the door he could not possibly convince himself notwithstanding that he had heard her come upstairs at the usual time go into her chamber and shut herself up in the usual way  yet all reason was so much against her being elsewhere that he was constrained to go back again to the unlikely theory of a heavy sleep though he had heard neither breath nor movement during a shouting and knocking loud enough to rouse the seven sleepers  before coming to any positive conclusion he fell asleep himself and did not awake till day  he saw nothing of mrs newberry in the morning before he went out to meet the rising sun as he liked to do when the weather was fine but as this was by no means unusual he took no notice of it  at breakfasttime he knew that she was not far off by hearing her in the kitchen and though he saw nothing of her person that back apartment being rigorously closed against his eyes she seemed to be talking ordering and bustling about among the pots and skimmers in so ordinary a manner that there was no reason for his wasting more time in fruitless surmise  the minister suffered from these distractions and his extemporized sermons were not improved thereby  already he often said romans for corinthians in the pulpit and gave out hymns in strange cramped metres that hitherto had always been skipped because the congregation could not raise a tune to fit them  he fully resolved that as soon as his few weeks of stay approached their end he would cut the matter short and commit himself by proposing a definite engagement repenting at leisure if necessary  with this end in view he suggested to her on the evening after her mysterious sleep that they should take a walk together just before dark the latter part of the proposition being introduced that they might return home unseen  she consented to go and away they went over a stile to a shrouded footpath suited for the occasion  but in spite of attempts on both sides they were unable to infuse much spirit into the ramble  she looked rather paler than usual and sometimes turned her head away  lizzy said stockdale reproachfully when they had walked in silence a long distance  yes said she  you yawnedmuch my company is to you  he put it in that way but he was really wondering whether her yawn could possibly have more to do with physical weariness from the night before than mental weariness of that present moment  lizzy apologized and owned that she was rather tired which gave him an opening for a direct question on the point but his modesty would not allow him to put it to her and he uncomfortably resolved to wait  the month of february passed with alternations of mud and frost rain and sleet east winds and northwesterly gales  the hollow places in the ploughed fields showed themselves as pools of water which had settled there from the higher levels and had not yet found time to soak away the birds began to get lively and a single thrush came just before sunset each evening and sang hopefully on the large elmtree which stood nearest to mrs newberrys house  cold blasts and brittle earth had given place to an oozing dampness more unpleasant in itself than frost but it suggested coming spring and its unpleasantness was of a bearable kind  stockdale had been going to bring about a practical understanding with lizzy at least halfadozen times but what with the mystery of her apparent absence on the night of the neighbours call and her curious way of lying in bed at unaccountable times he felt a check within him whenever he wanted to speak out  thus they still lived on as indefinitely affianced lovers each of whom hardly acknowledged the others claim to the name of chosen one  stockdale persuaded himself that his hesitation was owing to the postponement of the ordained ministers arrival and the consequent delay in his own departure which did away with all necessity for haste in his courtship but perhaps it was only that his discretion was reasserting itself and telling him that he had better get clearer ideas of lizzy before arranging for the grand contract of his life with her  she on her part always seemed ready to be urged further on that question than he had hitherto attempted to go but she was none the less independent and to a degree which would have kept from flagging the passion of a far more mutable man  on the evening of the first of march he went casually into his bedroom about dusk and noticed lying on a chair a greatcoat hat and breeches having no recollection of leaving any clothes of his own in that spot he went and examined them as well as he could in the twilight and found that they did not belong to him  he paused for a moment to consider how they might have got there  he was the only man living in the house and yet these were not his garments unless he had made a mistake  no they were not his  he called up martha sarah  how did these things come in my room he said flinging the objectionable articles to the floor  martha said that mrs newberry had given them to her to brush and that she had brought them up there thinking they must be mr stockdales as there was no other gentleman alodging there  of course you did said stockdale  now take them down to your misess and say they are some clothes i have found here and know nothing about  as the door was left open he heard the conversation downstairs  how stupid said mrs newberry in a tone of confusion  why marther sarer i did not tell you to take em to mr stockdales room  i thought they must be his as they was so muddy said martha humbly  you should have left em on the clotheshorse said the young mistress severely and she came upstairs with the garments on her arm quickly passed stockdales room and threw them forcibly into a closet at the end of a passage  with this the incident ended and the house was silent again  there would have been nothing remarkable in finding such clothes in a widows house had they been clean or motheaten or creased or mouldy from long lying by but that they should be splashed with recent mud bothered stockdale a good deal  when a young pastor is in the aspen stage of attachment and open to agitation at the merest trifles a really substantial incongruity of this complexion is a disturbing thing however nothing further occurred at that time but he became watchful and given to conjecture and was unable to forget the circumstance  one morning on looking from his window he saw mrs newberry herself brushing the tails of a long drab greatcoat which if he mistook not was the very same garment as the one that had adorned the chair of his room  it was densely splashed up to the hollow of the back with neighbouring nethermoynton mud to judge by its colour the spots being distinctly visible to him in the sunlight  the previous day or two having been wet the inference was irresistible that the wearer had quite recently been walking some considerable distance about the lanes and fields  stockdale opened the window and looked out and mrs newberry turned her head  her face became slowly red she never had looked prettier or more incomprehensible he waved his hand affectionately and said goodmorning she answered with embarrassment having ceased her occupation on the instant that she saw him and rolled up the coat half cleaned  stockdale shut the window  some simple explanation of her proceeding was doubtless within the bounds of possibility but he himself could not think of one and he wished that she had placed the matter beyond conjecture by voluntarily saying something about it there and then  but though lizzy had not offered an explanation at the moment the subject was brought forward by her at the next time of their meeting  she was chatting to him concerning some other event and remarked that it happened about the time when she was dusting some old clothes that had belonged to her poor husband  you keep them clean out of respect to his memory said stockdale tentatively  i air and dust them sometimes she said with the most charming innocence in the world  do dead men come out of their graves and walk in mud murmured the minister in a cold sweat at the deception that she was practising  what did you say asked lizzy  nothing nothing said he mournfully  mere wordsa phrase that will do for my sermon next sunday  it was too plain that lizzy was unaware that he had seen actual pedestrian splashes upon the skirts of the tell tale overcoat and that she imagined him to believe it had come direct from some chest or drawer  the aspect of the case was now considerably darker  stockdale was so much depressed by it that he did not challenge her explanation or threaten to go off as a missionary to benighted islanders or reproach her in any way whatever  he simply parted from her when she had done talking and lived on in perplexity till by degrees his natural manner became sad and constrained    chapter ivat the time of the new moon   the following thursday was changeable damp and gloomy and the night threatened to be windy and unpleasant  stockdale had gone away to knollsea in the morning to be present at some commemoration service there and on his return he was met by the attractive lizzy in the passage  whether influenced by the tide of cheerfulness which had attended him that day or by the drive through the open air or whether from a natural disposition to let bygones alone he allowed himself to be fascinated into forgetfulness of the greatcoat incident and upon the whole passed a pleasant evening not so much in her society as within sound of her voice as she sat talking in the back parlour to her mother till the latter went to bed  shortly after this mrs newberry retired and then stockdale prepared to go upstairs himself  but before he left the room he remained standing by the dying embers awhile thinking long of one thing and another and was only aroused by the flickering of his candle in the socket as it suddenly declined and went out  knowing that there were a tinderbox matches and another candle in his bedroom he felt his way upstairs without a light  on reaching his chamber he laid his hand on every possible ledge and corner for the tinderbox but for a long time in vain  discovering it at length stockdale produced a spark and was kindling the brimstone when he fancied that he heard a movement in the passage  he blew harder at the lint the match flared up and looking by aid of the blue light through the door which had been standing open all this time he was surprised to see a male figure vanishing round the top of the staircase with the evident intention of escaping unobserved  the personage wore the clothes which lizzy had been brushing and something in the outline and gait suggested to the minister that the wearer was lizzy herself  but he was not sure of this and greatly excited stockdale determined to investigate the mystery and to adopt his own way for doing it  he blew out the match without lighting the candle went into the passage and proceeded on tiptoe towards lizzys room  a faint grey square of light in the direction of the chamberwindow as he approached told him that the door was open and at once suggested that the occupant was gone he turned and brought down his fist upon the handrail of the staircase it was she in her late husbands coat and hat  somewhat relieved to find that there was no intruder in the case yet none the less surprised the minister crept down the stairs softly put on his boots overcoat and hat and tried the front door  it was fastened as usual he went to the back door found this unlocked and emerged into the garden  the night was mild and moonless and rain had lately been falling though for the present it had ceased  there was a sudden dropping from the trees and bushes every now and then as each passing wind shook their boughs  among these sounds stockdale heard the faint fall of feet upon the road outside and he guessed from the step that it was lizzys  he followed the sound and helped by the circumstance of the wind blowing from the direction in which the pedestrian moved he got nearly close to her and kept there without risk of being overheard  while he thus followed her up the street or lane as it might indifferently be called there being more hedge than houses on either side a figure came forward to her from one of the cottage doors  lizzy stopped the minister stepped upon the grass and stopped also  is that mrs newberry said the man who had come out whose voice stockdale recognized as that of one of the most devout members of his congregation  it is said lizzy  i be quite readyive been here this quarterhour  ah john said she i have bad news there is danger tonight for our venture  and dye tell ot  i dreamed there might be  yes she said hurriedly and you must go at once round to where the chaps are waiting and tell them they will not be wanted till tomorrow night at the same time  i go to burn the lugger off  i will he said and instantly went off through a gate lizzy continuing her way  on she tripped at a quickening pace till the lane turned into the turnpikeroad which she crossed and got into the track for ringsworth here she ascended the hill without the least hesitation passed the lonely hamlet of holworth and went down the vale on the other side stockdale had never taken any extensive walks in this direction but he was aware that if she persisted in her course much longer she would draw near to the coast which was here between two and three miles distant from nethermoynton and as it had been about a quarterpast eleven oclock when they set out her intention seemed to be to reach the shore about midnight  lizzy soon ascended a small mound which stockdale at the same time adroitly skirted on the left and a dull monotonous roar burst upon his ear  the hillock was about fifty yards from the top of the cliffs and by day it apparently commanded a full view of the bay  there was light enough in the sky to show her disguised figure against it when she reached the top where she paused and afterwards sat down  stockdale not wishing on any account to alarm her at this moment yet desirous of being near her sank upon his hands and knees crept a little higher up and there stayed still  the wind was chilly the ground damp and his position one in which he did not care to remain long  however before he had decided to leave it the young man heard voices behind him  what they signified he did not know but fearing that lizzy was in danger he was about to run forward and warn her that she might be seen when she crept to the shelter of a little bush which maintained a precarious existence in that exposed spot and her form was absorbed in its dark and stunted outline as if she had become part of it  she had evidently heard the men as well as he  they passed near him talking in loud and careless tones which could be heard above the uninterrupted washings of the sea and which suggested that they were not engaged in any business at their own risk  this proved to be the fact some of their words floated across to him and caused him to forget at once the coldness of his situation  whats the vessel  a lugger about fifty tons  from cherbourg i suppose  yes a blieve  but it dont all belong to owlett  o no  hes only got a share  theres another or two in ita farmer and such like but the names i dont know  the voices died away and the heads and shoulders of the men diminished towards the cliff and dropped out of sight  my darling has been tempted to buy a share by that unbeliever owlett groaned the minister his honest affection for lizzy having quickened to its intensest point during these moments of risk to her person and name thats why shes here he said to himself  o it will be the ruin of her  his perturbation was interrupted by the sudden bursting out of a bright and increasing light from the spot where lizzy was in hiding  a few seconds later and before it had reached the height of a blaze he heard her rush past him down the hollow like a stone from a sling in the direction of home  the light now flared high and wide and showed its position clearly  she had kindled a bough of furze and stuck it into the bush under which she had been crouching the wind fanned the flame which crackled fiercely and threatened to consume the bush as well as the bough  stockdale paused just long enough to notice thus much and then followed rapidly the route taken by the young woman  his intention was to overtake her and reveal himself as a friend but run as he would he could see nothing of her  thus he flew across the open country about holworth twisting his legs and ankles in unexpected fissures and descents till on coming to the gate between the downs and the road he was forced to pause to get breath  there was no audible movement either in front or behind him and he now concluded that she had not outrun him but that hearing him at her heels and believing him one of the excise party she had hidden herself somewhere on the way and let him pass by  he went on at a more leisurely pace towards the village  on reaching the house he found his surmise to be correct for the gate was on the latch and the door unfastened just as he had left them  stockdale closed the door behind him and waited silently in the passage  in about ten minutes he heard the same light footstep that he had heard in going out it paused at the gate which opened and shut softly and then the door latch was lifted and lizzy came in  stockdale went forward and said at once lizzy dont be frightened  i have been waiting up for you  she started though she had recognized the voice  it is mr stockdale isnt it she said  yes he answered becoming angry now that she was safe indoors and not alarmed  and a nice game ive found you out in tonight  you are in mans clothes and i am ashamed of you  lizzy could hardly find a voice to answer this unexpected reproach  i am only partly in mans clothes she faltered shrinking back to the wall  it is only his greatcoat and hat and breeches that ive got on which is no harm as he was my own husband and i do it only because a cloak blows about so and you cant use your arms  i have got my own dress under just the sameit is only tucked in  will you go away upstairs and let me pass  i didnt want you to see me at such a time as this  but i have a right to see you  how do you think there can be anything between us now  lizzy was silent  you are a smuggler he continued sadly  i have only a share in the run she said  that makes no difference  whatever did you engage in such a trade as that for and keep it such a secret from me all this time  i dont do it always  i only do it in wintertime when tis new moon  well i suppose thats because it cant be done anywhen else    you have regularly upset me lizzy  i am sorry for that lizzy meekly replied  well now said he more tenderly no harm is done as yet  wont you for the sake of me give up this blamable and dangerous practice altogether  i must do my best to save this run said she getting rather husky in the throat  i dont want to give you upyou know that but i dont want to lose my venture  i dont know what to do now  why i have kept it so secret from you is that i was afraid you would be angry if you knew  i should think so  i suppose if i had married you without finding this out youd have gone on with it just the same  i dont know  i did not think so far ahead  i only went tonight to burn the folks off because we found that the excisemen knew where the tubs were to be landed  it is a pretty mess to be in altogether is this said the distracted young minister  well what will you do now  lizzy slowly murmured the particulars of their plan the chief of which were that they meant to try their luck at some other point of the shore the next night that three landingplaces were always agreed upon before the run was attempted with the understanding that if the vessel was burnt off from the first point which was ringsworth as it had been by her tonight the crew should attempt to make the second which was lulstead cove on the second night and if there too danger threatened they should on the third night try the third place which was behind a headland further west  suppose the officers hinder them landing there too he said his attention to this interesting programme displacing for a moment his concern at her share in it  then we shant try anywhere else all this darkthats what we call the time between moon and moonand perhaps theyll string the tubs to a strayline and sink em a littleways from shore and take the bearings and then when they have a chance theyll go to creep for em  whats that  o theyll go out in a boat and drag a creeperthats a grapnelalong the bottom till it catch hold of the strayline  the minister stood thinking and there was no sound within doors but the tick of the clock on the stairs and the quick breathing of lizzy partly from her walk and partly from agitation as she stood close to the wall not in such complete darkness but that he could discern against its whitewashed surface the greatcoat and broad hat which covered her  lizzy all this is very wrong he said  dont you remember the lesson of the tributemoney  render unto caesar the things that are caesars surely you have heard that read times enough in your growing up  hes dead she pouted  but the spirit of the text is in force just the same  my father did it and so did my grandfather and almost everybody in nethermoynton lives by it and life would be so dull if it wasnt for that that i should not care to live at all  i am nothing to live for of course he replied bitterly  you would not think it worth while to give up this wild business and live for me alone  i have never looked at it like that  and you wont promise and wait till i am ready  i cannot give you my word tonight  and looking thoughtfully down she gradually moved and moved away going into the adjoining room and closing the door between them  she remained there in the dark till he was tired of waiting and had gone up to his own chamber  poor stockdale was dreadfully depressed all the next day by the discoveries of the night before  lizzy was unmistakably a fascinating young woman but as a ministers wife she was hardly to be contemplated if i had only stuck to fathers little grocery business instead of going in for the ministry she would have suited me beautifully he said sadly until he remembered that in that case he would never have come from his distant home to nethermoynton and never have known her  the estrangement between them was not complete but it was sufficient to keep them out of each others company  once during the day he met her in the gardenpath and said turning a reproachful eye upon her do you promise lizzy  but she did not reply  the evening drew on and he knew well enough that lizzy would repeat her excursion at nighther half offended manner had shown that she had not the slightest intention of altering her plans at present  he did not wish to repeat his own share of the adventure but act as he would his uneasiness on her account increased with the decline of day  supposing that an accident should befall her he would never forgive himself for not being there to help much as he disliked the idea of seeming to countenance such unlawful escapades    chapter vhow they went to lulstead cove   as he had expected she left the house at the same hour at night this time passing his door without stealth as if she knew very well that he would be watching and were resolved to brave his displeasure  he was quite ready opened the door quickly and reached the back door almost as soon as she  then you will go lizzy he said as he stood on the step beside her who now again appeared as a little man with a face altogether unsuited to his clothes  i must she said repressed by his stern manner  then i shall go too said he  and i am sure you will enjoy it she exclaimed in more buoyant tones everybody does who tries it  god forbid that i should he said  but i must look after you  they opened the wicket and went up the road abreast of each other but at some distance apart scarcely a word passing between them  the evening was rather less favourable to smuggling enterprise than the last had been the wind being lower and the sky somewhat clear towards the north  it is rather lighter said stockdale  tis unfortunately said she  but it is only from those few stars over there  the moon was new today at four oclock and i expected clouds  i hope we shall be able to do it this dark for when we have to sink em for long it makes the stuff taste bleachy and folks dont like it so well  her course was different from that of the preceding night branching off to the left over lords barrow as soon as they had got out of the lane and crossed the highway  by the time they reached chaldon down stockdale who had been in perplexed thought as to what he should say to her decided that he would not attempt expostulation now while she was excited by the adventure but wait till it was over and endeavour to keep her from such practices in future  it occurred to him once or twice as they rambled on that should they be surprised by the excisemen his situation would be more awkward than hers for it would be difficult to prove his true motive in coming to the spot but the risk was a slight consideration beside his wish to be with her  they now arrived at a ravine which lay on the outskirts of chaldon a village two miles on their way towards the point of the shore they sought  lizzy broke the silence this time i have to wait here to meet the carriers  i dont know if they have come yet  as i told you we go to lulstead cove tonight and it is two miles further than ringsworth  it turned out that the men had already come for while she spoke two or three dozen heads broke the line of the slope and a company of them at once descended from the bushes where they had been lying in wait  these carriers were men whom lizzy and other proprietors regularly employed to bring the tubs from the boat to a hidingplace inland  they were all young fellows of nethermoynton chaldon and the neighbourhood quiet and inoffensive persons who simply engaged to carry the cargo for lizzy and her cousin owlett as they would have engaged in any other labour for which they were fairly well paid  at a word from her they closed in together  you had better take it now she said to them and handed to each a packet  it contained six shillings their remuneration for the nights undertaking which was paid beforehand without reference to success or failure but besides this they had the privilege of selling as agents when the run was successfully made  as soon as it was done she said to them the place is the old one near lulstead cove the men till that moment not having been told whither they were bound for obvious reasons  owlett will meet you there added lizzy  i shall follow behind to see that we are not watched  the carriers went on and stockdale and mrs newberry followed at a distance of a stones throw  what do these men do by day he said  twelve or fourteen of them are labouring men  some are brickmakers some carpenters some shoemakers some thatchers  they are all known to me very well  nine of em are of your own congregation  i cant help that said stockdale  o i know you cant  i only told you  the others are more churchinclined because they supply the pason with all the spirits he requires and they dont wish to show unfriendliness to a customer  how do you choose em said stockdale  we choose em for their closeness and because they are strong and surefooted and able to carry a heavy load a long way without being tired  stockdale sighed as she enumerated each particular for it proved how far involved in the business a woman must be who was so well acquainted with its conditions and needs  and yet he felt more tenderly towards her at this moment than he had felt all the foregoing day  perhaps it was that her experienced manner and hold indifference stirred his admiration in spite of himself  take my arm lizzy he murmured  i dont want it she said  besides we may never be to each other again what we once have been  that depends upon you said he and they went on again as before  the hired carriers paced along over chaldon down with as little hesitation as if it had been day avoiding the cartway and leaving the village of east chaldon on the left so as to reach the crest of the hill at a lonely trackless place not far from the ancient earthwork called round pound  an hours brisk walking brought them within sound of the sea not many hundred yards from lulstead cove  here they paused and lizzy and stockdale came up with them when they went on together to the verge of the cliff  one of the men now produced an iron bar which he drove firmly into the soil a yard from the edge and attached to it a rope that he had uncoiled from his body  they all began to descend partly stepping partly sliding down the incline as the rope slipped through their hands  you will not go to the bottom lizzy said stockdale anxiously  no  i stay here to watch she said  owlett is down there  the men remained quite silent when they reached the shore and the next thing audible to the two at the top was the dip of heavy oars and the dashing of waves against a boats bow  in a moment the keel gently touched the shingle and stockdale heard the footsteps of the thirtysix carriers running forwards over the pebbles towards the point of landing  there was a sousing in the water as of a brood of ducks plunging in showing that the men had not been particular about keeping their legs or even their waists dry from the brine but it was impossible to see what they were doing and in a few minutes the shingle was trampled again  the iron bar sustaining the rope on which stockdales hand rested began to swerve a little and the carriers one by one appeared climbing up the sloping cliff dripping audibly as they came and sustaining themselves by the guiderope  each man on reaching the top was seen to be carrying a pair of tubs one on his back and one on his chest the two being slung together by cords passing round the chine hoops and resting on the carriers shoulders  some of the stronger men carried three by putting an extra one on the top behind but the customary load was a pair these being quite weighty enough to give their bearer the sensation of having chest and backbone in contact after a walk of four or five miles  where is owlett said lizzy to one of them  he will not come up this way said the carrier  hes to bide on shore till we be safe off  then without waiting for the rest the foremost men plunged across the down and when the last had ascended lizzy pulled up the rope wound it round her arm wriggled the bar from the sod and turned to follow the carriers  you are very anxious about owletts safety said the minister  was there ever such a man said lizzy  why isnt he my cousin  yes  well it is a bad nights work said stockdale heavily  but ill carry the bar and rope for you  thank god the tubs have got so far all right said she  stockdale shook his head and taking the bar walked by her side towards the downs and the moan of the sea was heard no more  is this what you meant the other day when you spoke of having business with owlett the young man asked  this is it she replied  i never see him on any other matter  a partnership of that kind with a young man is very odd  it was begun by my father and his who were brotherlaws  her companion could not blind himself to the fact that where tastes and pursuits were so akin as lizzys and owletts and where risks were shared as with them in every undertaking there would be a peculiar appropriateness in her answering owletts standing question on matrimony in the affirmative  this did not soothe stockdale its tendency being rather to stimulate in him an effort to make the pair as inappropriate as possible and win her away from this nocturnal crew to correctness of conduct and a ministers parlour in some farremoved inland county  they had been walking near enough to the file of carriers for stockdale to perceive that when they got into the road to the village they split up into two companies of unequal size each of which made off in a direction of its own  one company the smaller of the two went towards the church and by the time that lizzy and stockdale reached their own house these men had scaled the churchyard wall and were proceeding noiselessly over the grass within  i see that owlett has arranged for one batch to be put in the church again observed lizzy  do you remember my taking you there the first night you came  yes of course said stockdale  no wonder you had permission to broach the tubsthey were his i suppose  no they were notthey were mine i had permission from myself  the day after that they went several miles inland in a waggonload of manure and sold very well  at this moment the group of men who had made off to the left some time before began leaping one by one from the hedge opposite lizzys house and the first man who had no tubs upon his shoulders came forward  mrs newberry isnt it he said hastily  yes jim said she  whats the matter  i find that we cant put any in badgers clump tonight lizzy said owlett  the place is watched  we must sling the appletree in the orchet if theres time  we cant put any more under the church lumber than i have sent on there and my mixen hev already more in en than is safe  very well she said  be quick about itthats all  what can i do  nothing at all please  ah it is the ministeryou two that cant do anything had better get indoors and not be zeed  while owlett thus conversed in a tone so full of contraband anxiety and so free from lovers jealousy the men who followed him had been descending one by one from the hedge and it unfortunately happened that when the hindmost took his leap the cord slipped which sustained his tubs the result was that both the kegs fell into the road one of them being stove in by the blow  od drown it all said owlett rushing back  it is worth a good deal i suppose said stockdale  o noabout two guineas and half to us now said lizzy excitedly  it isnt thatit is the smell  it is so blazing strong before it has been lowered by water that it smells dreadfully when spilt in the road like that  i do hope latimer wont pass by till it is gone off  owlett and one or two others picked up the burst tub and began to scrape and trample over the spot to disperse the liquor as much as possible and then they all entered the gate of owletts orchard which adjoined lizzys garden on the right  stockdale did not care to follow them for several on recognizing him had looked wonderingly at his presence though they said nothing  lizzy left his side and went to the bottom of the garden looking over the hedge into the orchard where the men could be dimly seen bustling about and apparently hiding the tubs  all was done noiselessly and without a light and when it was over they dispersed in different directions those who had taken their cargoes to the church having already gone off to their homes  lizzy returned to the gardengate over which stockdale was still abstractedly leaning  it is all finished i am going indoors now she said gently  i will leave the door ajar for you  o noyou neednt said stockdale i am coming too  but before either of them had moved the faint clatter of horses hoofs broke upon the ear and it seemed to come from the point where the track across the down joined the hard road  they are just too late cried lizzy exultingly  who said stockdale  latimer the ridingofficer and some assistant of his  we had better go indoors  they entered the house and lizzy bolted the door  please dont get a light mr stockdale she said  of course i will not said he  i thought you might be on the side of the king said lizzy with faintest sarcasm  i am said stockdale  but lizzy newberry i love you and you know it perfectly well and you ought to know if you do not what i have suffered in my conscience on your account these last few days  i guess very well she said hurriedly  yet i dont see why  ah you are better than i  the trotting of the horses seemed to have again died away and the pair of listeners touched each others fingers in the cold goodnight of those whom something seriously divided  they were on the landing but before they had taken three steps apart the tramp of the horsemen suddenly revived almost close to the house  lizzy turned to the staircase window opened the casement about an inch and put her face close to the aperture  yes one of em is latimer she whispered  he always rides a white horse  one would think it was the last colour for a man in that line  stockdale looked and saw the white shape of the animal as it passed by but before the riders had gone another ten yards latimer reined in his horse and said something to his companion which neither stockdale nor lizzy could hear  its drift was however soon made evident for the other man stopped also and sharply turning the horses heads they cautiously retraced their steps  when they were again opposite mrs newberrys garden latimer dismounted and the man on the dark horse did the same  lizzy and stockdale intently listening and observing the proceedings naturally put their heads as close as possible to the slit formed by the slightly opened casement and thus it occurred that at last their cheeks came positively into contact  they went on listening as if they did not know of the singular incident which had happened to their faces and the pressure of each to each rather increased than lessened with the lapse of time  they could hear the excisemen sniffing the air like hounds as they paced slowly along  when they reached the spot where the tub had burst both stopped on the instant  ay ay tis quite strong here said the second officer  shall we knock at the door  well no said latimer  maybe this is only a trick to put us off the scent  they wouldnt kick up this stink anywhere near their hidingplace  i have known such things before  anyhow the things or some of em must have been brought this way said the other  yes said latimer musingly  unless tis all done to tole us the wrong way  i have a mind that we go home for tonight without saying a word and come the first thing in the morning with more hands  i know they have storages about here but we can do nothing by this owls light  we will look round the parish and see if everybody is in bed john and if all is quiet we will do as i say  they went on and the two inside the window could hear them passing leisurely through the whole village the street of which curved round at the bottom and entered the turnpike road at another junction  this way the excisemen followed and the amble of their horses died quite away  what will you do said stockdale withdrawing from his position  she knew that he alluded to the coming search by the officers to divert her attention from their own tender incident by the casement which he wished to be passed over as a thing rather dreamt of than done  o nothing she replied with as much coolness as she could command under her disappointment at his manner  we often have such storms as this you would not be frightened if you knew what fools they are  fancy riding o horseback through the place of course they will hear and see nobody while they make that noise but they are always afraid to get off in case some of our fellows should burst out upon em and tie them up to the gatepost as they have done before now  goodnight mr stockdale  she closed the window and went to her room where a tear fell from her eyes and that not because of the alertness of the ridingofficers    chapter vithe great search at nethermoynton   stockdale was so excited by the events of the evening and the dilemma that he was placed in between conscience and love that he did not sleep or even doze but remained as broadly awake as at noonday  as soon as the grey light began to touch ever so faintly the whiter objects in his bedroom he arose dressed himself and went downstairs into the road  the village was already astir  several of the carriers had heard the wellknown tramp of latimers horse while they were undressing in the dark that night and had already communicated with each other and owlett on the subject  the only doubt seemed to be about the safety of those tubs which had been left under the church gallerystairs and after a short discussion at the corner of the mill it was agreed that these should be removed before it got lighter and hidden in the middle of a double hedge bordering the adjoining field  however before anything could be carried into effect the footsteps of many men were heard coming down the lane from the highway  damn it here they be said owlett who having already drawn the hatch and started his mill for the day stood stolidly at the milldoor covered with flour as if the interest of his whole soul was bound up in the shaking walls around him  the two or three with whom he had been talking dispersed to their usual work and when the excise officers and the formidable body of men they had hired reached the village cross between the mill and mrs newberrys house the village wore the natural aspect of a place beginning its morning labours  now said latimer to his associates who numbered thirteen men in all what i know is that the things are somewhere in this here place  we have got the day before us and tis hard if we cant light upon em and get em to budmouth customhouse before night  first we will try the fuelhouses and then well work our way into the chimmers and then to the ricks and stables and so creep round  you have nothing but your noses to guide ye mind so use em today if you never did in your lives before  then the search began  owlett during the early part watched from his millwindow lizzy from the door of her house with the greatest self possession  a farmer down below who also had a share in the run rode about with one eye on his fields and the other on latimer and his myrmidons prepared to put them off the scent if he should be asked a question  stockdale who was no smuggler at all felt more anxiety than the worst of them and went about his studies with a heavy heart coming frequently to the door to ask lizzy some question or other on the consequences to her of the tubs being found  the consequences she said quietly are simply that i shall lose em as i have none in the house or garden they cant touch me personally  but you have some in the orchard  owlett rents that of me and he lends it to others  so it will be hard to say who put any tubs there if they should be found  there was never such a tremendous sniffing known as that which took place in nethermoynton parish and its vicinity this day  all was done methodically and mostly on hands and knees  at different hours of the day they had different plans  from daybreak to breakfasttime the officers used their sense of smell in a direct and straightforward manner only pausing nowhere but at such places as the tubs might be supposed to be secreted in at that very moment pending their removal on the following night  among the places tested and examined were  hollow trees        cupboards         culverts potatograves       clockcases       hedgerows fuelhouses         chimneyflues     faggotricks bedrooms            rainwaterbutts   haystacks applelofts         pigsties          coppers and ovens  after breakfast they recommenced with renewed vigour taking a new line that is to say directing their attention to clothes that might be supposed to have come in contact with the tubs in their removal from the shore such garments being usually tainted with the spirit owing to its oozing between the staves  they now sniffed at   smockfrocks                 smiths and shoemakers aprons old shirts and waistcoats    kneenaps and hedginggloves coats and hats               tarpaulins breeches and leggings        marketcloaks womens shawls and gowns     scarecrows  and as soon as the midday meal was over they pushed their search into places where the spirits might have been thrown away in alarm  horseponds       mixens         sinks in yards stabledrains     wet ditches    roadscrapings and cinderheaps      cesspools      backdoor gutters  but still these indefatigable excisemen discovered nothing more than the original telltale smell in the road opposite lizzys house which even yet had not passed off  ill tell ye what it is men said latimer about three oclock in the afternoon we must begin over again  find them tubs i will  the men who had been hired for the day looked at their hands and knees muddy with creeping on all fours so frequently and rubbed their noses as if they had almost had enough of it for the quantity of bad air which had passed into each ones nostril had rendered it nearly as insensible as a flue  however after a moments hesitation they prepared to start anew except three whose power of smell had quite succumbed under the excessive wear and tear of the day  by this time not a male villager was to be seen in the parish  owlett was not at his mill the farmers were not in their fields the parson was not in his garden the smith had left his forge and the wheelwrights shop was silent  where the divil are the folk gone said latimer waking up to the fact of their absence and looking round  ill have em up for this  why dont they come and help us  theres not a man about the place but the methodist parson and hes an old woman  i demand assistance in the kings name  we must find the jineral public afore we can demand that said his lieutenant  well well we shall do better without em said latimer who changed his moods at a moments notice  but theres great cause of suspicion in this silence and this keeping out of sight and ill bear it in mind  now we will go across to owletts orchard and see what we can find there  stockdale who heard this discussion from the gardengate over which he had been leaning was rather alarmed and thought it a mistake of the villagers to keep so completely out of the way  he himself like the excisemen had been wondering for the last halfhour what could have become of them  some labourers were of necessity engaged in distant fields but the masterworkmen should have been at home though one and all after just showing themselves at their shops had apparently gone off for the day  he went in to lizzy who sat at a back window sewing and said lizzy where are the men  lizzy laughed  where they mostly are when theyre run so hard as this she cast her eyes to heaven  up there she said  stockdale looked up  whaton the top of the church tower he asked seeing the direction of her glance  yes  well i expect they will soon have to come down said he gravely  i have been listening to the officers and they are going to search the orchard over again and then every nook in the church  lizzy looked alarmed for the first time  will you go and tell our folk she said  they ought to be let know  seeing his conscience struggling within him like a boiling pot she added no never mind ill go myself  she went out descended the garden and climbed over the churchyard wall at the same time that the preventivemen were ascending the road to the orchard  stockdale could do no less than follow her  by the time that she reached the tower entrance he was at her side and they entered together  nethermoynton churchtower was as in many villages without a turret and the only way to the top was by going up to the singers gallery and thence ascending by a ladder to a square trapdoor in the floor of the bellloft above which a permanent ladder was fixed passing through the bells to a hole in the roof  when lizzy and stockdale reached the gallery and looked up nothing but the trapdoor and the five holes for the bellropes appeared  the ladder was gone  theres no getting up said stockdale  o yes there is said she  theres an eye looking at us at this moment through a knothole in that trapdoor  and as she spoke the trap opened and the dark line of the ladder was seen descending against the whitewashed wall  when it touched the bottom lizzy dragged it to its place and said if youll go up ill follow  the young man ascended and presently found himself among consecrated bells for the first time in his life nonconformity having been in the stockdale blood for some generations  he eyed them uneasily and looked round for lizzy  owlett stood here holding the top of the ladder  what be you really one of us said the miller  it seems so said stockdale sadly  hes not said lizzy who overheard  hes neither for nor against us hell do us no harm  she stepped up beside them and then they went on to the next stage which when they had clambered over the dusty bellcarriages was of easy ascent leading towards the hole through which the pale sky appeared and into the open air  owlett remained behind for a moment to pull up the lower ladder  keep down your heads said a voice as soon as they set foot on the flat  stockdale here beheld all the missing parishioners lying on their stomachs on the tower roof except a few who elevated on their hands and knees were peeping through the embrasures of the parapet  stockdale did the same and saw the village lying like a map below him over which moved the figures of the excisemen each foreshortened to a crablike object the crown of his hat forming a circular disc in the centre of him  some of the men had turned their heads when the young preachers figure arose among them  what mr stockdale said matt grey in a tone of surprise  id as lief that it hadnt been said jim clarke  if the pason should see him a trespassing here in his tower twould be none the better for we seeing how a do hate chapelmembers  hed never buy a tub of us again and hes as good a customer as we have got this side o warmll  where is the pason said lizzy  in his house to be sure that he mid see nothing of whats going onwhere all good folks ought to be and this young man likewise  well he has brought some news said lizzy  they are going to search the orchet and church can we do anything if they should find  yes said her cousin owlett  thats what weve been talking o and we have settled our line  well be dazed  the exclamation was caused by his perceiving that some of the searchers having got into the orchard and begun stooping and creeping hither and thither were pausing in the middle where a tree smaller than the rest was growing  they drew closer and bent lower than ever upon the ground  o my tubs said lizzy faintly as she peered through the parapet at them  they have got em a blieve said owlett  the interest in the movements of the officers was so keen that not a single eye was looking in any other direction but at that moment a shout from the church beneath them attracted the attention of the smugglers as it did also of the party in the orchard who sprang to their feet and went towards the churchyard wall  at the same time those of the government men who had entered the church unperceived by the smugglers cried aloud here be some of em at last  the smugglers remained in a blank silence uncertain whether some of em meant tubs or men but again peeping cautiously over the edge of the tower they learnt that tubs were the things descried and soon these fated articles were brought one by one into the middle of the churchyard from their hidingplace under the gallerystairs  they are going to put em on hintons vault till they find the rest said lizzy hopelessly  the excisemen had in fact begun to pile up the tubs on a large stone slab which was fixed there and when all were brought out from the tower two or three of the men were left standing by them the rest of the party again proceeding to the orchard  the interest of the smugglers in the next manoeuvres of their enemies became painfully intense  only about thirty tubs had been secreted in the lumber of the tower but seventy were hidden in the orchard making up all that they had brought ashore as yet the remainder of the cargo having been tied to a sinker and dropped overboard for another nights operations  the excisemen having reentered the orchard acted as if they were positive that here lay hidden the rest of the tubs which they were determined to find before nightfall  they spread themselves out round the field and advancing on all fours as before went anew round every appletree in the enclosure  the young tree in the middle again led them to pause and at length the whole company gathered there in a way which signified that a second chain of reasoning had led to the same results as the first  when they had examined the sod hereabouts for some minutes one of the men rose ran to a disused porch of the church where tools were kept and returned with the sextons pickaxe and shovel with which they set to work  are they really buried there said the minister for the grass was so green and uninjured that it was difficult to believe it had been disturbed  the smugglers were too interested to reply and presently they saw to their chagrin the officers stand several on each side of the tree and stooping and applying their hands to the soil they bodily lifted the tree and the turf around it  the appletree now showed itself to be growing in a shallow box with handles for lifting at each of the four sides  under the site of the tree a square hole was revealed and an exciseman went and looked down  it is all up now said owlett quietly  and now all of ye get down before they notice we are here and be ready for our next move  i had better bide here till dark or they may take me on suspicion as tis on my ground  ill be with ye as soon as daylight begins to pink in  and i said lizzy  you please look to the linchpins and screws then go indoors and know nothing at all  the chaps will do the rest  the ladder was replaced and all but owlett descended the men passing off one by one at the back of the church and vanishing on their respective errands  lizzy walked boldly along the street followed closely by the minister  you are going indoors mrs newberry he said  she knew from the words mrs newberry that the division between them had widened yet another degree  i am not going home she said  i have a little thing to do before i go in  martha sarah will get your tea  o i dont mean on that account said stockdale  what can you have to do further in this unhallowed affair  only a little she said  what is that  ill go with you  no i shall go by myself  will you please go indoors  i shall be there in less than an hour  you are not going to run any danger lizzy said the young man his tenderness reasserting itself  none whateverworth mentioning answered she and went down towards the cross  stockdale entered the garden gate and stood behind it looking on  the excisemen were still busy in the orchard and at last he was tempted to enter and watch their proceedings  when he came closer he found that the secret cellar of whose existence he had been totally unaware was formed by timbers placed across from side to side about a foot under the ground and grassed over  the excisemen looked up at stockdales fair and downy countenance and evidently thinking him above suspicion went on with their work again  as soon as all the tubs were taken out they began tearing up the turf pulling out the timbers and breaking in the sides till the cellar was wholly dismantled and shapeless the appletree lying with its roots high to the air  but the hole which had in its time held so much contraband merchandize was never completely filled up either then or afterwards a depression in the greensward marking the spot to this day    chapter viithe walk to warmell cross and afterwards   as the goods had all to be carried to budmouth that night the excisemens next object was to find horses and carts for the journey and they went about the village for that purpose  latimer strode hither and thither with a lump of chalk in his hand marking broadarrows so vigorously on every vehicle and set of harness that he came across that it seemed as if he would chalk broadarrows on the very hedges and roads the owner of every conveyance so marked was bound to give it up for government purposes  stockdale who had had enough of the scene turned indoors thoughtful and depressed  lizzy was already there having come in at the back though she had not yet taken off her bonnet  she looked tired and her mood was not much brighter than his own  they had but little to say to each other and the minister went away and attempted to read but at this he could not succeed and he shook the little bell for tea  lizzy herself brought in the tray the girl having run off into the village during the afternoon too full of excitement at the proceedings to remember her state of life  however almost before the sad lovers had said anything to each other martha came in in a steaming state  o theres such a stoor mrs newberry and mr stockdale  the kings excisemen cant get the carts ready nohow at all  they pulled thomas ballams and william rogerss and stephen sprakes carts into the road and off came the wheels and down fell the carts and they found there was no linchpins in the arms and then they tried samuel shanes waggon and found that the screws were gone from he and at last they looked at the dairymans cart and hes got none neither  they have gone now to the blacksmiths to get some made but hes nowhere to be found  stockdale looked at lizzy who blushed very slightly and went out of the room followed by martha sarah  but before they had got through the passage there was a rap at the front door and stockdale recognized latimers voice addressing mrs newberry who had turned back  for gods sake mrs newberry have you seen hardman the blacksmith up this way  if we could get hold of him wed een amost drag him by the hair of his head to his anvil where he ought to be  hes an idle man mr latimer said lizzy archly  what do you want him for  why there isnt a horse in the place that has got more than three shoes on and some have only two  the waggonwheels be without strakes and theres no linchpins to the carts  what with that and the bother about every set of harness being out of order we shant be off before nightfallupon my soul we shant  tis a rough lot mrs newberry that youve got about you here but theyll play at this game once too often mark my words they will  theres not a man in the parish that dont deserve to be whipped  it happened that hardman was at that moment a little further up the lane smoking his pipe behind a hollybush  when latimer had done speaking he went on in this direction and hardman hearing the excisemans steps found curiosity too strong for prudence  he peeped out from the bush at the very moment that latimers glance was on it  there was nothing left for him to do but to come forward with unconcern  ive been looking for you for the last hour said latimer with a glare in his eye  sorry to hear that said hardman  ive been out for a stroll to look for more hid tubs to deliver em up to goverment  o yes hardman we know it said latimer with withering sarcasm  we know that youll deliver em up to goverment  we know that all the parish is helping us and have been all day  now you please walk along with me down to your shop and kindly let me hire ye in the kings name  they went down the lane together and presently there resounded from the smithy the ring of a hammer not very briskly swung  however the carts and horses were got into some sort of travelling condition but it was not until after the clock had struck six when the muddy roads were glistening under the horizontal light of the fading day  the smuggled tubs were soon packed into the vehicles and latimer with three of his assistants drove slowly out of the village in the direction of the port of budmouth some considerable number of miles distant the other excisemen being left to watch for the remainder of the cargo which they knew to have been sunk somewhere between ringsworth and lulstead cove and to unearth owlett the only person clearly implicated by the discovery of the cave  women and children stood at the doors as the carts each chalked with the government pitchfork passed in the increasing twilight and as they stood they looked at the confiscated property with a melancholy expression that told only too plainly the relation which they bore to the trade  well lizzy said stockdale when the crackle of the wheels had nearly died away  this is a fit finish to your adventure  i am truly thankful that you have got off without suspicion and the loss only of the liquor will you sit down and let me talk to you  by and by she said  but i must go out now  not to that horrid shore again he said blankly  no not there  i am only going to see the end of this days business  he did not answer to this and she moved towards the door slowly as if waiting for him to say something more  you dont offer to come with me she added at last  i suppose thats because you hate me after all this  can you say it lizzy when you know i only want to save you from such practices  come with you of course i will if it is only to take care of you  but why will you go out again  because i cannot rest indoors  something is happening and i must know what  now come  and they went into the dusk together  when they reached the turnpikeroad she turned to the right and he soon perceived that they were following the direction of the excisemen and their load  he had given her his arm and every now and then she suddenly pulled it back to signify that he was to halt a moment and listen  they had walked rather quickly along the first quarter of a mile and on the second or third time of standing still she said i hear them aheaddont you  yes he said i hear the wheels  but what of that  i only want to know if they get clear away from the neighbourhood  ah said he a light breaking upon him  something desperate is to be attemptedand now i remember there was not a man about the village when we left  hark she murmured  the noise of the cartwheels had stopped and given place to another sort of sound  tis a scuffle said stockdale  therell be murder  lizzy let go my arm i am going on  on my conscience i must not stay here and do nothing  therell be no murder and not even a broken head she said  our men are thirty to four of them no harm will be done at all  then there is an attack exclaimed stockdale and you knew it was to be  why should you side with men who break the laws like this  why should you side with men who take from country traders what they have honestly bought wi their own money in france said she firmly  they are not honestly bought said he  they are she contradicted  i and owlett and the others paid thirty shillings for every one of the tubs before they were put on board at cherbourg and if a king who is nothing to us sends his people to steal our property we have a right to steal it back again  stockdale did not stop to argue the matter but went quickly in the direction of the noise lizzy keeping at his side  dont you interfere will you dear richard she said anxiously as they drew near  dont let us go any closer tis at warmell cross where they are seizing em you can do no good and you may meet with a hard blow  let us see first what is going on he said  but before they had got much further the noise of the cartwheels began again and stockdale soon found that they were coming towards him  in another minute the three carts came up and stockdale and lizzy stood in the ditch to let them pass  instead of being conducted by four men as had happened when they went out of the village the horses and carts were now accompanied by a body of from twenty to thirty all of whom as stockdale perceived to his astonishment had blackened faces  among them walked six or eight huge female figures whom from their wide strides stockdale guessed to be men in disguise  as soon as the party discerned lizzy and her companion four or five fell back and when the carts had passed came close to the pair  there is no walking up this way for the present said one of the gaunt women who wore curls a foot long dangling down the sides of her face in the fashion of the time  stockdale recognized this ladys voice as owletts  why not said stockdale  this is the public highway  now look here youngster said owlett  o tis the methodist parsonwhat and mrs newberry  well youd better not go up that way lizzy  theyve all run off and folks have got their own again  the miller then hastened on and joined his comrades  stockdale and lizzy also turned back  i wish all this hadnt been forced upon us she said regretfully  but if those excisemen had got off with the tubs half the people in the parish would have been in want for the next month or two  stockdale was not paying much attention to her words and he said i dont think i can go back like this  those four poor excisemen may be murdered for all i know  murdered said lizzy impatiently  we dont do murder here  well i shall go as far as warmell cross to see said stockdale decisively and without wishing her safe home or anything else the minister turned back  lizzy stood looking at him till his form was absorbed in the shades and then with sadness she went in the direction of nethermoynton  the road was lonely and after nightfall at this time of the year there was often not a passer for hours  stockdale pursued his way without hearing a sound beyond that of his own footsteps and in due time he passed beneath the trees of the plantation which surrounded the warmell crossroad  before he had reached the point of intersection he heard voices from the thicket  hoihoihoi  help help  the voices were not at all feeble or despairing but they were unmistakably anxious  stockdale had no weapon and before plunging into the pitchy darkness of the plantation he pulled a stake from the hedge to use in case of need  when he got among the trees he shoutedwhats the matterwhere are you  here answered the voices and pushing through the brambles in that direction he came near the objects of his search  why dont you come forward said stockdale  we be tied to the trees  who are you  poor will latimer the exciseman said one plaintively  just come and cut these cords theres a good man  we were afraid nobody would pass by tonight  stockdale soon loosened them upon which they stretched their limbs and stood at their ease  the rascals said latimer getting now into a rage though he had seemed quite meek when stockdale first came up  tis the same set of fellows  i know they were moynton chaps to a man  but we cant swear to em said another  not one of em spoke  what are you going to do said stockdale  id fain go back to moynton and have at em again said latimer  so would we said his comrades  fight till we die said latimer  we will we will said his men  but said latimer more frigidly as they came out of the plantation we dont know that these chaps with black faces were moynton men  and proof is a hard thing  so it is said the rest  and therefore we wont do nothing at all said latimer with complete dispassionateness  for my part id sooner be them than we  the clitches of my arms are burning like fire from the cords those two strapping women tied round em  my opinion is now i have had time to think ot that you may serve your goverment at too high a price  for these two nights and days i have not had an hours rest and please god heres for homealong  the other officers agreed heartily to this course and thanking stockdale for his timely assistance they parted from him at the cross taking themselves the western road and stockdale going back to nether moynton  during that walk the minister was lost in reverie of the most painful kind  as soon as he got into the house and before entering his own rooms he advanced to the door of the little back parlour in which lizzy usually sat with her mother  he found her there alone  stockdale went forward and like a man in a dream looked down upon the table that stood between him and the young woman who had her bonnet and cloak still on  as he did not speak she looked up from her chair at him with misgiving in her eye  where are they gone he then said listlessly  whoi dont know  i have seen nothing of them since  i came straight in here  if your men can manage to get off with those tubs it will be a great profit to you i suppose  a share will be mine a share my cousin owletts a share to each of the two farmers and a share divided amongst the men who helped us  and you still think he went on slowly that you will not give this business up  lizzy rose and put her hand upon his shoulder  dont ask that she whispered  you dont know what you are asking  i must tell you though i meant not to do it  what i make by that trade is all i have to keep my mother and myself with  he was astonished  i did not dream of such a thing he said  i would rather have swept the streets had i been you  what is money compared with a clear conscience  my conscience is clear  i know my mother but the king i have never seen  his dues are nothing to me  but it is a great deal to me that my mother and i should live  marry me and promise to give it up  i will keep your mother  it is good of you she said trembling a little  let me think of it by myself  i would rather not answer now  she reserved her answer till the next day and came into his room with a solemn face  i cannot do what you wished she said passionately  it is too much to ask  my whole life ha been passed in this way  her words and manner showed that before entering she had been struggling with herself in private and that the contention had been strong  stockdale turned pale but he spoke quietly  then lizzy we must part i cannot go against my principles in this matter and i cannot make my profession a mockery  you know how i love you and what i would do for you but this one thing i cannot do  but why should you belong to that profession she burst out  i have got this large house why cant you marry me and live here with us and not be a methodist preacher any more  i assure you richard it is no harm and i wish you could only see it as i do  we only carry it on in winter in summer it is never done at all  it stirs up ones dull life at this time o the year and gives excitement which i have got so used to now that i should hardly know how to do ithout it  at nights when the wind blows instead of being dull and stupid and not noticing whether it do blow or not your mind is afield even if you are not afield yourself and you are wondering how the chaps are getting on and you walk up and down the room and look out o window and then you go out yourself and know your way about as well by night as by day and have hairbreadth escapes from old latimer and his fellows who are too stupid ever to really frighten us and only make us a bit nimble  he frightened you a little last night anyhow and i would advise you to drop it before it is worse  she shook her head  no i must go on as i have begun  i was born to it  it is in my blood and i cant be cured  o richard you cannot think what a hard thing you have asked and how sharp you try me when you put me between this and my love for ee  stockdale was leaning with his elbow on the mantelpiece his hands over his eyes  we ought never to have met lizzy he said  it was an ill day for us  i little thought there was anything so hopeless and impossible in our engagement as this  well it is too late now to regret consequences in this way  i have had the happiness of seeing you and knowing you at least  you dissent from church and i dissent from state she said  and i dont see why we are not well matched  he smiled sadly while lizzy remained looking down her eyes beginning to overflow  that was an unhappy evening for both of them and the days that followed were unhappy days  both she and he went mechanically about their employments and his depression was marked in the village by more than one of his denomination with whom he came in contact  but lizzy who passed her days indoors was unsuspected of being the cause for it was generally understood that a quiet engagement to marry existed between her and her cousin owlett and had existed for some time  thus uncertainly the week passed on till one morning stockdale said to her i have had a letter lizzy  i must call you that till i am gone  gone said she blankly  yes he said  i am going from this place  i felt it would be better for us both that i should not stay after what has happened  in fact i couldnt stay here and look on you from day to day without becoming weak and faltering in my course  i have just heard of an arrangement by which the other minister can arrive here in about a week and let me go elsewhere  that he had all this time continued so firmly fixed in his resolution came upon her as a grievous surprise  you never loved me she said bitterly  i might say the same he returned but i will not  grant me one favour  come and hear my last sermon on the day before i go  lizzy who was a churchgoer on sunday mornings frequently attended stockdales chapel in the evening with the rest of the doubleminded and she promised  it became known that stockdale was going to leave and a good many people outside his own sect were sorry to hear it  the intervening days flew rapidly away and on the evening of the sunday which preceded the morning of his departure lizzy sat in the chapel to hear him for the last time the little building was full to overflowing and he took up the subject which all had expected that of the contraband trade so extensively practised among them  his hearers in laying his words to their own hearts did not perceive that they were most particularly directed against lizzy till the sermon waxed warm and stockdale nearly broke down with emotion  in truth his own earnestness and her sad eyes looking up at him were too much for the young mans equanimity  he hardly knew how he ended  he saw lizzy as through a mist turn and go away with the rest of the congregation and shortly afterwards followed her home  she invited him to supper and they sat down alone her mother having as was usual with her on sunday nights gone to bed early  we will part friends wont we said lizzy with forced gaiety and never alluding to the sermon a reticence which rather disappointed him  we will he said with a forced smile on his part and they sat down  it was the first meal that they had ever shared together in their lives and probably the last that they would so share  when it was over and the indifferent conversation could no longer be continued he arose and took her hand  lizzy he said do you say we must partdo you  you do she said solemnly  i can say no more  nor i said he  if that is your answer goodbye  stockdale bent over her and kissed her and she involuntarily returned his kiss  i shall go early he said hurriedly  i shall not see you again  and he did leave early  he fancied when stepping forth into the grey morning light to mount the van which was to carry him away that he saw a face between the parted curtains of lizzys window but the light was faint and the panes glistened with wet so he could not be sure stockdale mounted the vehicle and was gone and on the following sunday the new minister preached in the chapel of the moynton wesleyans  one day two years after the parting stockdale now settled in a midland town came into nethermoynton by carrier in the original way  jogging along in the van that afternoon he had put questions to the driver and the answers that he received interested the minister deeply  the result of them was that he went without the least hesitation to the door of his former lodging  it was about six oclock in the evening and the same time of year as when he had left now too the ground was damp and glistening the west was bright and lizzys snowdrops were raising their heads in the border under the wall  lizzy must have caught sight of him from the window for by the time that he reached the door she was there holding it open and then as if she had not sufficiently considered her act of coming out she drew herself back saying with some constraint mr stockdale  you knew it was said stockdale taking her hand  i wrote to say i should call  yes but you did not say when she answered  i did not  i was not quite sure when my business would lead me to these parts  you only came because business brought you near  well that is the fact but i have often thought i should like to come on purpose to see you    but whats all this that has happened  i told you how it would be lizzy and you would not listen to me  i would not she said sadly  but i had been brought up to that life and it was second nature to me  however it is all over now  the officers have bloodmoney for taking a man dead or alive and the trade is going to nothing  we were hunted down like rats  owlett is quite gone i hear  yes  he is in america  we had a dreadful struggle that last time when they tried to take him  it is a perfect miracle that he lived through it and it is a wonder that i was not killed  i was shot in the hand  it was not by aim the shot was really meant for my cousin but i was behind looking on as usual and the bullet came to me  it bled terribly but i got home without fainting and it healed after a time you know how he suffered  no said stockdale  i only heard that he just escaped with his life  he was shot in the back but a rib turned the ball  he was badly hurt we would not let him be took  the men carried him all night across the meads to kingsbere and hid him in a barn dressing his wound as well as they could till he was so far recovered as to be able to get about  he had gied up his mill for some time and at last he got to bristol and took a passage to america and hes settled in wisconsin  what do you think of smuggling now said the minister gravely  i own that we were wrong said she  but i have suffered for it  i am very poor now and my mother has been dead these twelve months    but wont you come in mr stockdale  stockdale went in and it is to be supposed that they came to an understanding for a fortnight later there was a sale of lizzys furniture and after that a wedding at a chapel in a neighbouring town  he took her away from her old haunts to the home that he had made for himself in his native county where she studied her duties as a ministers wife with praiseworthy assiduity  it is said that in after years she wrote an excellent tract called render unto caesar or the repentant villagers in which her own experience was anonymously used as the introductory story  stockdale got it printed after making some corrections and putting in a few powerful sentences of his own and many hundreds of copies were distributed by the couple in the course of their married life  april 1879
