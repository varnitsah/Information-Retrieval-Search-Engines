88880710	the tremendous adventures of major gahagan     chapter i    truth is strange stranger than fiction  i think it but right that in making my appearance before the public i should at once acquaint them with my titles and name  my card as i leave it at the houses of the nobility my friends is as follows   major goliah ogrady gahagan heics commanding battalion of irregular horse ahmednuggar   seeing i say this simple visiting ticket the world will avoid any of those awkward mistakes as to my person which have been so frequent of late  there has been no end to the blunders regarding this humble title of mine and the confusion thereby created  when i published my volume of poems for instance the morning post newspaper remarked that the lyrics of the heart by miss gahagan may be ranked among the sweetest flowrets of the present spring season  the quarterly review commenting upon my observations on the pons asinorum 4to london 1836 called me doctor gahagan and so on  it was time to put an end to these mistakes and i have taken the above simple remedy  i was urged to it by a very exalted personage  dining in august last at the palace of the tlres at paris the lovely young duch ss of orlns who though she does not speak english understands it as well as i do said to me in the softest teutonic lieber herr major haben sie den ahmednuggarischenjagerbattalion gelassen  warum denn said i quite astonished at her rl h sss question  the pcess then spoke of some trifle from my pen which was simply signed goliah gahagan  there was unluckily a dead silence as hrh put this question  comment donc said hm lois phlppe looking gravely at count mole le cher major a quitte larmee  nicolas donc sera maitre de linde  h m and the pr mnster pursued their conversation in a low tone and left me as may be imagined in a dreadful state of confusion  i blushed and stuttered and murmured out a few incoherent words to explainbut it would not doi could not recover my equanimity during the course of the dinner and while endeavouring to help an english duke my neighbour to poulet a lausterlitz fairly sent seven mushrooms and three large greasy croutes over his whiskers and shirtfrill  another laugh at my expense  ah m le major said the q of the blgns archly vous naurez jamais votre brevet de colonel  her mys joke will be better understood when i state that his grace is the brother of a minister  i am not at liberty to violate the sanctity of private life by mentioning the names of the parties concerned in this little anecdote  i only wish to have it understood that i am a gentleman and live at least in decent society  verbum sat  but to be serious  i am obliged always to write the name of goliah in full to distinguish me from my brother gregory gahagan who was also a major in the kings service and whom i killed in a duel as the public most likely knows  poor greg a very trivial dispute was the cause of our quarrel which never would have originated but for the similarity of our names  the circumstance was this  i had been lucky enough to render the nawaub of lucknow some trifling service in the notorious affair of choprasjee muckjee and his highness sent down a gold toothpickcase directed to captain g gahagan which i of course thought was for me  my brother madly claimed it we fought and the consequence was that in about three minutes he received a slash in the right side cut 6 which effectually did his business he was a good swordsman enoughi was the best in the universe  the most ridiculous part of the affair is that the toothpickcase was his after allhe had left it on the nawaubs table at tiffin  i cant conceive what madness prompted him to fight about such a paltry bauble he had much better have yielded it at once when he saw i was determined to have it  from this slight specimen of my adventures the reader will perceive that my life has been one of no ordinary interest and in fact i may say that i have led a more remarkable life than any man in the servicei have been at more pitched battles led more forlorn hopes had more success among the fair sex drunk harder read more been a handsomer man than any officer now serving her majesty  when i first went to india in 1802 i was a raw cornet of seventeen with blazing red hair six feet four in height athletic at all kinds of exercises owing money to my tailor and everybody else who would trust me possessing an irish brogue and my full pay of 120l a year  i need not say that with all these advantages i did that which a number of clever fellows have done before mei fell in love and proposed to marry immediately  but how to overcome the difficultyit is true that i loved julia jowlerloved her to madness but her father intended her for a member of council at least and not for a beggarly irish ensign it was however my fate to make the passage to india on board of the samuel snob east indiaman captain duffy with this lovely creature and my misfortune instantaneously to fall in love with her  we were not out of the channel before i adored her worshipped the deck which she trod upon kissed a thousand times the cuddychair on which she used to sit  the same madness fell on every man in the ship  the two mates fought about her at the cape the surgeon a sober pious scotchman from disappointed affection took so dreadfully to drinking as to threaten spontaneous combustion and old colonel lilywhite carrying his wife and seven daughters to bengal swore that he would have a divorce from mrs l and made an attempt at suicide the captain himself told me with tears in his eyes that he hated his hithertoadored mrs duffy although he had had nineteen children by her  we used to call her the witchthere was magic in her beauty and in her voice  i was spellbound when i looked at her and stark staring mad when she looked at me  o lustrous black eyeso glossy nightblack ringletso lipso dainty frocks of white muslino tiny kid slippersthough old and gouty gahagan sees you still  i recollect off ascension she looked at me in her particular way one day at dinner just as i happened to be blowing on a piece of scalding hot green fat  i was stupefied at oncei thrust the entire morsel about half a pound into my mouth  i made no attempt to swallow or to masticate it but left it there for many minutes burning burning  i had no skin to my palate for seven weeks after and lived on ricewater during the rest of the voyage  the anecdote is trivial but it shows the power of julia jowler over me  the writers of marine novels have so exhausted the subject of storms shipwrecks mutinies engagements seasickness and so forth that although i have experienced each of these in many varieties i think it quite unnecessary to recount such trifling adventures suffice it to say that during our five months trajet my mad passion for julia daily increased so did the captains and the surgeons so did colonel lilywhites so did the doctors the matesthat of most part of the passengers and a considerable number of the crew  for myself i sworeensign as i wasi would win her for my wife i vowed that i would make her glorious with my swordthat as soon as i had made a favourable impression on my commanding officer which i did not doubt to create i would lay open to him the state of my affections and demand his daughters hand  with such sentimental outpourings did our voyage continue and conclude  we landed at the sunderbunds on a grilling hot day in december 1802 and then for the moment julia and i separated  she was carried off to her papas arms in a palankeen surrounded by at least forty hookahbadars whilst the poor cornet attended but by two dandies and a solitary beasty by which unnatural name these blackamoors are called made his way humbly to join the regiment at headquarters  the th regiment of bengal cavalry then under the command of lieutcolonel julius jowler cb was known throughout asia and europe by the proud title of the bundelcund invinciblesso great was its character for bravery so remarkable were its services in that delightful district of india  major sir george gutch was next in command and tom thrupp as kind a fellow as ever ran a mahratta through the body was second major  we were on the eve of that remarkable war which was speedily to spread throughout the whole of india to call forth the valour of a wellesley and the indomitable gallantry of a gahagan which was illustrated by our victories at ahmednuggar where i was the first over the barricade at the storming of the pettah at argaum where i slew with my own sword twentythree matchlockmen and cut a dromedary in two and by that terrible day of assaye where wellesley would have been beaten but for meme alone  i headed nineteen charges of cavalry took aided by only four men of my own troop seventeen fieldpieces killing the scoundrelly french artillerymen on that day i had eleven elephants shot under me and carried away scindiahs nose ring with a pistolball  wellesley is a duke and a marshal i but a simple major of irregulars  such is fortune and war  but my feelings carry me away from my narrative which had better proceed with more order  on arriving i say at our barracks at dum dum i for the first time put on the beautiful uniform of the invincibles  a light blue swallowtailed jacket with silver lace and wings ornamented with about 3000 sugarloaf buttons rhubarbcoloured leather inexpressibles tights and red morocco boots with silver spurs and tassels set off to admiration the handsome persons of the officers of our corps  we wore powder in those days and a regulation pigtail of seventeen inches a brass helmet surrounded by leopard skin with a bearskin top and a horsetail feather gave the head a fierce and chivalrous appearance which is far more easily imagined than described  attired in this magnificent costume i first presented myself before colonel jowler  he was habited in a manner precisely similar but not being more than five feet in height and weighing at least fifteen stone the dress he wore did not become him quite so much as slimmer and taller men  flanked by his tall majors thrupp and gutch he looked like a stumpy skittleball between two attenuated skittles  the plump little colonel received me with vast cordiality and i speedily became a prime favourite with himself and the other officers of the corps  jowler was the most hospitable of men and gratifying my appetite and my love together i continually partook of his dinners and feasted on the sweet presence of julia  i can see now what i would not and could not perceive in those early days that this miss jowleron whom i had lavished my first and warmest love whom i had endowed with all perfection and puritywas no better than a little impudent flirt who played with my feelings because during the monotony of a sea voyage she had no other toy to play with and who deserted others for me and me for others just as her whim or her interest might guide her  she had not been three weeks at headquarters when half the regiment was in love with her  each and all of the candidates had some favour to boast of or some encouraging hopes on which to build  it was the scene of the samuel snob over again only heightened in interest by a number of duels  the following list will give the reader a notion of some of them   1  cornet gahagan    ensign hicks of the sappers and miners hicks received a ball in his jaw and was half choked by a quantity of carroty whisker forced down his throat with the ball  2  captain macgillicuddy bni cornet gahagan  i was run through the body but the sword passed between the ribs and injured me very slightly  3  captain macgillicuddy bni mr mulligatawny bcs deputy assistant vice subcontroller of the boggleywollah indigo grounds ramgolly branch   macgillicuddy should have stuck to swords play and he might have come off in his second duel as well as in his first as it was the civilian placed a ball and a part of macs gold repeater in his stomach  a remarkable circumstance attended this shot an account of which i sent home to the philosophical transactions the surgeon had extracted the ball and was going off thinking that all was well when the gold repeater struck thirteen in poor macgillicuddys abdomen  i suppose that the works must have been disarranged in some way by the bullet for the repeater was one of barrauds never known to fail before and the circumstance occurred at seven oclock 1  i could continue almost ad infinitum an account of the wars which this helen occasioned but the above three specimens will i should think satisfy the peaceful reader  i delight not in scenes of blood heaven knows but i was compelled in the course of a few weeks and for the sake of this one woman to fight nine duels myself and i know that four times as many more took place concerning her  i forgot to say that jowlers wife was a halfcaste woman who had been born and bred entirely in india and whom the colonel had married from the house of her mother a native  there were some singular rumours abroad regarding this latter ladys history  it was reported that she was the daughter of a native rajah and had been carried off by a poor english subaltern in lord clives time the young man was killed very soon after and left his child with its mother  the black prince forgave his daughter and bequeathed to her a handsome sum of money  i suppose that it was on this account that jowler married mrs j a creature who had not i do believe a christian name or a single christian quality  she was a hideous bloated yellow creature with a beard black teeth and red eyes  she was fat lying ugly and stingyshe hated and was hated by all the world and by her jolly husband as devoutly as by any other  she did not pass a month in the year with him but spent most of her time with her native friends  i wonder how she could have given birth to so lovely a creature as her daughter this woman was of course with the colonel when julia arrived and the spice of the devil in her daughters composition was most carefully nourished and fed by her  if julia had been a flirt before she was a downright jilt now she set the whole cantonment by the ears she made wives jealous and husbands miserable she caused all those duels of which i have discoursed already and yet such was the fascination of the witch that i still thought her an angel  i made court to the nasty mother in order to be near the daughter and i listened untiringly to jowlers interminable dull stories because i was occupied all the time in watching the graceful movements of miss julia  but the trumpet of war was soon ringing in our ears and on the battlefield gahagan is a man  the bundelcund invincibles received orders to march and jowler hectorlike donned his helmet and prepared to part from his andromache  and now arose his perplexity  what must be done with his daughter his julia  he knew his wifes peculiarities of living and did not much care to trust his daughter to her keeping but in vain he tried to find her an asylum among the respectable ladies of his regiment  lady gutch offered to receive her but would have nothing to do with mrs jowler the surgeons wife mrs sawbone would have neither mother nor daughter  there was no help for it julia and her mother must have a house together and jowler knew that his wife would fill it with her odious blackamoor friends  i could not however go forth satisfied to the campaign until i learned from julia my fate  i watched twenty opportunities to see her alone and wandered about the colonels bungalow as an informer does about a publichouse marking the incomings and the outgoings of the family and longing to seize the moment when miss jowler unbiassed by her mother or her papa might listen perhaps to my eloquence and melt at the tale of my love  but it would not doold jowler seemed to have taken all of a sudden to such a fit of domesticity that there was no finding him out of doors and his rhubarbcoloured wife i believe that her skin gave the first idea of our regimental breeches who before had been gadding ceaselessly abroad and poking her broad nose into every menage in the cantonment stopped faithfully at home with her spouse  my only chance was to beard the old couple in their den and ask them at once for their cub  so i called one day at tiffin old jowler was always happy to have my company at this meal it amused him he said to see me drink hodgsons pale ale i drank two hundred and thirtyfour dozen the first year i was in bengaland it was no small piece of fun certainly to see old mrs jowler attack the curriebhautshe was exactly the colour of it as i have had already the honour to remark and she swallowed the mixture with a gusto which was never equalled except by my poor friend dando a propos dhuitres  she consumed the first three platefuls with a fork and spoon like a christian but as she warmed to her work the old hag would throw away her silver implements and dragging the dishes towards her go to work with her hands flip the rice into her mouth with her fingers and stow away a quantity of eatables sufficient for a sepoy company  but why do i diverge from the main point of my story  julia then jowler and mrs j were at luncheon the dear girl was in the act to sabler a glass of hodgson as i entered  how do you do mr gagin said the old hag leeringly  eat a bit o curriebhautand she thrust the dish towards me securing a heap as it passed  what  gagy my boy how do how do said the fat colonel  what run through the bodygot well againhave some hodgsonrun through your body tooand at this i may say coarse joke alluding to the fact that in these hot climates the ale oozes out as it were from the pores of the skin old jowler laughed  a host of swarthy chobdars kitmatgars sices consomahs and bobbychies laughed too as they provided me unasked with the grateful fluid  swallowing six tumblers of it i paused nervously for a moment and then said   bobbachy consomah ballybaloo hoga  the black ruffians took the hint and retired  colonel and mrs jowler said i solemnly we are alone and you miss jowler you are alone too that isi meani take this opportunity toanother glass of ale if you pleaseto express once for all before departing on a dangerous campaignjulia turned palebefore entering i say upon a war which may stretch in the dust my highraised hopes and me to express my hopes while life still remains to me and to declare in the face of heaven earth and colonel jowler that i love you julia  the colonel astonished let fall a steel fork which stuck quivering for some minutes in the calf of my leg but i heeded not the paltry interruption  yes by yon bright heaven continued i i love you julia  i respect my commander i esteem your excellent and beauteous mother  tell me before i leave you if i may hope for a return of my affection  say that you love me and i will do such deeds in this coming war as shall make you proud of the name of your gahagan  the old woman as i delivered these touching words stared snapped and ground her teeth like an enraged monkey  julia was now red now white the colonel stretched forward took the fork out of the calf of my leg wiped it and then seized a bundle of letters which i had remarked by his side  a cornet said he in a voice choking with emotion a pitiful beggarly irish cornet aspire to the hand of julia jowler  gag gahagan are you mad or laughing at us  look at these letters young manat these letters i sayone hundred and twentyfour epistles from every part of india not including one from the governorgeneral and six from his brother colonel wellesleyone hundred and twentyfour proposals for the hand of miss jowler cornet gahagan he continued i wish to think well of you  you are the bravest the most modest and perhaps the handsomest man in our corps but you have not got a single rupee  you ask me for julia and you do not possess even an annahere the old rogue grinned as if he had made a capital punno no said he waxing goodnatured gagy my boy it is nonsense  julia love retire with your mamma this silly young gentleman will remain and smoke a pipe with me  i took one  it was the bitterest chillum i ever smoked in my life      i am not going to give here an account of my military services they will appear in my great national autobiography in forty volumes which i am now preparing for the press  i was with my regiment in all wellesleys brilliant campaigns then taking dawk i travelled across the country northeastward and had the honour of fighting by the side of lord lake at laswaree degg furruckabad futtyghur and bhurtpore  but i will not boast of my actionsthe military man knows them my sovereign appreciates them  if asked who was the bravest man of the indian army there is not an officer belonging to it who would not cry at once gahagan  the fact is i was desperate  i cared not for life deprived of julia jowler  with julias stony looks ever before my eyes her fathers stern refusal in my ears i did not care at the close of the campaign again to seek her company or to press my suit  we were eighteen months on service marching and countermarching and fighting almost every other day  to the world i did not seem altered but the world only saw the face and not the seared and blighted heart within me  my valour always desperate now reached to a pitch of cruelty i tortured my grooms and grasscutters for the most trifling offence or errori never in action spared a mani sheared off three hundred and nine heads in the course of that single campaign  some influence equally melancholy seemed to have fallen upon poor old jowler  about six months after we had left dum dum he received a parcel of letters from benares whither his wife had retired with her daughter and so deeply did they seem to weigh upon his spirits that he ordered eleven men of his regiment to be flogged within two days but it was against the blacks that he chiefly turned his wrath  our fellows in the heat and hurry of the campaign were in the habit of dealing rather roughly with their prisoners to extract treasure from them  they used to pull their nails out by the root to boil them in kedgeree pots to flog them and dress their wounds with cayenne pepper and so on jowler when he heard of these proceedings which before had always justly exasperated him he was a humane and kind little man used now to smile fiercely and say d the black scoundrels  serve them right serve them right  one day about a couple of miles in advance of the column i had been on a foragingparty with a few dragoons and was returning peaceably to camp when of a sudden a troop of mahrattas burst on us from a neighbouring mangotope in which they had been hidden in an instant three of my mens saddles were empty and i was left with but seven more to make head against at least thirty of these vagabond black horsemen  i never saw in my life a nobler figure than the leader of the troopmounted on a splendid black arab he was as tall very nearly as myself he wore a steel cap and a shirt of mail and carried a beautiful french carbine which had already done execution upon two of my men  i saw that our only chance of safety lay in the destruction of this man  i shouted to him in a voice of thunder in the hindustanee tongue of course stop dog if you dare and encounter a man  in reply his lance came whirling in the air over my head and mortally transfixed poor foggarty of ours who was behind me grinding my teeth and swearing horribly i drew that scimitar which never yet failed its blow 2 and rushed at the indian  he came down at full gallop his own sword making ten thousand gleaming circles in the air shrieking his cry of battle  the contest did not last an instant  with my first blow i cut off his swordarm at the wrist my second i levelled at his head  i said that he wore a steel cap with a gilt iron spike of six inches and a hood of chain mail  i rose in my stirrups and delivered st george my sword caught the spike exactly on the point split it sheer in two cut crashing through the steel cap and hood and was only stopped by a ruby which he wore in his back plate  his head cut clean in two between the eyebrows and nostrils even between the two front teeth fell one side on each shoulder and he galloped on till his horse was stopped by my men who were not a little amused at the feat  as i had expected the remaining ruffians fled on seeing their leaders fate  i took home his helmet by way of curiosity and we made a single prisoner who was instantly carried before old jowler  we asked the prisoner the name of the leader of the troop  he said it was chowder loll  chowder loll shrieked colonel jowler  o fate thy hand is here  he rushed wildly into his tentthe next day applied for leave of absence  gutch took the command of the regiment and i saw him no more for some time      as i had distinguished myself not a little during the war general lake sent me up with despatches to calcutta where lord wellesley received me with the greatest distinction  fancy my surprise on going to a ball at government house to meet my old friend jowler my trembling blushing thrilling delight when i saw julia by his side  jowler seemed to blush too when he beheld me  i thought of my former passages with his daughter  gagy my boy says he shaking hands glad to see you  old friend juliacome to tiffin hodgsons palebrave fellow gagy  julia did not speak but she turned ashy pale and fixed upon me her awful eyes  i fainted almost and uttered some incoherent words  julia took my hand gazed at me still and said come  need i say i went  i will not go over the pale ale and curriebhaut again but this i know that in halfanhour i was as much in love as i ever had been  and that in three weeks iyes iwas the accepted lover of julia  i did not pause to ask where were the one hundred and twentyfour offers why i refused before should be accepted now i only felt that i loved her and was happy      one night one memorable night i could not sleep and with a lovers pardonable passion wandered solitary through the city of palaces until i came to the house which contained my julia  i peeped into the compoundall was still i looked into the verandahall was dark except a lightyes one lightand it was in julias chamber  my heart throbbed almost to stifling  i wouldi would advance if but to gaze upon her for a moment and to bless her as she slept  i did look i did advance and o heaven  i saw a lamp burning mrs jow in a nightdress with a very dark baby in her arms and julia looking tenderly at an ayah who was nursing another  oh mamma said julia what would that fool gahagan say if he knew all  he does know all shouted i springing forward and tearing down the tatties from the window  mrs jow ran shrieking out of the room julia fainted the cursed black children squalled and their dd nurse fell on her knees gabbling some infernal jargon of hindustanee  old jowler at this juncture entered with a candle and a drawn sword  liar scoundrel deceiver shouted i  turn ruffian and defend yourself  but old jowler when he saw me only whistled looked at his lifeless daughter and slowly left the room  why continue the tale  i need not now account for jowlers gloom on receiving his letters from benaresfor his exclamation upon the death of the indian chieffor his desire to marry his daughter the woman i was wooing was no longer miss julia jowler she was mrs chowder loll    chapter ii  allyghur and laswaree    i sat down to write gravely and sadly for since the appearance of some of my adventures in a monthly magazine unprincipled men have endeavoured to rob me of the only good i possess to question the statements that i make and themselves without a spark of honour or good feeling to steal from me that which is my sole wealthmy character as a teller of the truth  the reader will understand that it is to the illiberal strictures of a profligate press i now allude among the london journalists none luckily for themselves have dared to question the veracity of my statements  they know me and they know that i am in london if i can use the pen i can also wield a more manly and terrible weapon and would answer their contradictions with my sword  no gold or gems adorn the hilt of that warworn scimitar but there is blood upon the bladethe blood of the enemies of my country and the maligners of my honest fame  there are others howeverthe disgrace of a disgraceful tradewho borrowing from distance a despicable courage have ventured to assail me  the infamous editors of the kelso champion the bungay beacon the tipperary argus and the stoke pogis sentinel and other dastardly organs of the provincial press have although differing in politics agreed upon this one point and with a scoundrelly unanimity vented a flood of abuse upon the revelations made by me  they say that i have assailed private characters and wilfully perverted history to blacken the reputation of public men  i ask was any one of these men in bengal in the year 1803  was any single conductor of any one of these paltry prints ever in bundelcund or the rohilla country  does this exquisite tipperary scribe know the difference between hurrygurrybang and burrumtollah not he and because forsooth in those strange and distant lands strange circumstances have taken place it is insinuated that the relater is a liar  nay that the very places themselves have no existence but in my imagination  foolsbut i will not waste my anger upon them and proceed to recount some other portions of my personal history  it is i presume a fact which even these scribbling assassins will not venture to deny that before the commencement of the campaign against scindiah the english general formed a camp at kanouge on the jumna where he exercised that brilliant little army which was speedily to perform such wonders in the dooab  it will be as well to give a slight account of the causes of a war which was speedily to rage through some of the fairest portions of the indian continent  shah allum the son of shah lollum the descendant by the female line of nadir shah that celebrated toorkomaun adventurer who had wellnigh hurled bajazet and selim the second from the throne of bagdadshah allum i say although nominally the emperor of delhi was in reality the slave of the various warlike chieftains who lorded it by turns over the country and the sovereign until conquered and slain by some more successful rebel  chowder loll masolgee zubberdust khan dowsunt row scindiah and the celebrated bobbachy jung bahawder had held for a time complete mastery in delhi  the second of these a ruthless afghan soldier had abruptly entered the capital nor was he ejected from it until he had seized upon the principal jewels and likewise put out the eyes of the last of the unfortunate family of afrasiab  scindiah came to the rescue of the sightless shah allum and though he destroyed his oppressor only increased his slavery holding him in as painful a bondage as he had suffered under the tyrannous afghan  as long as these heroes were battling among themselves or as long rather as it appeared that they had any strength to fight a battle the british government ever anxious to see its enemies by the ears by no means interfered in the contest  but the french revolution broke out and a host of starving sansculottes appeared among the various indian states seeking for military service and inflaming the minds of the various native princes against the british east india company  a number of these entered into scindiahs ranks  one of them perron was commander of his army and though that chief was as yet quite engaged in his hereditary quarrel with jeswunt row holkar and never thought of an invasion of the british territory the company all of a sudden discovered that shah allum his sovereign was shamefully illused and determined to reestablish the ancient splendour of his throne  of course it was sheer benevolence for poor shah allum that prompted our governors to take these kindly measures in his favour i dont know how it happened that at the end of the war the poor shah was not a whit better off than at the beginning and that though holkar was beaten and scindiah annihilated shah allum was much such a puppet as before  somehow in the hurry and confusion of this struggle the oyster remained with the british government who had so kindly offered to dress it for the emperor while his majesty was obliged to be contented with the shell  the force encamped at kanouge bore the title of the grand army of the ganges and the jumna it consisted of eleven regiments of cavalry and twelve battalions of infantry and was commanded by general lake in person  well on the 1st of september we stormed perrons camp at allyghur on the fourth we took that fortress by assault and as my name was mentioned in general orders i may as well quote the commanderin chiefs words regarding methey will spare me the trouble of composing my own eulogium   the commanderinchief is proud thus publicly to declare his high sense of the gallantry of lieutenant gahagan of the  cavalry in the storming of the fortress although unprovided with a single ladder and accompanied but by a few brave men lieutenant gahagan succeeded in escalading the inner and fourteenth wall of the place fourteen ditches lined with swordblades and poisoned chevauxde frise fourteen walls bristling with innumerable artillery and as smooth as lookingglasses were in turn triumphantly passed by that enterprising officer  his course was to be traced by the heaps of slaughtered enemies lying thick upon the platforms and alas by the corpses of most of the gallant men who followed him  when at length he effected his lodgment and the dastardly enemy who dared not to confront him with arms let loose upon him the tigers and lions of scindiahs menagerie this meritorious officer destroyed with his own hand four of the largest and most ferocious animals and the rest awed by the indomitable majesty of british valour shrank back to their dens  thomas higgory a private and runty goss havildar were the only two who remained out of the nine hundred who followed lieutenant gahagan  honour to them  honour and tears for the brave men who perished on that awful day       i have copied this word for word from the bengal hurkaru of september 24 1803  and anybody who has the slightest doubt as to the statement may refer to the paper itself  and here i must pause to give thanks to fortune which so marvellously preserved me sergeantmajor higgory and runty goss were i to say that any valour of ours had carried us unhurt through this tremendous combat the reader would laugh me to scorn  no though my narrative is extraordinary it is nevertheless authentic and never never would i sacrifice truth for the mere sake of effect  the fact is this the citadel of allyghur is situated upon a rock about a thousand feet above the level of the sea and is surrounded by fourteen walls as his excellency was good enough to remark in his despatch  a man who would mount these without scalingladders is an ass he who would say he mounted them without such assistance is a liar and a knave  we had scaling ladders at the commencement of the assault although it was quite impossible to carry them beyond the first line of batteries mounted on them however as our troops were falling thick about me i saw that we must ignominiously retreat unless some other help could be found for our brave fellows to escalade the next wall  it was about seventy feet high  i instantly turned the guns of wall a on wall b and peppered the latter so as to make not a breach but a scaling place the men mounting in the holes made by the shot  by this simple stratagem i managed to pass each successive barrierfor to ascend a wall which the general was pleased to call as smooth as glass is an absurd impossibility  i seek to achieve none such   i dare do all that may become a man who dares do more is neither more nor less   of course had the enemys guns been commonly well served not one of us would ever have been alive out of the three but whether it was owing to fright or to the excessive smoke caused by so many pieces of artillery arrive we did  on the platforms too our work was not quite so difficult as might be imaginedkilling these fellows was sheer butchery  as soon as we appeared they all turned and fled helterskelter and the reader may judge of their courage by the fact that out of about seven hundred men killed by us only forty had wounds in front the rest being bayoneted as they ran  and beyond all other pieces of good fortune was the very letting out of these tigers which was the dernier ressort of bournonville the second commandant of the fort  i had observed this man conspicuous for a tricoloured scarf which he wore upon every one of the walls as we stormed them and running away the very first among the fugitives  he had all the keys of the gates and in his tremor as he opened the menagerie portal left the whole bunch in the door which i seized when the animals were overcome  runty goss then opened them one by one our troops entered and the victorious standard of my country floated on the walls of allyghur  when the general accompanied by his staff entered the last line of fortifications the brave old man raised me from the dead rhinoceros on which i was seated and pressed me to his breast but the excitement which had borne me through the fatigues and perils of that fearful day failed all of a sudden and i wept like a child upon his shoulder  promotion in our army goes unluckily by seniority nor is it in the power of the generalinchief to advance a caesar if he finds him in the capacity of a subaltern  my reward for the above exploit was therefore not very rich  his excellency had a favourite horn snuffbox for though exalted in station he was in his habits most simple  of this and about a quarter of an ounce of highdried welsh which he always took he made me a present saying in front of the line accept this mr gahagan as a token of respect from the first to the bravest officer in the army  calculating the snuff to be worth a halfpenny i should say that fourpence was about the value of this gift  but it has at least this good effectit serves to convince any person who doubts my story that the facts of it are really true  i have left it at the office of my publisher along with the extract from the bengal hurkaru and anybody may examine both by applying in the counting house of mr cunningham 3  that once popular expression or proverb are you up to snuff arose out of the above circumstance for the officers of my corps none of whom except myself had ventured on the storming party used to twit me about this modest reward for my labours  never mind when they want me to storm a fort again i shall know better  well immediately after the capture of this important fortress perron who had been the life and soul of scindiahs army came in to us with his family and treasure and was passed over to the french settlements at chandernagur  bourquien took his command and against him we now moved  the morning of the 11th of september found us upon the plains of delhi  it was a burning hot day and we were all refreshing ourselves after the mornings march when i who was on the advanced picket along with ogawler of the kings dragoons was made aware of the enemys neighbourhood in a very singular manner  ogawler and i were seated under a little canopy of horsecloths which we had formed to shelter us from the intolerable heat of the sun and were discussing with great delight a few manilla cheroots and a stone jar of the most exquisite cool weak refreshing sangaree  we had been playing cards the night before and ogawler had lost to me seven hundred rupees  i emptied the last of the sangaree into the two pint tumblers out of which we were drinking and holding mine up said heres better luck to you next time ogawler  as i spoke the wordswhisha cannonball cut the tumbler clean out of my hand and plumped into poor ogawlers stomach  it settled him completely and of course i never got my seven hundred rupees  such are the uncertainties of war  to strap on my sabre and my accoutrementsto mount my arab chargerto drink off what ogawler had left of the sangareeand to gallop to the general was the work of a moment  i found him as comfortably at tiffin as if he were at his own house in london  general said i as soon as i got into his paijamahs or tent you must leave your lunch if you want to fight the enemy  the enemypsha  mr gahagan the enemy is on the other side of the river  i can only tell your excellency that the enemys guns will hardly carry five miles and that cornet ogawler was this moment shot dead at my side with a cannonball  ha is it so said his excellency rising and laying down the drumstick of a grilled chicken  gentlemen remember that the eyes of europe are upon us and follow me  each aidedecamp started from table and seized his cocked hat each british heart beat high at the thoughts of the coming melee we mounted our horses and galloped swiftly after the brave old general i not the last in the train upon my famous black charger  it was perfectly true the enemy were posted in force within three miles of our camp and from a hillock in the advance to which we galloped we were enabled with our telescopes to see the whole of his imposing line  nothing can better describe it than this       a          a is the enemy and the dots represent the hundred and twenty pieces of artillery which defended his line  he was moreover entrenched and a wide morass in his front gave him an additional security  his excellency for a moment surveyed the line and then said turning round to one of his aidesdecamp order up majorgeneral tinkler and the cavalry  here does your excellency mean said the aidedecamp surprised for the enemy had perceived us and the cannonballs were flying about as thick as peas  here sir said the old general stamping with his foot in a passion and the adc shrugged his shoulders and galloped away in five minutes we heard the trumpets in our camp and in twenty more the greater part of the cavalry had joined us  up they came five thousand men their standards flapping in the air their long line of polished jackboots gleaming in the golden sunlight  and now we are here said majorgeneral sir theophilus tinkler what next  oh d it said the commanderinchief charge chargenothing like charginggallopinggunsrascally black scoundrelscharge charge  and then turning round to me perhaps he was glad to change the conversation he said lieutenant gahagan you will stay with me  and well for him i did for i do not hesitate to say that the battle was gained by me  i do not mean to insult the reader by pretending that any personal exertions of mine turned the day that i killed for instance a regiment of cavalry or swallowed a battery of gunssuch absurd tales would disgrace both the hearer and the teller  i as is well known never say a single word which cannot be proved and hate more than all other vices the absurd sin of egotism  i simply mean that my advice to the general at a quarterpast two oclock in the afternoon of that day won this great triumph for the british army  gleig mill and thorn have all told the tale of this war though somehow they have omitted all mention of the hero of it  general lake for the victory of that day became lord lake of laswaree laswaree and who forsooth was the real conqueror of laswaree  i can lay my hand upon my heart and say that i was  if any proof is wanting of the fact let me give it at once and from the highest military testimony in the worldi mean that of the emperor napoleon  in the month of march 1817 i was passenger on board the prince regent captain harris which touched at st helena on its passage from calcutta to england  in company with the other officers on board the ship i paid my respects to the illustrious exile of longwood who received us in his garden where he was walking about in a nankeen dress and a large broadbrimmed straw hat with general montholon count las casas and his son emanuel then a little boy who i dare say does not recollect me but who nevertheless played with my swordknot and the tassels of my hessian boots during the whole of our interview with his imperial majesty  our names were read out in a pretty accent by the way by general montholon and the emperor as each was pronounced made a bow to the owner of it but did not vouchsafe a word  at last montholon came to mine  the emperor looked me at once in the face took his hands out of his pockets put them behind his back and coming up to me smiling pronounced the following words  assaye delhi deeg futtyghur  i blushed and taking off my hat with a bow said sire cest moi  parbleu je le savais bien said the emperor holding out his snuffbox  en usezvous major  i took a large pinch which with the honour of speaking to so great a man brought the tears into my eyes and he continued as nearly as possible in the following words  sir you are known you come of an heroic nation  your third brother the chef de bataillon count godfrey gahagan was in my irish brigade  gahagan  sire it is true  he and my countrymen in your majestys service stood under the green flag in the breach of burgos and beat wellington back  it was the only time as your majesty knows that irishmen and englishmen were beaten in that war  napoleon looking as if he would say d your candour major gahagan  well well it was so  your brother was a count and died a general in my service  gahagan  he was found lying upon the bodies of nineandtwenty cossacks at borodino  they were all dead and bore the gahagan mark  napoleon to montholon  cest vrai montholon  je vous donne ma parole dhonneur la plus sacree que cest vrai  ils ne sont pas dautres ces terribles gagans  you must know that monsieur gained the battle of delhi as certainly as i did that of austerlitz  in this way ce belitre de lor lake after calling up his cavalry and placing them in front of holkars batteries qui balayaient la plaine was for charging the enemys batteries with his horse who would have been ecrases mitrailles foudroyes to a man but for the cunning of ce grand rogue que vous voyez  montholon  coquin de major va  napoleon  montholon taistoi  when lord lake with his great bullheaded english obstinacy saw the facheuse position into which he had brought his troops he was for dying on the spot and would infallibly have done soand the loss of his army would have been the ruin of the east india companyand the ruin of the english east india company would have established my empire bah it was a republic then in the eastbut that the man before us lieutenant goliah gahagan was riding at the side of general lake  montholon with an accent of despair and fury  gredin cent mille tonnerres de dieu  napoleon benignantly  calmetoi mon fidele ami  what will you  it was fate  gahagan at the critical period of the battle or rather slaughter for the english had not slain a man of the enemy advised a retreat  montholon  le lache  un francais meurt mais il ne recule jamais  napoleon  stupide  dont you see why the retreat was ordered dont you know that it was a feint on the part of gahagan to draw holkar from his impregnable entrenchments  dont you know that the ignorant indian fell into the snare and issuing from behind the cover of his guns came down with his cavalry on the plains in pursuit of lake and his dragoons  then it was that the englishmen turned upon him the hardy children of the north swept down his feeble horsemen bore them back to their guns which were useless entered holkars entrenchments along with his troops sabred the artillerymen at their pieces and won the battle of delhi  as the emperor spoke his pale cheek glowed red his eye flashed fire his deep clear voice rung as of old when he pointed out the enemy from beneath the shadow of the pyramids or rallied his regiments to the charge upon the deathstrewn plain of wagram  i have had many a proud moment in my life but never such a proud one as this and i would readily pardon the word coward as applied to me by montholon in consideration of the testimony which his master bore in my favour  major said the emperor to me in conclusion why had i not such a man as you in my service  i would have made you a prince and a marshal and here he fell into a reverie of which i knew and respected the purport  he was thinking doubtless that i might have retrieved his fortunes and indeed i have very little doubt that i might  very soon after coffee was brought by monsieur marchand napoleons valetdechambre and after partaking of that beverage and talking upon the politics of the day the emperor withdrew leaving me deeply impressed by the condescension he had shown in this remarkable interview    chapter iii  a peep into spainaccount of the origin and services of the ahmednuggar irregulars    headquarters morella  september 15 1838  i have been here for some months along with my young friend cabrera  and in the hurry and bustle of wardaily on guard and in the batteries for sixteen hours out of the twentyfour with fourteen severe wounds and seven musketballs in my bodyit may be imagined that i have had little time to think about the publication of my memoirs  inter arma silent legesin the midst of fighting be hanged to writing as the poet says and i never would have bothered myself with a pen had not common gratitude incited me to throw off a few pages  along with oraas troops who have of late been beleaguering this place there was a young milesian gentleman mr toone oconnor emmett fitzgerald sheeny by name a law student and a member of grays inn and what he called bay ah of trinity college dublin mr sheeny was with the queens people not in a military capacity but as representative of an english journal to which for a trifling weekly remuneration he was in the habit of transmitting accounts of the movements of the belligerents and his own opinion of the politics of spain  receiving for the discharge of his duty a couple of guineas a week from the proprietors of the journal in question he was enabled as i need scarcely say to make such a show in oraas camp as only a christino general officer or at the very least a colonel of a regiment can afford to keep up  in the famous sortie which we made upon the twentythird i was of course among the foremost in the melee and found myself after a good deal of slaughtering which it would be as disagreeable as useless to describe here in the court of a small inn or podesta which had been made the headquarters of several queenite officers during the siege  the pesatero or landlord of the inn had been despatched by my brave chapelchuries with his fine family of childrenthe officers quartered in the podesta had of course bolted but one man remained and my fellows were on the point of cutting him into ten thousand pieces with their borachios when i arrived in the room time enough to prevent the catastrophe  seeing before me an individual in the costume of a civiliana white hat a light blue satin cravat embroidered with butterflies and other quadrupeds a green coat and brass buttons and a pair of blue plaid trousers i recognised at once a countryman and interposed to save his life  in an agonised brogue the unhappy young man was saying all that he could to induce the chapelchuries to give up their intention of slaughtering him but it is very little likely that his protestations would have had any effect upon them had not i appeared in the room and shouted to the ruffians to hold their hand  seeing a general officer before them i have the honour to hold that rank in the service of his catholic majesty and moreover one six feet four in height and armed with that terrible cabecilla a sword so called because it is five feet long which is so well known among the spanish armiesseeing i say this figure the fellows retired exclaiming adios corpo di bacco nosotros and so on clearly proving by their words that they would if they dared have immolated the victim whom i had thus rescued from their fury  villains shouted i hearing them grumble away quit the apartment  each man sulkily sheathing his sombrero obeyed and quitted the camarilla  it was then that mr sheeny detailed to me the particulars to which i have briefly adverted and informing me at the same time that he had a family in england who would feel obliged to me for his release and that his most intimate friend the english ambassador would move heaven and earth to revenge his fall he directed my attention to a portmanteau passably well filled which he hoped would satisfy the cupidity of my troops  i said though with much regret that i must subject his person to a search and hence arose the circumstance which has called for what i fear you will consider a somewhat tedious explanation  i found upon mr sheenys person three sovereigns in english money which i have to this day and singularly enough a copy of the new monthly magazine containing a portion of my adventures  it was a tossup whether i should let the poor young man be shot or no but this little circumstance saved his life  the gratified vanity of authorship induced me to accept his portmanteau and valuables and to allow the poor wretch to go free  i put the magazine in my coatpocket and left him and the podesta  the men to my surprise had quitted the building and it was full time for me to follow for i found our sallying party after committing dreadful ravages in oraas lines were in full retreat upon the fort hotly pressed by a superior force of the enemy  i am pretty well known and respected by the men of both parties in spain indeed i served for some months on the queens side before i came over to don carlos and as it is my maxim never to give quarter i never expect to receive it when taken myself  on issuing from the podesta with sheenys portmanteau and my sword in my hand i was a little disgusted and annoyed to see our own men in a pretty good column retreating at doublequick and about four hundred yards beyond me up the hill leading to the fort while on my left hand and at only a hundred yards a troop of the queenite lancers were clattering along the road  i had got into the very middle of the road before i made this discovery so that the fellows had a full sight of me and whizz came a bullet by my left whisker before i could say jack robinson i looked roundthere were seventy of the accursed malvados at the least and within as i said a hundred yards  were i to say that i stopped to fight seventy men you would write me down a fool or a liar  no sir i did not fight i ran away  i am six feet fourmy figure is as well known in the spanish army as that of the count de luchana or my fierce little friend cabrera himself  gahagan shouted out halfadozen scoundrelly voices and fifty more shots came rattling after me  i was running running as the brave stag before the houndsrunning as i have done a great number of times before in my life when there was no help for it but a race  after i had run about five hundred yards i saw that i had gained nearly three upon our column in front and that likewise the christino horsemen were left behind some hundred yards more with the exception of three who were fearfully near me  the first was an officer without a lance he had fired both his pistols at me and was twenty yards in advance of his comrades there was a similar distance between the two lancers who rode behind him  i determined then to wait for no 1 and as he came up delivered cut 3 at his horses near legoff it flew and down as i expected went horse and man  i had hardly time to pass my sword through my prostrate enemy when no 2 was upon me  if i could but get that fellows horse thought i i am safe and i executed at once the plan which i hoped was to effect my rescue  i had as i said left the podesta with sheenys portmanteau and unwilling to part with some of the articles it containedsome shirts a bottle of whisky a few cakes of windsor soap c c i had carried it thus far on my shoulders but now was compelled to sacrifice it malgre moi  as the lancer came up i dropped my sword from my right hand and hurled the portmanteau at his head with aim so true that he fell back on his saddle like a sack and thus when the horse galloped up to me i had no difficulty in dismounting the rider  the whiskybottle struck him over his right eye and he was completely stunned  to dash him from the saddle and spring myself into it was the work of a moment indeed the two combats had taken place in about a fifth part of the time which it has taken the reader to peruse the description  but in the rapidity of the last encounter and the mounting of my enemys horse i had committed a very absurd oversighti was scampering away without my sword  what was i to doto scamper on to be sure and trust to the legs of my horse for safety  the lancer behind me gained on me every moment and i could hear his horrid laugh as he neared me  i leaned forward jockeyfashion in my saddle and kicked and urged and flogged with my hand but all in vain  closercloserthe point of his lance was within two feet of my back  ah ah he delivered the point and fancy my agony when i felt it enterthrough exactly fiftynine pages of the new monthly magazine  had it not been for that magazine i should have been impaled without a shadow of a doubt  was i wrong in feeling gratitude  had i not cause to continue my contributions to that periodical  when i got safe into morella along with the tail of the sallying party i was for the first time made acquainted with the ridiculous result of the lancers thrust as he delivered his lance i must tell you that a ball came whizz over my head from our fellows and entering at his nose put a stop to his lancing for the future  i hastened to cabreras quarter and related to him some of my adventures during the day  but general said he you are standing  i beg you chiudete luscio take a chair  i did so and then for the first time was aware that there was some foreign substance in the tail of my coat which prevented my sitting at ease  i drew out the magazine which i had seized and there to my wonder discovered the christino lance twisted up like a fishhook or a pastoral crook  ha ha ha said cabrera who is a notorious wag  valdepenas madrilenos growled out tristany  by my cachuca di caballero upon my honour as a gentleman shrieked out ros deroles convulsed with laughter i will send it to the bishop of leon for a crozier  gahagan has consecrated it giggled out ramon cabrera and so they went on with their muchacas for an hour or more  but when they heard that the means of my salvation from the lance of the scoundrelly christino had been the magazine containing my own history their laugh was changed into wonder  i read them speaking spanish more fluently than english every word of my story  but how is this said cabrera  you surely have other adventures to relate  excellent sir said i i have and that very evening as we sat over our cups of tertullia sangaree i continued my narrative in nearly the following words  i left off in the very middle of the battle of delhi which ended as everybody knows in the complete triumph of the british arms but who gained the battle  lord lake is called viscount lake of delhi and laswaree while major gahanonsense never mind him never mind the charge he executed when sabre in hand he leaped the sixfoot wall in the mouth of the roaring cannon over the heads of the gleaming pikes when with one hand seizing the sacred peishcush or fishwhich was the banner always borne before scindiahhe with his good sword cut off the trunk of the famous white elephant which shrieking with agony plunged madly into the mahratta ranks followed by his giant brethren tossing like chaff before the wind the affrighted kitmatgars  he meanwhile now plunging into the midst of a battalion of consomahs now cleaving to the chine a screaming and ferocious bobbachee 4 rushed on like the simoom across the red zaharan plain killing with his own hand a hundred and fortythrbut never mindalone he did it sufficient be it for him however that the victory was won  he cares not for the empty honours which were awarded to more fortunate men  we marched after the battle to delhi where poor blind old shah allum received us and bestowed all kinds of honours and titles on our general  as each of the officers passed before him the shah did not fail to remark my person 5 and was told my name  lord lake whispered to him my exploits and the old man was so delighted with the account of my victory over the elephant whose trunk i use to this day that he said let him be called gujputi or the lord of elephants and gujputi was the name by which i was afterwards familiarly known among the nativesthe men that is  the women had a softer appellation for me and called me mushook or charmer  well i shall not describe delhi which is doubtless well known to the reader nor the siege of agra to which place we went from delhi nor the terrible day at laswaree which went nigh to finish the war  suffice it to say that we were victorious and that i was wounded as i have invariably been in the two hundred and four occasions when i have found myself in action  one point however became in the course of this campaign quite evidentthat something must be done for gahagan  the country cried shame the kings troops grumbled the sepoys openly murmured that their gujputi was only a lieutenant when he had performed such signal services what was to be done  lord wellesley was in an evident quandary gahagan wrote he to be a subaltern is evidently not your fate you were born for command but lake and general wellesley are good officers they cannot be turned outi must make a post for you what say you my dear fellow to a corps of irregular horse  it was thus that the famous corps of ahmednuggar irregulars had its origin a guerilla force it is true but one which will long be remembered in the annals of our indian campaigns      as the commander of this regiment i was allowed to settle the uniform of the corps as well as to select recruits  these were not wanting as soon as my appointment was made known but came flocking to my standard a great deal faster than to the regular corps in the companys service  i had european officers of course to command them and a few of my countrymen as sergeants the rest were all natives whom i chose of the strongest and bravest men in india chiefly pitans afghans hurrumzadehs and calliawns  for these are well known to be the most warlike districts of our indian territory  when on parade and in full uniform we made a singular and noble appearance  i was always fond of dress and in this instance gave a carte blanche to my taste and invented the most splendid costume that ever perhaps decorated a soldier  i am as i have stated already six feet four inches in height and of matchless symmetry and proportion  my hair and beard are of the most brilliant auburn so bright as scarcely to be distinguished at a distance from scarlet  my eyes are bright blue overshadowed by bushy eyebrows of the colour of my hair and a terrific gash of the deepest purple which goes over the forehead the eyelid and the cheek and finishes at the ear gives my face a more strictly military appearance than can be conceived  when i have been drinking as is pretty often the case this gash becomes ruby bright and as i have another which took off a piece of my under lip and shows five of my front teeth i leave you to imagine that seldom lighted on the earth as the monster burke remarked of one of his unhappy victims a more extraordinary vision  i improved these natural advantages and while in cantonment during the hot winds at chittybobbary allowed my hair to grow very long as did my beard which reached to my waist  it took me two hours daily to curl my hair in ten thousand little corkscrew ringlets which waved over my shoulders and to get my moustaches well round to the corners of my eyelids  i dressed in loose scarlet trousers and red morocco boots a scarlet jacket and a shawl of the same colour round my waist a scarlet turban three feet high and decorated with a tuft of the scarlet feathers of the flamingo formed my headdress and i did not allow myself a single ornament except a small silver skull and crossbones in front of my turban  two brace of pistols a malay creese and a tulwar sharp on both sides and very nearly six feet in length completed this elegant costume  my two flags were each surmounted with a real skull and crossbones and ornamented one with a black and the other with a red beard of enormous length taken from men slain in battle by me  on one flag were of course the arms of john company on the other an image of myself bestriding a prostrate elephant with the simple word gujputi written underneath in the nagaree persian and sanscrit characters  i rode my black horse and looked by the immortal gods like mars  to me might be applied the words which were written concerning handsome general webb in marlboroughs time   to noble danger he conducts the way his great example all his troop obey before the front the major sternly rides with such an air as mars to battle strides propitious heaven must sure a hero save like paris handsome and like hector brave   my officers captains biggs and mackanulty lieutenants glogger pappendick stuffle c c were dressed exactly in the same way but in yellow and the men were similarly equipped but in black i have seen many regiments since and many ferociouslooking men but the ahmednuggar irregulars were more dreadful to the view than any set of ruffians on which i ever set eyes  i would to heaven that the czar of muscovy had passed through cabool and lahore and that i with my old ahmednuggars stood on a fair field to meet him bless you bless you my swart companions in victory through the mist of twenty years i hear the booming of your warcry and mark the glitter of your scimitars as ye rage in the thickest of the battle 6  but away with melancholy reminiscences  you may fancy what a figure the irregulars cut on a fielddaya line of five hundred blackfaced blackdressed blackhorsed blackbearded menbiggs glogger and the other officers in yellow galloping about the field like flashes of lightning myself enlightening them red solitary and majestic like yon glorious orb in heaven  there are very few men i presume who have not heard of holkars sudden and gallant incursion into the dooab in the year 1804 when we thought that the victory of laswaree and the brilliant success at deeg had completely finished him  taking ten thousand horse he broke up his camp at palimbang and the first thing general lake heard of him was that he was at putna then at rumpooge then at doncaradamhe was in fact in the very heart of our territory  the unfortunate part of the affair was this his excellency despising the mahratta chieftain had allowed him to advance about two thousand miles in his front and knew not in the slightest degree where to lay hold on him  was he at hazarubaug was he at bogly gunge nobody knew and for a considerable period the movements of lakes cavalry were quite ambiguous uncertain promiscuous and undetermined  such briefly was the state of affairs in october 1804  at the beginning of that month i had been wounded a trifling scratch cutting off my left upper eyelid a bit of my cheek and my under lip and i was obliged to leave biggs in command of my irregulars whilst i retired for my wounds to an english station at furruckabad alias futtyghurit is as every twopenny postman knows at the apex of the dooab  we have there a cantonment and thither i went for the mere sake of the surgeon and the sticking plaster  furruckabad then is divided into two districts or towns  the lower cotwal inhabited by the natives and the upper which is fortified slightly and has all along been called futtyghur meaning in hindustanee thefavouriteresortofthewhitefaced feringheesnearthemangotopeconsecratedtoram occupied by europeans  it is astonishing by the way how comprehensive that language is and how much can be conveyed in one or two of the commonest phrases  biggs then and my men were playing all sorts of wondrous pranks with lord lakes army whilst i was detained an unwilling prisoner of health at futtyghur  an unwilling prisoner however i should not say  the cantonment at futtyghur contained that which would have made any man a happy slave  woman lovely woman was there in abundance and variety the fact is that when the campaign commenced in 1803 the ladies of the army all congregated to this place where they were left as it was supposed in safety  i might like homer relate the names and qualities of all  i may at least mention some whose memory is still most dear to me  there was   mrs majorgeneral bulcher wife of bulcher of the infantry  miss bulcher  miss belinda bulcher whose name i beg the printer to place in large capitals  mrs colonel vandegobbleschroy  mrs major macan and the four misses macan  the honourable mrs burgoo mrs flix hicks wicks and many more too numerous to mention  the flower of our camp was however collected there and the last words of lord lake to me as i left him were gahagan i commit those women to your charge  guard them with your life watch over them with your honour defend them with the matchless power of your indomitable arm  futtyghur is as i have said a european station and the pretty air of the bungalows amid the clustering topes of mangotrees has often ere this excited the admiration of the tourist and sketcher on the brow of a hillthe burrumpooter river rolls majestically at its base and no spot in a word can be conceived more exquisitely arranged both by art and nature as a favourite residence of the british fair  mrs bulcher mrs vandegobbleschroy and the other married ladies above mentioned had each of them delightful bungalows and gardens in the place and between one cottage and another my time passed as delightfully as can the hours of any man who is away from his darling occupation of war  i was the commandant of the fort  it is a little insignificant pettah defended simply by a couple of gabions a very ordinary counterscarp and a bombproof embrasure  on the top of this my flag was planted and the small garrison of forty men only were comfortably barracked off in the casemates within  a surgeon and two chaplains there were besides three reverend gentlemen of amateur missions who lived in the town completed as i may say the garrison of our little fortalice which i was left to defend and to command  on the night of the first of november in the year 1804 i had invited mrs majorgeneral bulcher and her daughters mrs vandegobbleschroy and indeed all the ladies in the cantonment to a little festival in honour of the recovery of my health of the commencement of the shooting season and indeed as a farewell visit for it was my intention to take dawk the very next morning and return to my regiment  the three amateur missionaries whom i have mentioned and some ladies in the cantonment of very rigid religious principles refused to appear at my little party  they had better never have been born than have done as they did  as you shall hear  we had been dancing merrily all night and the supper chiefly of the delicate condor the luscious adjutant and other birds of a similar kind which i had shot in the course of the day had been duly feted by every lady and gentleman present when i took an opportunity to retire on the ramparts with the interesting and lovely belinda bulcher  i was occupied as the french say in contering fleurettes to this sweet young creature when all of a sudden a rocket was seen whizzing through the air and a strong light was visible in the valley below the little fort  what fireworks  captain gahagan said belinda this is too gallant  indeed my dear miss bulcher said i they are fireworks of which i have no idea  perhaps our friends the missionaries  look look said belinda trembling and clutching tightly hold of my arm  what do i see yesnoyes it isour bungalow is in flames  it was true the spacious bungalow occupied by mrs majorgeneral was at that moment seen a prey to the devouring elementanother and another succeeded itseven bungalows before i could almost ejaculate the name of jack robinson were seen blazing brightly in the black midnight air  i seized my nightglass and looking towards the spot where the conflagration raged what was my astonishment to see thousands of black forms dancing round the fires whilst by their lights i could observe columns after columns of indian horse arriving and taking up their ground in the very middle of the open square or tank round which the bungalows were built  ho warder shouted i while the frightened and trembling belinda clung closer to my side and pressed the stalwart arm that encircled her waist down with the drawbridge see that your masolgees small tumbrels which are used in place of large artillery be well loaded  you sepoys hasten and man the ravelin you choprasees put out the lights in the embrasures we shall have warm work of it tonight or my name is not goliah gahagan  the ladies the guests to the number of eightythree the sepoys choprasees masolgees and so on had all crowded on the platform at the sound of my shouting and dreadful was the consternation shrill the screaming occasioned by my words  the men stood irresolute and mute with terror the women trembling knew scarcely whither to fly for refuge  who are yonder ruffians said i  a hundred voices yelped in replysome said the pindarees some said the mahrattas some vowed it was scindiah and others declared it was holkarno one knew  is there any one here said i who will venture to reconnoitre yonder troops  there was a dead pause  a thousand tomauns to the man who will bring me news of yonder army again i repeated  still a dead silence  the fact was that scindiah and holkar both were so notorious for their cruelty that no one dared venture to face the danger  oh for fifty of my brave ahmednuggarees thought i  gentlemen said i i see ityou are cowardsnone of you dare encounter the chance even of death  it is an encouraging prospect know you not that the ruffian holkar if it be he will with to morrows dawn beleaguer our little fort and throw thousands of men against our walls know you not that if we are taken there is no quarter no hope death for usand worse than death for these lovely ones assembled here  here the ladies shrieked and raised a howl as i have heard the jackals on a summers evening  belinda my dear belinda flung both her arms round me and sobbed on my shoulder or in my waistcoatpocket rather for the little witch could reach no higher  captain gahagan sobbed she gogogoggleiah  my souls adored replied i  swear to me one thing  i swear  that ifthat ifthe nasty horrid odious black mahraaa attahs take the fort you will put me out of their power  i clasped the dear girl to my heart and swore upon my sword that rather than she should incur the risk of dishonour she should perish by my own hand  this comforted her and her mother mrs majorgeneral bulcher and her elder sister who had not until now known a word of our attachment indeed but for these extraordinary circumstances it is probable that we ourselves should never have discovered it were under these painful circumstances made aware of my beloved belindas partiality for me having communicated thus her wish of selfdestruction i thought her example a touching and excellent one and proposed to all the ladies that they should follow it and that at the entry of the enemy into the fort and at a signal given by me they should one and all make away with themselves  fancy my disgust when after making this proposition not one of the ladies chose to accede to it and received it with the same chilling denial that my former proposal to the garrison had met with  in the midst of this hurry and confusion as if purposely to add to it a trumpet was heard at the gate of the fort and one of the sentinels came running to me saying that a mahratta soldier was before the gate with a flag of truce  i went down rightly conjecturing as it turned out that the party whoever they might be had no artillery and received at the point of my sword a scroll of which the following is a translation   to goliah gahagan gujputi  lord of elephants siri have the honour to inform you that i arrived before this place at eight oclock pm with ten thousand cavalry under my orders  i have burned since my arrival seventeen bungalows in furruckabad and futtyghur and have likewise been under the painful necessity of putting to death three clergymen mollahs and seven english officers whom i found in the village the women have been transferred to safe keeping in the harems of my officers and myself  as i know your courage and talents i shall be very happy if you will surrender the fortress and take service as a majorgeneral hookahbadar in my army  should my proposal not meet with your assent i beg leave to state that tomorrow i shall storm the fort and on taking it shall put to death every male in the garrison and every female above twenty years of age  for yourself i shall reserve a punishment which for novelty and exquisite torture has i flatter myself hardly ever been exceeded  awaiting the favour of a reply i am sir  your very obedient servant  jeswunt row holkar camp before futtyghur  september 1 1804 r s v p   the officer who had brought this precious epistle it is astonishing how holkar had aped the forms of english correspondence an enormous pitan soldier with a shirt of mail and a steel cap and cape round which his turban wound was leaning against the gate on his matchlock and whistling a national melody i read the letter and saw at once there was no time to be lost that man thought i must never go back to holkar  were he to attack us now before we were prepared the fort would be his in halfanhour  tying my white pockethandkerchief to a stick i flung open the gate and advanced to the officer  he was standing i said on the little bridge across the moat  i made him a low salaam after the fashion of the country and as he bent forward to return the compliment i am sorry to say i plunged forward gave him a violent blow on the head which deprived him of all sensation and then dragged him within the wall raising the drawbridge after me  i bore the body into my own apartment there swift as thought i stripped him of his turban cammerbund peijammahs and papooshes and putting them on myself determined to go forth and reconnoitre the enemy      here i was obliged to stop for cabrera ros deroles and the rest of the staff were sound asleep  what i did in my reconnaissance and how i defended the fort of futtyghur i shall have the honour of telling on another occasion    chapter iv  the indian campthe sortie from the fort    headquarters morella  october 3 1838  it is a balmy night  i hear the merry jingle of the tambourine and the cheery voices of the girls and peasants as they dance beneath my casement under the shadow of the clustering vines  the laugh and song pass gaily round and even at this distance i can distinguish the elegant form of ramon cabrera as he whispers gay nothings in the ears of the andalusian girls or joins in the thrilling chorus of riegos hymn which is ever and anon vociferated by the enthusiastic soldiery of carlos quinto  i am alone in the most inaccessible and most bombproof tower of our little fortalice the large casements are openthe wind as it enters whispers in my ear its odorous recollections of the orange grove and the myrtle bower  my torch a branch of the fragrant cedartree flares and flickers in the midnight breeze and disperses its scent and burning splinters on my scroll and the desk where i writemeet implements for a soldiers authorshipit is cartridge paper over which my pen runs so glibly and a yawning barrel of gunpowder forms my rough writingtable  around me below me above me allall is peace  i think as i sit here so lonely on my country england and muse over the sweet and bitter recollections of my early days  let me resume my narrative at the point where interrupted by the authoritative summons of war i paused on the last occasion  i left off i thinkfor i am a thousand miles away from proof sheets as i write and were i not writing the simple truth must contradict myself a thousand times in the course of my talei think i say that i left off at that period of my story when holkar being before futtyghur and i in command of that fortress i had just been compelled to make away with his messenger  and dressed in the fallen indians accoutrements went forth to reconnoitre the force and if possible to learn the intentions of the enemy  however much my figure might have resembled that of the pitan and disguised in his armour might have deceived the lynx eyed mahrattas into whose camp i was about to plunge it was evident that a single glance at my fair face and auburn beard would have undeceived the dullest blockhead in holkars army  seizing then a bottle of burgesss walnut catsup i dyed my face and my hands and with the simple aid of a flask of warrens jet i made my hair and beard as black as ebony  the indians helmet and chain hood covered likewise a great part of my face and i hoped thus with luck impudence and a complete command of all the eastern dialects and languages from burmah to afghanistan to pass scot free through this somewhat dangerous ordeal  i had not the word of the night it is truebut i trusted to good fortune for that and passed boldly out of the fortress bearing the flag of truce as before i had scarcely passed on a couple of hundred yards when lo a party of indian horsemen armed like him i had just overcome trotted towards me  one was leading a noble white charger and no sooner did he see me than dismounting from his own horse and giving the rein to a companion he advanced to meet me with the charger a second fellow likewise dismounted and followed the first  one held the bridle of the horse while the other with a multitude of salaams aleikums and other genuflexions held the jewelled stirrup and kneeling waited until i should mount  i took the hint at once  the indian who had come up to the fort was a great manthat was evident i walked on with a majestic air gathered up the velvet reins and sprung into the magnificent high peaked saddle  buk buk said i  it is good  in the name of the fortynine imaums let us ride on  and the whole party set off at a brisk trot i keeping silence and thinking with no little trepidation of what i was about to encounter  as we rode along i heard two of the men commenting upon my unusual silence for i suppose ithat is the indianwas a talkative officer  the lips of the bahawder are closed said one  where are those birds of paradise his longtailed words they are imprisoned between the golden bars of his teeth  kush said his companion be quiet  bobbachy bahawder has seen the dreadful feringhee gahagan khan gujputi the elephantlord whose sword reaps the harvest of death there is but one champion who can wear the papooshes of the elephantslayerit is bobbachy bahawder  you speak truly puneeree muckun the bahawder ruminates on the words of the unbeliever  he is an ostrich and hatches the eggs of his thoughts  bekhusm on my nose be it  may the young birds his actions be strong and swift in flight  may they digest iron said puneeree muckun who was evidently a wag in his way  oho thought i as suddenly the light flashed upon me  it was then the famous bobbachy bahawder whom i overcame just now and he is the man destined to stand in my slippers is he and i was at that very moment standing in his own  such are the chances and changes that fall to the lot of the soldier  i suppose everybodyeverybody who has been in india at leasthas heard the name of bobbachy bahawder  it is derived from the two hindustanee wordsbobbachy general bahawder artilleryman  he had entered into holkars service in the latter capacity and had by his merit and his undaunted bravery in action attained the dignity of the peacocks feather which is only granted to noblemen of the first class he was married moreover to one of holkars innumerable daughters a match which according to the chronique scandaleuse brought more of honour than of pleasure to the poor bobbachy  gallant as he was in the field it was said that in the harem he was the veriest craven alive completely subjugated by his ugly and odious wife  in all matters of importance the late bahawder had been consulted by his prince who had as it appears knowing my character and not caring to do anything rash in his attack upon so formidable an enemy sent forward the unfortunate pitan to reconnoitre the fort he was to have done yet more as i learned from the attendant puneeree muckun who was i soon found out an old favourite with the bobbachydoubtless on account of his honesty and love of repartee  the bahawders lips are closed said he at last trotting up to me has he not a word for old puneeree muckun  bismillah mashallah barikallah said i which means my good friend what i have seen is not worth the trouble of relation and fills my bosom with the darkest forebodings  you could not then see the gujputi alone and stab him with your dagger  here was a pretty conspiracy  no i saw him but not alone his people were always with him  hurrumzadeh it is a pity we waited but the sound of your jogree whistle and straightway would have galloped up and seized upon every man woman and child in the fort  however there are but a dozen men in the garrison and they have not provision for two daysthey must yield and then hurrah for the moonfaces mashallah  i am told the soldiers who first get in are to have their pick  how my old woman rotee muckun will be surprised when i bring home a couple of feringhee wivesha ha  fool said i be stilltwelve men in the garrison there are twelve hundred  gahagan himself is as good as a thousand men and as for food i saw with my own eyes five hundred bullocks grazing in the courtyard as i entered  this was a bouncer i confess but my object was to deceive puneeree muckun and give him as high a notion as possible of the capabilities of defence which the besieged had  pooch pooch murmured the men it is a wonder of a fortress we shall never be able to take it until our guns come up  there was hope then they had no batteringtrain  ere this arrived i trusted that lord lake would hear of our plight and march down to rescue us  thus occupied in thought and conversation we rode on until the advanced sentinel challenged us when old puneeree gave the word and we passed on into the centre of holkars camp  it was a strangea stirring sight  the campfires were lighted and round themeating reposing talking looking at the merry steps of the dancinggirls or listening to the stories of some dhol baut or indian improvisatorewere thousands of dusky soldiery  the camels and horses were picketed under the banyan trees on which the ripe mango fruit was growing and offered them an excellent food  towards the spot which the golden fish and royal purdahs floating in the wind designated as the tent of holkar led an immense avenueof elephants the finest street indeed i ever saw  each of the monstrous animals had a castle on its back armed with mauritanian archers and the celebrated persian matchlockmen  it was the feeding time of these royal brutes and the grooms were observed bringing immense toffungs or baskets filled with pineapples plantains bananas indian corn and cocoanuts which grow luxuriantly at all seasons of the year  we passed down this extraordinary avenueno less than three hundred and eightyeight tails did i count on each sideeach tail appertaining to an elephant twentyfive feet higheach elephant having a twostoried castle on its backeach castle containing sleeping and eating rooms for the twelve men that formed its garrison and were keeping watch on the roofeach roof bearing a flagstaff twenty feet long on its top the crescent glittering with a thousand gems and round it the imperial standardeach standard of silk velvet and clothofgold bearing the wellknown device of holkar argent an or gules between a sinople of the first a chevron truncated wavy  i took nine of these myself in the course of a very short time after and shall be happy when i come to england to show them to any gentleman who has a curiosity that way  through this gorgeous scene our little cavalcade passed and at last we arrived at the quarters occupied by holkar  that celebrated chieftains tents and followers were gathered round one of the british bungalows which had escaped the flames and which he occupied during the siege  when i entered the large room where he sat i found him in the midst of a council of war his chief generals and viziers seated round him each smoking his hookah as is the common way with these black fellows before at and after breakfast dinner supper and bedtime  there was such a cloud raised by their smoke you could hardly see a yard before you another piece of goodluck for meas it diminished the chances of my detection  when with the ordinary ceremonies the kitmatgars and consomahs had explained to the prince that bobbachy bahawder the right eye of the sun of the universe as the ignorant heathens called me had arrived from his mission holkar immediately summoned me to the maidaun or elevated platform on which he was seated in a luxurious easychair and i instantly taking off my slippers falling on my knees and beating my head against the ground ninetynine times proceeded still on my knees a hundred and twenty feet through the room and then up the twenty steps which led to his maidauna silly painful and disgusting ceremony which can only be considered as a relic of barbarian darkness which tears the knees and shins to pieces let alone the pantaloons  i recommend anybody who goes to india with the prospect of entering the service of the native rajahs to recollect my advice and have them well wadded  well the right eye of the sun of the universe scrambled as well as he could up the steps of the maidaun on which in rows smoking as i have said the musnuds or general officers were seated and i arrived within speaking distance of holkar who instantly asked me the success of my mission  the impetuous old man thereon poured out a multitude of questions  how many men are there in the fort said he how many women  is it victualled have they ammunition  did you see gahagan sahib the commander did you kill him  all these questions jeswunt row holkar puffed out with so many whiffs of tobacco  taking a chillum myself and raising about me such a cloud that upon my honour as a gentleman no man at three yards distance could perceive anything of me except the pillar of smoke in which i was encompassed i told holkar in oriental language of course the best tale i could with regard to the fort  sir said i to answer your last question firstthat dreadful gujputi i have seenand he is alive  he is eight feet nearly in height he can eat a bullock daily of which he has seven hundred at present in the compound and swears that during the siege he will content himself with only three a week  he has lost in battle his left eye and what is the consequence  o ram gunge o thouwiththeeyeasbrightasmorning andwithbeardasblackas night goliah gujputinever sleeps  ah you ghorumsaug you thief of the world said the prince vizier saadut alee beg bimbukcheeits joking you areand there was a universal buzz through the room at the announcement of this bouncer  by the hundred and eleven incarnations of vishnu said i solemnly an oath which no indian was ever known to break i swear that so it is  so at least he told me and i have good cause to know his power  gujputi is an enchanter  he is leagued with devils he is invulnerable  look said i unsheathing my dagger and every eye turned instantly towards methrice did i stab him with this steelin the back oncetwice right through the heart but he only laughed me to scorn and bade me tell holkar that the steel was not yet forged which was to inflict an injury upon him  i never saw a man in such a rage as holkar was when i gave him this somewhat imprudent message  ah lilylivered rogue shouted he out to me milkblooded unbeliever palefaced miscreant lives he after insulting thy master in thy presence  in the name of the prophet i spit on thee defy thee abhor thee degrade thee  take that thou liar of the universe and thatand thatand that  such are the frightful excesses of barbaric minds every time this old man said take that he flung some article near him at the head of the undaunted gahaganhis dagger his sword his carbine his richly ornamented pistols his turban covered with jewels worth a hundred thousand crores of rupeesfinally his hookah snake mouthpiece silverbell chillum and allwhich went hissing over my head and flattening into a jelly the nose of the grand vizier  yock muzzee my nose is off said the old man mildly  will you have my life o holkar it is thine likewise and no other word of complaint escaped his lips  of all these missiles though a pistol and carbine had gone off as the ferocious indian flung them at my head and the naked scimitar fiercely but unadroitly thrown had lopped off the limbs of one or two of the musnuds as they sat trembling on their omrahs yet strange to say not a single weapon had hurt me  when the hubbub ceased and the unlucky wretches who had been the victims of this fit of rage had been removed holkars goodhumour somewhat returned and he allowed me to continue my account of the fort which i did not taking the slightest notice of his burst of impatience  as indeed it would have been the height of impoliteness to have done for such accidents happened many times in the day  it is well that the bobbachy has returned snuffled out the poor grand vizier after i had explained to the council the extraordinary means of defence possessed by the garrison  your star is bright o bahawder for this very night we had resolved upon an escalade of the fort and we had sworn to put every one of the infidel garrison to the edge of the sword  but you have no battering train said i  bah we have a couple of ninetysix pounders quite sufficient to blow the gates open and then hey for a charge said loll mahommed a general of cavalry who was a rival of bobbachys and contradicted therefore every word i said  in the name of juggernaut why wait for the heavy artillery  have we not swords have we not hearts  mashallah  let cravens stay with bobbachy all true men will follow loll mahommed  allahhumdillah bismillah barikallah 7 and drawing his scimitar he waved it over his head and shouted out his cry of battle  it was repeated by many of the other omrahs the sound of their cheers was carried into the camp and caught up by the men the camels began to cry the horses to prance and neigh the eight hundred elephants set up a scream the trumpeters and drummers clanged away at their instruments  i never heard such a din before or after  how i trembled for my little garrison when i heard the enthusiastic cries of this innumerable host  there was but one way for it  sir said i addressing holkar go out tonight and you go to certain death  loll mahommed has not seen the fort as i have  pass the gate if you please and for what to fall before the fire of a hundred pieces of artillery to storm another gate and then another and then to be blown up with gahagans garrison in the citadel  who talks of courage  were i not in your august presence o star of the faithful i would crop loll mahommeds nose from his face and wear his ears as an ornament in my own pugree  who is there here that knows not the difference between yonder yellowskinned coward and gahagan khan guji mean bobbachy bahawder  i am ready to fight one two three or twenty of them at broadsword smallsword single stick with fists if you please  by the holy piper fighting is like mate and dthrink to gato bobbachy i manewhoop come on you divvle and ill bate the skin off your ugly bones  this speech had very nearly proved fatal to me for when i am agitated i involuntarily adopt some of the phraseology peculiar to my own country which is so uneastern that had there been any suspicion as to my real character detection must indubitably have ensued  as it was holkar perceived nothing but instantaneously stopped the dispute  loll mahommed however evidently suspected something for as holkar with a voice of thunder shouted out tomasha silence loll sprang forward and gasped out   my lord my lord this is not bob  but he could say no more  gag the slave screamed out holkar stamping with fury and a turban was instantly twisted round the poor devils jaws  ho furoshes carry out loll mahommed khan give him a hundred dozen on the soles of his feet set him upon a white donkey and carry him round the camp with an inscription before him  this is the way that holkar rewards the talkative  i breathed again and ever as i heard each whack of the bamboo falling on loll mahommeds feet i felt peace returning to my mind and thanked my stars that i was delivered of this danger  vizier said holkar who enjoyed lolls roars amazingly i owe you a reparation for your nose  kiss the hand of your prince o saadut alee beg bimbukchee be from this day forth zoheir u dowlut  the good old mans eyes filled with tears  i can bear thy severity o prince said he i cannot bear thy love  was it not an honour that your highness did me just now when you condescended to pass over the bridge of your slaves nose  the phrase was by all voices pronounced to be very poetical  the vizier retired crowned with his new honours to bed  holkar was in high goodhumour  bobbachy said he thou too must pardon me  a propos i have news for thee  your wife the incomparable puttee rooge white and red rose has arrived in camp  my wife my lord said i aghast  our daughter the light of thine eyes  go my son i see thou art wild with joy  the princesss tents are set up close by mine and i know thou longest to join her  my wife  here was a complication truly    chapter v  the issue of my interview with my wife    i found puneeree muckun with the rest of my attendants waiting at the gate and they immediately conducted me to my own tents in the neighbourhood  i have been in many dangerous predicaments before that time and since but i dont care to deny that i felt in the present instance such a throbbing of the heart as i never have experienced when leading a forlorn hope or marching up to a battery  as soon as i entered the tents a host of menials sprang forward some to ease me of my armour some to offer me refreshments some with hookahs attar of roses in great quart bottles and the thousand delicacies of eastern life  i motioned them away  i will wear my armour said i i shall go forth tonight  carry my duty to the princess and say i grieve that tonight i have not the time to see her  spread me a couch here and bring me supper here a jar of persian wine well cooled a lamb stuffed with pistachio nuts a pillaw of a couple of turkeys a curried kidanything begone  give me a pipe leave me alone and tell me when the meal is ready  i thought by these means to put off the fair puttee rooge and hoped to be able to escape without subjecting myself to the examination of her curious eyes  after smoking for a while an attendant came to tell me that my supper was prepared in the inner apartment of the tent i suppose that the reader if he be possessed of the commonest intelligence knows that the tents of the indian grandees are made of the finest cashmere shawls and contain a dozen rooms at least with carpets chimneys and sash windows complete  i entered i say into an inner chamber and there began with my fingers to devour my meal in the oriental fashion taking every now and then a pull from the winejar which was cooling deliciously in another jar of snow  i was just in the act of despatching the last morsel of a most savoury stewed lamb and rice which had formed my meal when i heard a scuffle of feet a shrill clatter of female voices and the curtain being flung open in marched a lady accompanied by twelve slaves with moon faces and slim waists lovely as the houris in paradise  the lady herself to do her justice was as great a contrast to her attendants as could possibly be  she was crooked old of the complexion of molasses and rendered a thousand times more ugly by the tawdry dress and the blazing jewels with which she was covered a line of yellow chalk drawn from her forehead to the tip of her nose which was further ornamented by an immense glittering nose ring her eyelids painted bright red and a large dab of the same colour on her chin showed she was not of the mussulman but the brahmin faithand of a very high caste  you could see that by her eyes  my mind was instantaneously made up as to my line of action  the male attendants had of course quitted the apartment as they heard the wellknown sound of her voice  it would have been death to them to have remained and looked in her face  the females ranged themselves round their mistress as she squatted down opposite to me  and is this said she a welcome o khan after six months absence for the most unfortunate and loving wife in all the world is this lamb o glutton half so tender as thy spouse  is this wine o sot half so sweet as her looks  i saw the storm was brewingher slaves to whom she turned kept up a kind of chorus  oh the faithless one cried they  oh the rascal the false one who has no eye for beauty and no heart for love like the khanums  a lamb is not so sweet as love said i gravely but a lamb has a good temper  a winecup is not so intoxicating as a womanbut a winecup has no tongue o khanum gee and again i dipped my nose in the soulrefreshing jar  the sweet puttee rooge was not however to be put off by my repartees she and her maidens recommenced their chorus and chattered and stormed until i lost all patience  retire friends said i and leave me in peace  stir on your peril cried the khanum  so seeing there was no help for it but violence i drew out my pistols cocked them and said o houris these pistols contain each two balls  the daughter of holkar bears a sacred life for me but for youby all the saints of hindustan four of ye shall die if ye stay a moment longer in my presence  this was enough the ladies gave a shriek and skurried out of the apartment like a covey of partridges on the wing  now then was the time for action  my wife or rather bobbachys wife sat still a little flurried by the unusual ferocity which her lord had displayed in her presence  i seized her hand and gripping it close whispered in her ear to which i put the other pistol o khanum listen and scream not the moment you scream you die  she was completely beaten  she turned as pale as a woman could in her situation and said speak bobbachy bahawder i am dumb  woman said i taking off my helmet and removing the chain cape which had covered almost the whole of my facei am not thy husbandi am the slayer of elephants the worldrenowned gahagan  as i said this and as the long ringlets of red hair fell over my shoulders contrasting strangely with my dyed face and beard i formed one of the finest pictures that can possibly be conceived and i recommend it as a subject to mr heath for the next book of beauty  wretch said she what wouldst thou  you blackfaced fiend said i raise but your voice and you are dead  and afterwards said she do you suppose that you can escape the torments of hell are not so terrible as the tortures that holkar will invent for thee  tortures madam answered i coolly  fiddlesticks  you will neither betray me nor will i be put to the torture  on the contrary you will give me your best jewels and facilitate my escape to the fort  dont grind your teeth and swear at me listen madam  you know this dress and these armsthey are the arms of your husband bobbachy bahawdermy prisoner  he now lies in yonder fort and if i do not return before daylight at sunrise he dies  and then when they send his corpse back to holkar what will you his widow do  oh said she shuddering spare me spare me  ill tell you what you will do  you will have the pleasure of dying along with himof being roasted madam  an agonising death from which your father cannot save you to which he will be the first man to condemn and conduct you  ha  i see we understand each other and you will give me over the cashbox and jewels and so saying i threw myself back with the calmest air imaginable flinging the pistols over to her  light me a pipe my love said i and then go and hand me over the dollars  do you hear  you see i had her in my powerup a tree as the americans say and she very humbly lighted my pipe for me and then departed for the goods i spoke about  what a thing is luck  if loll mahommed had not been made to take that ride round the camp i should infallibly have been lost  my supper my quarrel with the princess and my pipe afterwards had occupied a couple of hours of my time  the princess returned from her quest and brought with her the box containing valuables to the amount of about three millions sterling  i was cheated of them afterwards but have the box still a plain deal one  i was just about to take my departure when a tremendous knocking shouting and screaming was heard at the entrance of the tent  it was holkar himself accompanied by that cursed loll mahommed who after his punishment found his master restored to goodhumour and had communicated to him his firm conviction that i was an impostor  ho begum shouted he in the anteroom for he and his people could not enter the womens apartments speak o my daughter is your husband returned  speak madam said i or remember the roasting  he is papa said the begum  are you sure  ho ho ho the old ruffian was laughing outsideare you sure it isha ahaheee  indeed it is he and no other  i pray you father to go and to pass no more such shameless jests on your daughter  have i ever seen the face of any other man  and hereat she began to weep as if her heart would breakthe deceitful minx  holkars laugh was instantly turned to fury  oh you liar and eternal thief said he turning round as i presume for i could only hear to loll mahommed to make your prince eat such monstrous dirt as this  furoshes seize this man  i dismiss him from my service i degrade him from his rank i appropriate to myself all his property  and hark ye furoshes give him a hundred dozen more  again i heard the whacks of the bamboos and peace flowed into my soul      just as morn began to break two figures were seen to approach the little fortress of futtyghur  one was a woman wrapped closely in a veil the other a warrior remarkable for the size and manly beauty of his form who carried in his hand a deal box of considerable size  the warrior at the gate gave the word and was admitted the woman returned slowly to the indian camp  her name was puttee rooge his was   g og g mheics ciha    chapter vi  famine in the garrison    thus my dangers for the night being overcome i hastened with my precious box into my own apartment which communicated with another where i had left my prisoner with a guard to report if he should recover and to prevent his escape  my servant ghorumsaug was one of the guard  i called him and the fellow came looking very much confused and frightened as it seemed at my appearance  why ghorumsaug said i what makes thee look so pale fellow he was as white as a sheet  it is thy master dost thou not remember him  the man had seen me dress myself in the pitans clothes but was not present when i had blacked my face and beard in the manner i have described  o bramah vishnu and mahomet cried the faithful fellow and do i see my dear master disguised in this way  for heavens sake let me rid you of this odious black paint for what will the ladies say in the ballroom if the beautiful feringhee should appear amongst them with his roses turned into coal  i am still one of the finest men in europe and at the time of which i write when only twoandtwenty i confess i was a little vain of my personal appearance and not very willing to appear before my dear belinda disguised like a blackamoor  i allowed ghorumsaug to divest me of the heathenish armour and habiliments which i wore and having with a world of scrubbing and trouble divested my face and beard of their black tinge i put on my own becoming uniform and hastened to wait on the ladies hastened i sayalthough delayed would have been the better word for the operation of bleaching lasted at least two hours  how is the prisoner ghorumsaug said i before leaving my apartment  he has recovered from the blow which the lion dealt him two men and myself watch over him and macgillicuddy sahib the second in command has just been the rounds and has seen that all was secure  i bade ghorumsaug help me to put away my chest of treasure my exultation in taking it was so great that i could not help informing him of its contents and this done i despatched him to his post near the prisoner while i prepared to sally forth and pay my respects to the fair creatures under my protection  what good after all have i done thought i to myself in this expedition which i had so rashly undertaken  i had seen the renowned holkar i had been in the heart of his camp i knew the disposition of his troops that there were eleven thousand of them and that he only waited for his guns to make a regular attack on the fort  i had seen puttee rooge i had robbed her i say robbed her and i dont care what the reader or any other man may think of the act of a deal box containing jewels to the amount of three millions sterling the property of herself and husband  three millions in money and jewels  and what the deuce were money and jewels to me or to my poor garrison  could my adorable miss bulcher eat a fricassee of diamonds or cleopatralike melt down pearls to her tea  could i careless as i am about food with a stomach that would digest anythingonce in spain i ate the leg of a horse during a famine and was so eager to swallow this morsel that i bolted the shoe as well as the hoof and never felt the slightest inconvenience from eithercould i i say expect to live long and well upon a ragout of rupees or a dish of stewed emeralds and rubies  with all the wealth of croesus before me i felt melancholy and would have paid cheerfully its weight in carats for a good honest round of boiled beef  wealth wealth what art thou  what is goldsoft metal  what are diamonds shining tinsel  the great wealthwinners the only fameachievers the sole objects worthy of a soldiers consideration are beefsteaks gunpowder and cold iron  the two latter means of competency we possessed i had in my own apartments a small store of gunpowder keeping it under my own bed with a candle burning for fear of accidents i had 14 pieces of artillery 4 long 48s and 4 carronades 5 howitzers and a long brass mortar for grape which i had taken myself at the battle of assaye and muskets for ten times my force  my garrison as i have told the reader in a previous number consisted of 40 men two chaplains and a surgeon add to these my guests 83 in number of whom nine only were gentlemen in tights powder pigtails and silk stockings who had come out merely for a dance and found themselves in for a siege  such were our numbers   troops and artillerymen        40 ladies                         74 other noncombatants           11 majorgeneral oggahagan   1000                             1125   i count myself good for a thousand for so i was regularly rated in the army  with this great benefit to it that i only consumed as much as an ordinary mortal  we were then as far as the victuals went 126 mouths as combatants we numbered 1040 gallant men with 12 guns and a fort against holkar and his 12000  no such alarming odds if   ifay there was the rubif we had shot as well as powder for our guns if we had not only men but meat  of the former commodity we had only three rounds for each piece  of the latter upon my sacred honour to feed 126 souls we had but   two drumsticks of fowls and a bone of ham fourteen bottles of gingerbeer of sodawater four ditto two bottles of fine spanish olives raspberry creamthe remainder of two dishes seven macaroons lying in the puddle of a demolished trifle half a drum of best turkey figs some bits of broken bread two dutch cheeses whole the crust of an old stilton and about an ounce of almonds and raisins three hamsandwiches and a pot of currantjelly and 197 bottles of brandy rum madeira pale ale my private stock a couple of hard eggs for a salad and a flask of florence oil   this was the provision for the whole garrison  the men after supper had seized upon the relics of the repast as they were carried off from the table and these were the miserable remnants i found and counted on my return taking good care to lock the door of the supperroom and treasure what little sustenance still remained in it  when i appeared in the saloon now lighted up by the morning sun i not only caused a sensation myself but felt one in my own bosom which was of the most painful description  oh my reader may you never behold such a sight as that which presented itself  eighty three men and women in balldresses the former with their lank powdered locks streaming over their faces the latter with faded flowers uncurled wigs smudged rouge blear eyes draggling feathers rumpled satinseach more desperately melancholy and hideous than the othereach except my beloved belinda bulcher whose raven ringlets never having been in curl could of course never go out of curl whose cheek pale as the lily could as it may naturally be supposed grow no paler whose neck and beauteous arms dazzling as alabaster needed no pearlpowder and therefore as i need not state did not suffer because the pearlpowder had come off  joy deft linkboy lit his lamps in each of her eyes as i entered  as if i had been her sun her spring lo blushing roses mantled in her cheek  seventythree ladies as i entered opened their fire upon me and stunned me with crossquestions regarding my adventures in the campshe as she saw me gave a faint scream the sweetest sure that ever gurgled through the throat of a woman then started upthen made as if she would sit downthen moved backwardsthen tottered forwardsthen tumbled into mypsha why recall why attempt to describe that delicious that passionate greeting of two young hearts  what was the surrounding crowd to us  what cared we for the sneers of the men the titters of the jealous women the shrill upon my word of the elder miss bulcher and the loud expostulations of belindas mamma the brave girl loved me and wept in my arms  goliah my goliah said she my brave my beautiful thou art returned and hope comes back with thee  oh who can tell the anguish of my soul during this dreadful dreadful night  other similar ejaculations of love and joy she uttered and if i had perilled life in her service if i did believe that hope of escape there was none so exquisite was the moment of our meeting that i forgot all else in this overwhelming joy      the majors description of this meeting which lasted at the very most not ten seconds occupies thirteen pages of writing  we have been compelled to dock off twelveandahalf for the whole passage though highly creditable to his feelings might possibly be tedious to the reader      as i said the ladies and gentlemen were inclined to sneer and were giggling audibly  i led the dear girl to a chair and scowling round with a tremendous fierceness which those who know me know i can sometimes put on i shouted out hark ye men and womeni am this ladys truest knighther husband i hope one day to be  i am commander too in this fortthe enemy is without it another word of mockeryanother glance of scornand by heaven i will hurl every man and woman from the battlements a prey to the ruffianly holkar  this quieted them  i am a man of my word and none of them stirred or looked disrespectfully from that moment  it was now my turn to make them look foolish  mrs vandegobbleschroy whose unfailing appetite is pretty well known to every person who has been in india cried well captain gahagan your ball has been so pleasant and the supper was despatched so long ago that myself and the ladies would be very glad of a little breakfast  and mrs van giggled as if she had made a very witty and reasonable speech  oh breakfast breakfast by all means said the rest we really are dying for a warm cup of tea  is it bohay tay or souchong tay that youd like ladies says i  nonsense you silly man any tea you like said fat mrs van  what do you say then to some prime gunpowder  of course they said it was the very thing  and do you like hot rowls or cowldmuffins or crumpetsfresh butter or salt  and you gentlemen what do you say to some ilegant divvledkidneys for yourselves and just a trifle of grilled turkeys and a couple of hundthred newlaid eggs for the ladies  pooh pooh be it as you will my dear fellow answered they all  but stop says i  o ladies o ladies  o gentlemen gentlemen that you should ever have come to the quarters of goliah gahagan and he been without  what said they in a breath  alas alas  i have not got a single stick of chocolate in the whole house  well well we can do without it  or a single pound of coffee  never mind let that pass too  mrs van and the rest were beginning to look alarmed  and about the kidneysnow i remember the black divvles outside the fort have seized upon all the sheep and how are we to have kidneys without them  here there was a slight ooo  and with regard to the milk and crame it may be remarked that the cows are likewise in pawn and not a single drop can be had for money or love  but we can beat up eggs you know in the tay which will be just as good  oh just as good  only the divvles in the luck theres not a fresh egg to be had no nor a fresh chicken continued i nor a stale one either not a tayspoonful of souchong nor a thimbleful of bohay nor the laste taste in life of butther salt or fresh nor hot rowls or cowld  in the name of heaven said mrs van growing very pale what is there then  ladies and gentlemen ill tell you what there is now shouted i theres   two drumsticks of fowls and a bone of ham fourteen bottles of gingerbeer c c c   and i went through the whole list of eatables as before ending with the hamsandwiches and the pot of jelly  law  mr gahagan said mrs colonel vandegobbleschroy give me the hamsandwichesi must manage to breakfast off them  and you should have heard the pretty todo there was at this modest proposition  of course i did not accede to itwhy should i  i was the commander of the fort and intended to keep these three very sandwiches for the use of myself and my dear belinda ladies said i there are in this fort one hundred and twenty six souls and this is all the food which is to last us during the siege  meat there is noneof drink there is a tolerable quantity and at one oclock punctually a glass of wine and one olive shall be served out to each woman  the men will receive two glasses and an olive and a figand this must be your food during the siege lord lake cannot be absent more than three days and if he bewhy still there is a chancewhy do i say a chancea certainty of escaping from the hands of these ruffians  oh name it name it dear captain gahagan screeched the whole covey at a breath  it lies answered i in the powder magazine  i will blow this fort and all it contains to atoms ere it becomes the prey of holkar  the women at this raised a squeal that might have been heard in holkars camp and fainted in different directions but my dear belinda whispered in my ear well done thou noble knight bravely said my hearts goliah  i felt i was right  i could have blown her up twenty times for the luxury of that single moment  and now ladies said i i must leave you  the two chaplains will remain with you to administer professional consolationthe other gentlemen will follow me upstairs to the ramparts where i shall find plenty of work for them    chapter vii  the escape    loth as they were these gentlemen had nothing for it but to obey and they accordingly followed me to the ramparts where i proceeded to review my men  the fort in my absence had been left in command of lieutenant macgillicuddy a countryman of my own with whom as may be seen in an early chapter of my memoirs i had an affair of honour and the prisoner bobbachy bahawder whom i had only stunned never wishing to kill him had been left in charge of that officer  three of the garrison one of them a man of the ahmednuggar irregulars my own bodyservant ghorumsaug above named were appointed to watch the captive by turns and never leave him out of their sight  the lieutenant was instructed to look to them and to their prisoner and as bobbachy was severely injured by the blow which i had given him and was moreover bound hand and foot and gagged smartly with cords i considered myself sure of his person  macgillicuddy did not make his appearance when i reviewed my little force and the three havildars were likewise absent  this did not surprise me as i had told them not to leave their prisoner but desirous to speak with the lieutenant i despatched a messenger to him and ordered him to appear immediately  the messenger came back he was looking ghastly pale  he whispered some information into my ear which instantly caused me to hasten to the apartments where i had caused bobbachy bahawder to be confined  the men had fledbobbachy had fled and in his place fancy my astonishment when i foundwith a rope cutting his naturally wide mouth almost into his earswith a dreadful sabrecut across his foreheadwith his legs tied over his head and his arms tied between his legsmy unhappy my attached friendmortimer macgillicuddy  he had been in this position for about three hoursit was the very position in which i had caused bobbachy bahawder to be placedan attitude uncomfortable it is true but one which renders escape impossible unless treason aid the prisoner  i restored the lieutenant to his natural erect position i poured halfabottle of whisky down the immensely enlarged orifice of his mouth and when he had been released he informed me of the circumstances that had taken place  fool that i was idiotupon my return to the fort to have been anxious about my personal appearance and to have spent a couple of hours in removing the artificial blackening from my beard and complexion instead of going to examine my prisonerwhen his escape would have been prevented  o foppery fopperyit was that cursed love of personal appearance which had led me to forget my duty to my general my country my monarch and my own honour  thus it was that the escape took place my own fellow of the irregulars whom i had summoned to dress me performed the operation to my satisfaction invested me with the elegant uniform of my corps and removed the pitans disguise which i had taken from the back of the prostrate bobbachy bahawder  what did the rogue do nextwhy he carried back the dress to the bobbachyhe put it once more on its right owner he and his infernal black companions who had been won over by the bobbachy with promises of enormous reward gagged macgillicuddy who was going the rounds and then marched with the indian coolly up to the outer gate and gave the word  the sentinel thinking it was myself who had first come in and was as likely to go out againindeed my rascally valet said that gahagan sahib was about to go out with him and his two companions to reconnoitreopened the gates and off they went  this accounted for the confusion of my valet when i enteredand for the scoundrels speech that the lieutenant had just been the roundshe had poor fellow and had been seized and bound in this cruel way  the three men with their liberated prisoner had just been on the point of escape when my arrival disconcerted them  i had changed the guard at the gate whom they had won over likewise and yet although they had overcome poor mac and although they were ready for the start they had positively no means for effecting their escape until i was ass enough to put means in their way  fool fool thrice besotted fool that i was to think of my own silly person when i should have been occupied solely with my public duty  from macgillicuddys incoherent accounts as he was gasping from the effects of the gag and the whisky he had taken to revive him and from my own subsequent observations i learned this sad story a sudden and painful thought struck memy precious boxi rushed back i found that boxi have it still  opening it there where i had left ingots sacks of bright tomauns kopeks and rupees strings of diamonds as big as ducks eggs rubies as red as the lips of my belinda countless strings of pearls amethysts emeralds piles upon piles of banknotesi founda piece of paper with a few lines in the sanscrit language which are thus word for word translated   epigram on disappointing a certain major  the conquering lion returnd with his prey and safe in his cavern he set it the sly little fox stole the booty away and as he escaped to the lion did say aha dont you wish you may get it   confusion  oh how my blood boiled as i read these cutting lines i stampedi sworei dont know to what insane lengths my rage might have carried me had not at this moment a soldier rushed in screaming the enemy the enemy    chapter viii  the captive    it was high time indeed that i should make my appearance  waving my sword with one hand and seizing my telescope with the other i at once frightened and examined the enemy  well they knew when they saw that flamingoplume floating in the breezethat awful figure standing in the breachthat waving warsword sparkling in the skywell i say they knew the name of the humble individual who owned the sword the plume and the figure  the ruffians were mustered in front the cavalry behind  the flags were flying the drums gongs tambourines violoncellos and other instruments of eastern music raised in the air a strange barbaric melody the officers yatabals mounted on white dromedaries were seen galloping to and fro carrying to the advancing hosts the orders of holkar  you see that two sides of the fort of futtyghur rising as it does on a rock that is almost perpendicular are defended by the burrumpooter river two hundred feet deep at this point and a thousand yards wide so that i had no fear about them attacking me in that quarter  my guns therefore with their sixandthirty miserable charges of shot were dragged round to the point at which i conceived holkar would be most likely to attack me  i was in a situation that i did not dare to fire except at such times as i could kill a hundred men by a single discharge of a cannon so the attacking party marched and marched very strongly about a mile and a half off the elephants marching without receiving the slightest damage from us until they had come to within four hundred yards of our walls the rogues knew all the secrets of our weakness through the betrayal of the dastardly ghorumsaug or they never would have ventured so near  at that distanceit was about the spot where the futtyghur hill began gradually to risethe invading force stopped the elephants drew up in a line at right angles with our wall the fools they thought they should expose themselves too much by taking a position parallel to it the cavalry halted too andafter the deuces own flourish of trumpets and banging of gongs to be suresomebody in a flamecoloured satin dress with an immense jewel blazing in his pugree that looked through my telescope like a small but very bright planet got up from the back of one of the very biggest elephants and began a speech  the elephants were as i said in a line formed with admirable precision about three hundred of them  the following little diagram will explain matters     g  e                         f   e is the line of elephants  f is the wall of the fort  g a gun in the fort  now the reader will see what i did  the elephants were standing their trunks waggling to and fro gracefully before them and i with superhuman skill and activity brought the gun g a devilish long brass gun to bear upon them  i pointed it myself bang it went and what was the consequence why this    x    g  e                         f  f is the fort as before  g is the gun as before  e the elephants as we have previously seen them  what then is x x is the line taken by the ball fired from g which took off one hundred and thirtyfour elephants trunks and only spent itself in the tusk of a very old animal that stood the hundred and thirtyfifth  i say that such a shot was never fired before or since that a gun was never pointed in such a way  suppose i had been a common man and contented myself with firing bang at the head of the first animal  an ass would have done it prided himself had he hit his mark and what would have been the consequence  why that the ball might have killed two elephants and wounded a third but here probably it would have stopped and done no further mischief  the trunk was the place at which to aim there are no bones there and away consequently went the bullet shearing as i have said through one hundred and thirtyfive probosces  heavens what a howl there was when the shot took effect  what a sudden stoppage of holkars speech  what a hideous snorting of elephants  what a rush backwards was made by the whole army as if some demon was pursuing them  away they went  no sooner did i see them in full retreat than rushing forward myself i shouted to my men my friends yonder lies your dinner  we flung open the gateswe tore down to the spot where the elephants had fallen  seven of them were killed and of those that escaped to die of their hideous wounds elsewhere most had left their trunks behind them  a great quantity of them we seized and i myself cutting up with my scimitar a couple of the fallen animals as a butcher would a calf motioned to the men to take the pieces back to the fort where barbecued elephant was served round for dinner instead of the miserable allowance of an olive and a glass of wine which i had promised to my female friends in my speech to them  the animal reserved for the ladies was a young white onethe fattest and tenderest i ever ate in my life  they are very fair eating but the flesh has an indiarubber flavour which until one is accustomed to it is unpalatable  it was well that i had obtained this supply for during my absence on the works mrs vandegobbleschroy and one or two others had forced their way into the supperroom and devoured every morsel of the garrison larder with the exception of the cheeses the olives and the wine which were locked up in my own apartment before which stood a sentinel  disgusting mrs van  when i heard of her gluttony i had almost a mind to eat her  however we made a very comfortable dinner off the barbecued steaks and when everybody had done had the comfort of knowing that there was enough for one meal more  the next day as i expected the enemy attacked us in great force attempting to escalade the fort but by the help of my guns and my good sword by the distinguished bravery of lieutenant macgillicuddy and the rest of the garrison we beat this attack off completely the enemy sustaining a loss of seven hundred men  we were victorious but when another attack was made what were we to do  we had still a little powder left but had fired off all the shot stones ironbars c in the garrison  on this day too we devoured the last morsel of our food  i shall never forget mrs vandegobbleschroys despairing look as i saw her sitting alone attempting to make some impression on the little white elephants roasted tail  the third day the attack was repeated  the resources of genius are never at an end  yesterday i had no ammunition today i discovered charges sufficient for two guns and two swivels which were much longer but had bores of about blunderbuss size  this time my friend loll mahommed who had received as the reader may remember such a bastinadoing for my sake headed the attack the poor wretch could not walk but he was carried in an open palanquin and came on waving his sword and cursing horribly in his hindustan jargon  behind him came troops of matchlockmen who picked off every one of our men who showed their noses above the ramparts and a great host of blackamoors with scalingladders bundles to fill the ditch fascines gabions culverins demilunes counterscarps and all the other appurtenances of offensive war  on they came my guns and men were ready for them  you will ask how my pieces were loaded  i answer that though my garrison were without food i knew my duty as an officer and had put the two dutch cheeses into the two guns and had crammed the contents of a bottle of olives into each swivel  they advancedwhish went one of the dutch cheesesbang went the other  alas they did little execution  in their first contact with an opposing body they certainly floored it but they became at once like so much welshrabbit and did no execution beyond the man whom they struck down  hogree pogree wongreefum praise to allah and the fortynine imaums shouted out the ferocious loll mahommed when he saw the failure of my shot  onward sons of the prophet the infidel has no more ammunition  a hundred thousand lakhs of rupees to the man who brings me gahagans head  his men set up a shout and rushed forwardhe to do him justice was at the very head urging on his own palanquinbearers and poking them with the tip of his scimitar  they came panting up the hill  i was black with rage but it was the cold concentrated rage of despair  macgillicuddy said i calling that faithful officer you know where the barrels of powder are  he did  you know the use to make of them  he did  he grasped my hand goliah said he farewell  i swear that the fort shall be in atoms as soon as yonder unbelievers have carried it  oh my poor mother added the gallant youth as sighing yet fearless he retired to his post  i gave one thought to my blessed my beautiful belinda and then stepping into the front took down one of the swivelsa shower of matchlock balls came whizzing round my head  i did not heed them  i took the swivel and aimed coolly  loll mahommed his palanquin and his men were now not above two hundred yards from the fort loll was straight before me gesticulating and shouting to his men i firedbang  i aimed so true that one hundred and seventeen best spanish olives were lodged in a lump in the face of the unhappy loll mahommed the wretch uttering a yell the most hideous and unearthly i ever heard fell back dead the frightened bearers flung down the palanquin and ranthe whole host ran as one man  their screams might be heard for leagues  tomasha tomasha they cried it is enchantment  away they fled and the victory a third time was ours  soon as the fight was done i flew back to my belinda  we had eaten nothing for twentyfour hours but i forgot hunger in the thought of once more beholding her  the sweet soul turned towards me with a sickly smile as i entered and almost fainted in my arms but alas it was not love which caused in her bosom an emotion so strongit was hunger  oh my goliah whispered she for three days i have not tasted foodi could not eat that horrid elephant yesterday but nowoh heaven  she could say no more but sank almost lifeless on my shoulder  i administered to her a trifling dram of rum which revived her for a moment and then rushed downstairs determined that if it were a piece of my own leg she should still have something to satisfy her hunger  luckily i remembered that three or four elephants were still lying in the field having been killed by us in the first action two days before  necessity thought i has no law my adorable girl must eat elephant until she can get something better  i rushed into the court where the men were for the most part assembled  men said i our larder is empty we must fill it as we did the day before yesterday  who will follow gahagan on a foraging party  i expected that as on former occasions every man would offer to accompany me  to my astonishment not a soul moveda murmur arose among the troops and at last one of the oldest and bravest came forward  captain he said it is of no use we cannot feed upon elephants for ever we have not a grain of powder left and must give up the fort when the attack is made tomorrow  we may as well be prisoners now as then and we wont go elephanthunting any more  ruffian i said he who first talks of surrender dies and i cut him down  is there anyone else who wishes to speak  no one stirred  cowards miserable cowards shouted i what you dare not move for fear of death at the hands of those wretches who even now fled before your armswhat do i say your armsbefore minealone i did it and as alone i routed the foe alone i will victual the fortress  ho open the gate  i rushed out not a single man would follow  the bodies of the elephants that we had killed still lay on the ground where they had fallen about four hundred yards from the fort  i descended calmly the hill a very steep one and coming to the spot took my pick of the animals choosing a tolerably small and plump one of about thirteen feet high which the vultures had respected  i threw this animal over my shoulders and made for the fort  as i marched up the acclivity whizzpiffwhirr came the balls over my head and pitterpatter pitterpatter they fell on the body of the elephant like drops of rain  the enemy were behind me i knew it and quickened my pace  i heard the gallop of their horse  they came nearer nearer i was within a hundred yards of the fortseventyfifty  i strained every nerve i panted with the superhuman exertioni rancould a man run very fast with such a tremendous weight on his shoulders  up came the enemy fifty horsemen were shouting and screaming at my tail  o heaven five yards moreone momentand i am saved  it is donei strain the last straini make the last stepi fling forward my precious burden into the gate opened wide to receive me and it andi fall  the gate thunders to and i am left on the outside  fifty knives are gleaming before my bloodshot eyesfifty black hands are at my throat when a voice exclaims stopkill him not it is gujputi  a film came over my eyesexhausted nature would bear no more    chapter ix  surprise of futtyghur    when i awoke from the trance into which i had fallen i found myself in a bath surrounded by innumerable black faces and a hindoo pothukoor whence our word apothecary feeling my pulse and looking at me with an air of sagacity  where am i i exclaimed looking round and examining the strange faces and the strange apartment which met my view  bekhusm said the apothecary  silence  gahagan sahib is in the hands of those who know his valour and will save his life  know my valour slave  of course you do said i but the fort the garrisonthe elephantbelinda my lovemy darling macgillicuddythe scoundrelly mutineersthe deal bo   i could say no more the painful recollections pressed so heavily upon my poor shattered mind and frame that both failed once more i fainted again and i know not how long i lay insensible  again however i came to my senses  the pothukoor applied restoratives and after a slumber of some hours i awoke much refreshed  i had no wound my repeated swoons had been brought on as indeed well they might by my gigantic efforts in carrying the elephant up a steep hill a quarter of a mile in length  walking the task is bad enough  but running it is the deuce and i would recommend any of my readers who may be disposed to try and carry a dead elephant never on any account to go a pace of more than five miles an hour  scarcely was i awake when i heard the clash of arms at my door plainly indicating that sentinels were posted there and a single old gentleman richly habited entered the room  did my eyes deceive me  i had surely seen him before  noyesnoyesit was he  the snowy white beard the mild eyes the nose flattened to a jelly and level with the rest of the venerable face proclaimed him at once to besaadut alee beg bimbukchee holkars prime vizier whose nose as the reader may recollect his highness had flattened with his kaleawn during my interview with him in the pitans disguise  i now knew my fate but too welli was in the hands of holkar  saadut alee beg bimbukchee slowly advanced towards me and with a mild air of benevolence which distinguished that excellent man he was torn to pieces by wild horses the year after on account of a difference with holkar he came to my bedside and taking gently my hand said life and death my son are not ours  strength is deceitful valour is unavailing fame is only windthe nightingale sings of the rose all nightwhere is the rose in the morning booch booch it

names of the fortynine imaums  you have but to renounce your religion and your service and all these rewards are yours  he produced a parchment signed as he said and gave it to me it was beautifully written in indian ink  i had it for fourteen years but a rascally valet seeing it very dirty washed it forsooth and washed off every bit of the writing  i took it calmly and said this is a tempting offer  o vizier how long wilt thou give me to consider of it  after a long parley he allowed me six hours when i promised to give him an answer  my mind however was made upas soon as he was gone i threw myself on the sofa and fell asleep      at the end of the six hours the vizier came back  two people were with him one by his martial appearance i knew to be holkar the other i did not recognise  it was about midnight  have you considered said the vizier as he came to my couch  i have said i sitting upi could not stand for my legs were tied and my arms fixed in a neat pair of steel handcuffs  i have said i unbelieving dogs  i have  do you think to pervert a christian gentleman from his faith and honour  ruffian blackamoors do your worst heap tortures on this body they cannot last long  tear me to pieces  after you have torn me into a certain number of pieces i shall not feel it and if i did if each torture could last a life if each limb were to feel the agonies of a whole body what then  i would bear allallall allallall  my breast heavedmy form dilatedmy eye flashed as i spoke these words  tyrants said i dulce et decorum est pro patria mori  having thus clinched the argument i was silent  the venerable  grand vizier turned away i saw a tear trickling down his cheeks  what a constancy said he  oh that such beauty and such bravery should be doomed so soon to quit the earth  his tall companion only sneered and said and belinda  ha said i ruffian be stillheaven will protect her spotless innocence  holkar i know thee and thou knowest me too  who with his single sword destroyed thy armies  who with his pistol cleft in twain thy nosering  who slew thy generals  who slew thy elephants  three hundred mighty beasts went forth to battle  of these i slew one hundred and thirtyfive  dog coward ruffian tyrant unbeliever  gahagan hates thee spurns thee spits on thee  holkar as i made these uncomplimentary remarks gave a scream of rage and drawing his scimitar rushed on to despatch me at once it was the very thing i wished for when the third person sprang forward and seizing his arm cried   papa oh save him  it was puttee rooge  remember continued she his misfortunesremember oh remember myloveand here she blushed and putting one finger into her mouth and hanging down her head looked the very picture of modest affection  holkar sulkily sheathed his scimitar and muttered tis better as it is had i killed him now i had spared him the torture  none of this shameless fooling puttee rooge continued the tyrant dragging her away  captain gahagan dies three hours from hence puttee rooge gave one scream and faintedher father and the vizier carried her off between them nor was i loth to part with her for with all her love she was as ugly as the deuce  they were gonemy fate was decided  i had but three hours more of life  so i flung myself again on the sofa and fell profoundly asleep  as it may happen to any of my readers to be in the same situation and to be hanged themselves let me earnestly entreat them to adopt this plan of going to sleep which i for my part have repeatedly found to be successful  it saves unnecessary annoyance it passes away a great deal of unpleasant time and it prepares one to meet like a man the coming catastrophe      three oclock came  the sun was at this time making his appearance in the heavens and with it came the guards who were appointed to conduct me to the torture  i woke rose was carried out and was set on the very white donkey on which loll mahommed was conducted through the camp after he was bastinadoed  bobbachy bahawder rode behind me restored to his rank and state troops of cavalry hemmed us in on all sides my ass was conducted by the common executioner a crier went forward shouting out make way for the destroyer of the faithfulhe goes to bear the punishment of his crimes  we came to the fatal plain  it was the very spot whence i had borne away the elephant and in full sight of the fort  i looked towards it  thank heaven  king georges banner waved on it stilla crowd were gathered on the wallsthe men the dastards who had deserted meand women too  among the latter i thought i distinguished one whoo gods the thought turned me sicki trembled and looked pale for the first time  he trembles he turns pale shouted out bobbachy bahawder ferociously exulting over his conquered enemy  dog shouted ii was sitting with my head to the donkeys tail and so looked the bobbachy full in the facenot so pale as you looked when i felled you with this armnot so pale as your women looked when i entered your harem  completely chopfallen the indian ruffian was silent  at any rate i had done for him  we arrived at the place of execution  a stake a couple of feet thick and eight high was driven in the grass  round the stake about seven feet from the ground was an iron ring to which were attached two fetters in these my wrists were placed  two or three executioners stood near with strangelooking instruments  others were blowing at a fire over which was a cauldron and in the embers were stuck prongs and other instruments of iron  the crier came forward and read my sentence  it was the same in effect as that which had been hinted to me the day previous by the grand vizier  i confess i was too agitated to catch every word that was spoken  holkar himself on a tall dromedary was at a little distance  the grand vizier came up to meit was his duty to stand by and see the punishment performed  it is yet time said he  i nodded my head but did not answer  the vizier cast up to heaven a look of inexpressible anguish and with a voice choking with emotion said executionerdoyour duty  the horrid man advancedhe whispered sulkily in the ears of the grand vizier guggly ka ghee hum khedgeree said he the oil does not boil yetwait one minute  the assistants blew the fire blazed the oil was heated  the vizier drew a few feet aside taking a large ladle full of the boiling liquid he advanced       whish bang bang pop the executioner was dead at my feet shot through the head the ladle of scalding oil had been dashed in the face of the unhappy grand vizier who lay on the plain howling whish bang pop  hurrahchargeforwardscut them downno quarter  i sawyes no yes no yesi saw regiment upon regiment of galloping british horsemen riding over the ranks of the flying natives  first of the host i recognised o heaven my ahmednuggar irregulars  on came the gallant line of black steeds and horsemen swift swift before them rode my officers in yellowglogger pappendick and stuffle their sabres gleamed in the sun their voices rung in the air  d them they cried give it them boys  a strength supernatural thrilled through my veins at that delicious music  by one tremendous effort i wrested the post from its foundation five feet in the ground  i could not release my hands from the fetters it is true but grasping the beam tightly i sprung forwardwith one blow i levelled the five executioners in the midst of the fire their fall upsetting the scalding oilcan with the next i swept the bearers of bobbachys palanquin off their legs with the third i caught that chief himself in the small of the back and sent him flying on to the sabres of my advancing soldiers  the next minute glogger and stuffle were in my arms pappendick leading on the irregulars  friend and foe in that wild chase had swept far away  we were alone  i was freed from my immense bar and ten minutes afterwards when lord lake trotted up with his staff he found me sitting on it  look at gahagan said his lordship  gentlemen did i not tell you we should be sure to find him at his post  the gallant old nobleman rode on  and this was the famous battle of furruckabad or surprise of futtyghur fought on the 17th of november 1804      about a month afterwards the following announcement appeared in the boggleywollah hurkaru and other indian papers  married on the 25th of december at futtyghur by the rev dr
