6818880	the american  by henry james  1877      chapter i   on a brilliant day in may in the year 1868 a gentleman was reclining at his ease on the great circular divan which at that period occupied the centre of the salon carre in the museum of the louvre this commodious ottoman has since been removed to the extreme regret of all weakkneed lovers of the fine arts but the gentleman in question had taken serene possession of its softest spot and with his head thrown back and his legs outstretched was staring at murillos beautiful moonborne madonna in profound enjoyment of his posture he had removed his hat and flung down beside him a little red guidebook and an operaglass the day was warm he was heated with walking and he repeatedly passed his handkerchief over his forehead with a somewhat wearied gesture and yet he was evidently not a man to whom fatigue was familiar long lean and muscular he suggested the sort of vigor that is commonly known as toughness but his exertions on this particular day had been of an unwonted sort and he had performed great physical feats which left him less jaded than his tranquil stroll through the louvre he had looked out all the pictures to which an asterisk was affixed in those formidable pages of fine print in his badeker his attention had been strained and his eyes dazzled and he had sat down with an aesthetic headache he had looked moreover not only at all the pictures but at all the copies that were going forward around them in the hands of those innumerable young women in irreproachable toilets who devote themselves in france to the propagation of masterpieces and if the truth must be told he had often admired the copy much more than the original his physiognomy would have sufficiently indicated that he was a shrewd and capable fellow and in truth he had often sat up all night over a bristling bundle of accounts and heard the cock crow without a yawn but raphael and titian and rubens were a new kind of arithmetic and they inspired our friend for the first time in his life with a vague selfmistrust  an observer with anything of an eye for national types would have had no difficulty in determining the local origin of this undeveloped connoisseur and indeed such an observer might have felt a certain humorous relish of the almost ideal completeness with which he filled out the national mould the gentleman on the divan was a powerful specimen of an american but he was not only a fine american he was in the first place physically a fine man he appeared to possess that kind of health and strength which when found in perfection are the most impressivethe physical capital which the owner does nothing to keep up if he was a muscular christian it was quite without knowing it if it was necessary to walk to a remote spot he walked but he had never known himself to exercise he had no theory with regard to cold bathing or the use of indian clubs he was neither an oarsman a rifleman nor a fencerhe had never had time for these amusementsand he was quite unaware that the saddle is recommended for certain forms of indigestion he was by inclination a temperate man but he had supped the night before his visit to the louvre at the cafe anglaissome one had told him it was an experience not to be omittedand he had slept none the less the sleep of the just his usual attitude and carriage were of a rather relaxed and lounging kind but when under a special inspiration he straightened himself he looked like a grenadier on parade he never smoked he had been assuredsuch things are saidthat cigars were excellent for the health and he was quite capable of believing it but he knew as little about tobacco as about homeopathy he had a very wellformed head with a shapely symmetrical balance of the frontal and the occipital development and a good deal of straight rather dry brown hair his complexion was brown and his nose had a bold wellmarked arch his eye was of a clear cold gray and save for a rather abundant mustache he was cleanshaved he had the flat jaw and sinewy neck which are frequent in the american type but the traces of national origin are a matter of expression even more than of feature and it was in this respect that our friends countenance was supremely eloquent the discriminating observer we have been supposing might however perfectly have measured its expressiveness and yet have been at a loss to describe it it had that typical vagueness which is not vacuity that blankness which is not simplicity that look of being committed to nothing in particular of standing in an attitude of general hospitality to the chances of life of being very much at ones own disposal so characteristic of many american faces it was our friends eye that chiefly told his story an eye in which innocence and experience were singularly blended it was full of contradictory suggestions and though it was by no means the glowing orb of a hero of romance you could find in it almost anything you looked for frigid and yet friendly frank yet cautious shrewd yet credulous positive yet skeptical confident yet shy extremely intelligent and extremely goodhumored there was something vaguely defiant in its concessions and something profoundly reassuring in its reserve the cut of this gentlemans mustache with the two premature wrinkles in the cheek above it and the fashion of his garments in which an exposed shirtfront and a cerulean cravat played perhaps an obtrusive part completed the conditions of his identity we have approached him perhaps at a not especially favorable moment he is by no means sitting for his portrait but listless as he lounges there rather baffled on the aesthetic question and guilty of the damning fault as we have lately discovered it to be of confounding the merit of the artist with that of his work for he admires the squinting madonna of the young lady with the boyish coiffure because he thinks the young lady herself uncommonly taking he is a sufficiently promising acquaintance decision salubrity jocosity prosperity seem to hover within his call he is evidently a practical man but the idea in his case has undefined and mysterious boundaries which invite the imagination to bestir itself on his behalf  as the little copyist proceeded with her work she sent every now and then a responsive glance toward her admirer the cultivation of the fine arts appeared to necessitate to her mind a great deal of byplay a great standing off with folded arms and head drooping from side to side stroking of a dimpled chin with a dimpled hand sighing and frowning and patting of the foot fumbling in disordered tresses for wandering hairpins these performances were accompanied by a restless glance which lingered longer than elsewhere upon the gentleman we have described at last he rose abruptly put on his hat and approached the young lady he placed himself before her picture and looked at it for some moments during which she pretended to be quite unconscious of his inspection then addressing her with the single word which constituted the strength of his french vocabulary and holding up one finger in a manner which appeared to him to illuminate his meaning combien he abruptly demanded  the artist stared a moment gave a little pout shrugged her shoulders put down her palette and brushes and stood rubbing her hands  how much said our friend in english combien  monsieur wishes to buy it asked the young lady in french  very pretty splendide combien repeated the american  it pleases monsieur my little picture its a very beautiful subject said the young lady  the madonna yes i am not a catholic but i want to buy it combien write it here and he took a pencil from his pocket and showed her the flyleaf of his guidebook she stood looking at him and scratching her chin with the pencil is it not for sale he asked and as she still stood reflecting and looking at him with an eye which in spite of her desire to treat this avidity of patronage as a very old story betrayed an almost touching incredulity he was afraid he had offended her she simply trying to look indifferent and wondering how far she might go i havent made a mistakepas insulte no her interlocutor continued dont you understand a little english  the young ladys aptitude for playing a part at short notice was remarkable she fixed him with her conscious perceptive eye and asked him if he spoke no french then donnez she said briefly and took the open guidebook in the upper corner of the flyleaf she traced a number in a minute and extremely neat hand then she handed back the book and took up her palette again  our friend read the number 2000 francs he said nothing for a time but stood looking at the picture while the copyist began actively to dabble with her paint for a copy isnt that a good deal he asked at last pas beaucoup  the young lady raised her eyes from her palette scanned him from head to foot and alighted with admirable sagacity upon exactly the right answer yes its a good deal but my copy has remarkable qualities it is worth nothing less  the gentleman in whom we are interested understood no french but i have said he was intelligent and here is a good chance to prove it he apprehended by a natural instinct the meaning of the young womans phrase and it gratified him to think that she was so honest beauty talent virtue she combined everything but you must finish it he said finish you know and he pointed to the unpainted hand of the figure  oh it shall be finished in perfection in the perfection of perfections cried mademoiselle and to confirm her promise she deposited a rosy blotch in the middle of the madonnas cheek  but the american frowned ah too red too red he rejoined her complexion pointing to the murillo ismore delicate  delicate oh it shall be delicate monsieur delicate as sevres biscuit i am going to tone that down i know all the secrets of my art and where will you allow us to send it to you your address  my address oh yes and the gentleman drew a card from his pocketbook and wrote something upon it then hesitating a moment he said if i dont like it when it its finished you know i shall not be obliged to take it  the young lady seemed as good a guesser as himself oh i am very sure that monsieur is not capricious she said with a roguish smile  capricious and at this monsieur began to laugh oh no im not capricious i am very faithful i am very constant comprenez  monsieur is constant i understand perfectly its a rare virtue to recompense you you shall have your picture on the first possible day next weekas soon as it is dry i will take the card of monsieur and she took it and read his name christopher newman then she tried to repeat it aloud and laughed at her bad accent your english names are so droll  droll said mr newman laughing too did you ever hear of christopher columbus  bien sur he invented america a very great man and is he your patron  my patron  your patronsaint in the calendar  oh exactly my parents named me for him  monsieur is american  dont you see it monsieur inquired  and you mean to carry my little picture away over there and she explained her phrase with a gesture  oh i mean to buy a great many picturesbeaucoup beaucoup said christopher newman  the honor is not less for me the young lady answered for i am sure monsieur has a great deal of taste  but you must give me your card newman said your card you know  the young lady looked severe for an instant and then said my father will wait upon you  but this time mr newmans powers of divination were at fault your card your address he simply repeated  my address said mademoiselle then with a little shrug happily for you you are an american it is the first time i ever gave my card to a gentleman and taking from her pocket a rather greasy portemonnaie she extracted from it a small glazed visiting card and presented the latter to her patron it was neatly inscribed in pencil with a great many flourishes mlle noemie nioche but mr newman unlike his companion read the name with perfect gravity all french names to him were equally droll  and precisely here is my father who has come to escort me home said mademoiselle noemie he speaks english he will arrange with you and she turned to welcome a little old gentleman who came shuffling up peering over his spectacles at newman  m nioche wore a glossy wig of an unnatural color which overhung his little meek white vacant face and left it hardly more expressive than the unfeatured block upon which these articles are displayed in the barbers window he was an exquisite image of shabby gentility his scant illmade coat desperately brushed his darned gloves his highly polished boots his rusty shapely hat told the story of a person who had had losses and who clung to the spirit of nice habits even though the letter had been hopelessly effaced among other things m nioche had lost courage adversity had not only ruined him it had frightened him and he was evidently going through his remnant of life on tiptoe for fear of waking up the hostile fates if this strange gentleman was saying anything improper to his daughter m nioche would entreat him huskily as a particular favor to forbear but he would admit at the same time that he was very presumptuous to ask for particular favors  monsieur has bought my picture said mademoiselle noemie when its finished youll carry it to him in a cab  in a cab cried m nioche and he stared in a bewildered way as if he had seen the sun rising at midnight  are you the young ladys father said newman i think she said you speak english  speak englishyes said the old man slowly rubbing his hands i will bring it in a cab  say something then cried his daughter thank him a littlenot too much  a little my daughter a little said m nioche perplexed how much  two thousand said mademoiselle noemie dont make a fuss or hell take back his word  two thousand cried the old man and he began to fumble for his snuffbox he looked at newman from head to foot he looked at his daughter and then at the picture take care you dont spoil it he cried almost sublimely  we must go home said mademoiselle noemie this is a good days work take care how you carry it and she began to put up her utensils  how can i thank you said m nioche my english does not suffice  i wish i spoke french as well said newman goodnaturedly your daughter is very clever  oh sir and m nioche looked over his spectacles with tearful eyes and nodded several times with a world of sadness she has had an educationtressuperieure nothing was spared lessons in pastel at ten francs the lesson lessons in oil at twelve francs i didnt look at the francs then shes an artiste ah  do i understand you to say that you have had reverses asked newman  reverses oh sir misfortunesterrible  unsuccessful in business eh  very unsuccessful sir  oh never fear youll get on your legs again said newman cheerily  the old man drooped his head on one side and looked at him with an expression of pain as if this were an unfeeling jest  what does he say demanded mademoiselle noemie  m nioche took a pinch of snuff he says i will make my fortune again  perhaps he will help you and what else  he says thou art very clever  it is very possible you believe it yourself my father  believe it my daughter with this evidence and the old man turned afresh with a staring wondering homage to the audacious daub on the easel  ask him then if he would not like to learn french  to learn french  to take lessons  to take lessons my daughter from thee  from you  from me my child how should i give lessons  pas de raisons ask him immediately said mademoiselle noemie with soft brevity  m nioche stood aghast but under his daughters eye he collected his wits and doing his best to assume an agreeable smile he executed her commands would it please you to receive instruction in our beautiful language he inquired with an appealing quaver  to study french asked newman staring  m nioche pressed his fingertips together and slowly raised his shoulders a little conversation  conversationthats it murmured mademoiselle noemie who had caught the word the conversation of the best society  our french conversation is famous you know m nioche ventured to continue its a great talent  but isnt it awfully difficult asked newman very simply  not to a man of esprit like monsieur an admirer of beauty in every form and m nioche cast a significant glance at his daughters madonna  i cant fancy myself chattering french said newman with a laugh and yet i suppose that the more a man knows the better  monsieur expresses that very happily helas oui  i suppose it would help me a great deal knocking about paris to know the language  ah there are so many things monsieur must want to say difficult things  everything i want to say is difficult but you give lessons  poor m nioche was embarrassed he smiled more appealingly i am not a regular professor he admitted i cant nevertheless tell him that im a professor he said to his daughter  tell him its a very exceptional chance answered mademoiselle noemie an homme du mondeone gentleman conversing with another remember what you arewhat you have been  a teacher of languages in neither case much more formerly and much less today and if he asks the price of the lessons  he wont ask it said mademoiselle noemie  what he pleases i may say  never thats bad style  if he asks then  mademoiselle noemie had put on her bonnet and was tying the ribbons she smoothed them out with her soft little chin thrust forward ten francs she said quickly  oh my daughter i shall never dare  dont dare then he wont ask till the end of the lessons and then i will make out the bill  m nioche turned to the confiding foreigner again and stood rubbing his hands with an air of seeming to plead guilty which was not intenser only because it was habitually so striking it never occurred to newman to ask him for a guarantee of his skill in imparting instruction he supposed of course m nioche knew his own language and his appealing forlornness was quite the perfection of what the american for vague reasons had always associated with all elderly foreigners of the lessongiving class newman had never reflected upon philological processes his chief impression with regard to ascertaining those mysterious correlatives of his familiar english vocables which were current in this extraordinary city of paris was that it was simply a matter of a good deal of unwonted and rather ridiculous muscular effort on his own part how did you learn english he asked of the old man  when i was young before my miseries oh i was wide awake then my father was a great commercant he placed me for a year in a countinghouse in england some of it stuck to me but i have forgotten  how much french can i learn in a month  what does he say asked mademoiselle noemie  m nioche explained  he will speak like an angel said his daughter  but the native integrity which had been vainly exerted to secure m nioches commercial prosperity flickered up again dame monsieur he answered all i can teach you and then recovering himself at a sign from his daughter i will wait upon you at your hotel  oh yes i should like to learn french newman went on with democratic confidingness hang me if i should ever have thought of it i took for granted it was impossible but if you learned my language why shouldnt i learn yours and his frank friendly laugh drew the sting from the jest only if we are going to converse you know you must think of something cheerful to converse about  you are very good sir i am overcome said m nioche throwing out his hands but you have cheerfulness and happiness for two  oh no said newman more seriously you must be bright and lively thats part of the bargain  m nioche bowed with his hand on his heart very well sir you have already made me lively  come and bring me my picture then i will pay you for it and we will talk about that that will be a cheerful subject  mademoiselle noemie had collected her accessories and she gave the precious madonna in charge to her father who retreated backwards out of sight holding it at armslength and reiterating his obeisance the young lady gathered her shawl about her like a perfect parisienne and it was with the smile of a parisienne that she took leave of her patron    chapter ii   he wandered back to the divan and seated himself on the other side in view of the great canvas on which paul veronese had depicted the marriagefeast of cana wearied as he was he found the picture entertaining it had an illusion for him it satisfied his conception which was ambitious of what a splendid banquet should be in the lefthand corner of the picture is a young woman with yellow tresses confined in a golden headdress she is bending forward and listening with the smile of a charming woman at a dinnerparty to her neighbor newman detected her in the crowd admired her and perceived that she too had her votive copyista young man with his hair standing on end suddenly he became conscious of the germ of the mania of the collector he had taken the first step why should he not go on it was only twenty minutes before that he had bought the first picture of his life and now he was already thinking of artpatronage as a fascinating pursuit his reflections quickened his goodhumor and he was on the point of approaching the young man with another combien two or three facts in this relation are noticeable although the logical chain which connects them may seem imperfect he knew mademoiselle nioche had asked too much he bore her no grudge for doing so and he was determined to pay the young man exactly the proper sum at this moment however his attention was attracted by a gentleman who had come from another part of the room and whose manner was that of a stranger to the gallery although he was equipped with neither guidebook nor operaglass he carried a white sunumbrella lined with blue silk and he strolled in front of the paul veronese vaguely looking at it but much too near to see anything but the grain of the canvas opposite to christopher newman he paused and turned and then our friend who had been observing him had a chance to verify a suspicion aroused by an imperfect view of his face the result of this larger scrutiny was that he presently sprang to his feet strode across the room and with an outstretched hand arrested the gentleman with the bluelined umbrella the latter stared but put out his hand at a venture he was corpulent and rosy and though his countenance which was ornamented with a beautiful flaxen beard carefully divided in the middle and brushed outward at the sides was not remarkable for intensity of expression he looked like a person who would willingly shake hands with any one i know not what newman thought of his face but he found a want of response in his grasp  oh come come he said laughing dont say now you dont know meif i have not got a white parasol  the sound of his voice quickened the others memory his face expanded to its fullest capacity and he also broke into a laugh why newmanill be blowed where in the worldi declarewho would have thought you know you have changed  you havent said newman  not for the better no doubt when did you get here  three days ago  why didnt you let me know  i had no idea you were here  i have been here these six years  it must be eight or nine since we met  something of that sort we were very young  it was in st louis during the war you were in the army  oh no not i but you were  i believe i was  you came out all right  i came out with my legs and armsand with satisfaction all that seems very far away  and how long have you been in europe  seventeen days  first time  yes very much so  made your everlasting fortune  christopher newman was silent a moment and then with a tranquil smile he answered yes  and come to paris to spend it eh  well we shall see so they carry those parasols herethe menfolk  of course they do theyre great things they understand comfort out here  where do you buy them  anywhere everywhere  well tristram im glad to get hold of you you can show me the ropes i suppose you know paris inside out  mr tristram gave a mellow smile of selfgratulation well i guess there are not many men that can show me much ill take care of you  its a pity you were not here a few minutes ago i have just bought a picture you might have put the thing through for me  bought a picture said mr tristram looking vaguely round at the walls why do they sell them  i mean a copy  oh i see these said mr tristram nodding at the titians and vandykes these i suppose are originals  i hope so cried newman i dont want a copy of a copy  ah said mr tristram mysteriously you can never tell they imitate you know so deucedly well its like the jewelers with their false stones go into the palais royal there you see imitation on half the windows the law obliges them to stick it on you know but you cant tell the things apart to tell the truth mr tristram continued with a wry face i dont do much in pictures i leave that to my wife  ah you have got a wife  didnt i mention it shes a very nice woman you must know her shes up there in the avenue diena  so you are regularly fixedhouse and children and all  yes a tiptop house and a couple of youngsters  well said christopher newman stretching his arms a little with a sigh i envy you  oh no you dont answered mr tristram giving him a little poke with his parasol  i beg your pardon i do  well you wont then whenwhen  you dont certainly mean when i have seen your establishment  when you have seen paris my boy you want to be your own master here  oh i have been my own master all my life and im tired of it  well try paris how old are you  thirtysix  cest le bel age as they say here  what does that mean  it means that a man shouldnt send away his plate till he has eaten his fill  all that i have just made arrangements to take french lessons  oh you dont want any lessons youll pick it up i never took any  i suppose you speak french as well as english  better said mr tristram roundly its a splendid language you can say all sorts of bright things in it  but i suppose said christopher newman with an earnest desire for information that you must be bright to begin with  not a bit thats just the beauty of it  the two friends as they exchanged these remarks had remained standing where they met and leaning against the rail which protected the pictures mr tristram at last declared that he was overcome with fatigue and should be happy to sit down newman recommended in the highest terms the great divan on which he had been lounging and they prepared to seat themselves this is a great place isnt it said newman with ardor  great place great place finest thing in the world and then suddenly mr tristram hesitated and looked about him i suppose they wont let you smoke here  newman stared smoke im sure i dont know you know the regulations better than i  i i never was here before  never in six years  i believe my wife dragged me here once when we first came to paris but i never found my way back  but you say you know paris so well  i dont call this paris cried mr tristram with assurance come lets go over to the palais royal and have a smoke  i dont smoke said newman  a drink then  and mr tristram led his companion away they passed through the glorious halls of the louvre down the staircases along the cool dim galleries of sculpture and out into the enormous court newman looked about him as he went but he made no comments and it was only when they at last emerged into the open air that he said to his friend it seems to me that in your place i should have come here once a week  oh no you wouldnt said mr tristram you think so but you wouldnt you wouldnt have had time you would always mean to go but you never would go theres better fun than that here in paris italys the place to see pictures wait till you get there there you have to go you cant do anything else its an awful country you cant get a decent cigar i dont know why i went in there today i was strolling along rather hard up for amusement i sort of noticed the louvre as i passed and i thought i would go in and see what was going on but if i hadnt found you there i should have felt rather sold hang it i dont care for pictures i prefer the reality and mr tristram tossed off this happy formula with an assurance which the numerous class of persons suffering from an overdose of culture might have envied him  the two gentlemen proceeded along the rue de rivoli and into the palais royal where they seated themselves at one of the little tables stationed at the door of the cafe which projects into the great open quadrangle the place was filled with people the fountains were spouting a band was playing clusters of chairs were gathered beneath all the limetrees and buxom whitecapped nurses seated along the benches were offering to their infant charges the amplest facilities for nutrition there was an easy homely gayety in the whole scene and christopher newman felt that it was most characteristically parisian  and now began mr tristram when they had tested the decoction which he had caused to be served to them now just give an account of yourself what are your ideas what are your plans where have you come from and where are you going in the first place where are you staying  at the grand hotel said newman  mr tristram puckered his plump visage that wont do you must change  change demanded newman why its the finest hotel i ever was in  you dont want a fine hotel you want something small and quiet and elegant where your bell is answered and youyour person is recognized  they keep running to see if i have rung before i have touched the bell said newman and as for my person they are always bowing and scraping to it  i suppose you are always tipping them thats very bad style  always by no means a man brought me something yesterday and then stood loafing in a beggarly manner i offered him a chair and asked him if he wouldnt sit down was that bad style  very  but he bolted instantly at any rate the place amuses me hang your elegance if it bores me i sat in the court of the grand hotel last night until two oclock in the morning watching the coming and going and the people knocking about  youre easily pleased but you can do as you choosea man in your shoes you have made a pile of money eh  i have made enough  happy the man who can say that enough for what  enough to rest awhile to forget the confounded thing to look about me to see the world to have a good time to improve my mind and if the fancy takes me to marry a wife newman spoke slowly with a certain dryness of accent and with frequent pauses this was his habitual mode of utterance but it was especially marked in the words i have just quoted  jupiter theres a programme cried mr tristram certainly all that takes money especially the wife unless indeed she gives it as mine did and whats the story how have you done it  newman had pushed his hat back from his forehead folded his arms and stretched his legs he listened to the music he looked about him at the bustling crowd at the plashing fountains at the nurses and the babies i have worked he answered at last  tristram looked at him for some moments and allowed his placid eyes to measure his friends generous longitude and rest upon his comfortably contemplative face what have you worked at he asked  oh at several things  i suppose youre a smart fellow eh  newman continued to look at the nurses and babies they imparted to the scene a kind of primordial pastoral simplicity yes he said at last i suppose i am and then in answer to his companions inquiries he related briefly his history since their last meeting it was an intensely western story and it dealt with enterprises which it will be needless to introduce to the reader in detail newman had come out of the war with a brevet of brigadiergeneral an honor which in this casewithout invidious comparisonshad lighted upon shoulders amply competent to bear it but though he could manage a fight when need was newman heartily disliked the business his four years in the army had left him with an angry bitter sense of the waste of precious thingslife and time and money and smartness and the early freshness of purpose and he had addressed himself to the pursuits of peace with passionate zest and energy he was of course as penniless when he plucked off his shoulderstraps as when he put them on and the only capital at his disposal was his dogged resolution and his lively perception of ends and means exertion and action were as natural to him as respiration a more completely healthy mortal had never trod the elastic soil of the west his experience moreover was as wide as his capacity when he was fourteen years old necessity had taken him by his slim young shoulders and pushed him into the street to earn that nights supper he had not earned it but he had earned the next nights and afterwards whenever he had had none it was because he had gone without it to use the money for something else a keener pleasure or a finer profit he had turned his hand with his brain in it to many things he had been enterprising in an eminent sense of the term he had been adventurous and even reckless and he had known bitter failure as well as brilliant success but he was a born experimentalist and he had always found something to enjoy in the pressure of necessity even when it was as irritating as the haircloth shirt of the mediaeval monk at one time failure seemed inexorably his portion illluck became his bedfellow and whatever he touched he turned not to gold but to ashes his most vivid conception of a supernatural element in the worlds affairs had come to him once when this pertinacity of misfortune was at its climax there seemed to him something stronger in life than his own will but the mysterious something could only be the devil and he was accordingly seized with an intense personal enmity to this impertinent force he had known what it was to have utterly exhausted his credit to be unable to raise a dollar and to find himself at nightfall in a strange city without a penny to mitigate its strangeness it was under these circumstances that he made his entrance into san francisco the scene subsequently of his happiest strokes of fortune if he did not like dr franklin in philadelphia march along the street munching a pennyloaf it was only because he had not the pennyloaf necessary to the performance in his darkest days he had had but one simple practical impulsethe desire as he would have phrased it to see the thing through he did so at last buffeted his way into smooth waters and made money largely it must be admitted rather nakedly that christopher newmans sole aim in life had been to make money what he had been placed in the world for was to his own perception simply to wrest a fortune the bigger the better from defiant opportunity this idea completely filled his horizon and satisfied his imagination upon the uses of money upon what one might do with a life into which one had succeeded in injecting the golden stream he had up to his thirtyfifth year very scantily reflected life had been for him an open game and he had played for high stakes he had won at last and carried off his winnings and now what was he to do with them he was a man to whom sooner or later the question was sure to present itself and the answer to it belongs to our story a vague sense that more answers were possible than his philosophy had hitherto dreamt of had already taken possession of him and it seemed softly and agreeably to deepen as he lounged in this brilliant corner of paris with his friend  i must confess he presently went on that here i dont feel at all smart my remarkable talents seem of no use i feel as simple as a little child and a little child might take me by the hand and lead me about  oh ill be your little child said tristram jovially ill take you by the hand trust yourself to me  i am a good worker newman continued but i rather think i am a poor loafer i have come abroad to amuse myself but i doubt whether i know how  oh thats easily learned  well i may perhaps learn it but i am afraid i shall never do it by rote i have the best will in the world about it but my genius doesnt lie in that direction as a loafer i shall never be original as i take it that you are  yes said tristram i suppose i am original like all those immoral pictures in the louvre  besides newman continued i dont want to work at pleasure any more than i played at work i want to take it easily i feel deliciously lazy and i should like to spend six months as i am now sitting under a tree and listening to a band theres only one thing i want to hear some good music  music and pictures lord what refined tastes you are what my wife calls intellectual i aint a bit but we can find something better for you to do than to sit under a tree to begin with you must come to the club  what club  the occidental you will see all the americans there all the best of them at least of course you play poker  oh i say cried newman with energy you are not going to lock me up in a club and stick me down at a cardtable i havent come all this way for that  what the deuce have you come for you were glad enough to play poker in st louis i recollect when you cleaned me out  i have come to see europe to get the best out of it i can i want to see all the great things and do what the clever people do  the clever people much obliged you set me down as a blockhead then  newman was sitting sidewise in his chair with his elbow on the back and his head leaning on his hand without moving he looked a while at his companion with his dry guarded halfinscrutable and yet altogether goodnatured smile introduce me to your wife he said at last  tristram bounced about in his chair upon my word i wont she doesnt want any help to turn up her nose at me nor do you either  i dont turn up my nose at you my dear fellow nor at any one or anything im not proud i assure you im not proud thats why i am willing to take example by the clever people  well if im not the rose as they say here i have lived near it i can show you some clever people too do you know general packard do you know c p hatch do you know miss kitty upjohn  i shall be happy to make their acquaintance i want to cultivate society  tristram seemed restless and suspicious he eyed his friend askance and then what are you up to any way he demanded are you going to write a book  christopher newman twisted one end of his mustache a while in silence and at last he made answer one day a couple of months ago something very curious happened to me i had come on to new york on some important business it was rather a long storya question of getting ahead of another party in a certain particular way in the stockmarket this other party had once played me a very mean trick i owed him a grudge i felt awfully savage at the time and i vowed that when i got a chance i would figuratively speaking put his nose out of joint there was a matter of some sixty thousand dollars at stake if i put it out of his way it was a blow the fellow would feel and he really deserved no quarter i jumped into a hack and went about my business and it was in this hackthis immortal historical hackthat the curious thing i speak of occurred it was a hack like any other only a trifle dirtier with a greasy line along the top of the drab cushions as if it had been used for a great many irish funerals it is possible i took a nap i had been traveling all night and though i was excited with my errand i felt the want of sleep at all events i woke up suddenly from a sleep or from a kind of a reverie with the most extraordinary feeling in the worlda mortal disgust for the thing i was going to do it came upon me like that and he snapped his fingersas abruptly as an old wound that begins to ache i couldnt tell the meaning of it i only felt that i loathed the whole business and wanted to wash my hands of it the idea of losing that sixty thousand dollars of letting it utterly slide and scuttle and never hearing of it again seemed the sweetest thing in the world and all this took place quite independently of my will and i sat watching it as if it were a play at the theatre i could feel it going on inside of me you may depend upon it that there are things going on inside of us that we understand mighty little about  jupiter you make my flesh creep cried tristram and while you sat in your hack watching the play as you call it the other man marched in and bagged your sixty thousand dollars  i have not the least idea i hope so poor devil but i never found out we pulled up in front of the place i was going to in wall street but i sat still in the carriage and at last the driver scrambled down off his seat to see whether his carriage had not turned into a hearse i couldnt have got out any more than if i had been a corpse what was the matter with me momentary idiocy youll say what i wanted to get out of was wall street i told the man to drive down to the brooklyn ferry and to cross over when we were over i told him to drive me out into the country as i had told him originally to drive for dear life down town i suppose he thought me insane perhaps i was but in that case i am insane still i spent the morning looking at the first green leaves on long island i was sick of business i wanted to throw it all up and break off short i had money enough or if i hadnt i ought to have i seemed to feel a new man inside my old skin and i longed for a new world when you want a thing so very badly you had better treat yourself to it i didnt understand the matter not in the least but i gave the old horse the bridle and let him find his way as soon as i could get out of the game i sailed for europe that is how i come to be sitting here  you ought to have bought up that hack said tristram it isnt a safe vehicle to have about and you have really sold out then you have retired from business  i have made over my hand to a friend when i feel disposed i can take up the cards again i dare say that a twelvemonth hence the operation will be reversed the pendulum will swing back again i shall be sitting in a gondola or on a dromedary and all of a sudden i shall want to clear out but for the present i am perfectly free i have even bargained that i am to receive no business letters  oh its a real caprice de prince said tristram i back out a poor devil like me cant help you to spend such very magnificent leisure as that you should get introduced to the crowned heads  newman looked at him a moment and then with his easy smile how does one do it he asked  come i like that cried tristram it shows you are in earnest  of course i am in earnest didnt i say i wanted the best i know the best cant be had for mere money but i rather think money will do a good deal in addition i am willing to take a good deal of trouble  you are not bashful eh  i havent the least idea i want the biggest kind of entertainment a man can get people places art nature everything i want to see the tallest mountains and the bluest lakes and the finest pictures and the handsomest churches and the most celebrated men and the most beautiful women  settle down in paris then there are no mountains that i know of and the only lake is in the bois du boulogne and not particularly blue but there is everything else plenty of pictures and churches no end of celebrated men and several beautiful women  but i cant settle down in paris at this season just as summer is coming on  oh for the summer go up to trouville  what is trouville  the french newport half the americans go  is it anywhere near the alps  about as near as newport is to the rocky mountains  oh i want to see mont blanc said newman and amsterdam and the rhine and a lot of places venice in particular i have great ideas about venice  ah said mr tristram rising i see i shall have to introduce you to my wife    chapter iii   he performed this ceremony on the following day when by appointment christopher newman went to dine with him mr and mrs tristram lived behind one of those chalkcolored facades which decorate with their pompous sameness the broad avenues manufactured by baron haussmann in the neighborhood of the arc de triomphe their apartment was rich in the modern conveniences and tristram lost no time in calling his visitors attention to their principal household treasures the gaslamps and the furnaceholes whenever you feel homesick he said you must come up here well stick you down before a register under a good big burner and  and you will soon get over your homesickness said mrs tristram  her husband stared his wife often had a tone which he found inscrutable he could not tell for his life whether she was in jest or in earnest the truth is that circumstances had done much to cultivate in mrs tristram a marked tendency to irony her taste on many points differed from that of her husband and though she made frequent concessions it must be confessed that her concessions were not always graceful they were founded upon a vague project she had of some day doing something very positive something a trifle passionate what she meant to do she could by no means have told you but meanwhile nevertheless she was buying a good conscience by installments  it should be added without delay to anticipate misconception that her little scheme of independence did not definitely involve the assistance of another person of the opposite sex she was not saving up virtue to cover the expenses of a flirtation for this there were various reasons to begin with she had a very plain face and she was entirely without illusions as to her appearance she had taken its measure to a hairs breadth she knew the worst and the best she had accepted herself it had not been indeed without a struggle as a young girl she had spent hours with her back to her mirror crying her eyes out and later she had from desperation and bravado adopted the habit of proclaiming herself the most illfavored of women in order that she mightas in common politeness was inevitablebe contradicted and reassured it was since she had come to live in europe that she had begun to take the matter philosophically her observation acutely exercised here had suggested to her that a womans first duty is not to be beautiful but to be pleasing and she encountered so many women who pleased without beauty that she began to feel that she had discovered her mission she had once heard an enthusiastic musician out of patience with a gifted bungler declare that a fine voice is really an obstacle to singing properly and it occurred to her that it might perhaps be equally true that a beautiful face is an obstacle to the acquisition of charming manners mrs tristram then undertook to be exquisitely agreeable and she brought to the task a really touching devotion how well she would have succeeded i am unable to say unfortunately she broke off in the middle her own excuse was the want of encouragement in her immediate circle but i am inclined to think that she had not a real genius for the matter or she would have pursued the charming art for itself the poor lady was very incomplete she fell back upon the harmonies of the toilet which she thoroughly understood and contented herself with dressing in perfection she lived in paris which she pretended to detest because it was only in paris that one could find things to exactly suit ones complexion besides out of paris it was always more or less of a trouble to get tenbutton gloves when she railed at this serviceable city and you asked her where she would prefer to reside she returned some very unexpected answer she would say in copenhagen or in barcelona having while making the tour of europe spent a couple of days at each of these places on the whole with her poetic furbelows and her misshapen intelligent little face she was when you knew her a decidedly interesting woman she was naturally shy and if she had been born a beauty she would having no vanity probably have remained shy now she was both diffident and importunate extremely reserved sometimes with her friends and strangely expansive with strangers she despised her husband despised him too much for she had been perfectly at liberty not to marry him she had been in love with a clever man who had slighted her and she had married a fool in the hope that this thankless wit reflecting on it would conclude that she had no appreciation of merit and that he had flattered himself in supposing that she cared for his own restless discontented visionary without personal ambitions but with a certain avidity of imagination she was as i have said before eminently incomplete she was fullboth for good and for illof beginnings that came to nothing but she had nevertheless morally a spark of the sacred fire  newman was fond under all circumstances of the society of women and now that he was out of his native element and deprived of his habitual interests he turned to it for compensation he took a great fancy to mrs tristram she frankly repaid it and after their first meeting he passed a great many hours in her drawingroom after two or three talks they were fast friends newmans manner with women was peculiar and it required some ingenuity on a ladys part to discover that he admired her he had no gallantry in the usual sense of the term no compliments no graces no speeches very fond of what is called chaffing in his dealings with men he never found himself on a sofa beside a member of the softer sex without feeling extremely serious he was not shy and so far as awkwardness proceeds from a struggle with shyness he was not awkward grave attentive submissive often silent he was simply swimming in a sort of rapture of respect this emotion was not at all theoretic it was not even in a high degree sentimental he had thought very little about the position of women and he was not familiar either sympathetically or otherwise with the image of a president in petticoats his attitude was simply the flower of his general goodnature and a part of his instinctive and genuinely democratic assumption of every ones right to lead an easy life if a shaggy pauper had a right to bed and board and wages and a vote women of course who were weaker than paupers and whose physical tissue was in itself an appeal should be maintained sentimentally at the public expense newman was willing to be taxed for this purpose largely in proportion to his means moreover many of the common traditions with regard to women were with him fresh personal impressions he had never read a novel he had been struck with their acuteness their subtlety their tact their felicity of judgment they seemed to him exquisitely organized if it is true that one must always have in ones work here below a religion or at least an ideal of some sort newman found his metaphysical inspiration in a vague acceptance of final responsibility to some illumined feminine brow  he spent a great deal of time in listening to advice from mrs tristram advice it must be added for which he had never asked he would have been incapable of asking for it for he had no perception of difficulties and consequently no curiosity about remedies the complex parisian world about him seemed a very simple affair it was an immense amazing spectacle but it neither inflamed his imagination nor irritated his curiosity he kept his hands in his pockets looked on goodhumoredly desired to miss nothing important observed a great many things narrowly and never reverted to himself mrs tristrams advice was a part of the show and a more entertaining element in her abundant gossip than the others he enjoyed her talking about himself it seemed a part of her beautiful ingenuity but he never made an application of anything she said or remembered it when he was away from her for herself she appropriated him he was the most interesting thing she had had to think about in many a month she wished to do something with himshe hardly knew what there was so much of him he was so rich and robust so easy friendly welldisposed that he kept her fancy constantly on the alert for the present the only thing she could do was to like him she told him that he was horribly western but in this compliment the adverb was tinged with insincerity she led him about with her introduced him to fifty people and took extreme satisfaction in her conquest newman accepted every proposal shook hands universally and promiscuously and seemed equally unfamiliar with trepidation or with elation tom tristram complained of his wifes avidity and declared that he could never have a clear five minutes with his friend if he had known how things were going to turn out he never would have brought him to the avenue diena the two men formerly had not been intimate but newman remembered his earlier impression of his host and did mrs tristram who had by no means taken him into her confidence but whose secret he presently discovered the justice to admit that her husband was a rather degenerate mortal at twentyfive he had been a good fellow and in this respect he was unchanged but of a man of his age one expected something more people said he was sociable but this was as much a matter of course as for a dipped sponge to expand and it was not a high order of sociability he was a great gossip and tattler and to produce a laugh would hardly have spared the reputation of his aged mother newman had a kindness for old memories but he found it impossible not to perceive that tristram was nowadays a very light weight his only aspirations were to hold out at poker at his club to know the names of all the cocottes to shake hands all round to ply his rosy gullet with truffles and champagne and to create uncomfortable eddies and obstructions among the constituent atoms of the american colony he was shamefully idle spiritless sensual snobbish he irritated our friend by the tone of his allusions to their native country and newman was at a loss to understand why the united states were not good enough for mr tristram he had never been a very conscious patriot but it vexed him to see them treated as little better than a vulgar smell in his friends nostrils and he finally broke out and swore that they were the greatest country in the world that they could put all europe into their breeches pockets and that an american who spoke ill of them ought to be carried home in irons and compelled to live in boston this for newman was putting it very vindictively tristram was a comfortable man to snub he bore no malice and he continued to insist on newmans finishing his evening at the occidental club  christopher newman dined several times in the avenue diena and his host always proposed an early adjournment to this institution mrs tristram protested and declared that her husband exhausted his ingenuity in trying to displease her  oh no i never try my love he answered i know you loathe me quite enough when i take my chance  newman hated to see a husband and wife on these terms and he was sure one or other of them must be very unhappy he knew it was not tristram mrs tristram had a balcony before her windows upon which during the june evenings she was fond of sitting and newman used frankly to say that he preferred the balcony to the club it had a fringe of perfumed plants in tubs and enabled you to look up the broad street and see the arch of triumph vaguely massing its heroic sculptures in the summer starlight sometimes newman kept his promise of following mr tristram in half an hour to the occidental and sometimes he forgot it his hostess asked him a great many questions about himself but on this subject he was an indifferent talker he was not what is called subjective though when he felt that her interest was sincere he made an almost heroic attempt to be he told her a great many things he had done and regaled her with anecdotes of western life she was from philadelphia and with her eight years in paris talked of herself as a languid oriental but some other person was always the hero of the tale by no means always to his advantage and newmans own emotions were but scantily chronicled she had an especial wish to know whether he had ever been in loveseriously passionatelyand failing to gather any satisfaction from his allusions she at last directly inquired he hesitated a while and at last he said no she declared that she was delighted to hear it as it confirmed her private conviction that he was a man of no feeling  really he asked very gravely do you think so how do you recognize a man of feeling  i cant make out said mrs tristram whether you are very simple or very deep  im very deep thats a fact  i believe that if i were to tell you with a certain air that you have no feeling you would implicitly believe me  a certain air said newman try it and see  you would believe me but you would not care said mrs tristram  you have got it all wrong i should care immensely but i shouldnt believe you the fact is i have never had time to feel things i have had to do them to make myself felt  i can imagine that you may have done that tremendously sometimes  yes theres no mistake about that  when you are in a fury it cant be pleasant  i am never in a fury  angry then or displeased  i am never angry and it is so long since i have been displeased that i have quite forgotten it  i dont believe said mrs tristram that you are never angry a man ought to be angry sometimes and you are neither good enough nor bad enough always to keep your temper  i lose it perhaps once in five years  the time is coming round then said his hostess before i have known you six months i shall see you in a fine fury  do you mean to put me into one  i should not be sorry you take things too coolly it exasperates me and then you are too happy you have what must be the most agreeable thing in the world the consciousness of having bought your pleasure beforehand and paid for it you have not a day of reckoning staring you in the face your reckonings are over  well i suppose i am happy said newman meditatively  you have been odiously successful  successful in copper said newman only soso in railroads and a hopeless fizzle in oil  it is very disagreeable to know how americans have made their money now you have the world before you you have only to enjoy  oh i suppose i am very well off said newman only i am tired of having it thrown up at me besides there are several drawbacks i am not intellectual  one doesnt expect it of you mrs tristram answered then in a moment besides you are  well i mean to have a good time whether or no said newman i am not cultivated i am not even educated i know nothing about history or art or foreign tongues or any other learned matters but i am not a fool either and i shall undertake to know something about europe by the time i have done with it i feel something under my ribs here he added in a moment that i cant explaina sort of a mighty hankering a desire to stretch out and haul in  bravo said mrs tristram that is very fine you are the great western barbarian stepping forth in his innocence and might gazing a while at this poor effete old world and then swooping down on it  oh come said newman i am not a barbarian by a good deal i am very much the reverse i have seen barbarians i know what they are  i dont mean that you are a comanche chief or that you wear a blanket and feathers there are different shades  i am a highly civilized man said newman i stick to that if you dont believe it i should like to prove it to you  mrs tristram was silent a while i should like to make you prove it she said at last i should like to put you in a difficult place  pray do said newman  that has a little conceited sound his companion rejoined  oh said newman i have a very good opinion of myself  i wish i could put it to the test give me time and i will and mrs tristram remained silent for some time afterwards as if she was trying to keep her pledge it did not appear that evening that she succeeded but as he was rising to take his leave she passed suddenly as she was very apt to do from the tone of unsparing persiflage to that of almost tremulous sympathy speaking seriously she said i believe in you mr newman you flatter my patriotism  your patriotism christopher demanded  even so it would take too long to explain and you probably would not understand besides you might take itreally you might take it for a declaration but it has nothing to do with you personally its what you represent fortunately you dont know all that or your conceit would increase insufferably  newman stood staring and wondering what under the sun he represented  forgive all my meddlesome chatter and forget my advice it is very silly in me to undertake to tell you what to do when you are embarrassed do as you think best and you will do very well when you are in a difficulty judge for yourself  i shall remember everything you have told me said newman there are so many forms and ceremonies over here  forms and ceremonies are what i mean of course  ah but i want to observe them said newman havent i as good a right as another they dont scare me and you neednt give me leave to violate them i wont take it  that is not what i mean i mean observe them in your own way settle nice questions for yourself cut the knot or untie it as you choose  oh i am sure i shall never fumble over it said newman  the next time that he dined in the avenue diena was a sunday a day on which mr tristram left the cards unshuffled so that there was a trio in the evening on the balcony the talk was of many things and at last mrs tristram suddenly observed to christopher newman that it was high time he should take a wife  listen to her she has the audacity said tristram who on sunday evenings was always rather acrimonious  i dont suppose you have made up your mind not to marry mrs tristram continued  heaven forbid cried newman i am sternly resolved on it  its very easy said tristram fatally easy  well then i suppose you do not mean to wait till you are fifty  on the contrary i am in a great hurry  one would never suppose it do you expect a lady to come and propose to you  no i am willing to propose i think a great deal about it  tell me some of your thoughts  well said newman slowly i want to marry very well  marry a woman of sixty then said tristram  well in what sense  in every sense i shall be hard to please  you must remember that as the french proverb says the most beautiful girl in the world can give but what she has  since you ask me said newman i will say frankly that i want extremely to marry it is time to begin with before i know it i shall be forty and then im lonely and helpless and dull but if i marry now so long as i didnt do it in hot haste when i was twenty i must do it with my eyes open i want to do the thing in handsome style i do not only want to make no mistakes but i want to make a great hit i want to take my pick my wife must be a magnificent woman  voila ce qui sappelle parler cried mrs tristram  oh i have thought an immense deal about it  perhaps you think too much the best thing is simply to fall in love  when i find the woman who pleases me i shall love her enough my wife shall be very comfortable  you are superb theres a chance for the magnificent women  you are not fair newman rejoined you draw a fellow out and put him off guard and then you laugh at him  i assure you said mrs tristram that i am very serious to prove it i will make you a proposal should you like me as they say here to marry you  to hunt up a wife for me  she is already found i will bring you together  oh come said tristram we dont keep a matrimonial bureau he will think you want your commission  present me to a woman who comes up to my notions said newman and i will marry her tomorrow  you have a strange tone about it and i dont quite understand you i didnt suppose you would be so coldblooded and calculating  newman was silent a while well he said at last i want a great woman i stick to that thats one thing i can treat myself to and if it is to be had i mean to have it what else have i toiled and struggled for all these years i have succeeded and now what am i to do with my success to make it perfect as i see it there must be a beautiful woman perched on the pile like a statue on a monument she must be as good as she is beautiful and as clever as she is good i can give my wife a good deal so i am not afraid to ask a good deal myself she shall have everything a woman can desire i shall not even object to her being too good for me she may be cleverer and wiser than i can understand and i shall only be the better pleased i want to possess in a word the best article in the market  why didnt you tell a fellow all this at the outset tristram demanded i have been trying so to make you fond of me  this is very interesting said mrs tristram i like to see a man know his own mind  i have known mine for a long time newman went on i made up my mind tolerably early in life that a beautiful wife was the thing best worth having here below it is the greatest victory over circumstances when i say beautiful i mean beautiful in mind and in manners as well as in person it is a thing every man has an equal right to he may get it if he can he doesnt have to be born with certain faculties on purpose he needs only to be a man then he needs only to use his will and such wits as he has and to try  it strikes me that your marriage is to be rather a matter of vanity  well it is certain said newman that if people notice my wife and admire her i shall be mightily tickled  after this cried mrs tristram call any man modest  but none of them will admire her so much as i  i see you have a taste for splendor  newman hesitated a little and then i honestly believe i have he said  and i suppose you have already looked about you a good deal  a good deal according to opportunity  and you have seen nothing that satisfied you  no said newman half reluctantly i am bound to say in honesty that i have seen nothing that really satisfied me  you remind me of the heroes of the french romantic poets rolla and fortunio and all those other insatiable gentlemen for whom nothing in this world was handsome enough but i see you are in earnest and i should like to help you  who the deuce is it darling that you are going to put upon him tristram cried we know a good many pretty girls thank heaven but magnificent women are not so common  have you any objections to a foreigner his wife continued addressing newman who had tilted back his chair and with his feet on a bar of the balcony railing and his hands in his pockets was looking at the stars  no irish need apply said tristram  newman meditated a while as a foreigner no he said at last i have no prejudices  my dear fellow you have no suspicions cried tristram you dont know what terrible customers these foreign women are especially the magnificent ones how should you like a fair circassian with a dagger in her belt  newman administered a vigorous slap to his knee i would marry a japanese if she pleased me he affirmed  we had better confine ourselves to europe said mrs tristram the only thing is then that the person be in herself to your taste  she is going to offer you an unappreciated governess tristram groaned  assuredly i wont deny that other things being equal i should prefer one of my own countrywomen we should speak the same language and that would be a comfort but i am not afraid of a foreigner besides i rather like the idea of taking in europe too it enlarges the field of selection when you choose from a greater number you can bring your choice to a finer point  you talk like sardanapalus exclaimed tristram  you say all this to the right person said newmans hostess i happen to number among my friends the loveliest woman in the world neither more nor less i dont say a very charming person or a very estimable woman or a very great beauty i say simply the loveliest woman in the world  the deuce cried tristram you have kept very quiet about her were you afraid of me  you have seen her said his wife but you have no perception of such merit as claires  ah her name is claire i give it up  does your friend wish to marry asked newman  not in the least it is for you to make her change her mind it will not be easy she has had one husband and he gave her a low opinion of the species  oh she is a widow then said newman  are you already afraid she was married at eighteen by her parents in the french fashion to a disagreeable old man but he had the good taste to die a couple of years afterward and she is now twentyfive  so she is french  french by her father english by her mother she is really more english than french and she speaks english as well as you or ior rather much better she belongs to the very top of the basket as they say here her family on each side is of fabulous antiquity her mother is the daughter of an english catholic earl her father is dead and since her widowhood she has lived with her mother and a married brother there is another brother younger who i believe is wild they have an old hotel in the rue de luniversite but their fortune is small and they make a common household for economys sake when i was a girl i was put into a convent here for my education while my father made the tour of europe it was a silly thing to do with me but it had the advantage that it made me acquainted with claire de bellegarde she was younger than i but we became fast friends i took a tremendous fancy to her and she returned my passion as far as she could they kept such a tight rein on her that she could do very little and when i left the convent she had to give me up i was not of her monde i am not now either but we sometimes meet they are terrible peopleher monde all mounted upon stilts a mile high and with pedigrees long in proportion it is the skim of the milk of the old noblesse do you know what a legitimist is or an ultramontane go into madame de cintres drawingroom some afternoon at five oclock and you will see the best preserved specimens i say go but no one is admitted who cant show his fifty quarterings  and this is the lady you propose to me to marry asked newman a lady i cant even approach  but you said just now that you recognized no obstacles  newman looked at mrs tristram a while stroking his mustache is she a beauty he demanded  no  oh then its no use  she is not a beauty but she is beautiful two very different things a beauty has no faults in her face the face of a beautiful woman may have faults that only deepen its charm  i remember madame de cintre now said tristram she is as plain as a pikestaff a man wouldnt look at her twice  in saying that he would not look at her twice my husband sufficiently describes her mrs tristram rejoined  is she good is she clever newman asked  she is perfect i wont say more than that when you are praising a person to another who is to know her it is bad policy to go into details i wont exaggerate i simply recommend her among all women i have known she stands alone she is of a different clay  i should like to see her said newman simply  i will try to manage it the only way will be to invite her to dinner i have never invited her before and i dont know that she will come her old feudal countess of a mother rules the family with an iron hand and allows her to have no friends but of her own choosing and to visit only in a certain sacred circle but i can at least ask her  at this moment mrs tristram was interrupted a servant stepped out upon the balcony and announced that there were visitors in the drawingroom when newmans hostess had gone in to receive her friends tom tristram approached his guest  dont put your foot into this my boy he said puffing the last whiffs of his cigar theres nothing in it  newman looked askance at him inquisitive you tell another story eh  i say simply that madame de cintre is a great white doll of a woman who cultivates quiet haughtiness  ah shes haughty eh  she looks at you as if you were so much thin air and cares for you about as much  she is very proud eh  proud as proud as im humble  and not goodlooking  tristram shrugged his shoulders its a kind of beauty you must be intellectual to understand but i must go in and amuse the company  some time elapsed before newman followed his friends into the drawingroom when he at last made his appearance there he remained but a short time and during this period sat perfectly silent listening to a lady to whom mrs tristram had straightway introduced him and who chattered without a pause with the full force of an extraordinarily highpitched voice newman gazed and attended presently he came to bid goodnight to mrs tristram  who is that lady he asked  miss dora finch how do you like her  shes too noisy  she is thought so bright certainly you are fastidious said mrs tristram  newman stood a moment hesitating then at last dont forget about your friend he said madame whatshername the proud beauty ask her to dinner and give me a good notice and with this he departed  some days later he came back it was in the afternoon he found mrs tristram in her drawingroom with her was a visitor a woman young and pretty dressed in white the two ladies had risen and the visitor was apparently taking her leave as newman approached he received from mrs tristram a glance of the most vivid significance which he was not immediately able to interpret  this is a good friend of ours she said turning to her companion mr christopher newman i have spoken of you to him and he has an extreme desire to make your acquaintance if you had consented to come and dine i should have offered him an opportunity  the stranger turned her face toward newman with a smile he was not embarrassed for his unconscious sangfroid was boundless but as he became aware that this was the proud and beautiful madame de cintre the loveliest woman in the world the promised perfection the proposed ideal he made an instinctive movement to gather his wits together through the slight preoccupation that it produced he had a sense of a long fair face and of two eyes that were both brilliant and mild  i should have been most happy said madame de cintre unfortunately as i have been telling mrs tristram i go on monday to the country  newman had made a solemn bow i am very sorry he said  paris is getting too warm madame de cintre added taking her friends hand again in farewell  mrs tristram seemed to have formed a sudden and somewhat venturesome resolution and she smiled more intensely as women do when they take such resolution i want mr newman to know you she said dropping her head on one side and looking at madame de cintres bonnet ribbons  christopher newman stood gravely silent while his native penetration admonished him mrs tristram was determined to force her friend to address him a word of encouragement which should be more than one of the common formulas of politeness and if she was prompted by charity it was by the charity that begins at home madame de cintre was her dearest claire and her especial admiration but madame de cintre had found it impossible to dine with her and madame de cintre should for once be forced gently to render tribute to mrs tristram  it would give me great pleasure she said looking at mrs tristram  thats a great deal cried the latter for madame de cintre to say  i am very much obliged to you said newman mrs tristram can speak better for me than i can speak for myself  madame de cintre looked at him again with the same soft brightness are you to be long in paris she asked  we shall keep him said mrs tristram  but you are keeping me and madame de cintre shook her friends hand  a moment longer said mrs tristram  madame de cintre looked at newman again this time without her smile her eyes lingered a moment will you come and see me she asked  mrs tristram kissed her newman expressed his thanks and she took her leave her hostess went with her to the door and left newman alone a moment presently she returned rubbing her hands it was a fortunate chance she said she had come to decline my invitation you triumphed on the spot making her ask you at the end of three minutes to her house  it was you who triumphed said newman you must not be too hard upon her  mrs tristram stared what do you mean  she did not strike me as so proud i should say she was shy  you are very discriminating and what do you think of her face  its handsome said newman  i should think it was of course you will go and see her  tomorrow cried newman  no not tomorrow the next day that will be sunday she leaves paris on monday if you dont see her it will at least be a beginning and she gave him madame de cintres address  he walked across the seine late in the summer afternoon and made his way through those gray and silent streets of the faubourg st germain whose houses present to the outer world a face as impassive and as suggestive of the concentration of privacy within as the blank walls of eastern seraglios newman thought it a queer way for rich people to live his ideal of grandeur was a splendid facade diffusing its brilliancy outward too irradiating hospitality the house to which he had been directed had a dark dusty painted portal which swung open in answer to his ring it admitted him into a wide graveled court surrounded on three sides with closed windows and with a doorway facing the street approached by three steps and surmounted by a tin canopy the place was all in the shade it answered to newmans conception of a convent the portress could not tell him whether madame de cintre was visible he would please to apply at the farther door he crossed the court a gentleman was sitting bareheaded on the steps of the portico playing with a beautiful pointer he rose as newman approached and as he laid his hand upon the bell said with a smile in english that he was afraid newman would be kept waiting the servants were scattered he himself had been ringing he didnt know what the deuce was in them he was a young man his english was excellent and his smile very frank newman pronounced the name of madame de cintre  i think said the young man that my sister is visible come in and if you will give me your card i will carry it to her myself  newman had been accompanied on his present errand by a slight sentiment i will not say of defiancea readiness for aggression or defense as they might prove needfulbut of reflection goodhumored suspicion he took from his pocket while he stood on the portico a card upon which under his name he had written the words san francisco and while he presented it he looked warily at his interlocutor his glance was singularly reassuring he liked the young mans face it strongly resembled that of madame de cintre he was evidently her brother the young man on his side had made a rapid inspection of newmans person he had taken the card and was about to enter the house with it when another figure appeared on the thresholdan older man of a fine presence wearing evening dress he looked hard at newman and newman looked at him madame de cintre the younger man repeated as an introduction of the visitor the other took the card from his hand read it in a rapid glance looked again at newman from head to foot hesitated a moment and then said gravely but urbanely madame de cintre is not at home  the younger man made a gesture and then turning to newman i am very sorry sir he said  newman gave him a friendly nod to show that he bore him no malice and retraced his steps at the porters lodge he stopped the two men were still standing on the portico  who is the gentleman with the dog he asked of the old woman who reappeared he had begun to learn french  that is monsieur le comte  and the other  that is monsieur le marquis  a marquis said christopher in english which the old woman fortunately did not understand oh then hes not the butler    chapter iv   early one morning before christopher newman was dressed a little old man was ushered into his apartment followed by a youth in a blouse bearing a picture in a brilliant frame newman among the distractions of paris had forgotten m nioche and his accomplished daughter but this was an effective reminder  i am afraid you had given me up sir said the old man after many apologies and salutations we have made you wait so many days you accused us perhaps of inconstancy of bad faith but behold me at last and behold also the pretty madonna place it on a chair my friend in a good light so that monsieur may admire it and m nioche addressing his companion helped him to dispose the work of art  it had been endued with a layer of varnish an inch thick and its frame of an elaborate pattern was at least a foot wide it glittered and twinkled in the morning light and looked to newmans eyes wonderfully splendid and precious it seemed to him a very happy purchase and he felt rich in the possession of it he stood looking at it complacently while he proceeded with his toilet and m nioche who had dismissed his own attendant hovered near smiling and rubbing his hands  it has wonderful finesse he murmured caressingly and here and there are marvelous touches you probably perceive them sir it attracted great attention on the boulevard as we came along and then a gradation of tones thats what it is to know how to paint i dont say it because i am her father sir but as one man of taste addressing another i cannot help observing that you have there an exquisite work it is hard to produce such things and to have to part with them if our means only allowed us the luxury of keeping it i really may say sir and m nioche gave a little feebly insinuating laughi really may say that i envy you you see he added in a moment we have taken the liberty of offering you a frame it increases by a trifle the value of the work and it will save you the annoyanceso great for a person of your delicacyof going about to bargain at the shops  the language spoken by m nioche was a singular compound which i shrink from the attempt to reproduce in its integrity he had apparently once possessed a certain knowledge of english and his accent was oddly tinged with the cockneyism of the british metropolis but his learning had grown rusty with disuse and his vocabulary was defective and capricious he had repaired it with large patches of french with words anglicized by a process of his own and with native idioms literally translated the result in the form in which he in all humility presented it would be scarcely comprehensible to the reader so that i have ventured to trim and sift it newman only half understood it but it amused him and the old mans decent forlornness appealed to his democratic instincts the assumption of a fatality in misery always irritated his strong good natureit was almost the only thing that did so and he felt the impulse to wipe it out as it were with the sponge of his own prosperity the papa of mademoiselle noemie however had apparently on this occasion been vigorously indoctrinated and he showed a certain tremulous eagerness to cultivate unexpected opportunities  how much do i owe you then with the frame asked newman  it will make in all three thousand francs said the old man smiling agreeably but folding his hands in instinctive suppliance  can you give me a receipt  i have brought one said m nioche i took the liberty of drawing it up in case monsieur should happen to desire to discharge his debt and he drew a paper from his pocketbook and presented it to his patron the document was written in a minute fantastic hand and couched in the choicest language  newman laid down the money and m nioche dropped the napoleons one by one solemnly and lovingly into an old leathern purse  and how is your young lady asked newman she made a great impression on me  an impression monsieur is very good monsieur admires her appearance  she is very pretty certainly  alas yes she is very pretty  and what is the harm in her being pretty  m nioche fixed his eyes upon a spot on the carpet and shook his head then looking up at newman with a gaze that seemed to brighten and expand monsieur knows what paris is she is dangerous to beauty when beauty hasnt the sou  ah but that is not the case with your daughter she is rich now  very true we are rich for six months but if my daughter were a plain girl i should sleep better all the same  you are afraid of the young men  the young and the old  she ought to get a husband  ah monsieur one doesnt get a husband for nothing her husband must take her as she is i cant give her a sou but the young men dont see with that eye  oh said newman her talent is in itself a dowry  ah sir it needs first to be converted into specie and m nioche slapped his purse tenderly before he stowed it away the operation doesnt take place every day  well your young men are very shabby said newman thats all i can say they ought to pay for your daughter and not ask money themselves  those are very noble ideas monsieur but what will you have they are not the ideas of this country we want to know what we are about when we marry  how big a portion does your daughter want  m nioche stared as if he wondered what was coming next but he promptly recovered himself at a venture and replied that he knew a very nice young man employed by an insurance company who would content himself with fifteen thousand francs  let your daughter paint half a dozen pictures for me and she shall have her dowry  half a dozen picturesher dowry monsieur is not speaking inconsiderately  if she will make me six or eight copies in the louvre as pretty as that madonna i will pay her the same price said newman  poor m nioche was speechless a moment with amazement and gratitude and then he seized newmans hand pressed it between his own ten fingers and gazed at him with watery eyes as pretty as that they shall be a thousand times prettierthey shall be magnificent sublime ah if i only knew how to paint myself sir so that i might lend a hand what can i do to thank you voyons and he pressed his forehead while he tried to think of something  oh you have thanked me enough said newman  ah here it is sir cried m nioche to express my gratitude i will charge you nothing for the lessons in french conversation  the lessons i had quite forgotten them listening to your english added newman laughing is almost a lesson in french  ah i dont profess to teach english certainly said m nioche but for my own admirable tongue i am still at your service  since you are here then said newman we will begin this is a very good hour i am going to have my coffee come every morning at halfpast nine and have yours with me  monsieur offers me my coffee also cried m nioche truly my beaux jours are coming back  come said newman let us begin the coffee is almighty hot how do you say that in french  every day then for the following three weeks the minutely respectable figure of m nioche made its appearance with a series of little inquiring and apologetic obeisances among the aromatic fumes of newmans morning beverage i dont know how much french our friend learned but as he himself said if the attempt did him no good it could at any rate do him no harm and it amused him it gratified that irregularly sociable side of his nature which had always expressed itself in a relish for ungrammatical conversation and which often even in his busy and preoccupied days had made him sit on rail fences in young western towns in the twilight in gossip hardly less than fraternal with humorous loafers and obscure fortuneseekers he had notions wherever he went about talking with the natives he had been assured and his judgment approved the advice that in traveling abroad it was an excellent thing to look into the life of the country m nioche was very much of a native and though his life might not be particularly worth looking into he was a palpable and smoothlyrounded unit in that picturesque parisian civilization which offered our hero so much easy entertainment and propounded so many curious problems to his inquiring and practical mind newman was fond of statistics he liked to know how things were done it gratified him to learn what taxes were paid what profits were gathered what commercial habits prevailed how the battle of life was fought m nioche as a reduced capitalist was familiar with these considerations and he formulated his information which he was proud to be able to impart in the neatest possible terms and with a pinch of snuff between finger and thumb as a frenchmanquite apart from newmans napoleonsm nioche loved conversation and even in his decay his urbanity had not grown rusty as a frenchman too he could give a clear account of things andstill as a frenchmanwhen his knowledge was at fault he could supply its lapses with the most convenient and ingenious hypotheses the little shrunken financier was intensely delighted to have questions asked him and he scraped together information by frugal processes and took notes in his little greasy pocketbook of incidents which might interest his munificent friend he read old almanacs at the bookstalls on the quays and he began to frequent another cafe where more newspapers were taken and his postprandial demitasse cost him a penny extra and where he used to con the tattered sheets for curious anecdotes freaks of nature and strange coincidences he would relate with solemnity the next morning that a child of five years of age had lately died at bordeaux whose brain had been found to weigh sixty ouncesthe brain of a napoleon or a washington or that madame p charcutiere in the rue de clichy had found in the wadding of an old petticoat the sum of three hundred and sixty francs which she had lost five years before he pronounced his words with great distinctness and sonority and newman assured him that his way of dealing with the french tongue was very superior to the bewildering chatter that he heard in other mouths upon this m nioches accent became more finely trenchant than ever he offered to read extracts from lamartine and he protested that although he did endeavor according to his feeble lights to cultivate refinement of diction monsieur if he wanted the real thing should go to the theatre francais  newman took an interest in french thriftiness and conceived a lively admiration for parisian economies his own economic genius was so entirely for operations on a larger scale and to move at his ease he needed so imperatively the sense of great risks and great prizes that he found an ungrudging entertainment in the spectacle of fortunes made by the aggregation of copper coins and in the minute subdivision of labor and profit he questioned m nioche about his own manner of life and felt a friendly mixture of compassion and respect over the recital of his delicate frugalities the worthy man told him how at one period he and his daughter had supported existence comfortably upon the sum of fifteen sous per diem recently having succeeded in hauling ashore the last floating fragments of the wreck of his fortune his budget had been a trifle more ample but they still had to count their sous very narrowly and m nioche intimated with a sigh that mademoiselle noemie did not bring to this task that zealous cooperation which might have been desired  but what will you have he asked philosophically one is young one is pretty one needs new dresses and fresh gloves one cant wear shabby gowns among the splendors of the louvre  but your daughter earns enough to pay for her own clothes said newman  m nioche looked at him with weak uncertain eyes he would have liked to be able to say that his daughters talents were appreciated and that her crooked little daubs commanded a market but it seemed a scandal to abuse the credulity of this freehanded stranger who without a suspicion or a question had admitted him to equal social rights he compromised and declared that while it was obvious that mademoiselle noemies reproductions of the old masters had only to be seen to be coveted the prices which in consideration of their altogether peculiar degree of finish she felt obliged to ask for them had kept purchasers at a respectful distance poor little one said m nioche with a sigh it is almost a pity that her work is so perfect it would be in her interest to paint less well  but if mademoiselle noemie has this devotion to her art newman once observed why should you have those fears for her that you spoke of the other day  m nioche meditated there was an inconsistency in his position it made him chronically uncomfortable though he had no desire to destroy the goose with the golden eggsnewmans benevolent confidencehe felt a tremulous impulse to speak out all his trouble ah she is an artist my dear sir most assuredly he declared but to tell you the truth she is also a franche coquette i am sorry to say he added in a moment shaking his head with a world of harmless bitterness that she comes honestly by it her mother was one before her  you were not happy with your wife newman asked  m nioche gave half a dozen little backward jerks of his head she was my purgatory monsieur  she deceived you  under my nose year after year i was too stupid and the temptation was too great but i found her out at last i have only been once in my life a man to be afraid of i know it very well it was in that hour nevertheless i dont like to think of it i loved heri cant tell you how much she was a bad woman  she is not living  she has gone to her account  her influence on your daughter then said newman encouragingly is not to be feared  she cared no more for her daughter than for the sole of her shoe but noemie has no need of influence she is sufficient to herself she is stronger than i  she doesnt obey you eh  she cant obey monsieur since i dont command what would be the use it would only irritate her and drive her to some coup de tete she is very clever like her mother she would waste no time about it as a childwhen i was happy or supposed i wasshe studied drawing and painting with firstclass professors and they assured me she had a talent i was delighted to believe it and when i went into society i used to carry her pictures with me in a portfolio and hand them round to the company i remember once a lady thought i was offering them for sale and i took it very ill we dont know what we may come to then came my dark days and my explosion with madame nioche noemie had no more twentyfranc lessons but in the course of time when she grew older and it became highly expedient that she should do something that would help to keep us alive she bethought herself of her palette and brushes some of our friends in the quartier pronounced the idea fantastic they recommended her to try bonnet making to get a situation in a shop orif she was more ambitiousto advertise for a place of dame de compagnie she did advertise and an old lady wrote her a letter and bade her come and see her the old lady liked her and offered her her living and six hundred francs a year but noemie discovered that she passed her life in her armchair and had only two visitors her confessor and her nephew the confessor very strict and the nephew a man of fifty with a broken nose and a government clerkship of two thousand francs she threw her old lady over bought a paintbox a canvas and a new dress and went and set up her easel in the louvre there in one place and another she has passed the last two years i cant say it has made us millionaires but noemie tells me that rome was not built in a day that she is making great progress that i must leave her to her own devices the fact is without prejudice to her genius that she has no idea of burying herself alive she likes to see the world and to be seen she says herself that she cant work in the dark with her appearance it is very natural only i cant help worrying and trembling and wondering what may happen to her there all alone day after day amid all that coming and going of strangers i cant be always at her side i go with her in the morning and i come to fetch her away but she wont have me near her in the interval she says i make her nervous as if it didnt make me nervous to wander about all day without her ah if anything were to happen to her cried m nioche clenching his two fists and jerking back his head again portentously  oh i guess nothing will happen said newman  i believe i should shoot her said the old man solemnly  oh well marry her said newman since thats how you manage it and i will go and see her tomorrow at the louvre and pick out the pictures she is to copy for me  m nioche had brought newman a message from his daughter in acceptance of his magnificent commission the young lady declaring herself his most devoted servant promising her most zealous endeavor and regretting that the proprieties forbade her coming to thank him in person the morning after the conversation just narrated newman reverted to his intention of meeting mademoiselle noemie at the louvre m nioche appeared preoccupied and left his budget of anecdotes unopened he took a great deal of snuff and sent certain oblique appealing glances toward his stalwart pupil at last when he was taking his leave he stood a moment after he had polished his hat with his calico pockethandkerchief with his small pale eyes fixed strangely upon newman  whats the matter our hero demanded  excuse the solicitude of a fathers heart said m nioche you inspire me with boundless confidence but i cant help giving you a warning after all you are a man you are young and at liberty let me beseech you then to respect the innocence of mademoiselle nioche  newman had wondered what was coming and at this he broke into a laugh he was on the point of declaring that his own innocence struck him as the more exposed but he contented himself with promising to treat the young girl with nothing less than veneration he found her waiting for him seated upon the great divan in the salon carre she was not in her workingday costume but wore her bonnet and gloves and carried her parasol in honor of the occasion these articles had been selected with unerring taste and a fresher prettier image of youthful alertness and blooming discretion was not to be conceived she made newman a most respectful curtsey and expressed her gratitude for his liberality in a wonderfully graceful little speech it annoyed him to have a charming young girl stand there thanking him and it made him feel uncomfortable to think that this perfect young lady with her excellent manners and her finished intonation was literally in his pay he assured her in such french as he could muster that the thing was not worth mentioning and that he considered her services a great favor  whenever you please then said mademoiselle noemie we will pass the review  they walked slowly round the room then passed into the others and strolled about for half an hour mademoiselle noemie evidently relished her situation and had no desire to bring her public interview with her strikinglooking patron to a close newman perceived that prosperity agreed with her the little thinlipped peremptory air with which she had addressed her father on the occasion of their former meeting had given place to the most lingering and caressing tones  what sort of pictures do you desire she asked sacred or profane  oh a few of each said newman but i want something bright and gay  something gay there is nothing very gay in this solemn old louvre but we will see what we can find you speak french today like a charm my father has done wonders  oh i am a bad subject said newman i am too old to learn a language  too old quelle folie cried mademoiselle noemie with a clear shrill laugh you are a very young man and how do you like my father  he is a very nice old gentleman he never laughs at my blunders  he is very comme il faut my papa said mademoiselle noemie and as honest as the day oh an exceptional probity you could trust him with millions  do you always obey him asked newman  obey him  do you do what he bids you  the young girl stopped and looked at him she had a spot of color in either cheek and in her expressive french eye which projected too much for perfect beauty there was a slight gleam of audacity why do you ask me that she demanded  because i want to know  you think me a bad girl and she gave a strange smile  newman looked at her a moment he saw that she was pretty but he was not in the least dazzled he remembered poor m nioches solicitude for her innocence and he laughed as his eyes met hers her face was the oddest mixture of youth and maturity and beneath her candid brow her searching little smile seemed to contain a world of ambiguous intentions she was pretty enough certainly to make her father nervous but as regards her innocence newman felt ready on the spot to affirm that she had never parted with it she had simply never had any she had been looking at the world since she was ten years old and he would have been a wise man who could tell her any secrets in her long mornings at the louvre she had not only studied madonnas and st johns she had kept an eye upon all the variously embodied human nature around her and she had formed her conclusions in a certain sense it seemed to newman m nioche might be at rest his daughter might do something very audacious but she would never do anything foolish newman with his longdrawn leisurely smile and his even unhurried utterance was always mentally taking his time and he asked himself now what she was looking at him in that way for he had an idea that she would like him to confess that he did think her a bad girl  oh no he said at last it would be very bad manners in me to judge you that way i dont know you  but my father has complained to you said mademoiselle noemie  he says you are a coquette  he shouldnt go about saying such things to gentlemen but you dont believe it  no said newman gravely i dont believe it  she looked at him again gave a shrug and a smile and then pointed to a small italian picture a marriage of st catherine how should you like that she asked  it doesnt please me said newman the young lady in the yellow dress is not pretty  ah you are a great connoisseur murmured mademoiselle noemie  in pictures oh no i know very little about them  in pretty women then  in that i am hardly better  what do you say to that then the young girl asked indicating a superb italian portrait of a lady i will do it for you on a smaller scale  on a smaller scale why not as large as the original  mademoiselle noemie glanced at the glowing splendor of the venetian masterpiece and gave a little toss of her head i dont like that woman she looks stupid  i do like her said newman decidedly i must have her as large as life and just as stupid as she is there  the young girl fixed her eyes on him again and with her mocking smile it certainly ought to be easy for me to make her look stupid she said  what do you mean asked newman puzzled  she gave another little shrug seriously then you want that portraitthe golden hair the purple satin the pearl necklace the two magnificent arms  everythingjust as it is  would nothing else do instead  oh i want some other things but i want that too  mademoiselle noemie turned away a moment walked to the other side of the hall and stood there looking vaguely about her at last she came back it must be charming to be able to order pictures at such a rate venetian portraits as large as life you go at it en prince and you are going to travel about europe that way  yes i intend to travel said newman  ordering buying spending money  of course i shall spend some money  you are very happy to have it and you are perfectly free  how do you mean free  you have nothing to bother youno family no wife no fiancee  yes i am tolerably free  you are very happy said mademoiselle noemie gravely  je le veux bien said newman proving that he had learned more french than he admitted  and how long shall you stay in paris the young girl went on  only a few days more  why do you go away  it is getting hot and i must go to switzerland  to switzerland thats a fine country i would give my new parasol to see it lakes and mountains romantic valleys and icy peaks oh i congratulate you meanwhile i shall sit here through all the hot summer daubing at your pictures  oh take your time about it said newman do them at your convenience  they walked farther and looked at a dozen other things newman pointed out what pleased him and mademoiselle noemie generally criticised it and proposed something else then suddenly she diverged and began to talk about some personal matter  what made you speak to me the other day in the salon carre she abruptly asked  i admired your picture  but you hesitated a long time  oh i do nothing rashly said newman  yes i saw you watching me but i never supposed you were going to speak to me i never dreamed i should be walking about here with you today its very curious  it is very natural observed newman  oh i beg your pardon not to me coquette as you think me i have never walked about in public with a gentleman before what was my father thinking of when he consented to our interview  he was repenting of his unjust accusations replied newman  mademoiselle noemie remained silent at last she dropped into a seat well then for those five it is fixed she said five copies as brilliant and beautiful as i can make them we have one more to choose shouldnt you like one of those great rubensesthe marriage of marie de medicis just look at it and see how handsome it is  oh yes i should like that said newman finish off with that  finish off with thatgood and she laughed she sat a moment looking at him and then she suddenly rose and stood before him with her hands hanging and clasped in front of her i dont understand you she said with a smile i dont understand how a man can be so ignorant  oh i am ignorant certainly said newman putting his hands into his pockets  its ridiculous i dont know how to paint  you dont know how  i paint like a cat i cant draw a straight line i never sold a picture until you bought that thing the other day and as she offered this surprising information she continued to smile  newman burst into a laugh why do you tell me this he asked  because it irritates me to see a clever man blunder so my pictures are grotesque  and the one i possess  that one is rather worse than usual  well said newman i like it all the same  she looked at him askance that is a very pretty thing to say she answered but it is my duty to warn you before you go farther this order of yours is impossible you know what do you take me for it is work for ten men you pick out the six most difficult pictures in the louvre and you expect me to go to work as if i were sitting down to hem a dozen pocket handkerchiefs i wanted to see how far you would go  newman looked at the young girl in some perplexity in spite of the ridiculous blunder of which he stood convicted he was very far from being a simpleton and he had a lively suspicion that mademoiselle noemies sudden frankness was not essentially more honest than her leaving him in error would have been she was playing a game she was not simply taking pity on his aesthetic verdancy what was it she expected to win the stakes were high and the risk was great the prize therefore must have been commensurate but even granting that the prize might be great newman could not resist a movement of admiration for his companions intrepidity she was throwing away with one hand whatever she might intend to do with the other a very handsome sum of money  are you joking he said or are you serious  oh serious cried mademoiselle noemie but with her extraordinary smile  i know very little about pictures or how they are painted if you cant do all that of course you cant do what you can then  it will be very bad said mademoiselle noemie  oh said newman laughing if you are determined it shall be bad of course it will but why do you go on painting badly  i can do nothing else i have no real talent  you are deceiving your father then  the young girl hesitated a moment he knows very well  no newman declared i am sure he believes in you  he is afraid of me i go on painting badly as you say because i want to learn i like it at any rate and i like being here it is a place to come to every day it is better than sitting in a little dark damp room on a court or selling buttons and whalebones over a counter  of course it is much more amusing said newman but for a poor girl isnt it rather an expensive amusement  oh i am very wrong there is no doubt about that said mademoiselle noemie but rather than earn my living as some girls dotoiling with a needle in little black holes out of the worldi would throw myself into the seine  there is no need of that newman answered your father told you my offer  your offer  he wants you to marry and i told him i would give you a chance to earn your dot  he told me all about it and you see the account i make of it why should you take such an interest in my marriage  my interest was in your father i hold to my offer do what you can and i will buy what you paint  she stood for some time meditating with her eyes on the ground at last looking up what sort of a husband can you get for twelve thousand francs she asked  your father tells me he knows some very good young men  grocers and butchers and little maitres de cafes i will not marry at all if i cant marry well  i would advise you not to be too fastidious said newman thats all the advice i can give you  i am very much vexed at what i have said cried the young girl it has done me no good but i couldnt help it  what good did you expect it to do you  i couldnt help it simply  newman looked at her a moment well your pictures may be bad he said but you are too clever for me nevertheless i dont understand you goodby and he put out his hand  she made no response and offered him no farewell she turned away and seated herself sidewise on a bench leaning her head on the back of her hand which clasped the rail in front of the pictures newman stood a moment and then turned on his heel and retreated he had understood her better than he confessed this singular scene was a practical commentary upon her fathers statement that she was a frank coquette    chapter v   when newman related to mrs tristram his fruitless visit to madame de cintre she urged him not to be discouraged but to carry out his plan of seeing europe during the summer and return to paris in the autumn and settle down comfortably for the winter madame de cintre will keep she said she is not a woman who will marry from one day to another newman made no distinct affirmation that he would come back to paris he even talked about rome and the nile and abstained from professing any especial interest in madame de cintres continued widowhood this circumstance was at variance with his habitual frankness and may perhaps be regarded as characteristic of the incipient stage of that passion which is more particularly known as the mysterious one the truth is that the expression of a pair of eyes that were at once brilliant and mild had become very familiar to his memory and he would not easily have resigned himself to the prospect of never looking into them again he communicated to mrs tristram a number of other facts of greater or less importance as you choose but on this particular point he kept his own counsel he took a kindly leave of m nioche having assured him that so far as he was concerned the bluecloaked madonna herself might have been present at his interview with mademoiselle noemie and left the old man nursing his breastpocket in an ecstasy which the acutest misfortune might have been defied to dissipate newman then started on his travels with all his usual appearance of slowstrolling leisure and all his essential directness and intensity of aim no man seemed less in a hurry and yet no man achieved more in brief periods he had certain practical instincts which served him excellently in his trade of tourist he found his way in foreign cities by divination his memory was excellent when once his attention had been at all cordially given and he emerged from dialogues in foreign tongues of which he had formally not understood a word in full possession of the particular fact he had desired to ascertain his appetite for facts was capacious and although many of those which he noted would have seemed woefully dry and colorless to the ordinary sentimental traveler a careful inspection of the list would have shown that he had a soft spot in his imagination in the charming city of brusselshis first stoppingplace after leaving parishe asked a great many questions about the streetcars and took extreme satisfaction in the reappearance of this familiar symbol of american civilization but he was also greatly struck with the beautiful gothic tower of the hotel de ville and wondered whether it would not be possible to get up something like it in san francisco he stood for half an hour in the crowded square before this edifice in imminent danger from carriagewheels listening to a toothless old cicerone mumble in broken english the touching history of counts egmont and horn and he wrote the names of these gentlemenfor reasons best known to himselfon the back of an old letter  at the outset on his leaving paris his curiosity had not been intense passive entertainment in the champs elysees and at the theatres seemed about as much as he need expect of himself and although as he had said to tristram he wanted to see the mysterious satisfying best he had not the grand tour in the least on his conscience and was not given to crossquestioning the amusement of the hour he believed that europe was made for him and not he for europe he had said that he wanted to improve his mind but he would have felt a certain embarrassment a certain shame evena false shame possiblyif he had caught himself looking intellectually into the mirror neither in this nor in any other respect had newman a high sense of responsibility it was his prime conviction that a mans life should be easy and that he should be able to resolve privilege into a matter of course the world to his sense was a great bazaar where one might stroll about and purchase handsome things but he was no more conscious individually of social pressure than he admitted the existence of such a thing as an obligatory purchase he had not only a dislike but a sort of moral mistrust of uncomfortable thoughts and it was both uncomfortable and slightly contemptible to feel obliged to square ones self with a standard ones standard was the ideal of ones own goodhumored prosperity the prosperity which enabled one to give as well as take to expand without bothering about itwithout shiftless timidity on one side or loquacious eagerness on the otherto the full compass of what he would have called a pleasant experience was newmans most definite programme of life he had always hated to hurry to catch railroad trains and yet he had always caught them and just so an undue solicitude for culture seemed a sort of silly dawdling at the station a proceeding properly confined to women foreigners and other unpractical persons all this admitted newman enjoyed his journey when once he had fairly entered the current as profoundly as the most zealous dilettante ones theories after all matter little it is ones humor that is the great thing our friend was intelligent and he could not help that he lounged through belgium and holland and the rhineland through switzerland and northern italy planning about nothing but seeing everything the guides and valets de place found him an excellent subject he was always approachable for he was much addicted to standing about in the vestibules and porticos of inns and he availed himself little of the opportunities for impressive seclusion which are so liberally offered in europe to gentlemen who travel with long purses when an excursion a church a gallery a ruin was proposed to him the first thing newman usually did after surveying his postulant in silence from head to foot was to sit down at a little table and order something to drink the cicerone during this process usually retreated to a respectful distance otherwise i am not sure that newman would not have bidden him sit down and have a glass also and tell him as an honest fellow whether his church or his gallery was really worth a mans trouble at last he rose and stretched his long legs beckoned to the man of monuments looked at his watch and fixed his eye on his adversary what is it he asked how far and whatever the answer was although he sometimes seemed to hesitate he never declined he stepped into an open cab made his conductor sit beside him to answer questions bade the driver go fast he had a particular aversion to slow driving and rolled in all probability through a dusty suburb to the goal of his pilgrimage if the goal was a disappointment if the church was meagre or the ruin a heap of rubbish newman never protested or berated his cicerone he looked with an impartial eye upon great monuments and small made the guide recite his lesson listened to it religiously asked if there was nothing else to be seen in the neighborhood and drove back again at a rattling pace it is to be feared that his perception of the difference between good architecture and bad was not acute and that he might sometimes have been seen gazing with culpable serenity at inferior productions ugly churches were a part of his pastime in europe as well as beautiful ones and his tour was altogether a pastime but there is sometimes nothing like the imagination of these people who have none and newman now and then in an unguided stroll in a foreign city before some lonely sadtowered church or some angular image of one who had rendered civic service in an unknown past had felt a singular inward tremor it was not an excitement or a perplexity it was a placid fathomless sense of diversion  he encountered by chance in holland a young american with whom for a time he formed a sort of travelers partnership they were men of a very different cast but each in his way was so good a fellow that for a few weeks at least it seemed something of a pleasure to share the chances of the road newmans comrade whose name was babcock was a young unitarian minister a small spare neatlyattired man with a strikingly candid physiognomy he was a native of dorchester massachusetts and had spiritual charge of a small congregation in another suburb of the new england metropolis his digestion was weak and he lived chiefly on graham bread and hominya regimen to which he was so much attached that his tour seemed to him destined to be blighted when on landing on the continent he found that these delicacies did not flourish under the table dhote system in paris he had purchased a bag of hominy at an establishment which called itself an american agency and at which the new york illustrated papers were also to be procured and he had carried it about with him and shown extreme serenity and fortitude in the somewhat delicate position of having his hominy prepared for him and served at anomalous hours at the hotels he successively visited newman had once spent a morning in the course of business at mr babcocks birthplace and for reasons too recondite to unfold his visit there always assumed in his mind a jocular cast to carry out his joke which certainly seems poor so long as it is not explained he used often to address his companion as dorchester fellowtravelers very soon grow intimate but it is highly improbable that at home these extremely dissimilar characters would have found any very convenient points of contact they were indeed as different as possible newman who never reflected on such matters accepted the situation with great equanimity but babcock used to meditate over it privately used often indeed to retire to his room early in the evening for the express purpose of considering it conscientiously and impartially he was not sure that it was a good thing for him to associate with our hero whose way of taking life was so little his own newman was an excellent generous fellow mr babcock sometimes said to himself that he was a noble fellow and certainly it was impossible not to like him but would it not be desirable to try to exert an influence upon him to try to quicken his moral life and sharpen his sense of duty he liked everything he accepted everything he found amusement in everything he was not discriminating he had not a high tone the young man from dorchester accused newman of a fault which he considered very grave and which he did his best to avoid what he would have called a want of moral reaction poor mr babcock was extremely fond of pictures and churches and carried mrs jamesons works about in his trunk he delighted in aesthetic analysis and received peculiar impressions from everything he saw but nevertheless in his secret soul he detested europe and he felt an irritating need to protest against newmans gross intellectual hospitality mr babcocks moral malaise i am afraid lay deeper than where any definition of mine can reach it he mistrusted the european temperament he suffered from the european climate he hated the european dinnerhour european life seemed to him unscrupulous and impure and yet he had an exquisite sense of beauty and as beauty was often inextricably associated with the above displeasing conditions as he wished above all to be just and dispassionate and as he was furthermore extremely devoted to culture he could not bring himself to decide that europe was utterly bad but he thought it was very bad indeed and his quarrel with newman was that this unregulated epicure had a sadly insufficient perception of the bad babcock himself really knew as little about the bad in any quarter of the world as a nursing infant his most vivid realization of evil had been the discovery that one of his college classmates who was studying architecture in paris had a love affair with a young woman who did not expect him to marry her babcock had related this incident to newman and our hero had applied an epithet of an unflattering sort to the young girl the next day his companion asked him whether he was very sure he had used exactly the right word to characterize the young architects mistress newman stared and laughed there are a great many words to express that idea he said you can take your choice  oh i mean said babcock was she possibly not to be considered in a different light dont you think she really expected him to marry her  i am sure i dont know said newman very likely she did i have no doubt she is a grand woman and he began to laugh again  i didnt mean that either said babcock i was only afraid that i might have seemed yesterday not to remembernot to consider well i think i will write to percival about it  and he had written to percival who answered him in a really impudent fashion and he had reflected that it was somehow raw and reckless in newman to assume in that offhand manner that the young woman in paris might be grand the brevity of newmans judgments very often shocked and discomposed him he had a way of damning people without farther appeal or of pronouncing them capital company in the face of uncomfortable symptoms which seemed unworthy of a man whose conscience had been properly cultivated and yet poor babcock liked him and remembered that even if he was sometimes perplexing and painful this was not a reason for giving him up goethe recommended seeing human nature in the most various forms and mr babcock thought goethe perfectly splendid he often tried in odd halfhours of conversation to infuse into newman a little of his own spiritual starch but newmans personal texture was too loose to admit of stiffening his mind could no more hold principles than a sieve can hold water he admired principles extremely and thought babcock a mighty fine little fellow for having so many he accepted all that his highstrung companion offered him and put them away in what he supposed to be a very safe place but poor babcock never afterwards recognized his gifts among the articles that newman had in daily use  they traveled together through germany and into switzerland where for three or four weeks they trudged over passes and lounged upon blue lakes at last they crossed the simplon and made their way to venice mr babcock had become gloomy and even a trifle irritable he seemed moody absent preoccupied he got his plans into a tangle and talked one moment of doing one thing and the next of doing another newman led his usual life made acquaintances took his ease in the galleries and churches spent an unconscionable amount of time in strolling in the piazza san marco bought a great many bad pictures and for a fortnight enjoyed venice grossly one evening coming back to his inn he found babcock waiting for him in the little garden beside it the young man walked up to him looking very dismal thrust out his hand and said with solemnity that he was afraid they must part newman expressed his surprise and regret and asked why a parting had became necessary dont be afraid im tired of you he said  you are not tired of me demanded babcock fixing him with his clear gray eye  why the deuce should i be you are a very plucky fellow besides i dont grow tired of things  we dont understand each other said the young minister  dont i understand you cried newman why i hoped i did but what if i dont wheres the harm  i dont understand you said babcock and he sat down and rested his head on his hand and looked up mournfully at his immeasurable friend  oh lord i dont mind that cried newman with a laugh  but its very distressing to me it keeps me in a state of unrest it irritates me i cant settle anything i dont think its good for me  you worry too much thats whats the matter with you said newman  of course it must seem so to you you think i take things too hard and i think you take things too easily we can never agree  but we have agreed very well all along  no i havent agreed said babcock shaking his head i am very uncomfortable i ought to have separated from you a month ago  oh horrors ill agree to anything cried newman  mr babcock buried his head in both hands at last looking up i dont think you appreciate my position he said i try to arrive at the truth about everything and then you go too fast for me you are too passionate too extravagant i feel as if i ought to go over all this ground we have traversed again by myself alone i am afraid i have made a great many mistakes  oh you neednt give so many reasons said newman you are simply tired of my company you have a good right to be  no no i am not tired cried the pestered young divine it is very wrong to be tired  i give it up laughed newman but of course it will never do to go on making mistakes go your way by all means i shall miss you but you have seen i make friends very easily you will be lonely yourself but drop me a line when you feel like it and i will wait for you anywhere  i think i will go back to milan i am afraid i didnt do justice to luini  poor luini said newman  i mean that i am afraid i overestimated him i dont think that he is a painter of the first rank  luini newman exclaimed why hes enchantinghes magnificent there is something in his genius that is like a beautiful woman it gives one the same feeling  mr babcock frowned and winced and it must be added that this was for newman an unusually metaphysical flight but in passing through milan he had taken a great fancy to the painter there you are again said mr babcock yes we had better separate and on the morrow he retraced his steps and proceeded to tone down his impressions of the great lombard artist  a few days afterwards newman received a note from his late companion which ran as follows  my dear mr newmani am afraid that my conduct at venice a week ago seemed to you strange and ungrateful and i wish to explain my position which as i said at the time i do not think you appreciate i had long had it on my mind to propose that we should part company and this step was not really so abrupt as it seemed in the first place you know i am traveling in europe on funds supplied by my congregation who kindly offered me a vacation and an opportunity to enrich my mind with the treasures of nature and art in the old world i feel therefore as if i ought to use my time to the very best advantage i have a high sense of responsibility you appear to care only for the pleasure of the hour and you give yourself up to it with a violence which i confess i am not able to emulate i feel as if i must arrive at some conclusion and fix my belief on certain points art and life seem to me intensely serious things and in our travels in europe we should especially remember the immense seriousness of art you seem to hold that if a thing amuses you for the moment that is all you need ask for it and your relish for mere amusement is also much higher than mine you put however a kind of reckless confidence into your pleasure which at times i confess has seemed to meshall i say italmost cynical your way at any rate is not my way and it is unwise that we should attempt any longer to pull together and yet let me add that i know there is a great deal to be said for your way i have felt its attraction in your society very strongly but for this i should have left you long ago but i was so perplexed i hope i have not done wrong i feel as if i had a great deal of lost time to make up i beg you take all this as i mean it which heaven knows is not invidiously i have a great personal esteem for you and hope that some day when i have recovered my balance we shall meet again i hope you will continue to enjoy your travels only do remember that life and art are extremely serious believe me your sincere friend and wellwisher  benjamin babcock  p s i am greatly perplexed by luini   this letter produced in newmans mind a singular mixture of exhilaration and awe at first mr babcocks tender conscience seemed to him a capital farce and his traveling back to milan only to get into a deeper muddle appeared as the reward of his pedantry exquisitely and ludicrously just then newman reflected that these are mighty mysteries that possibly he himself was indeed that baleful and barely mentionable thing a cynic and that his manner of considering the treasures of art and the privileges of life was probably very base and immoral newman had a great contempt for immorality and that evening for a good half hour as he sat watching the starsheen on the warm adriatic he felt rebuked and depressed he was at a loss how to answer babcocks letter his good nature checked his resenting the young ministers lofty admonitions and his tough inelastic sense of humor forbade his taking them seriously he wrote no answer at all but a day or two afterward he found in a curiosity shop a grotesque little statuette in ivory of the sixteenth century which he sent off to babcock without a commentary it represented a gaunt asceticlooking monk in a tattered gown and cowl kneeling with clasped hands and pulling a portentously long face it was a wonderfully delicate piece of carving and in a moment through one of the rents of his gown you espied a fat capon hung round the monks waist in newmans intention what did the figure symbolize did it mean that he was going to try to be as hightoned as the monk looked at first but that he feared he should succeed no better than the friar on a closer inspection proved to have done it is not supposable that he intended a satire upon babcocks own asceticism for this would have been a truly cynical stroke he made his late companion at any rate a very valuable little present  newman on leaving venice went through the tyrol to vienna and then returned westward through southern germany the autumn found him at badenbaden where he spent several weeks the place was charming and he was in no hurry to depart besides he was looking about him and deciding what to do for the winter his summer had been very full and he sat under the great trees beside the miniature river that trickles past the baden flowerbeds he slowly rummaged it over he had seen and done a great deal enjoyed and observed a great deal he felt older and yet he felt younger too he remembered mr babcock and his desire to form conclusions and he remembered also that he had profited very little by his friends exhortation to cultivate the same respectable habit could he not scrape together a few conclusions badenbaden was the prettiest place he had seen yet and orchestral music in the evening under the stars was decidedly a great institution this was one of his conclusions but he went on to reflect that he had done very wisely to pull up stakes and come abroad this seeing of the world was a very interesting thing he had learned a great deal he couldnt say just what but he had it there under his hatband he had done what he wanted he had seen the great things and he had given his mind a chance to improve if it would he cheerfully believed that it had improved yes this seeing of the world was very pleasant and he would willingly do a little more of it thirtysix years old as he was he had a handsome stretch of life before him yet and he need not begin to count his weeks where should he take the world next i have said he remembered the eyes of the lady whom he had found standing in mrs tristrams drawingroom four months had elapsed and he had not forgotten them yet he had lookedhe had made a point of lookinginto a great many other eyes in the interval but the only ones he thought of now were madame de cintres if he wanted to see more of the world should he find it in madame de cintres eyes he would certainly find something there call it this world or the next throughout these rather formless meditations he sometimes thought of his past life and the long array of years they had begun so early during which he had had nothing in his head but enterprise they seemed far away now for his present attitude was more than a holiday it was almost a rupture he had told tristram that the pendulum was swinging back and it appeared that the backward swing had not yet ended still enterprise which was over in the other quarter wore to his mind a different aspect at different hours in its train a thousand forgotten episodes came trooping back into his memory some of them he looked complacently enough in the face from some he averted his head they were old efforts old exploits antiquated examples of smartness and sharpness some of them as he looked at them he felt decidedly proud of he admired himself as if he had been looking at another man and in fact many of the qualities that make a great deed were there the decision the resolution the courage the celerity the clear eye and the strong hand of certain other achievements it would be going too far to say that he was ashamed of them for newman had never had a stomach for dirty work he was blessed with a natural impulse to disfigure with a direct unreasoning blow the comely visage of temptation and certainly in no man could a want of integrity have been less excusable newman knew the crooked from the straight at a glance and the former had cost him first and last a great many moments of lively disgust but none the less some of his memories seemed to wear at present a rather graceless and sordid mien and it struck him that if he had never done anything very ugly he had never on the other hand done anything particularly beautiful he had spent his years in the unremitting effort to add thousands to thousands and now that he stood well outside of it the business of moneygetting appeared tolerably dry and sterile it is very well to sneer at moneygetting after you have filled your pockets and newman it may be said should have begun somewhat earlier to moralize thus delicately to this it may be answered that he might have made another fortune if he chose and we ought to add that he was not exactly moralizing it had come back to him simply that what he had been looking at all summer was a very rich and beautiful world and that it had not all been made by sharp railroad men and stockbrokers  during his stay at badenbaden he received a letter from mrs tristram scolding him for the scanty tidings he had sent to his friends of the avenue diena and begging to be definitely informed that he had not concocted any horrid scheme for wintering in outlying regions but was coming back sanely and promptly to the most comfortable city in the world newmans answer ran as follows  i supposed you knew i was a miserable letterwriter and didnt expect anything of me i dont think i have written twenty letters of pure friendship in my whole life in america i conducted my correspondence altogether by telegrams this is a letter of pure friendship you have got hold of a curiosity and i hope you will value it you want to know everything that has happened to me these three months the best way to tell you i think would be to send you my half dozen guidebooks with my pencilmarks in the margin wherever you find a scratch or a cross or a beautiful or a so true or a too thin you may know that i have had a sensation of some sort or other that has been about my history ever since i left you belgium holland switzerland germany italy i have been through the whole list and i dont think i am any the worse for it i know more about madonnas and churchsteeples than i supposed any man could i have seen some very pretty things and shall perhaps talk them over this winter by your fireside you see my face is not altogether set against paris i have had all kinds of plans and visions but your letter has blown most of them away lappetit vient en mangeant says the french proverb and i find that the more i see of the world the more i want to see now that i am in the shafts why shouldnt i trot to the end of the course sometimes i think of the far east and keep rolling the names of eastern cities under my tongue damascus and bagdad medina and mecca i spent a week last month in the company of a returned missionary who told me i ought to be ashamed to be loafing about europe when there are such big things to be seen out there i do want to explore but i think i would rather explore over in the rue de luniversite do you ever hear from that pretty lady if you can get her to promise she will be at home the next time i call i will go back to paris straight i am more than ever in the state of mind i told you about that evening i want a firstclass wife i have kept an eye on all the pretty girls i have come across this summer but none of them came up to my notion or anywhere near it i should have enjoyed all this a thousand times more if i had had the lady just mentioned by my side the nearest approach to her was a unitarian minister from boston who very soon demanded a separation for incompatibility of temper he told me i was lowminded immoral a devotee of art for artwhatever that is all of which greatly afflicted me for he was really a sweet little fellow but shortly afterwards i met an englishman with whom i struck up an acquaintance which at first seemed to promise wella very bright man who writes in the london papers and knows paris nearly as well as tristram we knocked about for a week together but he very soon gave me up in disgust i was too virtuous by half i was too stern a moralist he told me in a friendly way that i was cursed with a conscience that i judged things like a methodist and talked about them like an old lady this was rather bewildering which of my two critics was i to believe i didnt worry about it and very soon made up my mind they were both idiots but there is one thing in which no one will ever have the impudence to pretend i am wrong that is in being your faithful friend  c n    chapter vi   newman gave up damascus and bagdad and returned to paris before the autumn was over he established himself in some rooms selected for him by tom tristram in accordance with the latters estimate of what he called his social position when newman learned that his social position was to be taken into account he professed himself utterly incompetent and begged tristram to relieve him of the care i didnt know i had a social position he said and if i have i havent the smallest idea what it is isnt a social position knowing some two or three thousand people and inviting them to dinner i know you and your wife and little old mr nioche who gave me french lessons last spring can i invite you to dinner to meet each other if i can you must come tomorrow  that is not very grateful to me said mrs tristram who introduced you last year to every creature i know  so you did i had quite forgotten but i thought you wanted me to forget said newman with that tone of simple deliberateness which frequently marked his utterance and which an observer would not have known whether to pronounce a somewhat mysteriously humorous affection of ignorance or a modest aspiration to knowledge you told me you disliked them all  ah the way you remember what i say is at least very flattering but in future added mrs tristram pray forget all the wicked things and remember only the good ones it will be easily done and it will not fatigue your memory but i forewarn you that if you trust my husband to pick out your rooms you are in for something hideous  hideous darling cried tristram  today i must say nothing wicked otherwise i should use stronger language  what do you think she would say newman asked tristram if she really tried now she can express displeasure volubly in two or three languages thats what it is to be intellectual it gives her the start of me completely for i cant swear for the life of me except in english when i get mad i have to fall back on our dear old mother tongue theres nothing like it after all  newman declared that he knew nothing about tables and chairs and that he would accept in the way of a lodging with his eyes shut anything that tristram should offer him this was partly veracity on our heros part but it was also partly charity he knew that to pry about and look at rooms and make people open windows and poke into sofas with his cane and gossip with landladies and ask who lived above and who belowhe knew that this was of all pastimes the dearest to tristrams heart and he felt the more disposed to put it in his way as he was conscious that as regards his obliging friend he had suffered the warmth of ancient goodfellowship somewhat to abate besides he had no taste for upholstery he had even no very exquisite sense of comfort or convenience he had a relish for luxury and splendor but it was satisfied by rather gross contrivances he scarcely knew a hard chair from a soft one and he possessed a talent for stretching his legs which quite dispensed with adventitious facilities his idea of comfort was to inhabit very large rooms have a great many of them and be conscious of their possessing a number of patented mechanical deviceshalf of which he should never have occasion to use the apartments should be light and brilliant and lofty he had once said that he liked rooms in which you wanted to keep your hat on for the rest he was satisfied with the assurance of any respectable person that everything was handsome tristram accordingly secured for him an apartment to which this epithet might be lavishly applied it was situated on the boulevard haussmann on the first floor and consisted of a series of rooms gilded from floor to ceiling a foot thick draped in various light shades of satin and chiefly furnished with mirrors and clocks newman thought them magnificent thanked tristram heartily immediately took possession and had one of his trunks standing for three months in his drawingroom  one day mrs tristram told him that her beautiful friend madame de cintre had returned from the country that she had met her three days before coming out of the church of st sulpice she herself having journeyed to that distant quarter in quest of an obscure lacemender of whose skill she had heard high praise  and how were those eyes newman asked  those eyes were red with weeping if you please said mrs tristram she had been to confession  it doesnt tally with your account of her said newman that she should have sins to confess  they were not sins they were sufferings  how do you know that  she asked me to come and see her i went this morning  and what does she suffer from  i didnt ask her with her somehow one is very discreet but i guessed easily enough she suffers from her wicked old mother and her grand turk of a brother they persecute her but i can almost forgive them because as i told you she is a saint and a persecution is all that she needs to bring out her saintliness and make her perfect  thats a comfortable theory for her i hope you will never impart it to the old folks why does she let them bully her is she not her own mistress  legally yes i suppose but morally no in france you must never say nay to your mother whatever she requires of you she may be the most abominable old woman in the world and make your life a purgatory but after all she is ma mere and you have no right to judge her you have simply to obey the thing has a fine side to it madame de cintre bows her head and folds her wings  cant she at least make her brother leave off  her brother is the chef de la famille as they say he is the head of the clan with those people the family is everything you must act not for your own pleasure but for the advantage of the family  i wonder what my family would like me to do exclaimed tristram  i wish you had one said his wife  but what do they want to get out of that poor lady newman asked  another marriage they are not rich and they want to bring more money into the family  theres your chance my boy said tristram  and madame de cintre objects newman continued  she has been sold once she naturally objects to being sold again it appears that the first time they made rather a poor bargain m de cintre left a scanty property  and to whom do they want to marry her now  i thought it best not to ask but you may be sure it is to some horrid old nabob or to some dissipated little duke  theres mrs tristram as large as life cried her husband observe the richness of her imagination she has not a single questionits vulgar to ask questionsand yet she knows everything she has the history of madame de cintres marriage at her fingers ends she has seen the lovely claire on her knees with loosened tresses and streaming eyes and the rest of them standing over her with spikes and goads and redhot irons ready to come down on her if she refuses the tipsy duke the simple truth is that they made a fuss about her milliners bill or refused her an operabox  newman looked from tristram to his wife with a certain mistrust in each direction do you really mean he asked of mrs tristram that your friend is being forced into an unhappy marriage  i think it extremely probable those people are very capable of that sort of thing  it is like something in a play said newman that dark old house over there looks as if wicked things had been done in it and might be done again  they have a still darker old house in the country madame de cintre tells me and there during the summer this scheme must have been hatched  must have been mind that said tristram  after all suggested newman after a silence she may be in trouble about something else  if it is something else then it is something worse said mrs tristram with rich decision  newman was silent a while and seemed lost in meditation is it possible he asked at last that they do that sort of thing over here that helpless women are bullied into marrying men they hate  helpless women all over the world have a hard time of it said mrs tristram there is plenty of bullying everywhere  a great deal of that kind of thing goes on in new york said tristram girls are bullied or coaxed or bribed or all three together into marrying nasty fellows there is no end of that always going on in the fifth avenue and other bad things besides the mysteries of the fifth avenue some one ought to show them up  i dont believe it said newman very gravely i dont believe that in america girls are ever subjected to compulsion i dont believe there have been a dozen cases of it since the country began  listen to the voice of the spread eagle cried tristram  the spread eagle ought to use his wings said mrs tristram fly to the rescue of madame de cintre  to her rescue  pounce down seize her in your talons and carry her off marry her yourself  newman for some moments answered nothing but presently i should suppose she had heard enough of marrying he said the kindest way to treat her would be to admire her and yet never to speak of it but that sort of thing is infamous he added it makes me feel savage to hear of it  he heard of it however more than once afterward mrs tristram again saw madame de cintre and again found her looking very sad but on these occasions there had been no tears her beautiful eyes were clear and still she is cold calm and hopeless mrs tristram declared and she added that on her mentioning that her friend mr newman was again in paris and was faithful in his desire to make madame de cintres acquaintance this lovely woman had found a smile in her despair and declared that she was sorry to have missed his visit in the spring and that she hoped he had not lost courage i told her something about you said mrs tristram  thats a comfort said newman placidly i like people to know about me  a few days after this one dusky autumn afternoon he went again to the rue de luniversite the early evening had closed in as he applied for admittance at the stoutly guarded hotel de bellegarde he was told that madame de cintre was at home he crossed the court entered the farther door and was conducted through a vestibule vast dim and cold up a broad stone staircase with an ancient iron balustrade to an apartment on the second floor announced and ushered in he found himself in a sort of paneled boudoir at one end of which a lady and gentleman were seated before the fire the gentleman was smoking a cigarette there was no light in the room save that of a couple of candles and the glow from the hearth both persons rose to welcome newman who in the firelight recognized madame de cintre she gave him her hand with a smile which seemed in itself an illumination and pointing to her companion said softly my brother the gentleman offered newman a frank friendly greeting and our hero then perceived him to be the young man who had spoken to him in the court of the hotel on his former visit and who had struck him as a good fellow  mrs tristram has spoken to me a great deal of you said madame de cintre gently as she resumed her former place  newman after he had seated himself began to consider what in truth was his errand he had an unusual unexpected sense of having wandered into a strange corner of the world he was not given as a general thing to anticipating danger or forecasting disaster and he had had no social tremors on this particular occasion he was not timid and he was not impudent he felt too kindly toward himself to be the one and too goodnaturedly toward the rest of the world to be the other but his native shrewdness sometimes placed his ease of temper at its mercy with every disposition to take things simply it was obliged to perceive that some things were not so simple as others he felt as one does in missing a step in an ascent where one expected to find it this strange pretty woman sitting in fireside talk with her brother in the gray depths of her inhospitablelooking housewhat had he to say to her she seemed enveloped in a sort of fantastic privacy on what grounds had he pulled away the curtain for a moment he felt as if he had plunged into some medium as deep as the ocean and as if he must exert himself to keep from sinking meanwhile he was looking at madame de cintre and she was settling herself in her chair and drawing in her long dress and turning her face towards him their eyes met a moment afterwards she looked away and motioned to her brother to put a log on the fire but the moment and the glance which traversed it had been sufficient to relieve newman of the first and the last fit of personal embarrassment he was ever to know he performed the movement which was so frequent with him and which was always a sort of symbol of his taking mental possession of a scenehe extended his legs the impression madame de cintre had made upon him on their first meeting came back in an instant it had been deeper than he knew she was pleasing she was interesting he had opened a book and the first lines held his attention  she asked him several questions how lately he had seen mrs tristram how long he had been in paris how long he expected to remain there how he liked it she spoke english without an accent or rather with that distinctively british accent which on his arrival in europe had struck newman as an altogether foreign tongue but which in women he had come to like extremely here and there madame de cintres utterance had a faint shade of strangeness but at the end of ten minutes newman found himself waiting for these soft roughnesses he enjoyed them and he marveled to see that gross thing error brought down to so fine a point  you have a beautiful country said madame de cintre presently  oh magnificent said newman you ought to see it  i shall never see it said madame de cintre with a smile  why not asked newman  i dont travel especially so far  but you go away sometimes you are not always here  i go away in summer a little way to the country  newman wanted to ask her something more something personal he hardly knew what dont you find it ratherrather quiet here he said so far from the street rather gloomy he was going to say but he reflected that that would be impolite  yes it is very quiet said madame de cintre but we like that  ah you like that repeated newman slowly  besides i have lived here all my life  lived here all your life said newman in the same way  i was born here and my father was born here before me and my grandfather and my greatgrandfathers were they not valentin and she appealed to her brother  yes its a family habit to be born here the young man said with a laugh and rose and threw the remnant of his cigarette into the fire and then remained leaning against the chimneypiece an observer would have perceived that he wished to take a better look at newman whom he covertly examined while he stood stroking his mustache  your house is tremendously old then said newman  how old is it brother asked madame de cintre  the young man took the two candles from the mantelshelf lifted one high in each hand and looked up toward the cornice of the room above the chimneypiece this latter feature of the apartment was of white marble and in the familiar rococo style of the last century but above it was a paneling of an earlier date quaintly carved painted white and gilded here and there the white had turned to yellow and the gilding was tarnished on the top the figures ranged themselves into a sort of shield on which an armorial device was cut above it in relief was a date1627 there you have it said the young man that is old or new according to your point of view  well over here said newman ones point of view gets shifted round considerably and he threw back his head and looked about the room your house is of a very curious style of architecture he said  are you interested in architecture asked the young man at the chimneypiece  well i took the trouble this summer said newman to examineas well as i can calculatesome four hundred and seventy churches do you call that interested  perhaps you are interested in theology said the young man  not particularly are you a roman catholic madam and he turned to madame de cintre  yes sir she answered gravely  newman was struck with the gravity of her tone he threw back his head and began to look round the room again had you never noticed that number up there he presently asked  she hesitated a moment and then in former years she said  her brother had been watching newmans movement perhaps you would like to examine the house he said  newman slowly brought down his eyes and looked at him he had a vague impression that the young man at the chimneypiece was inclined to irony he was a handsome fellow his face wore a smile his mustaches were curled up at the ends and there was a little dancing gleam in his eye damn his french impudence newman was on the point of saying to himself what the deuce is he grinning at he glanced at madame de cintre she was sitting with her eyes fixed on the floor she raised them they met his and she looked at her brother newman turned again to this young man and observed that he strikingly resembled his sister this was in his favor and our heros first impression of the count valentin moreover had been agreeable his mistrust expired and he said he would be very glad to see the house  the young man gave a frank laugh and laid his hand on one of the candlesticks good good he exclaimed come then  but madame de cintre rose quickly and grasped his arm ah valentin she said what do you mean to do  to show mr newman the house it will be very amusing  she kept her hand on his arm and turned to newman with a smile dont let him take you she said you will not find it amusing it is a musty old house like any other  it is full of curious things said the count resisting besides i want to do it it is a rare chance  you are very wicked brother madame de cintre answered  nothing venture nothing have cried the young man will you come  madame de cintre stepped toward newman gently clasping her hands and smiling softly would you not prefer my society here by my fire to stumbling about dark passages after my brother  a hundred times said newman we will see the house some other day  the young man put down his candlestick with mock solemnity and shaking his head ah you have defeated a great scheme sir he said  a scheme i dont understand said newman  you would have played your part in it all the better perhaps some day i shall have a chance to explain it  be quiet and ring for the tea said madame de cintre  the young man obeyed and presently a servant brought in the tea placed the tray on a small table and departed madame de cintre from her place busied herself with making it she had but just begun when the door was thrown open and a lady rushed in making a loud rustling sound she stared at newman gave a little nod and a monsieur and then quickly approached madame de cintre and presented her forehead to be kissed madame de cintre saluted her and continued to make tea the newcomer was young and pretty it seemed to newman she wore her bonnet and cloak and a train of royal proportions she began to talk rapidly in french oh give me some tea my beautiful one for the love of god im exhausted mangled massacred newman found himself quite unable to follow her she spoke much less distinctly than m nioche  that is my sisterinlaw said the count valentin leaning towards him  she is very pretty said newman  exquisite answered the young man and this time again newman suspected him of irony  his sisterinlaw came round to the other side of the fire with her cup of tea in her hand holding it out at armslength so that she might not spill it on her dress and uttering little cries of alarm she placed the cup on the mantelshelf and begun to unpin her veil and pull off her gloves looking meanwhile at newman  is there any thing i can do for you my dear lady the count valentin asked in a sort of mockcaressing tone  present monsieur said his sisterinlaw  the young man answered mr newman  i cant courtesy to you monsieur or i shall spill my tea said the lady so claire receives strangers like that she added in a low voice in french to her brotherinlaw  apparently he answered with a smile newman stood a moment and then he approached madame de cintre she looked up at him as if she were thinking of something to say but she seemed to think of nothing so she simply smiled he sat down near her and she handed him a cup of tea for a few moments they talked about that and meanwhile he looked at her he remembered what mrs tristram had told him of her perfection and of her having in combination all the brilliant things that he dreamed of finding this made him observe her not only without mistrust but without uneasy conjectures the presumption from the first moment he looked at her had been in her favor and yet if she was beautiful it was not a dazzling beauty she was tall and moulded in long lines she had thick fair hair a wide forehead and features with a sort of harmonious irregularity her clear gray eyes were strikingly expressive they were both gentle and intelligent and newman liked them immensely but they had not those depths of splendorthose manycolored rayswhich illumine the brows of famous beauties madame de cintre was rather thin and she looked younger than probably she was in her whole person there was something both youthful and subdued slender and yet ample tranquil yet shy a mixture of immaturity and repose of innocence and dignity what had tristram meant newman wondered by calling her proud she was certainly not proud now to him or if she was it was of no use it was lost upon him she must pile it up higher if she expected him to mind it she was a beautiful woman and it was very easy to get on with her was she a countess a marquise a kind of historical formation newman who had rarely heard these words used had never been at pains to attach any particular image to them but they occurred to him now and seemed charged with a sort of melodious meaning they signified something fair and softly bright that had easy motions and spoke very agreeably  have you many friends in paris do you go out asked madame de cintre who had at last thought of something to say  do you mean do i dance and all that  do you go dans le monde as we say  i have seen a good many people mrs tristram has taken me about i do whatever she tells me  by yourself you are not fond of amusements  oh yes of some sorts i am not fond of dancing and that sort of thing i am too old and sober but i want to be amused i came to europe for that  but you can be amused in america too  i couldnt i was always at work but after all that was my amusement  at this moment madame de bellegarde came back for another cup of tea accompanied by the count valentin madame de cintre when she had served her began to talk again with newman and recalling what he had last said in your own country you were very much occupied she asked  i was in business i have been in business since i was fifteen years old  and what was your business asked madame de bellegarde who was decidedly not so pretty as madame de cintre  i have been in everything said newman at one time i sold leather at one time i manufactured washtubs  madame de bellegarde made a little grimace leather i dont like that washtubs are better i prefer the smell of soap i hope at least they made your fortune she rattled this off with the air of a woman who had the reputation of saying everything that came into her head and with a strong french accent  newman had spoken with cheerful seriousness but madame de bellegardes tone made him go on after a meditative pause with a certain light grimness of jocularity no i lost money on washtubs but i came out pretty square on leather  i have made up my mind after all said madame de bellegarde that the great point ishow do you call itto come out square i am on my knees to money i dont deny it if you have it i ask no questions for that i am a real democratlike you monsieur madame de cintre is very proud but i find that one gets much more pleasure in this sad life if one doesnt look too close  just heaven dear madam how you go at it said the count valentin lowering his voice  hes a man one can speak to i suppose since my sister receives him the lady answered besides its very true those are my ideas  ah you call them ideas murmured the young man  but mrs tristram told me you had been in the armyin your war said madame de cintre  yes but that is not business said newman  very true said m de bellegarde otherwise perhaps i should not be penniless  is it true asked newman in a moment that you are so proud i had already heard it  madame de cintre smiled do you find me so  oh said newman i am no judge if you are proud with me you will have to tell me otherwise i shall not know it  madame de cintre began to laugh that would be pride in a sad position she said  it would be partly newman went on because i shouldnt want to know it i want you to treat me well  madame de cintre whose laugh had ceased looked at him with her head half averted as if she feared what he was going to say  mrs tristram told you the literal truth he went on i want very much to know you i didnt come here simply to call today i came in the hope that you might ask me to come again  oh pray come often said madame de cintre  but will you be at home newman insisted even to himself he seemed a trifle pushing but he was in truth a trifle excited  i hope so said madame de cintre  newman got up well we shall see he said smoothing his hat with his coatcuff  brother said madame de cintre invite mr newman to come again  the count valentin looked at our hero from head to foot with his peculiar smile in which impudence and urbanity seemed perplexingly commingled are you a brave man he asked eying him askance  well i hope so said newman  i rather suspect so in that case come again  ah what an invitation murmured madame de cintre with something painful in her smile  oh i want mr newman to comeparticularly said the young man it will give me great pleasure i shall be desolate if i miss one of his visits but i maintain he must be brave a stout heart sir and he offered newman his hand  i shall not come to see you i shall come to see madame de cintre said newman  you will need all the more courage  ah valentin said madame de cintre appealingly  decidedly cried madame de bellegarde i am the only person here capable of saying something polite come to see me you will need no courage she said  newman gave a laugh which was not altogether an assent and took his leave madame de cintre did not take up her sisters challenge to be gracious but she looked with a certain troubled air at the retreating guest    chapter vii   one evening very late about a week after his visit to madame de cintre newmans servant brought him a card it was that of young m de bellegarde when a few moments later he went to receive his visitor he found him standing in the middle of his great gilded parlor and eying it from cornice to carpet m de bellegardes face it seemed to newman expressed a sense of lively entertainment what the devil is he laughing at now our hero asked himself but he put the question without acrimony for he felt that madame de cintres brother was a good fellow and he had a presentiment that on this basis of good fellowship they were destined to understand each other only if there was anything to laugh at he wished to have a glimpse of it too  to begin with said the young man as he extended his hand have i come too late  too late for what asked newman  to smoke a cigar with you  you would have to come early to do that said newman i dont smoke  ah you are a strong man  but i keep cigars newman added sit down  surely i may not smoke here said m de bellegarde  what is the matter is the room too small  it is too large it is like smoking in a ballroom or a church  that is what you were laughing at just now newman asked the size of my room  it is not size only replied m de bellegarde but splendor and harmony and beauty of detail it was the smile of admiration  newman looked at him a moment and then so it is very ugly he inquired  ugly my dear sir it is magnificent  that is the same thing i suppose said newman make yourself comfortable your coming to see me i take it is an act of friendship you were not obliged to therefore if anything around here amuses you it will be all in a pleasant way laugh as loud as you please i like to see my visitors cheerful only i must make this request that you explain the joke to me as soon as you can speak i dont want to lose anything myself  m de bellegarde stared with a look of unresentful perplexity he laid his hand on newmans sleeve and seemed on the point of saying something but he suddenly checked himself leaned back in his chair and puffed at his cigar at last however breaking silencecertainly he said my coming to see you is an act of friendship nevertheless i was in a measure obliged to do so my sister asked me to come and a request from my sister is for me a law i was near you and i observed lights in what i supposed were your rooms it was not a ceremonious hour for making a call but i was not sorry to do something that would show i was not performing a mere ceremony  well here i am as large as life said newman extending his legs  i dont know what you mean the young man went on by giving me unlimited leave to laugh certainly i am a great laugher and it is better to laugh too much than too little but it is not in order that we may laugh togetheror separatelythat i have i may say sought your acquaintance to speak with almost impudent frankness you interest me all this was uttered by m de bellegarde with the modulated smoothness of the man of the world and in spite of his excellent english of the frenchman but newman at the same time that he sat noting its harmonious flow perceived that it was not mere mechanical urbanity decidedly there was something in his visitor that he liked m de bellegarde was a foreigner to his fingertips and if newman had met him on a western prairie he would have felt it proper to address him with a howdyedo mosseer but there was something in his physiognomy which seemed to cast a sort of aerial bridge over the impassable gulf produced by difference of race he was below the middle height and robust and agile in figure valentin de bellegarde newman afterwards learned had a mortal dread of the robustness overtaking the agility he was afraid of growing stout he was too short as he said to afford a belly he rode and fenced and practiced gymnastics with unremitting zeal and if you greeted him with a how well you are looking he started and turned pale in your well he read a grosser monosyllable he had a round head high above the ears a crop of hair at once dense and silky a broad low forehead a short nose of the ironical and inquiring rather than of the dogmatic or sensitive cast and a mustache as delicate as that of a page in a romance he resembled his sister not in feature but in the expression of his clear bright eye completely void of introspection and in the way he smiled the great point in his face was that it was intensely alivefrankly ardently gallantly alive the look of it was like a bell of which the handle might have been in the young mans soul at a touch of the handle it rang with a loud silver sound there was something in his quick light brown eye which assured you that he was not economizing his consciousness he was not living in a corner of it to spare the furniture of the rest he was squarely encamped in the centre and he was keeping open house when he smiled it was like the movement of a person who in emptying a cup turns it upside down he gave you the last drop of his jollity he inspired newman with something of the same kindness that our hero used to feel in his earlier years for those of his companions who could perform strange and clever tricksmake their joints crack in queer places or whistle at the back of their mouths  my sister told me m de bellegarde continued that i ought to come and remove the impression that i had taken such great pains to produce upon you the impression that i am a lunatic did it strike you that i behaved very oddly the other day  rather so said newman  so my sister tells me and m de bellegarde watched his host for a moment through his smokewreaths if that is the case i think we had better let it stand i didnt try to make you think i was a lunatic at all on the contrary i wanted to produce a favorable impression but if after all i made a fool of myself it was the intention of providence i should injure myself by protesting too much for i should seem to set up a claim for wisdom which in the sequel of our acquaintance i could by no means justify set me down as a lunatic with intervals of sanity  oh i guess you know what you are about said newman  when i am sane i am very sane that i admit m de bellegarde answered but i didnt come here to talk about myself i should like to ask you a few questions you allow me  give me a specimen said newman  you live here all alone  absolutely with whom should i live  for the moment said m de bellegarde with a smile i am asking questions not answering them you have come to paris for your pleasure  newman was silent a while then at last every one asks me that he said with his mild slowness it sounds so awfully foolish  but at any rate you had a reason  oh i came for my pleasure said newman though it is foolish it is true  and you are enjoying it  like any other good american newman thought it as well not to truckle to the foreigner oh soso he answered  m de bellegarde puffed his cigar again in silence for myself he said at last i am entirely at your service anything i can do for you i shall be very happy to do call upon me at your convenience is there any one you desire to knowanything you wish to see it is a pity you should not enjoy paris  oh i do enjoy it said newman goodnaturedly im much obligated to you  honestly speaking m de bellegarde went on there is something absurd to me in hearing myself make you these offers they represent a great deal of goodwill but they represent little else you are a successful man and i am a failure and its a turning of the tables to talk as if i could lend you a hand  in what way are you a failure asked newman  oh im not a tragical failure cried the young man with a laugh i have fallen from a height and my fiasco has made no noise you evidently are a success you have made a fortune you have built up an edifice you are a financial commercial power you can travel about the world until you have found a soft spot and lie down in it with the consciousness of having earned your rest is not that true well imagine the exact reverse of all that and you have me i have done nothingi can do nothing  why not  its a long story some day i will tell you meanwhile im right eh you are a success you have made a fortune its none of my business but in short you are rich  thats another thing that it sounds foolish to say said newman hang it no man is rich  i have heard philosophers affirm laughed m de bellegarde that no man was poor but your formula strikes me as an improvement as a general thing i confess i dont like successful people and i find clever men who have made great fortunes very offensive they tread on my toes they make me uncomfortable but as soon as i saw you i said to myself ah there is a man with whom i shall get on he has the goodnature of success and none of the morgue he has not our confoundedly irritable french vanity in short i took a fancy to you we are very different im sure i dont believe there is a subject on which we think or feel alike but i rather think we shall get on for there is such a thing you know as being too different to quarrel  oh i never quarrel said newman  never sometimes its a dutyor at least its a pleasure oh i have had two or three delicious quarrels in my day and m de bellegardes handsome smile assumed at the memory of these incidents an almost voluptuous intensity  with the preamble embodied in his share of the foregoing fragment of dialogue he paid our hero a long visit as the two men sat with their heels on newmans glowing hearth they heard the small hours of the morning striking larger from a faroff belfry valentin de bellegarde was by his own confession at all times a great chatterer and on this occasion he was evidently in a particularly loquacious mood it was a tradition of his race that people of its blood always conferred a favor by their smiles and as his enthusiasms were as rare as his civility was constant he had a double reason for not suspecting that his friendship could ever be importunate moreover the flower of an ancient stem as he was tradition since i have used the word had in his temperament nothing of disagreeable rigidity it was muffled in sociability and urbanity as an old dowager in her laces and strings of pearls valentin was what is called in france a gentilhomme of the purest source and his rule of life so far as it was definite was to play the part of a gentilhomme this it seemed to him was enough to occupy comfortably a young man of ordinary good parts but all that he was he was by instinct and not by theory and the amiability of his character was so great that certain of the aristocratic virtues which in some aspects seem rather brittle and trenchant acquired in his application of them an extreme geniality in his younger years he had been suspected of low tastes and his mother had greatly feared he would make a slip in the mud of the highway and bespatter the family shield he had been treated therefore to more than his share of schooling and drilling but his instructors had not succeeded in mounting him upon stilts they could not spoil his safe spontaneity and he remained the least cautious and the most lucky of young nobles he had been tied with so short a rope in his youth that he had now a mortal grudge against family discipline he had been known to say within the limits of the family that lightheaded as he was the honor of the name was safer in his hands than in those of some of its other members and that if a day ever came to try it they should see his talk was an odd mixture of almost boyish garrulity and of the reserve and discretion of the man of the world and he seemed to newman as afterwards young members of the latin races often seemed to him now amusingly juvenile and now appallingly mature in america newman reflected lads of twentyfive and thirty have old heads and young hearts or at least young morals here they have young heads and very aged hearts morals the most grizzled and wrinkled  what i envy you is your liberty observed m de bellegarde your wide range your freedom to come and go your not having a lot of people who take themselves awfully seriously expecting something of you i live he added with a sigh beneath the eyes of my admirable mother  it is your own fault what is to hinder your ranging said newman  there is a delightful simplicity in that remark everything is to hinder me to begin with i have not a penny  i had not a penny when i began to range  ah but your poverty was your capital being an american it was impossible you should remain what you were born and being born poordo i understand itit was therefore inevitable that you should become rich you were in a position that makes ones mouth water you looked round you and saw a world full of things you had only to step up to and take hold of when i was twenty i looked around me and saw a world with everything ticketed hands off and the deuce of it was that the ticket seemed meant only for me i couldnt go into business i couldnt make money because i was a bellegarde i couldnt go into politics because i was a bellegardethe bellegardes dont recognize the bonapartes i couldnt go into literature because i was a dunce i couldnt marry a rich girl because no bellegarde had ever married a roturiere and it was not proper that i should begin we shall have to come to it yet marriageable heiresses de notre bord are not to be had for nothing it must be name for name and fortune for fortune the only thing i could do was to go and fight for the pope that i did punctiliously and received an apostolic fleshwound at castlefidardo it did neither the holy father nor me any good that i could see rome was doubtless a very amusing place in the days of caligula but it has sadly fallen off since i passed three years in the castle of st angelo and then came back to secular life  so you have no professionyou do nothing said newman  i do nothing i am supposed to amuse myself and to tell the truth i have amused myself one can if one knows how but you cant keep it up forever i am good for another five years perhaps but i foresee that after that i shall lose my appetite then what shall i do i think i shall turn monk seriously i think i shall tie a rope round my waist and go into a monastery it was an old custom and the old customs were very good people understood life quite as well as we do they kept the pot boiling till it cracked and then they put it on the shelf altogether  are you very religious asked newman in a tone which gave the inquiry a grotesque effect  m de bellegarde evidently appreciated the comical element in the question but he looked at newman a moment with extreme soberness i am a very good catholic i respect the church i adore the blessed virgin i fear the devil  well then said newman you are very well fixed you have got pleasure in the present and religion in the future what do you complain of  its a part of ones pleasure to complain there is something in your own circumstances that irritates me you are the first man i have ever envied its singular but so it is i have known many men who besides any factitious advantages that i may possess had money and brains into the bargain but somehow they have never disturbed my goodhumor but you have got something that i should have liked to have it is not money it is not even brainsthough no doubt yours are excellent it is not your six feet of height though i should have rather liked to be a couple of inches taller its a sort of air you have of being thoroughly at home in the world when i was a boy my father told me that it was by such an air as that that people recognized a bellegarde he called my attention to it he didnt advise me to cultivate it he said that as we grew up it always came of itself i supposed it had come to me because i think i have always had the feeling my place in life was made for me and it seemed easy to occupy it but you who as i understand it have made your own place you who as you told us the other day have manufactured washtubsyou strike me somehow as a man who stands at his ease who looks at things from a height i fancy you going about the world like a man traveling on a railroad in which he owns a large amount of stock you make me feel as if i had missed something what is it  it is the proud consciousness of honest toilof having manufactured a few washtubs said newman at once jocose and serious  oh no i have seen men who had done even more men who had made not only washtubs but soapstrongsmelling yellow soap in great bars and they never made me the least uncomfortable  then its the privilege of being an american citizen said newman that sets a man up  possibly rejoined m de bellegarde but i am forced to say that i have seen a great many american citizens who didnt seem at all set up or in the least like large stockholders i never envied them i rather think the thing is an accomplishment of your own  oh come said newman you will make me proud  no i shall not you have nothing to do with pride or with humilitythat is a part of this easy manner of yours people are proud only when they have something to lose and humble when they have something to gain  i dont know what i have to lose said newman but i certainly have something to gain  what is it asked his visitor  newman hesitated a while i will tell you when i know you better  i hope that will be soon then if i can help you to gain it i shall be happy  perhaps you may said newman  dont forget then that i am your servant m de bellegarde answered and shortly afterwards he took his departure  during the next three weeks newman saw bellegarde several times and without formally swearing an eternal friendship the two men established a sort of comradeship to newman bellegarde was the ideal frenchman the frenchman of tradition and romance so far as our hero was concerned with these mystical influences gallant expansive amusing more pleased himself with the effect he produced than those even when they were well pleased for whom he produced it a master of all the distinctively social virtues and a votary of all agreeable sensations a devotee of something mysterious and sacred to which he occasionally alluded in terms more ecstatic even than those in which he spoke of the last pretty woman and which was simply the beautiful though somewhat superannuated image of honor he was irresistibly entertaining and enlivening and he formed a character to which newman was as capable of doing justice when he had once been placed in contact with it as he was unlikely in musing upon the possible mixtures of our human ingredients mentally to have foreshadowed it bellegarde did not in the least cause him to modify his needful premise that all frenchmen are of a frothy and imponderable substance he simply reminded him that light materials may be beaten up into a most agreeable compound no two companions could be more different but their differences made a capital basis for a friendship of which the distinctive characteristic was that it was extremely amusing to each  valentin de bellegarde lived in the basement of an old house in the rue danjou st honore and his small apartments lay between the court of the house and an old garden which spread itself behind itone of those large sunless humid gardens into which you look unexpectingly in paris from back windows wondering how among the grudging habitations they find their space when newman returned bellegardes visit he hinted that his lodging was at least as much a laughing matter as his own but its oddities were of a different cast from those of our heros gilded saloons on the boulevard haussmann the place was low dusky contracted and crowded with curious bricabrac bellegarde penniless patrician as he was was an insatiable collector and his walls were covered with rusty arms and ancient panels and platters his doorways draped in faded tapestries his floors muffled in the skins of beasts here and there was one of those uncomfortable tributes to elegance in which the upholsterers art in france is so prolific a curtain recess with a sheet of lookingglass in which among the shadows you could see nothing a divan on which for its festoons and furbelows you could not sit a fireplace draped flounced and frilled to the complete exclusion of fire the young mans possessions were in picturesque disorder and his apartment was pervaded by the odor of cigars mingled with perfumes more inscrutable newman thought it a damp gloomy place to live in and was puzzled by the obstructive and fragmentary character of the furniture  bellegarde according to the custom of his country talked very generously about himself and unveiled the mysteries of his private history with an unsparing hand inevitably he had a vast deal to say about women and he used frequently to indulge in sentimental and ironical apostrophes to these authors of his joys and woes oh the women the women and the things they have made me do he would exclaim with a lustrous eye cest egal of all the follies and stupidities i have committed for them i would not have missed one on this subject newman maintained an habitual reserve to expatiate largely upon it had always seemed to him a proceeding vaguely analogous to the cooing of pigeons and the chattering of monkeys and even inconsistent with a fully developed human character but bellegardes confidences greatly amused him and rarely displeased him for the generous young frenchman was not a cynic i really think he had once said that i am not more depraved than most of my contemporaries they are tolerably depraved my contemporaries he said wonderfully pretty things about his female friends and numerous and various as they had been declared that on the whole there was more good in them than harm but you are not to take that as advice he added as an authority i am very untrustworthy im prejudiced in their favor im an idealist newman listened to him with his impartial smile and was glad for his own sake that he had fine feelings but he mentally repudiated the idea of a frenchman having discovered any merit in the amiable sex which he himself did not suspect m de bellegarde however did not confine his conversation to the autobiographical channel he questioned our hero largely as to the events of his own life and newman told him some better stories than any that bellegarde carried in his budget he narrated his career in fact from the beginning through all its variations and whenever his companions credulity or his habits of gentility appeared to protest it amused him to heighten the color of the episode newman had sat with western humorists in knots round castiron stoves and seen tall stories grow taller without toppling over and his own imagination had learned the trick of piling up consistent wonders bellegardes regular attitude at last became that of laughing selfdefense to maintain his reputation as an allknowing frenchman he doubted of everything wholesale the result of this was that newman found it impossible to convince him of certain timehonored verities  but the details dont matter said m de bellegarde you have evidently had some surprising adventures you have seen some strange sides of life you have revolved to and fro over a whole continent as i walked up and down the boulevard you are a man of the world with a vengeance you have spent some deadly dull hours and you have done some extremely disagreeable things you have shoveled sand as a boy for supper and you have eaten roast dog in a golddiggers camp you have stood casting up figures for ten hours at a time and you have sat through methodist sermons for the sake of looking at a pretty girl in another pew all that is rather stiff as we say but at any rate you have done something and you are something you have used your will and you have made your fortune you have not stupified yourself with debauchery and you have not mortgaged your fortune to social conveniences you take things easily and you have fewer prejudices even than i who pretend to have none but who in reality have three or four happy man you are strong and you are free but what the deuce demanded the young man in conclusion do you propose to do with such advantages really to use them you need a better world than this there is nothing worth your while here  oh i think there is something said newman  what is it  well murmured newman i will tell you some other time  in this way our hero delayed from day to day broaching a subject which he had very much at heart meanwhile however he was growing practically familiar with it in other words he had called again three times on madame de cintre on only two of these occasions had he found her at home and on each of them she had other visitors her visitors were numerous and extremely loquacious and they exacted much of their hostesss attention she found time however to bestow a little of it on newman in an occasional vague smile the very vagueness of which pleased him allowing him as it did to fill it out mentally both at the time and afterwards with such meanings as most pleased him he sat by without speaking looking at the entrances and exits the greetings and chatterings of madame de cintres visitors he felt as if he were at the play and as if his own speaking would be an interruption sometimes he wished he had a book to follow the dialogue he half expected to see a woman in a white cap and pink ribbons come and offer him one for two francs some of the ladies looked at him very hardor very soft as you please others seemed profoundly unconscious of his presence the men looked only at madame de cintre this was inevitable for whether one called her beautiful or not she entirely occupied and filled ones vision just as an agreeable sound fills ones ear newman had but twenty distinct words with her but he carried away an impression to which solemn promises could not have given a higher value she was part of the play that he was seeing acted quite as much as her companions but how she filled the stage and how much better she did it whether she rose or seated herself whether she went with her departing friends to the door and lifted up the heavy curtain as they passed out and stood an instant looking after them and giving them the last nod or whether she leaned back in her chair with her arms crossed and her eyes resting listening and smiling she gave newman the feeling that he should like to have her always before him moving slowly to and fro along the whole scale of expressive hospitality if it might be to him it would be well if it might be for him it would be still better she was so tall and yet so light so active and yet so still so elegant and yet so simple so frank and yet so mysterious it was the mysteryit was what she was off the stage as it werethat interested newman most of all he could not have told you what warrant he had for talking about mysteries if it had been his habit to express himself in poetic figures he might have said that in observing madame de cintre he seemed to see the vague circle which sometimes accompanies the partlyfilled disk of the moon it was not that she was reserved on the contrary she was as frank as flowing water but he was sure she had qualities which she herself did not suspect  he had abstained for several reasons from saying some of these things to bellegarde one reason was that before proceeding to any act he was always circumspect conjectural contemplative he had little eagerness as became a man who felt that whenever he really began to move he walked with long steps and then it simply pleased him not to speakit occupied him it excited him but one day bellegarde had been dining with him at a restaurant and they had sat long over their dinner on rising from it bellegarde proposed that to help them through the rest of the evening they should go and see madame dandelard madame dandelard was a little italian lady who had married a frenchman who proved to be a rake and a brute and the torment of her life her husband had spent all her money and then lacking the means of obtaining more expensive pleasures had taken in his duller hours to beating her she had a blue spot somewhere which she showed to several persons including bellegarde she had obtained a separation from her husband collected the scraps of her fortune they were very meagre and come to live in paris where she was staying at a hotel garni she was always looking for an apartment and visiting inquiringly those of other people she was very pretty very childlike and she made very extraordinary remarks bellegarde had made her acquaintance and the source of his interest in her was according to his own declaration a curiosity as to what would become of her she is poor she is pretty and she is silly he said it seems to me she can go only one way its a pity but it cant be helped i will give her six months she has nothing to fear from me but i am watching the process i am curious to see just how things will go yes i know what you are going to say this horrible paris hardens ones heart but it quickens ones wits and it ends by teaching one a refinement of observation to see this little womans little drama play itself out now is for me an intellectual pleasure  if she is going to throw herself away newman had said you ought to stop her  stop her how stop her  talk to her give her some good advice  bellegarde laughed heaven deliver us both imagine the situation go and advise her yourself  it was after this that newman had gone with bellegarde to see madame dandelard when they came away bellegarde reproached his companion where was your famous advice he asked i didnt hear a word of it  oh i give it up said newman simply  then you are as bad as i said bellegarde  no because i dont take an intellectual pleasure in her prospective adventures i dont in the least want to see her going down hill i had rather look the other way but why he asked in a moment dont you get your sister to go and see her  bellegarde stared go and see madame dandelardmy sister  she might talk to her to very good purpose  bellegarde shook his head with sudden gravity my sister cant see that sort of person madame dandelard is nothing at all they would never meet  i should think said newman that your sister might see whom she pleased and he privately resolved that after he knew her a little better he would ask madame de cintre to go and talk to the foolish little italian lady  after his dinner with bellegarde on the occasion i have mentioned he demurred to his companions proposal that they should go again and listen to madame dandelard describe her sorrows and her bruises  i have something better in mind he said come home with me and finish the evening before my fire  bellegarde always welcomed the prospect of a long stretch of conversation and before long the two men sat watching the great blaze which scattered its scintillations over the high adornments of newmans ballroom    chapter viii   tell me something about your sister newman began abruptly  bellegarde turned and gave him a quick look now that i think of it you have never yet asked me a question about her  i know that very well  if it is because you dont trust me you are very right said bellegarde i cant talk of her rationally i admire her too much  talk of her as you can rejoined newman let yourself go  well we are very good friends we are such a brother and sister as have not been seen since orestes and electra you have seen her you know what she is tall thin light imposing and gentle half a grande dame and half an angel a mixture of pride and humility of the eagle and the dove she looks like a statue which had failed as stone resigned itself to its grave defects and come to life as flesh and blood to wear white capes and long trains all i can say is that she really possesses every merit that her face her glance her smile the tone of her voice lead you to expect it is saying a great deal as a general thing when a woman seems very charming i should say beware but in proportion as claire seems charming you may fold your arms and let yourself float with the current you are safe she is so good i have never seen a woman half so perfect or so complete she has everything that is all i can say about her there bellegarde concluded i told you i should rhapsodize  newman was silent a while as if he were turning over his companions words she is very good eh he repeated at last  divinely good  kind charitable gentle generous  generosity itself kindness doubledistilled  is she clever  she is the most intelligent woman i know try her some day with something difficult and you will see  is she fond of admiration  parbleu cried bellegarde what woman is not  ah when they are too fond of admiration they commit all kinds of follies to get it  i did not say she was too fond bellegarde exclaimed heaven forbid i should say anything so idiotic she is not too anything if i were to say she was ugly i should not mean she was too ugly she is fond of pleasing and if you are pleased she is grateful if you are not pleased she lets it pass and thinks the worst neither of you nor of herself i imagine though she hopes the saints in heaven are for i am sure she is incapable of trying to please by any means of which they would disapprove  is she grave or gay asked newman  she is both not alternately for she is always the same there is gravity in her gayety and gayety in her gravity but there is no reason why she should be particularly gay  is she unhappy  i wont say that for unhappiness is according as one takes things and claire takes them according to some receipt communicated to her by the blessed virgin in a vision to be unhappy is to be disagreeable which for her is out of the question so she has arranged her circumstances so as to be happy in them  she is a philosopher said newman  no she is simply a very nice woman  her circumstances at any rate have been disagreeable  bellegarde hesitated a momenta thing he very rarely did oh my dear fellow if i go into the history of my family i shall give you more than you bargain for  no on the contrary i bargain for that said newman  we shall have to appoint a special seance then beginning early suffice it for the present that claire has not slept on roses she made at eighteen a marriage that was expected to be brilliant but that turned out like a lamp that goes out all smoke and bad smell m de cintre was sixty years old and an odious old gentleman he lived however but a short time and after his death his family pounced upon his money brought a lawsuit against his widow and pushed things very hard their case was a good one for m de cintre who had been trustee for some of his relatives appeared to have been guilty of some very irregular practices in the course of the suit some revelations were made as to his private history which my sister found so displeasing that she ceased to defend herself and washed her hands of the property this required some pluck for she was between two fires her husbands family opposing her and her own family forcing her my mother and my brother wished her to cleave to what they regarded as her rights but she resisted firmly and at last bought her freedomobtained my mothers assent to dropping the suit at the price of a promise  what was the promise  to do anything else for the next ten years that was asked of heranything that is but marry  she had disliked her husband very much  no one knows how much  the marriage had been made in your horrible french way newman continued made by the two families without her having any voice  it was a chapter for a novel she saw m de cintre for the first time a month before the wedding after everything to the minutest detail had been arranged she turned white when she looked at him and white remained till her weddingday the evening before the ceremony she swooned away and she spent the whole night in sobs my mother sat holding her two hands and my brother walked up and down the room i declared it was revolting and told my sister publicly that if she would refuse downright i would stand by her i was told to go about my business and she became comtesse de cintre  your brother said newman reflectively must be a very nice young man  he is very nice though he is not young he is upward of fifty fifteen years my senior he has been a father to my sister and me he is a very remarkable man he has the best manners in france he is extremely clever indeed he is very learned he is writing a history of the princesses of france who never married this was said by bellegarde with extreme gravity looking straight at newman and with an eye that betokened no mental reservation or that at least almost betokened none  newman perhaps discovered there what little there was for he presently said you dont love your brother  i beg your pardon said bellegarde ceremoniously wellbred people always love their brothers  well i dont love him then newman answered  wait till you know him rejoined bellegarde and this time he smiled  is your mother also very remarkable newman asked after a pause  for my mother said bellegarde now with intense gravity i have the highest admiration she is a very extraordinary woman you cannot approach her without perceiving it  she is the daughter i believe of an english nobleman  of the earl of st dunstans  is the earl of st dunstans a very old family  soso the sixteenth century it is on my fathers side that we go backback back back the family antiquaries themselves lose breath at last they stop panting and fanning themselves somewhere in the ninth century under charlemagne that is where we begin  there is no mistake about it said newman  im sure i hope not we have been mistaken at least for several centuries  and you have always married into old families  as a rule though in so long a stretch of time there have been some exceptions three or four bellegardes in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries took wives out of the bourgoisiemarried lawyers daughters  a lawyers daughter thats very bad is it asked newman  horrible one of us in the middle ages did better he married a beggarmaid like king cophetua that was really better it was like marrying a bird or a monkey one didnt have to think about her family at all our women have always done well they have never even gone into the petite noblesse there is i believe not a case on record of a misalliance among the women  newman turned this over for a while and then at last he said you offered the first time you came to see me to render me any service you could i told you that some time i would mention something you might do do you remember  remember i have been counting the hours  very well heres your chance do what you can to make your sister think well of me  bellegarde stared with a smile why im sure she thinks as well of you as possible already  an opinion founded on seeing me three or four times that is putting me off with very little i want something more i have been thinking of it a good deal and at last i have decided to tell you i should like very much to marry madame de cintre  bellegarde had been looking at him with quickened expectancy and with the smile with which he had greeted newmans allusion to his promised request at this last announcement he continued to gaze but his smile went through two or three curious phases it felt apparently a momentary impulse to broaden but this it immediately checked then it remained for some instants taking counsel with itself at the end of which it decreed a retreat it slowly effaced itself and left a look of seriousness modified by the desire not to be rude extreme surprise had come into the count valentins face but he had reflected that it would be uncivil to leave it there and yet what the deuce was he to do with it he got up in his agitation and stood before the chimneypiece still looking at newman he was a longer time thinking what to say than one would have expected  if you cant render me the service i ask said newman say it out  let me hear it again distinctly said bellegarde its very important you know i shall plead your cause with my sister because you wantyou want to marry her thats it eh  oh i dont say plead my cause exactly i shall try and do that myself but say a good word for me now and thenlet her know that you think well of me  at this bellegarde gave a little light laugh  what i want chiefly after all newman went on is just to let you know what i have in mind i suppose that is what you expect isnt it i want to do what is customary over here if there is any thing particular to be done let me know and i will do it i wouldnt for the world approach madame de cintre without all the proper forms if i ought to go and tell your mother why i will go and tell her i will go and tell your brother even i will go and tell any one you please as i dont know any one else i begin by telling you but that if it is a social obligation is a pleasure as well  yes i seei see said bellegarde lightly stroking his chin you have a very right feeling about it but im glad you have begun with me he paused hesitated and then turned away and walked slowly the length of the room newman got up and stood leaning against the mantelshelf with his hands in his pockets watching bellegardes promenade the young frenchman came back and stopped in front of him i give it up he said i will not pretend i am not surprised i amhugely ouf its a relief  that sort of news is always a surprise said newman no matter what you have done people are never prepared but if you are so surprised i hope at least you are pleased  come said bellegarde i am going to be tremendously frank i dont know whether i am pleased or horrified  if you are pleased i shall be glad said newman and i shall beencouraged if you are horrified i shall be sorry but i shall not be discouraged you must make the best of it  that is quite rightthat is your only possible attitude you are perfectly serious  am i a frenchman that i should not be asked newman but why is it by the bye that you should be horrified  bellegarde raised his hand to the back of his head and rubbed his hair quickly up and down thrusting out the tip of his tongue as he did so why you are not noble for instance he said  the devil i am not exclaimed newman  oh said bellegarde a little more seriously i did not know you had a title  a title what do you mean by a title asked newman a count a duke a marquis i dont know anything about that i dont know who is and who is not but i say i am noble i dont exactly know what you mean by it but its a fine word and a fine idea i put in a claim to it  but what have you to show my dear fellow what proofs  anything you please but you dont suppose i am going to undertake to prove that i am noble it is for you to prove the contrary  thats easily done you have manufactured washtubs  newman stared a moment therefore i am not noble i dont see it tell me something i have not donesomething i cannot do  you cannot marry a woman like madame de cintre for the asking  i believe you mean said newman slowly that i am not good enough  brutally speakingyes  bellegarde had hesitated a moment and while he hesitated newmans attentive glance had grown somewhat eager in answer to these last words he for a moment said nothing he simply blushed a little then he raised his eyes to the ceiling and stood looking at one of the rosy cherubs that was painted upon it of course i dont expect to marry any woman for the asking he said at last i expect first to make myself acceptable to her she must like me to begin with but that i am not good enough to make a trial is rather a surprise  bellegarde wore a look of mingled perplexity sympathy and amusement you should not hesitate then to go up tomorrow and ask a duchess to marry you  not if i thought she would suit me but i am very fastidious she might not at all  bellegardes amusement began to prevail and you should be surprised if she refused you  newman hesitated a moment it sounds conceited to say yes but nevertheless i think i should for i should make a very handsome offer  what would it be  everything she wishes if i get hold of a woman that comes up to my standard i shall think nothing too good for her i have been a long time looking and i find such women are rare to combine the qualities i require seems to be difficult but when the difficulty is vanquished it deserves a reward my wife shall have a good position and im not afraid to say that i shall be a good husband  and these qualities that you requirewhat are they  goodness beauty intelligence a fine education personal eleganceeverything in a word that makes a splendid woman  and noble birth evidently said bellegarde  oh throw that in by all means if its there the more the better  and my sister seems to you to have all these things  she is exactly what i have been looking for she is my dream realized  and you would make her a very good husband  that is what i wanted you to tell her  bellegarde laid his hand on his companions arm a moment looked at him with his head on one side from head to foot and then with a loud laugh and shaking the other hand in the air turned away he walked again the length of the room and again he came back and stationed himself in front of newman all this is very interestingit is very curious in what i said just now i was speaking not for myself but for my tradition my superstitions for myself really your proposal tickles me it startled me at first but the more i think of it the more i see in it its no use attempting to explain anything you wont understand me after all i dont see why you need its no great loss  oh if there is anything more to explain try it i want to proceed with my eyes open i will do my best to understand  no said bellegarde its disagreeable to me i give it up i liked you the first time i saw you and i will abide by that it would be quite odious for me to come talking to you as if i could patronize you i have told you before that i envy you vous mimposez as we say i didnt know you much until within five minutes so we will let things go and i will say nothing to you that if our positions were reversed you would not say to me  i do not know whether in renouncing the mysterious opportunity to which he alluded bellegarde felt that he was doing something very generous if so he was not rewarded his generosity was not appreciated newman quite failed to recognize the young frenchmans power to wound his feelings and he had now no sense of escaping or coming off easily he did not thank his companion even with a glance my eyes are open though he said so far as that you have practically told me that your family and your friends will turn up their noses at me i have never thought much about the reasons that make it proper for people to turn up their noses and so i can only decide the question offhand looking at it in that way i cant see anything in it i simply think if you want to know that im as good as the best who the best are i dont pretend to say i have never thought much about that either to tell the truth i have always had rather a good opinion of myself a man who is successful cant help it but i will admit that i was conceited what i dont say yes to is that i dont stand highas high as any one else this is a line of speculation i should not have chosen but you must remember you began it yourself i should never have dreamed that i was on the defensive or that i had to justify myself but if your people will have it so i will do my best  but you offered a while ago to make your court as we say to my mother and my brother  damn it cried newman i want to be polite  good rejoined bellegarde this will go far it will be very entertaining excuse my speaking of it in that coldblooded fashion but the matter must of necessity be for me something of a spectacle its positively exciting but apart from that i sympathize with you and i shall be actor so far as i can as well as spectator you are a capital fellow i believe in you and i back you the simple fact that you appreciate my sister will serve as the proof i was asking for all men are equalespecially men of taste  do you think asked newman presently that madame de cintre is determined not to marry  that is my impression but that is not against you its for you to make her change her mind  i am afraid it will be hard said newman gravely  i dont think it will be easy in a general way i dont see why a widow should ever marry again she has gained the benefits of matrimonyfreedom and considerationand she has got rid of the drawbacks why should she put her head into the noose again her usual motive is ambition if a man can offer her a great position make her a princess or an ambassadress she may think the compensation sufficient  andin that wayis madame de cintre ambitious  who knows said bellegarde with a profound shrug i dont pretend to say all that she is or all that she is not i think she might be touched by the prospect of becoming the wife of a great man but in a certain way i believe whatever she does will be the improbable dont be too confident but dont absolutely doubt your best chance for success will be precisely in being to her mind unusual unexpected original dont try to be any one else be simply yourself out and out something or other cant fail to come of it i am very curious to see what  i am much obliged to you for your advice said newman and he added with a smile i am glad for your sake i am going to be so amusing  it will be more than amusing said bellegarde it will be inspiring i look at it from my point of view and you from yours after all anything for a change and only yesterday i was yawning so as to dislocate my jaw and declaring that there was nothing new under the sun if it isnt new to see you come into the family as a suitor i am very much mistaken let me say that my dear fellow i wont call it anything else bad or good i will simply call it new and overcome with a sense of the novelty thus foreshadowed valentin de bellegarde threw himself into a deep armchair before the fire and with a fixed intense smile seemed to read a vision of it in the flame of the logs after a while he looked up go ahead my boy you have my good wishes he said but it is really a pity you dont understand me that you dont know just what i am doing  oh said newman laughing dont do anything wrong leave me to myself rather or defy me out and out i wouldnt lay any load on your conscience  bellegarde sprang up again he was evidently excited there was a warmer spark even than usual in his eye you never will understandyou never will know he said and if you succeed and i turn out to have helped you you will never be grateful not as i shall deserve you should be you will be an excellent fellow always but you will not be grateful but it doesnt matter for i shall get my own fun out of it and he broke into an extravagant laugh you look puzzled he added you look almost frightened  it is a pity said newman that i dont understand you i shall lose some very good jokes  i told you you remember that we were very strange people bellegarde went on i give you warning again we are my mother is strange my brother is strange and i verily believe that i am stranger than either you will even find my sister a little strange old trees have crooked branches old houses have queer cracks old races have odd secrets remember that we are eight hundred years old  very good said newman thats the sort of thing i came to europe for you come into my programme  touchezla then said bellegarde putting out his hand its a bargain i accept you i espouse your cause its because i like you in a great measure but that is not the only reason and he stood holding newmans hand and looking at him askance  what is the other one  i am in the opposition i dislike some one else  your brother asked newman in his unmodulated voice  bellegarde laid his fingers upon his lips with a whispered hush old races have strange secrets he said put yourself into motion come and see my sister and be assured of my sympathy and on this he took his leave  newman dropped into a chair before his fire and sat a long time staring into the blaze    chapter ix   he went to see madame de cintre the next day and was informed by the servant that she was at home he passed as usual up the large cold staircase and through a spacious vestibule above where the walls seemed all composed of small door panels touched with longfaded gilding whence he was ushered into the sittingroom in which he had already been received it was empty and the servant told him that madame la comtesse would presently appear he had time while he waited to wonder whether bellegarde had seen his sister since the evening before and whether in this case he had spoken to her of their talk in this case madame de cintres receiving him was an encouragement he felt a certain trepidation as he reflected that she might come in with the knowledge of his supreme admiration and of the project he had built upon it in her eyes but the feeling was not disagreeable her face could wear no look that would make it less beautiful and he was sure beforehand that however she might take the proposal he had in reserve she would not take it in scorn or in irony he had a feeling that if she could only read the bottom of his heart and measure the extent of his good will toward her she would be entirely kind  she came in at last after so long an interval that he wondered whether she had been hesitating she smiled with her usual frankness and held out her hand she looked at him straight with her soft and luminous eyes and said without a tremor in her voice that she was glad to see him and that she hoped he was well he found in her what he had found beforethat faint perfume of a personal shyness worn away by contact with the world but the more perceptible the more closely you approached her this lingering diffidence seemed to give a peculiar value to what was definite and assured in her manner it made it seem like an accomplishment a beautiful talent something that one might compare to an exquisite touch in a pianist it was in fact madame de cintres authority as they say of artists that especially impressed and fascinated newman he always came back to the feeling that when he should complete himself by taking a wife that was the way he should like his wife to interpret him to the world the only trouble indeed was that when the instrument was so perfect it seemed to interpose too much between you and the genius that used it madame de cintre gave newman the sense of an elaborate education of her having passed through mysterious ceremonies and processes of culture in her youth of her having been fashioned and made flexible to certain exalted social needs all this as i have affirmed made her seem rare and preciousa very expensive article as he would have said and one which a man with an ambition to have everything about him of the best would find it highly agreeable to possess but looking at the matter with an eye to private felicity newman wondered where in so exquisite a compound nature and art showed their dividing line where did the special intention separate from the habit of good manners where did urbanity end and sincerity begin newman asked himself these questions even while he stood ready to accept the admired object in all its complexity he felt that he could do so in profound security and examine its mechanism afterwards at leisure  i am very glad to find you alone he said you know i have never had such good luck before  but you have seemed before very well contented with your luck said madame de cintre you have sat and watched my visitors with an air of quiet amusement what have you thought of them  oh i have thought the ladies were very elegant and very graceful and wonderfully quick at repartee but what i have chiefly thought has been that they only helped me to admire you this was not gallantry on newmans partan art in which he was quite unversed it was simply the instinct of the practical man who had made up his mind what he wanted and was now beginning to take active steps to obtain it  madame de cintre started slightly and raised her eyebrows she had evidently not expected so fervid a compliment oh in that case she said with a laugh your finding me alone is not good luck for me i hope some one will come in quickly  i hope not said newman i have something particular to say to you have you seen your brother  yes i saw him an hour ago  did he tell you that he had seen me last night  he said so  and did he tell you what we had talked about  madame de cintre hesitated a moment as newman asked these questions she had grown a little pale as if she regarded what was coming as necessary but not as agreeable did you give him a message to me she asked  it was not exactly a messagei asked him to render me a service  the service was to sing your praises was it not and she accompanied this question with a little smile as if to make it easier to herself  yes that is what it really amounts to said newman did he sing my praises  he spoke very well of you but when i know that it was by your special request of course i must take his eulogy with a grain of salt  oh that makes no difference said newman your brother would not have spoken well of me unless he believed what he was saying he is too honest for that  are you very deep said madame de cintre are you trying to please me by praising my brother i confess it is a good way  for me any way that succeeds will be good i will praise your brother all day if that will help me he is a noble little fellow he has made me feel in promising to do what he can to help me that i can depend upon him  dont make too much of that said madame de cintre he can help you very little  of course i must work my way myself i know that very well i only want a chance to in consenting to see me after what he told you you almost seem to be giving me a chance  i am seeing you said madame de cintre slowly and gravely because i promised my brother i would  blessings on your brothers head cried newman what i told him last evening was this that i admired you more than any woman i had ever seen and that i should like immensely to make you my wife he uttered these words with great directness and firmness and without any sense of confusion he was full of his idea he had completely mastered it and he seemed to look down on madame de cintre with all her gathered elegance from the height of his bracing good conscience it is probable that this particular tone and manner were the very best he could have hit upon yet the light just visibly forced smile with which his companion had listened to him died away and she sat looking at him with her lips parted and her face as solemn as a tragic mask there was evidently something very painful to her in the scene to which he was subjecting her and yet her impatience of it found no angry voice newman wondered whether he was hurting her he could not imagine why the liberal devotion he meant to express should be disagreeable he got up and stood before her leaning one hand on the chimneypiece i know i have seen you very little to say this he said so little that it may make what i say seem disrespectful that is my misfortune i could have said it the first time i saw you really i had seen you before i had seen you in imagination you seemed almost an old friend so what i say is not mere gallantry and compliments and nonsensei cant talk that way i dont know how and i wouldnt to you if i could its as serious as such words can be i feel as if i knew you and knew what a beautiful admirable woman you are i shall know better perhaps some day but i have a general notion now you are just the woman i have been looking for except that you are far more perfect i wont make any protestations and vows but you can trust me it is very soon i know to say all this it is almost offensive but why not gain time if one can and if you want time to reflectof course you dothe sooner you begin the better for me i dont know what you think of me but there is no great mystery about me you see what i am your brother told me that my antecedents and occupations were against me that your family stands somehow on a higher level than i do that is an idea which of course i dont understand and dont accept but you dont care anything about that i can assure you that i am a very solid fellow and that if i give my mind to it i can arrange things so that in a very few years i shall not need to waste time in explaining who i am and what i am you will decide for yourself whether you like me or not what there is you see before you i honestly believe i have no hidden vices or nasty tricks i am kind kind kind everything that a man can give a woman i will give you i have a large fortune a very large fortune some day if you will allow me i will go into details if you want brilliancy everything in the way of brilliancy that money can give you you shall have and as regards anything you may give up dont take for granted too much that its place cannot be filled leave that to me ill take care of you i shall know what you need energy and ingenuity can arrange everything im a strong man there i have said what i had on my heart it was better to get it off i am very sorry if its disagreeable to you but think how much better it is that things should be clear dont answer me now if you dont wish it think about it think about it as slowly as you please of course i havent said i cant say half i mean especially about my admiration for you but take a favorable view of me it will only be just  during this speech the longest that newman had ever made madame de cintre kept her gaze fixed upon him and it expanded at the last into a sort of fascinated stare when he ceased speaking she lowered her eyes and sat for some moments looking down and straight before her then she slowly rose to her feet and a pair of exceptionally keen eyes would have perceived that she was trembling a little in the movement she still looked extremely serious i am very much obliged to you for your offer she said it seems very strange but i am glad you spoke without waiting any longer it is better the subject should be dismissed i appreciate all you say you do me great honor but i have decided not to marry  oh dont say that cried newman in a tone absolutely naif from its pleading and caressing cadence she had turned away and it made her stop a moment with her back to him think better of that you are too young too beautiful too much made to be happy and to make others happy if you are afraid of losing your freedom i can assure you that this freedom here this life you now lead is a dreary bondage to what i will offer you you shall do things that i dont think you have ever thought of i will take you anywhere in the wide world that you propose are you unhappy you give me a feeling that you are unhappy you have no right to be or to be made so let me come in and put an end to it  madame de cintre stood there a moment longer looking away from him if she was touched by the way he spoke the thing was conceivable his voice always very mild and interrogative gradually became as soft and as tenderly argumentative as if he had been talking to a muchloved child he stood watching her and she presently turned round again but this time she did not look at him and she spoke in a quietness in which there was a visible trace of effort  there are a great many reasons why i should not marry she said more than i can explain to you as for my happiness i am very happy your offer seems strange to me for more reasons also than i can say of course you have a perfect right to make it but i cannot accept itit is impossible please never speak of this matter again if you cannot promise me this i must ask you not to come back  why is it impossible newman demanded you may think it is at first without its really being so i didnt expect you to be pleased at first but i do believe that if you will think of it a good while you may be satisfied  i dont know you said madame de cintre think how little i know you  very little of course and therefore i dont ask for your ultimatum on the spot i only ask you not to say no and to let me hope i will wait as long as you desire meanwhile you can see more of me and know me better look at me as a possible husbandas a candidateand make up your mind  something was going on rapidly in madame de cintres thoughts she was weighing a question there beneath newmans eyes weighing it and deciding it from the moment i dont very respectfully beg you to leave the house and never return she said i listen to you i seem to give you hope i have listened to youagainst my judgment it is because you are eloquent if i had been told this morning that i should consent to consider you as a possible husband i should have thought my informant a little crazy i am listening to you you see and she threw her hands out for a moment and let them drop with a gesture in which there was just the slightest expression of appealing weakness  well as far as saying goes i have said everything said newman i believe in you without restriction and i think all the good of you that it is possible to think of a human creature i firmly believe that in marrying me you will be safe as i said just now he went on with a smile i have no bad ways i can do so much for you and if you are afraid that i am not what you have been accustomed to not refined and delicate and punctilious you may easily carry that too far i am delicate you shall see  madame de cintre walked some distance away and paused before a great plant an azalea which was flourishing in a porcelain tub before her window she plucked off one of the flowers and twisting it in her fingers retraced her steps then she sat down in silence and her attitude seemed to be a consent that newman should say more  why should you say it is impossible you should marry he continued the only thing that could make it really impossible would be your being already married is it because you have been unhappy in marriage that is all the more reason is it because your family exert a pressure upon you interfere with you annoy you that is still another reason you ought to be perfectly free and marriage will make you so i dont say anything against your familyunderstand that added newman with an eagerness which might have made a perspicacious observer smile whatever way you feel toward them is the right way and anything that you should wish me to do to make myself agreeable to them i will do as well as i know how depend upon that  madame de cintre rose again and came toward the fireplace near which newman was standing the expression of pain and embarrassment had passed out of her face and it was illuminated with something which this time at least newman need not have been perplexed whether to attribute to habit or to intention to art or to nature she had the air of a woman who has stepped across the frontier of friendship and looking around her finds the region vast a certain checked and controlled exaltation seemed mingled with the usual level radiance of her glance i will not refuse to see you again she said because much of what you have said has given me pleasure but i will see you only on this condition that you say nothing more in the same way for a long time  for how long  for six months it must be a solemn promise  very well i promise  goodby then she said and extended her hand  he held it a moment as if he were going to say something more but he only looked at her then he took his departure  that evening on the boulevard he met valentin de bellegarde after they had exchanged greetings newman told him that he had seen madame de cintre a few hours before  i know it said bellegarde i dined in the rue de luniversite and then for some moments both men were silent newman wished to ask bellegarde what visible impression his visit had made and the count valentin had a question of his own bellegarde spoke first  its none of my business but what the deuce did you say to my sister  i am willing to tell you said newman that i made her an offer of marriage  already and the young man gave a whistle time is money is that what you say in america and madame de cintre he added with an interrogative inflection  she did not accept my offer  she couldnt you know in that way  but im to see her again said newman  oh the strangeness of woman exclaimed bellegarde then he stopped and held newman off at armslength i look at you with respect he exclaimed you have achieved what we call a personal success immediately now i must present you to my brother  whenever you please said newman    chapter x   newman continued to see his friends the tristrams with a good deal of frequency though if you had listened to mrs tristrams account of the matter you would have supposed that they had been cynically repudiated for the sake of grander acquaintance we were all very well so long as we had no rivalswe were better than nothing but now that you have become the fashion and have your pick every day of three invitations to dinner we are tossed into the corner i am sure it is very good of you to come and see us once a month i wonder you dont send us your cards in an envelope when you do pray have them with black edges it will be for the death of my last illusion it was in this incisive strain that mrs tristram moralized over newmans socalled neglect which was in reality a most exemplary constancy of course she was joking but there was always something ironical in her jokes as there was always something jocular in her gravity  i know no better proof that i have treated you very well newman had said than the fact that you make so free with my character familiarity breeds contempt i have made myself too cheap if i had a little proper pride i would stay away a while and when you asked me to dinner say i was going to the princess borealskas but i have not any pride where my pleasure is concerned and to keep you in the humor to see meif you must see me only to call me bad namesi will agree to anything you choose i will admit that i am the biggest snob in paris newman in fact had declined an invitation personally given by the princess borealska an inquiring polish lady to whom he had been presented on the ground that on that particular day he always dined at mrs tristrams and it was only a tenderly perverse theory of his hostess of the avenue diena that he was faithless to his early friendships she needed the theory to explain a certain moral irritation by which she was often visited though if this explanation was unsound a deeper analyst than i must give the right one having launched our hero upon the current which was bearing him so rapidly along she appeared but halfpleased at its swiftness she had succeeded too well she had played her game too cleverly and she wished to mix up the cards newman had told her in due season that her friend was satisfactory the epithet was not romantic but mrs tristram had no difficulty in perceiving that in essentials the feeling which lay beneath it was indeed the mild expansive brevity with which it was uttered and a certain look at once appealing and inscrutable that issued from newmans halfclosed eyes as he leaned his head against the back of his chair seemed to her the most eloquent attestation of a mature sentiment that she had ever encountered newman was according to the french phrase only abounding in her own sense but his temperate raptures exerted a singular effect upon the ardor which she herself had so freely manifested a few months before she now seemed inclined to take a purely critical view of madame de cintre and wished to have it understood that she did not in the least answer for her being a compendium of all the virtues no woman was ever so good as that woman seems she said remember what shakespeare calls desdemona a supersubtle venetian madame de cintre is a supersubtle parisian she is a charming woman and she has five hundred merits but you had better keep that in mind was mrs tristram simply finding out that she was jealous of her dear friend on the other side of the seine and that in undertaking to provide newman with an ideal wife she had counted too much on her own disinterestedness we may be permitted to doubt it the inconsistent little lady of the avenue diena had an insuperable need of changing her place intellectually she had a lively imagination and she was capable at certain times of imagining the direct reverse of her most cherished beliefs with a vividness more intense than that of conviction she got tired of thinking aright but there was no serious harm in it as she got equally tired of thinking wrong in the midst of her mysterious perversities she had admirable flashes of justice one of these occurred when newman related to her that he had made a formal proposal to madame de cintre he repeated in a few words what he had said and in a great many what she had answered mrs tristram listened with extreme interest  but after all said newman there is nothing to congratulate me upon it is not a triumph  i beg your pardon said mrs tristram it is a great triumph it is a great triumph that she did not silence you at the first word and request you never to speak to her again  i dont see that observed newman  of course you dont heaven forbid you should when i told you to go on your own way and do what came into your head i had no idea you would go over the ground so fast i never dreamed you would offer yourself after five or six morningcalls as yet what had you done to make her like you you had simply satnot very straightand stared at her but she does like you  that remains to be seen  no that is proved what will come of it remains to be seen that you should propose to marry her without more ado could never have come into her head you can form very little idea of what passed through her mind as you spoke if she ever really marries you the affair will be characterized by the usual justice of all human beings towards women you will think you take generous views of her but you will never begin to know through what a strange sea of feeling she passed before she accepted you as she stood there in front of you the other day she plunged into it she said why not to something which a few hours earlier had been inconceivable she turned about on a thousand gathered prejudices and traditions as on a pivot and looked where she had never looked hitherto when i think of itwhen i think of claire de cintre and all that she represents there seems to me something very fine in it when i recommended you to try your fortune with her i of course thought well of you and in spite of your sins i think so still but i confess i dont see quite what you are and what you have done to make such a woman do this sort of thing for you  oh there is something very fine in it said newman with a laugh repeating her words he took an extreme satisfaction in hearing that there was something fine in it he had not the least doubt of it himself but he had already begun to value the worlds admiration of madame de cintre as adding to the prospective glory of possession  it was immediately after this conversation that valentin de bellegarde came to conduct his friend to the rue de luniversite to present him to the other members of his family you are already introduced he said and you have begun to be talked about my sister has mentioned your successive visits to my mother and it was an accident that my mother was present at none of them i have spoken of you as an american of immense wealth and the best fellow in the world who is looking for something very superior in the way of a wife  do you suppose asked newman that madame de cintre has related to your mother the last conversation i had with her  i am very certain that she has not she will keep her own counsel meanwhile you must make your way with the rest of the family thus much is known about you you have made a great fortune in trade you are a little eccentric and you frankly admire our dear claire my sisterinlaw whom you remember seeing in madame de cintres sittingroom took it appears a fancy to you she has described you as having beaucoup de cachet my mother therefore is curious to see you  she expects to laugh at me eh said newman  she never laughs if she does not like you dont hope to purchase favor by being amusing take warning by me  this conversation took place in the evening and half an hour later valentin ushered his companion into an apartment of the house of the rue de luniversite into which he had not yet penetrated the salon of the dowager marquise de bellegarde it was a vast high room with elaborate and ponderous mouldings painted a whitish gray along the upper portion of the walls and the ceiling with a great deal of faded and carefully repaired tapestry in the doorways and chairbacks a turkey carpet in light colors still soft and deep in spite of great antiquity on the floor and portraits of each of madame de bellegardes children at the age of ten suspended against an old screen of red silk the room was illumined exactly enough for conversation by half a dozen candles placed in odd corners at a great distance apart in a deep armchair near the fire sat an old lady in black at the other end of the room another person was seated at the piano playing a very expressive waltz in this latter person newman recognized the young marquise de bellegarde  valentin presented his friend and newman walked up to the old lady by the fire and shook hands with her he received a rapid impression of a white delicate aged face with a high forehead a small mouth and a pair of cold blue eyes which had kept much of the freshness of youth madame de bellegarde looked hard at him and returned his handshake with a sort of british positiveness which reminded him that she was the daughter of the earl of st dunstans her daughterinlaw stopped playing and gave him an agreeable smile newman sat down and looked about him while valentin went and kissed the hand of the young marquise  i ought to have seen you before said madame de bellegarde you have paid several visits to my daughter  oh yes said newman smiling madame de cintre and i are old friends by this time  you have gone fast said madame de bellegarde  not so fast as i should like said newman bravely  oh you are very ambitious answered the old lady  yes i confess i am said newman smiling  madame de bellegarde looked at him with her cold fine eyes and he returned her gaze reflecting that she was a possible adversary and trying to take her measure their eyes remained in contact for some moments then madame de bellegarde looked away and without smiling i am very ambitious too she said  newman felt that taking her measure was not easy she was a formidable inscrutable little woman she resembled her daughter and yet she was utterly unlike her the coloring in madame de cintre was the same and the high delicacy of her brow and nose was hereditary but her face was a larger and freer copy and her mouth in especial a happy divergence from that conservative orifice a little pair of lips at once plump and pinched that looked when closed as if they could not open wider than to swallow a gooseberry or to emit an oh dear no which probably had been thought to give the finishing touch to the aristocratic prettiness of the lady emmeline atheling as represented forty years before in several books of beauty madame de cintres face had to newmans eye a range of expression as delightfully vast as the windstreaked cloudflecked distance on a western prairie but her mothers white intense respectable countenance with its formal gaze and its circumscribed smile suggested a document signed and sealed a thing of parchment ink and ruled lines she is a woman of conventions and proprieties he said to himself as he looked at her her world is the world of things immutably decreed but how she is at home in it and what a paradise she finds it she walks about in it as if it were a blooming park a garden of eden and when she sees this is genteel or this is improper written on a milestone she stops ecstatically as if she were listening to a nightingale or smelling a rose madame de bellegarde wore a little black velvet hood tied under her chin and she was wrapped in an old black cashmere shawl  you are an american she said presently i have seen several americans  there are several in paris said newman jocosely  oh really said madame de bellegarde it was in england i saw these or somewhere else not in paris i think it must have been in the pyrenees many years ago i am told your ladies are very pretty one of these ladies was very pretty such a wonderful complexion she presented me a note of introduction from some onei forgot whomand she sent with it a note of her own i kept her letter a long time afterwards it was so strangely expressed i used to know some of the phrases by heart but i have forgotten them now it is so many years ago since then i have seen no more americans i think my daughterinlaw has she is a great gadabout she sees every one  at this the younger lady came rustling forward pinching in a very slender waist and casting idly preoccupied glances over the front of her dress which was apparently designed for a ball she was in a singular way at once ugly and pretty she had protuberant eyes and lips strangely red she reminded newman of his friend mademoiselle nioche this was what that muchobstructed young lady would have liked to be valentin de bellegarde walked behind her at a distance hopping about to keep off the farspreading train of her dress  you ought to show more of your shoulders behind he said very gravely you might as well wear a standing ruff as such a dress as that  the young woman turned her back to the mirror over the chimneypiece and glanced behind her to verify valentins assertion the mirror descended low and yet it reflected nothing but a large unclad flesh surface the young marquise put her hands behind her and gave a downward pull to the waist of her dress like that you mean she asked  that is a little better said bellegarde in the same tone but it leaves a good deal to be desired  oh i never go to extremes said his sisterinlaw and then turning to madame de bellegarde what were you calling me just now madame  i called you a gadabout said the old lady but i might call you something else too  a gadabout what an ugly word what does it mean  a very beautiful person newman ventured to say seeing that it was in french  that is a pretty compliment but a bad translation said the young marquise and then looking at him a moment do you dance  not a step  you are very wrong she said simply and with another look at her back in the mirror she turned away  do you like paris asked the old lady who was apparently wondering what was the proper way to talk to an american  yes rather said newman and then he added with a friendly intonation dont you  i cant say i know it i know my housei know my friendsi dont know paris  oh you lose a great deal said newman sympathetically  madame de bellegarde stared it was presumably the first time she had been condoled with on her losses  i am content with what i have she said with dignity  newmans eyes at this moment were wandering round the room which struck him as rather sad and shabby passing from the high casements with their small thicklyframed panes to the sallow tints of two or three portraits in pastel of the last century which hung between them he ought obviously to have answered that the contentment of his hostess was quite naturalshe had a great deal but the idea did not occur to him during the pause of some moments which followed  well my dear mother said valentin coming and leaning against the chimneypiece what do you think of my dear friend newman is he not the excellent fellow i told you  my acquaintance with mr newman has not gone very far said madame de bellegarde i can as yet only appreciate his great politeness  my mother is a great judge of these matters said valentin to newman if you have satisfied her it is a triumph  i hope i shall satisfy you some day said newman looking at the old lady i have done nothing yet  you must not listen to my son he will bring you into trouble he is a sad scatterbrain  oh i like himi like him said newman genially  he amuses you eh  yes perfectly  do you hear that valentin said madame de bellegarde you amuse mr newman  perhaps we shall all come to that valentin exclaimed  you must see my other son said madame de bellegarde he is much better than this one but he will not amuse you  i dont knowi dont know murmured valentin reflectively but we shall very soon see here comes monsieur mon frere  the door had just opened to give ingress to a gentleman who stepped forward and whose face newman remembered he had been the author of our heros discomfiture the first time he tried to present himself to madame de cintre valentin de bellegarde went to meet his brother looked at him a moment and then taking him by the arm led him up to newman  this is my excellent friend mr newman he said very blandly you must know him  i am delighted to know mr newman said the marquis with a low bow but without offering his hand  he is the old woman at secondhand newman said to himself as he returned m de bellegardes greeting and this was the startingpoint of a speculative theory in his mind that the late marquis had been a very amiable foreigner with an inclination to take life easily and a sense that it was difficult for the husband of the stilted little lady by the fire to do so but if he had taken little comfort in his wife he had taken much in his two younger children who were after his own heart while madame de bellegarde had paired with her eldestborn  my brother has spoken to me of you said m de bellegarde and as you are also acquainted with my sister it was time we should meet he turned to his mother and gallantly bent over her hand touching it with his lips and then he assumed an attitude before the chimneypiece with his long lean face his highbridged nose and his small opaque eye he looked much like an englishman his whiskers were fair and glossy and he had a large dimple of unmistakably british origin in the middle of his handsome chin he was distinguished to the tips of his polished nails and there was not a movement of his fine perpendicular person that was not noble and majestic newman had never yet been confronted with such an incarnation of the art of taking ones self seriously he felt a sort of impulse to step backward as you do to get a view of a great facade  urbain said young madame de bellegarde who had apparently been waiting for her husband to take her to her ball i call your attention to the fact that i am dressed  that is a good idea murmured valentin  i am at your orders my dear friend said m de bellegarde only you must allow me first the pleasure of a little conversation with mr newman  oh if you are going to a party dont let me keep you objected newman i am very sure we shall meet again indeed if you would like to converse with me i will gladly name an hour he was eager to make it known that he would readily answer all questions and satisfy all exactions  m de bellegarde stood in a wellbalanced position before the fire caressing one of his fair whiskers with one of his white hands and looking at newman half askance with eyes from which a particular ray of observation made its way through a general meaningless smile it is very kind of you to make such an offer he said if i am not mistaken your occupations are such as to make your time precious you are inaas we say dans les affaires  in business you mean oh no i have thrown business overboard for the present i am loafing as we say my time is quite my own  ah you are taking a holiday rejoined m de bellegarde loafing yes i have heard that expression  mr newman is american said madame de bellegarde  my brother is a great ethnologist said valentin  an ethnologist said newman ah you collect negroes skulls and that sort of thing  the marquis looked hard at his brother and began to caress his other whisker then turning to newman with sustained urbanity you are traveling for your pleasure he asked  oh i am knocking about to pick up one thing and another of course i get a good deal of pleasure out of it  what especially interests you inquired the marquis  well everything interests me said newman i am not particular manufactures are what i care most about  that has been your specialty  i cant say i have any specialty my specialty has been to make the largest possible fortune in the shortest possible time newman made this last remark very deliberately he wished to open the way if it were necessary to an authoritative statement of his means  m de bellegarde laughed agreeably i hope you have succeeded he said  yes i have made a fortune in a reasonable time i am not so old you see  paris is a very good place to spend a fortune i wish you great enjoyment of yours and m de bellegarde drew forth his gloves and began to put them on  newman for a few moments watched him sliding his white hands into the white kid and as he did so his feelings took a singular turn m de bellegardes good wishes seemed to descend out of the white expanse of his sublime serenity with the soft scattered movement of a shower of snowflakes yet newman was not irritated he did not feel that he was being patronized he was conscious of no especial impulse to introduce a discord into so noble a harmony only he felt himself suddenly in personal contact with the forces with which his friend valentin had told him that he would have to contend and he became sensible of their intensity he wished to make some answering manifestation to stretch himself out at his own length to sound a note at the uttermost end of his scale it must be added that if this impulse was not vicious or malicious it was by no means void of humorous expectancy newman was quite as ready to give play to that looselyadjusted smile of his if his hosts should happen to be shocked as he was far from deliberately planning to shock them  paris is a very good place for idle people he said or it is a very good place if your family has been settled here for a long time and you have made acquaintances and got your relations round you or if you have got a good big house like this and a wife and children and mother and sister and everything comfortable i dont like that way of living all in rooms next door to each other but i am not an idler i try to be but i cant manage it it goes against the grain my business habits are too deepseated then i havent any house to call my own or anything in the way of a family my sisters are five thousand miles away my mother died when i was a youngster and i havent any wife i wish i had so you see i dont exactly know what to do with myself i am not fond of books as you are sir and i get tired of dining out and going to the opera i miss my business activity you see i began to earn my living when i was almost a baby and until a few months ago i have never had my hand off the plow elegant leisure comes hard  this speech was followed by a profound silence of some moments on the part of newmans entertainers valentin stood looking at him fixedly with his hands in his pockets and then he slowly with a halfsidling motion went out of the door the marquis continued to draw on his gloves and to smile benignantly  you began to earn your living when you were a mere baby said the marquise  hardly morea small boy  you say you are not fond of books said m de bellegarde but you must do yourself the justice to remember that your studies were interrupted early  that is very true on my tenth birthday i stopped going to school i thought it was a grand way to keep it but i picked up some information afterwards said newman reassuringly  you have some sisters asked old madame de bellegarde  yes two sisters splendid women  i hope that for them the hardships of life commenced less early  they married very early if you call that a hardship as girls do in our western country one of them is married to the owner of the largest indiarubber house in the west  ah you make houses also of indiarubber inquired the marquise  you can stretch them as your family increases said young madame de bellegarde who was muffling herself in a long white shawl  newman indulged in a burst of hilarity and explained that the house in which his brotherinlaw lived was a large wooden structure but that he manufactured and sold indiarubber on a colossal scale  my children have some little indiarubber shoes which they put on when they go to play in the tuileries in damp weather said the young marquise i wonder whether your brotherinlaw made them  very likely said newman if he did you may be very sure they are well made  well you must not be discouraged said m de bellegarde with vague urbanity  oh i dont mean to be i have a project which gives me plenty to think about and that is an occupation and then newman was silent a moment hesitating yet thinking rapidly he wished to make his point and yet to do so forced him to speak out in a way that was disagreeable to him nevertheless he continued addressing himself to old madame de bellegarde i will tell you my project perhaps you can help me i want to take a wife  it is a very good project but i am no matchmaker said the old lady  newman looked at her an instant and then with perfect sincerity i should have thought you were he declared  madame de bellegarde appeared to think him too sincere she murmured something sharply in french and fixed her eyes on her son at this moment the door of the room was thrown open and with a rapid step valentin reappeared  i have a message for you he said to his sisterinlaw claire bids me to request you not to start for your ball she will go with you  claire will go with us cried the young marquise en voila du nouveau  she has changed her mind she decided half an hour ago and she is sticking the last diamond into her hair said valentin  what has taken possession of my daughter demanded madame de bellegarde sternly she has not been into the world these three years does she take such a step at half an hours notice and without consulting me  she consulted me dear mother five minutes since said valentin and i told her that such a beautiful womanshe is beautiful you will seehad no right to bury herself alive  you should have referred claire to her mother my brother said m de bellegarde in french this is very strange  i refer her to the whole company said valentin here she comes and he went to the open door met madame de cintre on the threshold took her by the hand and led her into the room she was dressed in white but a long blue cloak which hung almost to her feet was fastened across her shoulders by a silver clasp she had tossed it back however and her long white arms were uncovered in her dense fair hair there glittered a dozen diamonds she looked serious and newman thought rather pale but she glanced round her and when she saw him smiled and put out her hand he thought her tremendously handsome he had a chance to look at her full in the face for she stood a moment in the centre of the room hesitating apparently what she should do without meeting his eyes then she went up to her mother who sat in her deep chair by the fire looking at madame de cintre almost fiercely with her back turned to the others madame de cintre held her cloak apart to show her dress  what do you think of me she asked  i think you are audacious said the marquise it was but three days ago when i asked you as a particular favor to myself to go to the duchess de lusignans that you told me you were going nowhere and that one must be consistent is this your consistency why should you distinguish madame robineau who is it you wish to please tonight  i wish to please myself dear mother said madame de cintre and she bent over and kissed the old lady  i dont like surprises my sister said urbain de bellegarde especially when one is on the point of entering a drawingroom  newman at this juncture felt inspired to speak oh if you are going into a room with madame de cintre you neednt be afraid of being noticed yourself  m de bellegarde turned to his sister with a smile too intense to be easy i hope you appreciate a compliment that is paid you at your brothers expense he said come come madame and offering madame de cintre his arm he led her rapidly out of the room valentin rendered the same service to young madame de bellegarde who had apparently been reflecting on the fact that the ball dress of her sisterinlaw was much less brilliant than her own and yet had failed to derive absolute comfort from the reflection with a farewell smile she sought the complement of her consolation in the eyes of the american visitor and perceiving in them a certain mysterious brilliancy it is not improbable that she may have flattered herself she had found it  newman left alone with old madame de bellegarde stood before her a few moments in silence your daughter is very beautiful he said at last  she is very strange said madame de bellegarde  i am glad to hear it newman rejoined smiling it makes me hope  hope what  that she will consent some day to marry me  the old lady slowly rose to her feet that really is your project then  yes will you favor it  favor it madame de bellegarde looked at him a moment and then shook her head no she said softly  will you suffer it then will you let it pass  you dont know what you ask i am a very proud and meddlesome old woman  well i am very rich said newman  madame de bellegarde fixed her eyes on the floor and newman thought it probable she was weighing the reasons in favor of resenting the brutality of this remark but at last looking up she said simply how rich  newman expressed his income in a round number which had the magnificent sound that large aggregations of dollars put on when they are translated into francs he added a few remarks of a financial character which completed a sufficiently striking presentment of his resources  madame de bellegarde listened in silence you are very frank she said finally i will be the same i would rather favor you on the whole than suffer you it will be easier  i am thankful for any terms said newman but for the present you have suffered me long enough good night and he took his leave    chapter xi   newman on his return to paris had not resumed the study of french conversation with m nioche he found that he had too many other uses for his time m nioche however came to see him very promptly having learned his whereabouts by a mysterious process to which his patron never obtained the key the shrunken little capitalist repeated his visit more than once he seemed oppressed by a humiliating sense of having been overpaid and wished apparently to redeem his debt by the offer of grammatical and statistical information in small installments he wore the same decently melancholy aspect as a few months before a few months more or less of brushing could make little difference in the antique lustre of his coat and hat but the poor old mans spirit was a trifle more threadbare it seemed to have received some hard rubs during the summer newman inquired with interest about mademoiselle noemie and m nioche at first for answer simply looked at him in lachrymose silence  dont ask me sir he said at last i sit and watch her but i can do nothing  do you mean that she misconducts herself  i dont know i am sure i cant follow her i dont understand her she has something in her head i dont know what she is trying to do she is too deep for me  does she continue to go to the louvre has she made any of those copies for me  she goes to the louvre but i see nothing of the copies she has something on her easel i suppose it is one of the pictures you ordered such a magnificent order ought to give her fairyfingers but she is not in earnest i cant say anything to her i am afraid of her one evening last summer when i took her to walk in the champs elysees she said some things to me that frightened me  what were they  excuse an unhappy father from telling you said m nioche unfolding his calico pockethandkerchief  newman promised himself to pay mademoiselle noemie another visit at the louvre he was curious about the progress of his copies but it must be added that he was still more curious about the progress of the young lady herself he went one afternoon to the great museum and wandered through several of the rooms in fruitless quest of her he was bending his steps to the long hall of the italian masters when suddenly he found himself face to face with valentin de bellegarde the young frenchman greeted him with ardor and assured him that he was a godsend he himself was in the worst of humors and he wanted some one to contradict  in a bad humor among all these beautiful things said newman i thought you were so fond of pictures especially the old black ones there are two or three here that ought to keep you in spirits  oh today answered valentin i am not in a mood for pictures and the more beautiful they are the less i like them their great staring eyes and fixed positions irritate me i feel as if i were at some big dull party in a room full of people i shouldnt wish to speak to what should i care for their beauty its a bore and worse still its a reproach i have a great many ennuis i feel vicious  if the louvre has so little comfort for you why in the world did you come here newman asked  that is one of my ennuis i came to meet my cousina dreadful english cousin a member of my mothers familywho is in paris for a week for her husband and who wishes me to point out the principal beauties imagine a woman who wears a green crape bonnet in december and has straps sticking out of the ankles of her interminable boots my mother begged i would do something to oblige them i have undertaken to play valet de place this afternoon they were to have met me here at two oclock and i have been waiting for them twenty minutes why doesnt she arrive she has at least a pair of feet to carry her i dont know whether to be furious at their playing me false or delighted to have escaped them  i think in your place i would be furious said newman because they may arrive yet and then your fury will still be of use to you whereas if you were delighted and they were afterwards to turn up you might not know what to do with your delight  you give me excellent advice and i already feel better i will be furious i will let them go to the deuce and i myself will go with youunless by chance you too have a rendezvous  it is not exactly a rendezvous said newman but i have in fact come to see a person not a picture  a woman presumably  a young lady  well said valentin i hope for you with all my heart that she is not clothed in green tulle and that her feet are not too much out of focus  i dont know much about her feet but she has very pretty hands  valentin gave a sigh and on that assurance i must part with you  i am not certain of finding my young lady said newman and i am not quite prepared to lose your company on the chance it does not strike me as particularly desirable to introduce you to her and yet i should rather like to have your opinion of her  is she pretty  i guess you will think so  bellegarde passed his arm into that of his companion conduct me to her on the instant i should be ashamed to make a pretty woman wait for my verdict  newman suffered himself to be gently propelled in the direction in which he had been walking but his step was not rapid he was turning something over in his mind the two men passed into the long gallery of the italian masters and newman after having scanned for a moment its brilliant vista turned aside into the smaller apartment devoted to the same school on the left it contained very few persons but at the farther end of it sat mademoiselle nioche before her easel she was not at work her palette and brushes had been laid down beside her her hands were folded in her lap and she was leaning back in her chair and looking intently at two ladies on the other side of the hall who with their backs turned to her had stopped before one of the pictures these ladies were apparently persons of high fashion they were dressed with great splendor and their long silken trains and furbelows were spread over the polished floor it was at their dresses mademoiselle noemie was looking though what she was thinking of i am unable to say i hazard the supposition that she was saying to herself that to be able to drag such a train over a polished floor was a felicity worth any price her reflections at any rate were disturbed by the advent of newman and his companion she glanced at them quickly and then coloring a little rose and stood before her easel  i came here on purpose to see you said newman in his bad french offering to shake hands and then like a good american he introduced valentin formally allow me to make you acquainted with the comte valentin de bellegarde  valentin made a bow which must have seemed to mademoiselle noemie quite in harmony with the impressiveness of his title but the graceful brevity of her own response made no concession to underbred surprise she turned to newman putting up her hands to her hair and smoothing its delicatelyfelt roughness then rapidly she turned the canvas that was on her easel over upon its face you have not forgotten me she asked  i shall never forget you said newman you may be sure of that  oh said the young girl there are a great many different ways of remembering a person and she looked straight at valentin de bellegarde who was looking at her as a gentleman may when a verdict is expected of him  have you painted anything for me said newman have you been industrious  no i have done nothing and taking up her palette she began to mix her colors at hazard  but your father tells me you have come here constantly  i have nowhere else to go here all summer it was cool at least  being here then said newman you might have tried something  i told you before she answered softly that i dont know how to paint  but you have something charming on your easel now said valentin if you would only let me see it  she spread out her two hands with the fingers expanded over the back of the canvasthose hands which newman had called pretty and which in spite of several paintstains valentin could now admire my painting is not charming she said  it is the only thing about you that is not then mademoiselle quoth valentin gallantly  she took up her little canvas and silently passed it to him he looked at it and in a moment she said i am sure you are a judge  yes he answered i am  you know then that that is very bad  mon dieu said valentin shrugging his shoulders let us distinguish  you know that i ought not to attempt to paint the young girl continued  frankly then mademoiselle i think you ought not  she began to look at the dresses of the two splendid ladies againa point on which having risked one conjecture i think i may risk another while she was looking at the ladies she was seeing valentin de bellegarde he at all events was seeing her he put down the roughlybesmeared canvas and addressed a little click with his tongue accompanied by an elevation of the eyebrows to newman  where have you been all these months asked mademoiselle noemie of our hero you took those great journeys you amused yourself well  oh yes said newman i amused myself well enough  i am very glad said mademoiselle noemie with extreme gentleness and she began to dabble in her colors again she was singularly pretty with the look of serious sympathy that she threw into her face  valentin took advantage of her downcast eyes to telegraph again to his companion he renewed his mysterious physiognomical play making at the same time a rapid tremulous movement in the air with his fingers he was evidently finding mademoiselle noemie extremely interesting the blue devils had departed leaving the field clear  tell me something about your travels murmured the young girl  oh i went to switzerlandto geneva and zermatt and zurich and all those places you know and down to venice and all through germany and down the rhine and into holland and belgiumthe regular round how do you say that in frenchthe regular round newman asked of valentin  mademoiselle nioche fixed her eyes an instant on bellegarde and then with a little smile i dont understand monsieur she said when he says so much at once would you be so good as to translate  i would rather talk to you out of my own head valentin declared  no said newman gravely still in his bad french you must not talk to mademoiselle nioche because you say discouraging things you ought to tell her to work to persevere  and we french mademoiselle said valentin are accused of being false flatterers  i dont want any flattery i want only the truth but i know the truth  all i say is that i suspect there are some things that you can do better than paint said valentin  i know the truthi know the truth mademoiselle noemie repeated and dipping a brush into a clot of red paint she drew a great horizontal daub across her unfinished picture  what is that asked newman  without answering she drew another long crimson daub in a vertical direction down the middle of her canvas and so in a moment completed the rough indication of a cross it is the sign of the truth she said at last  the two men looked at each other and valentin indulged in another flash of physiognomical eloquence you have spoiled your picture said newman  i know that very well it was the only thing to do with it i had sat looking at it all day without touching it i had begun to hate it it seemed to me something was going to happen  i like it better that way than as it was before said valentin now it is more interesting it tells a story is it for sale  everything i have is for sale said mademoiselle noemie  how much is this thing  ten thousand francs said the young girl without a smile  everything that mademoiselle nioche may do at present is mine in advance said newman it makes part of an order i gave her some months ago so you cant have this  monsieur will lose nothing by it said the young girl looking at valentin and she began to put up her utensils  i shall have gained a charming memory said valentin you are going away your day is over  my father is coming to fetch me said mademoiselle noemie  she had hardly spoken when through the door behind her which opens on one of the great white stone staircases of the louvre m nioche made his appearance he came in with his usual even patient shuffle and he made a low salute to the two gentlemen who were standing before his daughters easel newman shook his hands with muscular friendliness and valentin returned his greeting with extreme deference while the old man stood waiting for noemie to make a parcel of her implements he let his mild oblique gaze hover toward bellegarde who was watching mademoiselle noemie put on her bonnet and mantle valentin was at no pains to disguise his scrutiny he looked at a pretty girl as he would have listened to a piece of music attention in each case was simple good manners m nioche at last took his daughters paintbox in one hand and the bedaubed canvas after giving it a solemn puzzled stare in the other and led the way to the door mademoiselle noemie made the young men the salute of a duchess and followed her father  well said newman what do you think of her  she is very remarkable diable diable diable repeated m de bellegarde reflectively she is very remarkable  i am afraid she is a sad little adventuress said newman  not a little onea great one she has the material and valentin began to walk away slowly looking vaguely at the pictures on the walls with a thoughtful illumination in his eye nothing could have appealed to his imagination more than the possible adventures of a young lady endowed with the material of mademoiselle nioche she is very interesting he went on she is a beautiful type  a beautiful type what the deuce do you mean asked newman  i mean from the artistic point of view she is an artistoutside of her painting which obviously is execrable  but she is not beautiful i dont even think her very pretty  she is quite pretty enough for her purposes and it is a face and figure on which everything tells if she were prettier she would be less intelligent and her intelligence is half of her charm  in what way asked newman who was much amused at his companions immediate philosophization of mademoiselle nioche does her intelligence strike you as so remarkable  she has taken the measure of life and she has determined to be somethingto succeed at any cost her painting of course is a mere trick to gain time she is waiting for her chance she wishes to launch herself and to do it well she knows her paris she is one of fifty thousand so far as the mere ambition goes but i am very sure that in the way of resolution and capacity she is a rarity and in one giftperfect heartlessnessi will warrant she is unsurpassed she has not as much heart as will go on the point of a needle that is an immense virtue yes she is one of the celebrities of the future  heaven help us said newman how far the artistic point of view may take a man but in this case i must request that you dont let it take you too far you have learned a wonderful deal about mademoiselle noemie in a quarter of an hour let that suffice dont follow up your researches  my dear fellow cried bellegarde with warmth i hope i have too good manners to intrude  you are not intruding the girl is nothing to me in fact i rather dislike her but i like her poor old father and for his sake i beg you to abstain from any attempt to verify your theories  for the sake of that seedy old gentleman who came to fetch her demanded valentin stopping short and on newmans assenting ah no ah no he went on with a smile you are quite wrong my dear fellow you neednt mind him  i verily believe that you are accusing the poor gentleman of being capable of rejoicing in his daughters dishonor  voyons said valentin who is he what is he  he is what he looks like as poor as a rat but very hightoned  exactly i noticed him perfectly be sure i do him justice he has had losses des malheurs as we say he is very lowspirited and his daughter is too much for him he is the pink of respectability and he has sixty years of honesty on his back all this i perfectly appreciate but i know my fellowmen and my fellowparisians and i will make a bargain with you newman gave ear to his bargain and he went on he would rather his daughter were a good girl than a bad one but if the worst comes to the worst the old man will not do what virginius did success justifies everything if mademoiselle noemie makes a figure her papa will feelwell we will call it relieved and she will make a figure the old gentlemans future is assured  i dont know what virginius did but m nioche will shoot miss noemie said newman after that i suppose his future will be assured in some snug prison  i am not a cynic i am simply an observer valentin rejoined mademoiselle noemie interests me she is extremely remarkable if there is a good reason in honor or decency for dismissing her from my thoughts forever i am perfectly willing to do it your estimate of the papas sensibilities is a good reason until it is invalidated i promise you not to look at the young girl again until you tell me that you have changed your mind about the papa when he has given distinct proof of being a philosopher you will raise your interdict do you agree to that  do you mean to bribe him  oh you admit then that he is bribable no he would ask too much and it would not be exactly fair i mean simply to wait you will continue i suppose to see this interesting couple and you will give me the news yourself  well said newman if the old man turns out a humbug you may do what you please i wash my hands of the matter for the girl herself you may be at rest i dont know what harm she may do to me but i certainly cant hurt her it seems to me said newman that you are very well matched you are both hard cases and m nioche and i i believe are the only virtuous men to be found in paris  soon after this m de bellegarde in punishment for his levity received a stern poke in the back from a pointed instrument turning quickly round he found the weapon to be a parasol wielded by a lady in green gauze bonnet valentins english cousins had been drifting about unpiloted and evidently deemed that they had a grievance newman left him to their mercies but with a boundless faith in his power to plead his cause    chapter xii   three days after his introduction to the family of madame de cintre newman coming in toward evening found upon his table the card of the marquis de bellegarde on the following day he received a note informing him that the marquise de bellegarde would be grateful for the honor of his company at dinner  he went of course though he had to break another engagement to do it he was ushered into the room in which madame de bellegarde had received him before and here he found his venerable hostess surrounded by her entire family the room was lighted only by the crackling fire which illuminated the very small pink slippers of a lady who seated in a low chair was stretching out her toes before it this lady was the younger madame de bellegarde madame de cintre was seated at the other end of the room holding a little girl against her knee the child of her brother urbain to whom she was apparently relating a wonderful story valentin was sitting on a puff close to his sisterinlaw into whose ear he was certainly distilling the finest nonsense the marquis was stationed before the fire with his head erect and his hands behind him in an attitude of formal expectancy  old madame de bellegarde stood up to give newman her greeting and there was that in the way she did so which seemed to measure narrowly the extent of her condescension we are all alone you see we have asked no one else she said austerely  i am very glad you didnt this is much more sociable said newman good evening sir and he offered his hand to the marquis  m de bellegarde was affable but in spite of his dignity he was restless he began to pace up and down the room he looked out of the long windows he took up books and laid them down again young madame de bellegarde gave newman her hand without moving and without looking at him  you may think that is coldness exclaimed valentin but it is not it is warmth it shows she is treating you as an intimate now she detests me and yet she is always looking at me  no wonder i detest you if i am always looking at you cried the lady if mr newman does not like my way of shaking hands i will do it again  but this charming privilege was lost upon our hero who was already making his way across the room to madame de cintre she looked at him as she shook hands but she went on with the story she was telling her little niece she had only two or three phrases to add but they were apparently of great moment she deepened her voice smiling as she did so and the little girl gazed at her with round eyes  but in the end the young prince married the beautiful florabella said madame de cintre and carried her off to live with him in the land of the pink sky there she was so happy that she forgot all her troubles and went out to drive every day of her life in an ivory coach drawn by five hundred white mice poor florabella she exclaimed to newman had suffered terribly  she had had nothing to eat for six months said little blanche  yes but when the six months were over she had a plumcake as big as that ottoman said madame de cintre that quite set her up again  what a checkered career said newman are you very fond of children he was certain that she was but he wished to make her say it  i like to talk with them she answered we can talk with them so much more seriously than with grown persons that is great nonsense that i have been telling blanche but it is a great deal more serious than most of what we say in society  i wish you would talk to me then as if i were blanches age said newman laughing were you happy at your ball the other night  ecstatically  now you are talking the nonsense that we talk in society said newman i dont believe that  it was my own fault if i was not happy the ball was very pretty and every one very amiable  it was on your conscience said newman that you had annoyed your mother and your brother  madame de cintre looked at him a moment without answering that is true she replied at last i had undertaken more than i could carry out i have very little courage i am not a heroine she said this with a certain soft emphasis but then changing her tone i could never have gone through the sufferings of the beautiful florabella she added not even for her prospective rewards  dinner was announced and newman betook himself to the side of the old madame de bellegarde the diningroom at the end of a cold corridor was vast and sombre the dinner was simple and delicately excellent newman wondered whether madame de cintre had had something to do with ordering the repast and greatly hoped she had once seated at table with the various members of the ancient house of bellegarde around him he asked himself the meaning of his position was the old lady responding to his advances did the fact that he was a solitary guest augment his credit or diminish it were they ashamed to show him to other people or did they wish to give him a sign of sudden adoption into their last reserve of favor newman was on his guard he was watchful and conjectural and yet at the same time he was vaguely indifferent whether they gave him a long rope or a short one he was there now and madame de cintre was opposite to him she had a tall candlestick on each side of her she would sit there for the next hour and that was enough the dinner was extremely solemn and measured he wondered whether this was always the state of things in old families madame de bellegarde held her head very high and fixed her eyes which looked peculiarly sharp in her little finelywrinkled white face very intently upon the tableservice the marquis appeared to have decided that the fine arts offered a safe subject of conversation as not leading to startling personal revelations every now and then having learned from newman that he had been through the museums of europe he uttered some polished aphorism upon the fleshtints of rubens and the good taste of sansovino his manners seemed to indicate a fine nervous dread that something disagreeable might happen if the atmosphere were not purified by allusions of a thoroughly superior cast what under the sun is the man afraid of newman asked himself does he think i am going to offer to swap jackknives with him it was useless to shut his eyes to the fact that the marquis was profoundly disagreeable to him he had never been a man of strong personal aversions his nerves had not been at the mercy of the mystical qualities of his neighbors but here was a man towards whom he was irresistibly in opposition a man of forms and phrases and postures a man full of possible impertinences and treacheries m de bellegarde made him feel as if he were standing barefooted on a marble floor and yet to gain his desire newman felt perfectly able to stand he wondered what madame de cintre thought of his being accepted if accepted it was there was no judging from her face which expressed simply the desire to be gracious in a manner which should require as little explicit recognition as possible young madame de bellegarde had always the same manners she was always preoccupied distracted listening to everything and hearing nothing looking at her dress her rings her fingernails seeming rather bored and yet puzzling you to decide what was her ideal of social diversion newman was enlightened on this point later even valentin did not quite seem master of his wits his vivacity was fitful and forced yet newman observed that in the lapses of his talk he appeared excited his eyes had an intenser spark than usual the effect of all this was that newman for the first time in his life was not himself that he measured his movements and counted his words and resolved that if the occasion demanded that he should appear to have swallowed a ramrod he would meet the emergency  after dinner m de bellegarde proposed to his guest that they should go into the smokingroom and he led the way toward a small somewhat musty apartment the walls of which were ornamented with old hangings of stamped leather and trophies of rusty arms newman refused a cigar but he established himself upon one of the divans while the marquis puffed his own weed before the fireplace and valentin sat looking through the light fumes of a cigarette from one to the other  i cant keep quiet any longer said valentin at last i must tell you the news and congratulate you my brother seems unable to come to the point he revolves around his announcement like the priest around the altar you are accepted as a candidate for the hand of our sister  valentin be a little proper murmured the marquis with a look of the most delicate irritation contracting the bridge of his high nose  there has been a family council the young man continued my mother and urbain have put their heads together and even my testimony has not been altogether excluded my mother and the marquis sat at a table covered with green cloth my sisterinlaw and i were on a bench against the wall it was like a committee at the corps legislatif we were called up one after the other to testify we spoke of you very handsomely madame de bellegarde said that if she had not been told who you were she would have taken you for a dukean american duke the duke of california i said that i could warrant you grateful for the smallest favorsmodest humble unassuming i was sure that you would know your own place always and never give us occasion to remind you of certain differences after all you couldnt help it if you were not a duke there were none in your country but if there had been it was certain that smart and active as you are you would have got the pick of the titles at this point i was ordered to sit down but i think i made an impression in your favor  m de bellegarde looked at his brother with dangerous coldness and gave a smile as thin as the edge of a knife then he removed a spark of cigarash from the sleeve of his coat he fixed his eyes for a while on the cornice of the room and at last he inserted one of his white hands into the breast of his waistcoat i must apologize to you for the deplorable levity of my brother he said and i must notify you that this is probably not the last time that his want of tact will cause you serious embarrassment  no i confess i have no tact said valentin is your embarrassment really painful newman the marquis will put you right again his own touch is deliciously delicate  valentin i am sorry to say the marquis continued has never possessed the tone the manner that belongs to a young man in his position it has been a great affliction to his mother who is very fond of the old traditions but you must remember that he speaks for no one but himself  oh i dont mind him sir said newman goodhumoredly i know what he amounts to  in the good old times said valentin marquises and counts used to have their appointed fools and jesters to crack jokes for them nowadays we see a great strapping democrat keeping a count about him to play the fool its a good situation but i certainly am very degenerate  m de bellegarde fixed his eyes for some time on the floor my mother informed me he said presently of the announcement that you made to her the other evening  that i desired to marry your sister said newman  that you wished to arrange a marriage said the marquis slowly with my sister the comtesse de cintre the proposal was serious and required on my mothers part a great deal of reflection she naturally took me into her counsels and i gave my most zealous attention to the subject there was a great deal to be considered more than you appear to imagine we have viewed the question on all its faces we have weighed one thing against another our conclusion has been that we favor your suit my mother has desired me to inform you of our decision she will have the honor of saying a few words to you on the subject herself meanwhile by us the heads of the family you are accepted  newman got up and came nearer to the marquis you will do nothing to hinder me and all you can to help me eh  i will recommend my sister to accept you  newman passed his hand over his face and pressed it for a moment upon his eyes this promise had a great sound and yet the pleasure he took in it was embittered by his having to stand there so and receive his passport from m de bellegarde the idea of having this gentleman mixed up with his wooing and wedding was more and more disagreeable to him but newman had resolved to go through the mill as he imagined it and he would not cry out at the first turn of the wheel he was silent a while and then he said with a certain dryness which valentin told him afterwards had a very grand air i am much obliged to you  i take note of the promise said valentin i register the vow  m de bellegarde began to gaze at the cornice again he apparently had something more to say i must do my mother the justice he resumed i must do myself the justice to say that our decision was not easy such an arrangement was not what we had expected the idea that my sister should marry a gentlemanahin business was something of a novelty  so i told you you know said valentin raising his finger at newman  the novelty has not quite worn away i confess the marquis went on perhaps it never will entirely but possibly that is not altogether to be regretted and he gave his thin smile again it may be that the time has come when we should make some concession to novelty there had been no novelties in our house for a great many years i made the observation to my mother and she did me the honor to admit that it was worthy of attention  my dear brother interrupted valentin is not your memory just here leading you the least bit astray our mother is i may say distinguished for her small respect of abstract reasoning are you very sure that she replied to your striking proposition in the gracious manner you describe you know how terribly incisive she is sometimes didnt she rather do you the honor to say a fiddlestick for your phrases there are better reasons than that  other reasons were discussed said the marquis without looking at valentin but with an audible tremor in his voice some of them possibly were better we are conservative mr newman but we are not also bigots we judged the matter liberally we have no doubt that everything will be comfortable  newman had stood listening to these remarks with his arms folded and his eyes fastened upon m de bellegarde comfortable he said with a sort of grim flatness of intonation why shouldnt we be comfortable if you are not it will be your own fault i have everything to make me so  my brother means that with the lapse of time you may get used to the changeand valentin paused to light another cigarette  what change asked newman in the same tone  urbain said valentin very gravely i am afraid that mr newman does not quite realize the change we ought to insist upon that  my brother goes too far said m de bellegarde it is his fatal want of tact again it is my mothers wish and mine that no such allusions should be made pray never make them yourself we prefer to assume that the person accepted as the possible husband of my sister is one of ourselves and that he should have no explanations to make with a little discretion on both sides everything i think will be easy that is exactly what i wished to saythat we quite understand what we have undertaken and that you may depend upon our adhering to our resolution  valentin shook his hands in the air and then buried his face in them i have less tact than i might have no doubt but oh my brother if you knew what you yourself were saying and he went off into a long laugh  m de bellegardes face flushed a little but he held his head higher as if to repudiate this concession to vulgar perturbability i am sure you understand me he said to newman  oh no i dont understand you at all said newman but you neednt mind that i dont care in fact i think i had better not understand you i might not like it that wouldnt suit me at all you know i want to marry your sister thats all to do it as quickly as possible and to find fault with nothing i dont care how i do it i am not marrying you you know sir i have got my leave and that is all i want  you had better receive the last word from my mother said the marquis  very good i will go and get it said newman and he prepared to return to the drawingroom  m de bellegarde made a motion for him to pass first and when newman had gone out he shut himself into the room with valentin newman had been a trifle bewildered by the audacious irony of the younger brother and he had not needed its aid to point the moral of m de bellegardes transcendent patronage he had wit enough to appreciate the force of that civility which consists in calling your attention to the impertinences it spares you but he had felt warmly the delicate sympathy with himself that underlay valentins fraternal irreverence and he was most unwilling that his friend should pay a tax upon it he paused a moment in the corridor after he had gone a few steps expecting to hear the resonance of m de bellegardes displeasure but he detected only a perfect stillness the stillness itself seemed a trifle portentous he reflected however that he had no right to stand listening and he made his way back to the salon in his absence several persons had come in they were scattered about the room in groups two or three of them having passed into a small boudoir next to the drawingroom which had now been lighted and opened old madame de bellegarde was in her place by the fire talking to a very old gentleman in a wig and a profuse white neck cloth of the fashion of 1820 madame de cintre was bending a listening head to the historic confidences of an old lady who was presumably the wife of the old gentleman in the neckcloth an old lady in a red satin dress and an ermine cape who wore across her forehead a band with a topaz set in it young madame de bellegarde when newman came in left some people among whom she was sitting and took the place that she had occupied before dinner then she gave a little push to the puff that stood near her and by a glance at newman seemed to indicate that she had placed it in position for him he went and took possession of it the marquiss wife amused and puzzled him  i know your secret she said in her bad but charming english you need make no mystery of it you wish to marry my sisterinlaw cest un beau choix a man like you ought to marry a tall thin woman you must know that i have spoken in your favor you owe me a famous taper  you have spoken to madame de cintre said newman  oh no not that you may think it strange but my sisterinlaw and i are not so intimate as that no i spoke to my husband and my motherinlaw i said i was sure we could do what we chose with you  i am much obliged to you said newman laughing but you cant  i know that very well i didnt believe a word of it but i wanted you to come into the house i thought we should be friends  i am very sure of it said newman  dont be too sure if you like madame de cintre so much perhaps you will not like me we are as different as blue and pink but you and i have something in common i have come into this family by marriage you want to come into it in the same way  oh no i dont interrupted newman i only want to take madame de cintre out of it  well to cast your nets you have to go into the water our positions are alike we shall be able to compare notes what do you think of my husband its a strange question isnt it but i shall ask you some stranger ones yet  perhaps a stranger one will be easier to answer said newman you might try me  oh you get off very well the old comte de la rochefidele yonder couldnt do it better i told them that if we only gave you a chance you would be a perfect talon rouge i know something about men besides you and i belong to the same camp i am a ferocious democrat by birth i am vieille roche a good little bit of the history of france is the history of my family oh you never heard of us of course ce que cest que la gloire we are much better than the bellegardes at any rate but i dont care a pin for my pedigree i want to belong to my time im a revolutionist a radical a child of the age i am sure i go beyond you i like clever people wherever they come from and i take my amusement wherever i find it i dont pout at the empire here all the world pouts at the empire of course i have to mind what i say but i expect to take my revenge with you madame de bellegarde discoursed for some time longer in this sympathetic strain with an eager abundance which seemed to indicate that her opportunities for revealing her esoteric philosophy were indeed rare she hoped that newman would never be afraid of her however he might be with the others for really she went very far indeed strong peoplele gens fortswere in her opinion equal all the world over newman listened to her with an attention at once beguiled and irritated he wondered what the deuce she too was driving at with her hope that he would not be afraid of her and her protestations of equality in so far as he could understand her she was wrong a silly rattling woman was certainly not the equal of a sensible man preoccupied with an ambitious passion madame de bellegarde stopped suddenly and looked at him sharply shaking her fan i see you dont believe me she said you are too much on your guard you will not form an alliance offensive or defensive you are very wrong i could help you  newman answered that he was very grateful and that he would certainly ask for help she should see but first of all he said i must help myself and he went to join madame de cintre  i have been telling madame de la rochefidele that you are an american she said as he came up it interests her greatly her father went over with the french troops to help you in your battles in the last century and she has always in consequence wanted greatly to see an american but she has never succeeded till tonight you are the firstto her knowledgethat she has ever looked at  madame de la rochefidele had an aged cadaverous face with a falling of the lower jaw which prevented her from bringing her lips together and reduced her conversations to a series of impressive but inarticulate gutturals she raised an antique eyeglass elaborately mounted in chased silver and looked at newman from head to foot then she said something to which he listened deferentially but which he completely failed to understand  madame de la rochefidele says that she is convinced that she must have seen americans without knowing it madame de cintre explained newman thought it probable she had seen a great many things without knowing it and the old lady again addressing herself to utterance declaredas interpreted by madame de cintrethat she wished she had known it  at this moment the old gentleman who had been talking to the elder madame de bellegarde drew near leading the marquise on his arm his wife pointed out newman to him apparently explaining his remarkable origin m de la rochefidele whose old age was rosy and rotund spoke very neatly and clearly almost as prettily newman thought as m nioche when he had been enlightened he turned to newman with an inimitable elderly grace  monsieur is by no means the first american that i have seen he said almost the first person i ever sawto notice himwas an american  ah said newman sympathetically  the great dr franklin said m de la rochefidele of course i was very young he was received very well in our monde  not better than mr newman said madame de bellegarde i beg he will offer his arm into the other room i could have offered no higher privilege to dr franklin  newman complying with madame de bellegardes request perceived that her two sons had returned to the drawingroom he scanned their faces an instant for traces of the scene that had followed his separation from them but the marquise seemed neither more nor less frigidly grand than usual and valentin was kissing ladies hands with at least his habitual air of selfabandonment to the act madame de bellegarde gave a glance at her eldest son and by the time she had crossed the threshold of her boudoir he was at her side the room was now empty and offered a sufficient degree of privacy the old lady disengaged herself from newmans arm and rested her hand on the arm of the marquis and in this position she stood a moment holding her head high and biting her small underlip i am afraid the picture was lost upon newman but madame de bellegarde was in fact at this moment a striking image of the dignity whicheven in the case of a little timeshrunken old ladymay reside in the habit of unquestioned authority and the absoluteness of a social theory favorable to yourself  my son has spoken to you as i desired she said and you understand that we shall not interfere the rest will lie with yourself  m de bellegarde told me several things i didnt understand said newman but i made out that you will leave me open field i am much obliged  i wish to add a word that my son probably did not feel at liberty to say the marquise rejoined i must say it for my own peace of mind we are stretching a point we are doing you a great favor  oh your son said it very well didnt you said newman  not so well as my mother declared the marquis  i can only repeati am much obliged  it is proper i should tell you madame de bellegarde went on that i am very proud and that i hold my head very high i may be wrong but i am too old to change at least i know it and i dont pretend to anything else dont flatter yourself that my daughter is not proud she is proud in her own waya somewhat different way from mine you will have to make your terms with that even valentin is proud if you touch the right spotor the wrong one urbain is proud that you see for yourself sometimes i think he is a little too proud but i wouldnt change him he is the best of my children he cleaves to his old mother but i have said enough to show you that we are all proud together it is well that you should know the sort of people you have come among  well said newman i can only say in return that i am not proud i shant mind you but you speak as if you intended to be very disagreeable  i shall not enjoy having my daughter marry you and i shall not pretend to enjoy it if you dont mind that so much the better  if you stick to your own side of the contract we shall not quarrel that is all i ask of you said newman keep your hands off and give me an open field i am very much in earnest and there is not the slightest danger of my getting discouraged or backing out you will have me constantly before your eyes if you dont like it i am sorry for you i will do for your daughter if she will accept me everything that a man can do for a woman i am happy to tell you that as a promisea pledge i consider that on your side you make me an equal pledge you will not back out eh  i dont know what you mean by backing out said the marquise it suggests a movement of which i think no bellegarde has ever been guilty  our word is our word said urbain we have given it  well now said newman i am very glad you are so proud it makes me believe that you will keep it  the marquise was silent a moment and then suddenly i shall always be polite to you mr newman she declared but decidedly i shall never like you  dont be too sure said newman laughing  i am so sure that i will ask you to take me back to my armchair without the least fear of having my sentiments modified by the service you render me and madame de bellegarde took his arm and returned to the salon and to her customary place  m de la rochefidele and his wife were preparing to take their leave and madame de cintres interview with the mumbling old lady was at an end she stood looking about her asking herself apparently to whom she should next speak when newman came up to her  your mother has given me leavevery solemnlyto come here often he said i mean to come often  i shall be glad to see you she answered simply and then in a moment you probably think it very strange that there should be such a solemnityas you sayabout your coming  well yes i do rather  do you remember what my brother valentin said the first time you came to see methat we were a strange strange family  it was not the first time i came but the second said newman  very true valentin annoyed me at the time but now i know you better i may tell you he was right if you come often you will see and madame de cintre turned away  newman watched her a while talking with other people and then he took his leave he shook hands last with valentin de bellegarde who came out with him to the top of the staircase well you have got your permit said valentin i hope you liked the process  i like your sister more than ever but dont worry your brother any more for my sake newman added i dont mind him i am afraid he came down on you in the smokingroom after i went out  when my brother comes down on me said valentin he falls hard i have a peculiar way of receiving him i must say he continued that they came up to the mark much sooner than i expected i dont understand it they must have had to turn the screw pretty tight its a tribute to your millions  well its the most precious one they have ever received said newman  he was turning away when valentin stopped him looking at him with a brilliant softlycynical glance i should like to know whether within a few days you have seen your venerable friend m nioche  he was yesterday at my rooms newman answered  what did he tell you  nothing particular  you didnt see the muzzle of a pistol sticking out of his pocket  what are you driving at newman demanded i thought he seemed rather cheerful for him  valentin broke into a laugh i am delighted to hear it i win my bet mademoiselle noemie has thrown her cap over the mill as we say she has left the paternal domicile she is launched and m nioche is rather cheerfulfor him dont brandish your tomahawk at that rate i have not seen her nor communicated with her since that day at the louvre andromeda has found another perseus than i my information is exact on such matters it always is i suppose that now you will raise your protest  my protest be hanged murmured newman disgustedly  but his tone found no echo in that in which valentin with his hand on the door to return to his mothers apartment exclaimed but i shall see her now she is very remarkableshe is very remarkable    chapter xiii   newman kept his promise or his menace of going often to the rue de luniversite and during the next six weeks he saw madame de cintre more times than he could have numbered he flattered himself that he was not in love but his biographer may be supposed to know better he claimed at least none of the exemptions and emoluments of the romantic passion love he believed made a fool of a man and his present emotion was not folly but wisdom wisdom sound serene welldirected what he felt was an intense allconsuming tenderness which had for its object an extraordinarily graceful and delicate and at the same time impressive woman who lived in a large gray house on the left bank of the seine this tenderness turned very often into a positive heartache a sign in which certainly newman ought to have read the appellation which science has conferred upon his sentiment when the heart has a heavy weight upon it it hardly matters whether the weight be of gold or of lead when at any rate happiness passes into that place in which it becomes identical with pain a man may admit that the reign of wisdom is temporarily suspended newman wished madame de cintre so well that nothing he could think of doing for her in the future rose to the high standard which his present mood had set itself she seemed to him so felicitous a product of nature and circumstance that his invention musing on future combinations was constantly catching its breath with the fear of stumbling into some brutal compression or mutilation of her beautiful personal harmony this is what i mean by newmans tenderness madame de cintre pleased him so exactly as she was that his desire to interpose between her and the troubles of life had the quality of a young mothers eagerness to protect the sleep of her firstborn child newman was simply charmed and he handled his charm as if it were a musicbox which would stop if one shook it there can be no better proof of the hankering epicure that is hidden in every mans temperament waiting for a signal from some divine confederate that he may safely peep out newman at last was enjoying purely freely deeply certain of madame de cintres personal qualitiesthe luminous sweetness of her eyes the delicate mobility of her face the deep liquidity of her voicefilled all his consciousness a rosecrowned greek of old gazing at a marble goddess with his whole bright intellect resting satisfied in the act could not have been a more complete embodiment of the wisdom that loses itself in the enjoyment of quiet harmonies  he made no violent love to herno sentimental speeches he never trespassed on what she had made him understand was for the present forbidden ground but he had nevertheless a comfortable sense that she knew better from day to day how much he admired her though in general he was no great talker he talked much and he succeeded perfectly in making her say many things he was not afraid of boring her either by his discourse or by his silence and whether or no he did occasionally bore her it is probable that on the whole she liked him only the better for his absense of embarrassed scruples her visitors coming in often while newman sat there found a tall lean silent man in a halflounging attitude who laughed out sometimes when no one had meant to be droll and remained grave in the presence of calculated witticisms for appreciation of which he had apparently not the proper culture  it must be confessed that the number of subjects upon which newman had no ideas was extremely large and it must be added that as regards those subjects upon which he was without ideas he was also perfectly without words he had little of the small change of conversation and his stock of readymade formulas and phrases was the scantiest on the other hand he had plenty of attention to bestow and his estimate of the importance of a topic did not depend upon the number of clever things he could say about it he himself was almost never bored and there was no man with whom it would have been a greater mistake to suppose that silence meant displeasure what it was that entertained him during some of his speechless sessions i must however confess myself unable to determine we know in a general way that a great many things which were old stories to a great many people had the charm of novelty to him but a complete list of his new impressions would probably contain a number of surprises for us he told madame de cintre a hundred long stories he explained to her in talking of the united states the working of various local institutions and mercantile customs judging by the sequel she was interested but one would not have been sure of it beforehand as regards her own talk newman was very sure himself that she herself enjoyed it this was as a sort of amendment to the portrait that mrs tristram had drawn of her he discovered that she had naturally an abundance of gayety he had been right at first in saying she was shy her shyness in a woman whose circumstances and tranquil beauty afforded every facility for wellmannered hardihood was only a charm the more for newman it had lasted some time and even when it went it left something behind it which for a while performed the same office was this the tearful secret of which mrs tristram had had a glimpse and of which as of her friends reserve her highbreeding and her profundity she had given a sketch of which the outlines were perhaps rather too heavy newman supposed so but he found himself wondering less every day what madame de cintres secrets might be and more convinced that secrets were in themselves hateful things to her she was a woman for the light not for the shade and her natural line was not picturesque reserve and mysterious melancholy but frank joyous brilliant action with just so much meditation as was necessary and not a grain more to this apparently he had succeeded in bringing her back he felt himself that he was an antidote to oppressive secrets what he offered her was in fact above all things a vast sunny immunity from the need of having any  he often passed his evenings when madame de cintre had so appointed it at the chilly fireside of madame de bellegarde contenting himself with looking across the room through narrowed eyelids at his mistress who always made a point before her family of talking to some one else madame de bellegarde sat by the fire conversing neatly and coldly with whomsoever approached her and glancing round the room with her slowlyrestless eye the effect of which when it lighted upon him was to newmans sense identical with that of a sudden spurt of damp air when he shook hands with her he always asked her with a laugh whether she could stand him another evening and she replied without a laugh that thank god she had always been able to do her duty newman talking once of the marquise to mrs tristram said that after all it was very easy to get on with her it always was easy to get on with outandout rascals  and is it by that elegant term said mrs tristram that you designate the marquise de bellegarde  well said newman she is wicked she is an old sinner  what is her crime asked mrs tristram  i shouldnt wonder if she had murdered some oneall from a sense of duty of course  how can you be so dreadful sighed mrs tristram  i am not dreadful i am speaking of her favorably  pray what will you say when you want to be severe  i shall keep my severity for some one elsefor the marquis theres a man i cant swallow mix the drink as i will  and what has he done  i cant quite make out it is something dreadfully bad something mean and underhand and not redeemed by audacity as his mothers misdemeanors may have been if he has never committed murder he has at least turned his back and looked the other way while some one else was committing it  in spite of this invidious hypothesis which must be taken for nothing more than an example of the capricious play of american humor newman did his best to maintain an easy and friendly style of communication with m de bellegarde so long as he was in personal contact with people he disliked extremely to have anything to forgive them and he was capable of a good deal of unsuspected imaginative effort for the sake of his own personal comfort to assume for the time that they were good fellows he did his best to treat the marquis as one he believed honestly moreover that he could not in reason be such a confounded fool as he seemed newmans familiarity was never importunate his sense of human equality was not an aggressive taste or an aesthetic theory but something as natural and organic as a physical appetite which had never been put on a scanty allowance and consequently was innocent of ungraceful eagerness his tranquil unsuspectingness of the relativity of his own place in the social scale was probably irritating to m de bellegarde who saw himself reflected in the mind of his potential brotherinlaw in a crude and colorless form unpleasantly dissimilar to the impressive image projected upon his own intellectual mirror he never forgot himself for an instant and replied to what he must have considered newmans advances with mechanical politeness newman who was constantly forgetting himself and indulging in an unlimited amount of irresponsible inquiry and conjecture now and then found himself confronted by the conscious ironical smile of his host what the deuce m de bellegarde was smiling at he was at a loss to divine m de bellegardes smile may be supposed to have been for himself a compromise between a great many emotions so long as he smiled he was polite and it was proper he should be polite a smile moreover committed him to nothing more than politeness and left the degree of politeness agreeably vague a smile too was neither dissentwhich was too seriousnor agreement which might have brought on terrible complications and then a smile covered his own personal dignity which in this critical situation he was resolved to keep immaculate it was quite enough that the glory of his house should pass into eclipse between him and newman his whole manner seemed to declare there could be no interchange of opinion he was holding his breath so as not to inhale the odor of democracy newman was far from being versed in european politics but he liked to have a general idea of what was going on about him and he accordingly asked m de bellegarde several times what he thought of public affairs m de bellegarde answered with suave concision that he thought as ill of them as possible that they were going from bad to worse and that the age was rotten to its core this gave newman for the moment an almost kindly feeling for the marquis he pitied a man for whom the world was so cheerless a place and the next time he saw m de bellegarde he attempted to call his attention to some of the brilliant features of the time the marquis presently replied that he had but a single political conviction which was enough for him he believed in the divine right of henry of bourbon fifth of his name to the throne of france newman stared and after this he ceased to talk politics with m de bellegarde he was not horrified nor scandalized he was not even amused he felt as he should have felt if he had discovered in m de bellegarde a taste for certain oddities of diet an appetite for instance for fishbones or nutshells under these circumstances of course he would never have broached dietary questions with him  one afternoon on his calling on madame de cintre newman was requested by the servant to wait a few moments as his hostess was not at liberty he walked about the room a while taking up her books smelling her flowers and looking at her prints and photographs which he thought prodigiously pretty and at last he heard the opening of a door to which his back was turned on the threshold stood an old woman whom he remembered to have met several times in entering and leaving the house she was tall and straight and dressed in black and she wore a cap which if newman had been initiated into such mysteries would have been a sufficient assurance that she was not a frenchwoman a cap of pure british composition she had a pale decent depressedlooking face and a clear dull english eye she looked at newman a moment both intently and timidly and then she dropped a short straight english curtsey  madame de cintre begs you will kindly wait she said she has just come in she will soon have finished dressing  oh i will wait as long as she wants said newman pray tell her not to hurry  thank you sir said the woman softly and then instead of retiring with her message she advanced into the room she looked about her for a moment and presently went to a table and began to arrange certain books and knickknacks newman was struck with the high respectability of her appearance he was afraid to address her as a servant she busied herself for some moments with putting the table in order and pulling the curtains straight while newman walked slowly to and fro he perceived at last from her reflection in the mirror as he was passing that her hands were idle and that she was looking at him intently she evidently wished to say something and newman perceiving it helped her to begin  you are english he asked  yes sir please she answered quickly and softly i was born in wiltshire  and what do you think of paris  oh i dont think of paris sir she said in the same tone it is so long since i have been here  ah you have been here very long  it is more than forty years sir i came over with lady emmeline  you mean with old madame de bellegarde  yes sir i came with her when she was married i was my ladys own woman  and you have been with her ever since  i have been in the house ever since my lady has taken a younger person you see i am very old i do nothing regular now but i keep about  you look very strong and well said newman observing the erectness of her figure and a certain venerable rosiness in her cheek  thank god i am not ill sir i hope i know my duty too well to go panting and coughing about the house but i am an old woman sir and it is as an old woman that i venture to speak to you  oh speak out said newman curiously you neednt be afraid of me  yes sir i think you are kind i have seen you before  on the stairs you mean  yes sir when you have been coming to see the countess i have taken the liberty of noticing that you come often  oh yes i come very often said newman laughing you need not have been wideawake to notice that  i have noticed it with pleasure sir said the ancient tirewoman gravely and she stood looking at newman with a strange expression of face the old instinct of deference and humility was there the habit of decent selfeffacement and knowledge of her own place but there mingled with it a certain mild audacity born of the occasion and of a sense probably of newmans unprecedented approachableness and beyond this a vague indifference to the old proprieties as if my ladys own woman had at last begun to reflect that since my lady had taken another person she had a slight reversionary property in herself  you take a great interest in the family said newman  a deep interest sir especially in the countess  i am glad of that said newman and in a moment he added smiling so do i  so i suppose sir we cant help noticing these things and having our ideas can we sir  you mean as a servant said newman  ah there it is sir i am afraid that when i let my thoughts meddle with such matters i am no longer a servant but i am so devoted to the countess if she were my own child i couldnt love her more that is how i come to be so bold sir they say you want to marry her  newman eyed his interlocutress and satisfied himself that she was not a gossip but a zealot she looked anxious appealing discreet it is quite true he said i want to marry madame de cintre  and to take her away to america  i will take her wherever she wants to go  the farther away the better sir exclaimed the old woman with sudden intensity but she checked herself and taking up a paperweight in mosaic began to polish it with her black apron i dont mean anything against the house or the family sir but i think a great change would do the poor countess good it is very sad here  yes its not very lively said newman but madame de cintre is gay herself  she is everything that is good you will not be vexed to hear that she has been gayer for a couple of months past than she had been in many a day before  newman was delighted to gather this testimony to the prosperity of his suit but he repressed all violent marks of elation has madame de cintre been in bad spirits before this he asked  poor lady she had good reason m de cintre was no husband for a sweet young lady like that and then as i say it has been a sad house it is better in my humble opinion that she were out of it so if you will excuse me for saying so i hope she will marry you  i hope she will said newman  but you must not lose courage sir if she doesnt make up her mind at once that is what i wanted to beg of you sir dont give it up sir you will not take it ill if i say its a great risk for any lady at any time all the more when she has got rid of one bad bargain but if she can marry a good kind respectable gentleman i think she had better make up her mind to it they speak very well of you sir in the house and if you will allow me to say so i like your face you have a very different appearance from the late count he wasnt five feet high and they say your fortune is beyond everything theres no harm in that so i beseech you to be patient sir and bide your time if i dont say this to you sir perhaps no one will of course it is not for me to make any promises i can answer for nothing but i think your chance is not so bad sir i am nothing but a weary old woman in my quiet corner but one woman understands another and i think i make out the countess i received her in my arms when she came into the world and her first wedding day was the saddest of my life she owes it to me to show me another and a brighter one if you will hold firm sirand you look as if you wouldi think we may see it  i am much obliged to you for your encouragement said newman heartily one cant have too much i mean to hold firm and if madame de cintre marries me you must come and live with her  the old woman looked at him strangely with her soft lifeless eyes it may seem a heartless thing to say sir when one has been forty years in a house but i may tell you that i should like to leave this place  why its just the time to say it said newman fervently after forty years one wants a change  you are very kind sir and this faithful servant dropped another curtsey and seemed disposed to retire but she lingered a moment and gave a timid joyless smile newman was disappointed and his fingers stole half shyly half irritably into his waistcoatpocket his informant noticed the movement thank god i am not a frenchwoman she said if i were i would tell you with a brazen simper old as i am that if you please monsieur my information is worth something let me tell you so in my own decent english way it is worth something  how much please said newman  simply this a promise not to hint to the countess that i have said these things  if that is all you have it said newman  that is all sir thank you sir good day sir and having once more slid down telescopewise into her scanty petticoats the old woman departed at the same moment madame de cintre came in by an opposite door she noticed the movement of the other portiere and asked newman who had been entertaining him  the british female said newman an old lady in a black dress and a cap who curtsies up and down and expresses herself ever so well  an old lady who curtsies and expresses herself ah you mean poor mrs bread i happen to know that you have made a conquest of her  mrs cake she ought to be called said newman she is very sweet she is a delicious old woman  madame de cintre looked at him a moment what can she have said to you she is an excellent creature but we think her rather dismal  i suppose newman answered presently that i like her because she has lived near you so long since your birth she told me  yes said madame de cintre simply she is very faithful i can trust her  newman had never made any reflections to this lady upon her mother and her brother urbain had given no hint of the impression they made upon him but as if she had guessed his thoughts she seemed careful to avoid all occasion for making him speak of them she never alluded to her mothers domestic decrees she never quoted the opinions of the marquis they had talked however of valentin and she had made no secret of her extreme affection for her younger brother newman listened sometimes with a certain harmless jealousy he would have liked to divert some of her tender allusions to his own credit once madame de cintre told him with a little air of triumph about something that valentin had done which she thought very much to his honor it was a service he had rendered to an old friend of the family something more serious than valentin was usually supposed capable of being newman said he was glad to hear of it and then began to talk about something which lay upon his own heart madame de cintre listened but after a while she said i dont like the way you speak of my brother valentin hereupon newman surprised said that he had never spoken of him but kindly  it is too kindly said madame de cintre it is a kindness that costs nothing it is the kindness you show to a child it is as if you didnt respect him  respect him why i think i do  you think if you are not sure it is no respect  do you respect him said newman if you do i do  if one loves a person that is a question one is not bound to answer said madame de cintre  you should not have asked it of me then i am very fond of your brother  he amuses you but you would not like to resemble him  i shouldnt like to resemble any one it is hard enough work resembling ones self  what do you mean asked madame de cintre by resembling ones self  why doing what is expected of one doing ones duty  but that is only when one is very good  well a great many people are good said newman valentin is quite good enough for me  madame de cintre was silent for a short time he is not good enough for me she said at last i wish he would do something  what can he do asked newman  nothing yet he is very clever  it is a proof of cleverness said newman to be happy without doing anything  i dont think valentin is happy in reality he is clever generous brave but what is there to show for it to me there is something sad in his life and sometimes i have a sort of foreboding about him i dont know why but i fancy he will have some great troubleperhaps an unhappy end  oh leave him to me said newman jovially i will watch over him and keep harm away  one evening in madame de bellegardes salon the conversation had flagged most sensibly the marquis walked up and down in silence like a sentinel at the door of some smoothfronted citadel of the proprieties his mother sat staring at the fire young madame de bellegarde worked at an enormous band of tapestry usually there were three or four visitors but on this occasion a violent storm sufficiently accounted for the absence of even the most devoted habitues in the long silences the howling of the wind and the beating of the rain were distinctly audible newman sat perfectly still watching the clock determined to stay till the stroke of eleven but not a moment longer madame de cintre had turned her back to the circle and had been standing for some time within the uplifted curtain of a window with her forehead against the pane gazing out into the deluged darkness suddenly she turned round toward her sisterinlaw  for heavens sake she said with peculiar eagerness go to the piano and play something  madame de bellegarde held up her tapestry and pointed to a little white flower dont ask me to leave this i am in the midst of a masterpiece my flower is going to smell very sweet i am putting in the smell with this goldcolored silk i am holding my breath i cant leave off play something yourself  it is absurd for me to play when you are present said madame de cintre but the next moment she went to the piano and began to strike the keys with vehemence she played for some time rapidly and brilliantly when she stopped newman went to the piano and asked her to begin again she shook her head and on his insisting she said i have not been playing for you i have been playing for myself she went back to the window again and looked out and shortly afterwards left the room when newman took leave urbain de bellegarde accompanied him as he always did just three steps down the staircase at the bottom stood a servant with his overcoat he had just put it on when he saw madame de cintre coming towards him across the vestibule  shall you be at home on friday newman asked  she looked at him a moment before answering his question you dont like my mother and my brother she said  he hesitated a moment and then he said softly no  she laid her hand on the balustrade and prepared to ascend the stairs fixing her eyes on the first step  yes i shall be at home on friday and she passed up the wide dusky staircase  on the friday as soon as he came in she asked him to please to tell her why he disliked her family  dislike your family he exclaimed that has a horrid sound i didnt say so did i i didnt mean it if i did  i wish you would tell me what you think of them said madame de cintre  i dont think of any of them but you  that is because you dislike them speak the truth you cant offend me  well i dont exactly love your brother said newman i remember now but what is the use of my saying so i had forgotten it  you are too goodnatured said madame de cintre gravely then as if to avoid the appearance of inviting him to speak ill of the marquis she turned away motioning him to sit down  but he remained standing before her and said presently what is of much more importance is that they dont like me  nothey dont she said  and dont you think they are wrong newman asked i dont believe i am a man to dislike  i suppose that a man who may be liked may also be disliked and my brothermy mother she added have not made you angry  yes sometimes  you have never shown it  so much the better  yes so much the better they think they have treated you very well  i have no doubt they might have handled me much more roughly said newman i am much obliged to them honestly  you are generous said madame de cintre its a disagreeable position  for them you mean not for me  for me said madame de cintre  not when their sins are forgiven said newman they dont think i am as good as they are i do but we shant quarrel about it  i cant even agree with you without saying something that has a disagreeable sound the presumption was against you that you probably dont understand  newman sat down and looked at her for some time i dont think i really understand it but when you say it i believe it  thats a poor reason said madame de cintre smiling  no its a very good one you have a high spirit a high standard but with you its all natural and unaffected you dont seem to have stuck your head into a vise as if you were sitting for the photograph of propriety you think of me as a fellow who has had no idea in life but to make money and drive sharp bargains thats a fair description of me but it is not the whole story a man ought to care for something else though i dont know exactly what i cared for moneymaking but i never cared particularly for the money there was nothing else to do and it was impossible to be idle i have been very easy to others and to myself i have done most of the things that people asked mei dont mean rascals as regards your mother and your brother newman added there is only one point upon which i feel that i might quarrel with them i dont ask them to sing my praises to you but i ask them to let you alone if i thought they talked ill of me to you i should come down upon them  they have let me alone as you say they have not talked ill of you  in that case cried newman i declare they are only too good for this world  madame de cintre appeared to find something startling in his exclamation she would perhaps have replied but at this moment the door was thrown open and urbain de bellegarde stepped across the threshold he appeared surprised at finding newman but his surprise was but a momentary shadow across the surface of an unwonted joviality newman had never seen the marquis so exhilarated his pale unlighted countenance had a sort of thin transfiguration he held open the door for some one else to enter and presently appeared old madame de bellegarde leaning on the arm of a gentleman whom newman had not seen before he had already risen and madame de cintre rose as she always did before her mother the marquis who had greeted newman almost genially stood apart slowly rubbing his hands his mother came forward with her companion she gave a majestic little nod at newman and then she released the strange gentleman that he might make his bow to her daughter  my daughter she said i have brought you an unknown relative lord deepmere lord deepmere is our cousin but he has done only today what he ought to have done long agocome to make our acquaintance  madame de cintre smiled and offered lord deepmere her hand it is very extraordinary said this noble laggard but this is the first time that i have ever been in paris for more than three or four weeks  and how long have you been here now asked madame de cintre  oh for the last two months said lord deepmere  these two remarks might have constituted an impertinence but a glance at lord deepmeres face would have satisfied you as it apparently satisfied madame de cintre that they constituted only a naivete when his companions were seated newman who was out of the conversation occupied himself with observing the newcomer observation however as regards lord deepmeres person had no great range he was a small meagre man of some three and thirty years of age with a bald head a short nose and no front teeth in the upper jaw he had round candid blue eyes and several pimples on his chin he was evidently very shy and he laughed a great deal catching his breath with an odd startling sound as the most convenient imitation of repose his physiognomy denoted great simplicity a certain amount of brutality and probable failure in the past to profit by rare educational advantages he remarked that paris was awfully jolly but that for real thoroughpaced entertainment it was nothing to dublin he even preferred dublin to london had madame de cintre ever been to dublin they must all come over there some day and he would show them some irish sport he always went to ireland for the fishing and he came to paris for the new offenbach things they always brought them out in dublin but he couldnt wait he had been nine times to hear la pomme de paris madame de cintre leaning back with her arms folded looked at lord deepmere with a more visibly puzzled face than she usually showed to society madame de bellegarde on the other hand wore a fixed smile the marquis said that among light operas his favorite was the gazza ladra the marquise then began a series of inquiries about the duke and the cardinal the old countess and lady barbara after listening to which and to lord deepmeres somewhat irreverent responses for a quarter of an hour newman rose to take his leave the marquis went with him three steps into the hall  is he irish asked newman nodding in the direction of the visitor  his mother was the daughter of lord finucane said the marquis he has great irish estates lady bridget in the complete absence of male heirs either direct or collaterala most extraordinary circumstancecame in for everything but lord deepmeres title is english and his english property is immense he is a charming young man  newman answered nothing but he detained the marquis as the latter was beginning gracefully to recede it is a good time for me to thank you he said for sticking so punctiliously to our bargain for doing so much to help me on with your sister  the marquis stared really i have done nothing that i can boast of he said  oh dont be modest newman answered laughing i cant flatter myself that i am doing so well simply by my own merit and thank your mother for me too and he turned away leaving m de bellegarde looking after him    chapter xiv   the next time newman came to the rue de luniversite he had the good fortune to find madame de cintre alone he had come with a definite intention and he lost no time in executing it she wore moreover a look which he eagerly interpreted as expectancy  i have been coming to see you for six months now he said and i have never spoken to you a second time of marriage that was what you asked me i obeyed could any man have done better  you have acted with great delicacy said madame de cintre  well im going to change now said newman i dont mean that i am going to be indelicate but im going to go back to where i began i am back there i have been all round the circle or rather i have never been away from here i have never ceased to want what i wanted then only now i am more sure of it if possible i am more sure of myself and more sure of you i know you better though i dont know anything i didnt believe three months ago you are everythingyou are beyond everythingi can imagine or desire you know me now you must know me i wont say that you have seen the bestbut you have seen the worst i hope you have been thinking all this while you must have seen that i was only waiting you cant suppose that i was changing what will you say to me now say that everything is clear and reasonable and that i have been very patient and considerate and deserve my reward and then give me your hand madame de cintre do that do it  i knew you were only waiting she said and i was very sure this day would come i have thought about it a great deal at first i was half afraid of it but i am not afraid of it now she paused a moment and then she added its a relief  she was sitting on a low chair and newman was on an ottoman near her he leaned a little and took her hand which for an instant she let him keep that means that i have not waited for nothing he said she looked at him for a moment and he saw her eyes fill with tears with me he went on you will be as safeas safeand even in his ardor he hesitated a moment for a comparisonas safe he said with a kind of simple solemnity as in your fathers arms  still she looked at him and her tears increased then abruptly she buried her face on the cushioned arm of the sofa beside her chair and broke into noiseless sobs i am weaki am weak he heard her say  all the more reason why you should give yourself up to me he answered why are you troubled there is nothing but happiness is that so hard to believe  to you everything seems so simple she said raising her head but things are not so i like you extremely i liked you six months ago and now i am sure of it as you say you are sure but it is not easy simply for that to decide to marry you there are a great many things to think about  there ought to be only one thing to think aboutthat we love each other said newman and as she remained silent he quickly added very good if you cant accept that dont tell me so  i should be very glad to think of nothing she said at last not to think at all only to shut both my eyes and give myself up but i cant im cold im old im a coward i never supposed i should marry again and it seems to me very strange i should ever have listened to you when i used to think as a girl of what i should do if i were to marry freely by my own choice i thought of a very different man from you  thats nothing against me said newman with an immense smile your taste was not formed  his smile made madame de cintre smile have you formed it she asked and then she said in a different tone where do you wish to live  anywhere in the wide world you like we can easily settle that  i dont know why i ask you she presently continued i care very little i think if i were to marry you i could live almost anywhere you have some false ideas about me you think that i need a great many thingsthat i must have a brilliant worldly life i am sure you are prepared to take a great deal of trouble to give me such things but that is very arbitrary i have done nothing to prove that she paused again looking at him and her mingled sound and silence were so sweet to him that he had no wish to hurry her any more than he would have had a wish to hurry a golden sunrise your being so different which at first seemed a difficulty a trouble began one day to seem to me a pleasure a great pleasure i was glad you were different and yet if i had said so no one would have understood me i dont mean simply to my family  they would have said i was a queer monster eh said newman  they would have said i could never be happy with youyou were too different and i would have said it was just because you were so different that i might be happy but they would have given better reasons than i my only reasonand she paused again  but this time in the midst of his golden sunrise newman felt the impulse to grasp at a rosy cloud your only reason is that you love me he murmured with an eloquent gesture and for want of a better reason madame de cintre reconciled herself to this one  newman came back the next day and in the vestibule as he entered the house he encountered his friend mrs bread she was wandering about in honorable idleness and when his eyes fell upon her she delivered him one of her curtsies then turning to the servant who had admitted him she said with the combined majesty of her native superiority and of a rugged english accent you may retire i will have the honor of conducting monsieur in spite of this combination however it appeared to newman that her voice had a slight quaver as if the tone of command were not habitual to it the man gave her an impertinent stare but he walked slowly away and she led newman upstairs at half its course the staircase gave a bend forming a little platform in the angle of the wall stood an indifferent statue of an eighteenthcentury nymph simpering sallow and cracked here mrs bread stopped and looked with shy kindness at her companion  i know the good news sir she murmured  you have a good right to be first to know it said newman you have taken such a friendly interest  mrs bread turned away and began to blow the dust off the statue as if this might be mockery  i suppose you want to congratulate me said newman i am greatly obliged and then he added you gave me much pleasure the other day  she turned around apparently reassured you are not to think that i have been told anything she said i have only guessed but when i looked at you as you came in i was sure i had guessed aright  you are very sharp said newman i am sure that in your quiet way you see everything  i am not a fool sir thank god i have guessed something else beside said mrs bread  whats that  i neednt tell you that sir i dont think you would believe it at any rate it wouldnt please you  oh tell me nothing but what will please me laughed newman that is the way you began  well sir i suppose you wont be vexed to hear that the sooner everything is over the better  the sooner we are married you mean the better for me certainly  the better for every one  the better for you perhaps you know you are coming to live with us said newman  im extremely obliged to you sir but it is not of myself i was thinking i only wanted if i might take the liberty to recommend you to lose no time  whom are you afraid of  mrs bread looked up the staircase and then down and then she looked at the undusted nymph as if she possibly had sentient ears i am afraid of every one she said  what an uncomfortable state of mind said newman does every one wish to prevent my marriage  i am afraid of already having said too much mrs bread replied i wont take it back but i wont say any more and she took her way up the staircase again and led him into madame de cintres salon  newman indulged in a brief and silent imprecation when he found that madame de cintre was not alone with her sat her mother and in the middle of the room stood young madame de bellegarde in her bonnet and mantle the old marquise who was leaning back in her chair with a hand clasping the knob of each arm looked at him fixedly without moving she seemed barely conscious of his greeting she appeared to be musing intently newman said to himself that her daughter had been announcing her engagement and that the old lady found the morsel hard to swallow but madame de cintre as she gave him her hand gave him also a look by which she appeared to mean that he should understand something was it a warning or a request did she wish to enjoin speech or silence he was puzzled and young madame de bellegardes pretty grin gave him no information  i have not told my mother said madame de cintre abruptly looking at him  told me what demanded the marquise you tell me too little you should tell me everything  that is what i do said madame urbain with a little laugh  let me tell your mother said newman  the old lady stared at him again and then turned to her daughter you are going to marry him she cried softly  oui ma mere said madame de cintre  your daughter has consented to my great happiness said newman  and when was this arrangement made asked madame de bellegarde i seem to be picking up the news by chance  my suspense came to an end yesterday said newman  and how long was mine to have lasted said the marquise to her daughter she spoke without irritation with a sort of cold noble displeasure  madame de cintre stood silent with her eyes on the ground it is over now she said  where is my sonwhere is urbain asked the marquise send for your brother and inform him  young madame de bellegarde laid her hand on the bellrope he was to make some visits with me and i was to go and knockvery softly very softlyat the door of his study but he can come to me she pulled the bell and in a few moments mrs bread appeared with a face of calm inquiry  send for your brother said the old lady  but newman felt an irresistible impulse to speak and to speak in a certain way tell the marquis we want him he said to mrs bread who quietly retired  young madame de bellegarde went to her sisterinlaw and embraced her then she turned to newman with an intense smile she is charming i congratulate you  i congratulate you sir said madame de bellegarde with extreme solemnity my daughter is an extraordinarily good woman she may have faults but i dont know them  my mother does not often make jokes said madame de cintre but when she does they are terrible  she is ravishing the marquise urbain resumed looking at her sisterinlaw with her head on one side yes i congratulate you  madame de cintre turned away and taking up a piece of tapestry began to ply the needle some minutes of silence elapsed which were interrupted by the arrival of m de bellegarde he came in with his hat in his hand gloved and was followed by his brother valentin who appeared to have just entered the house m de bellegarde looked around the circle and greeted newman with his usual finelymeasured courtesy valentin saluted his mother and his sisters and as he shook hands with newman gave him a glance of acute interrogation  arrivez donc messieurs cried young madame de bellegarde we have great news for you  speak to your brother my daughter said the old lady  madame de cintre had been looking at her tapestry she raised her eyes to her brother i have accepted mr newman  your sister has consented said newman you see after all i knew what i was about  i am charmed said m de bellegarde with superior benignity  so am i said valentin to newman the marquis and i are charmed i cant marry myself but i can understand it i cant stand on my head but i can applaud a clever acrobat my dear sister i bless your union  the marquis stood looking for a while into the crown of his hat we have been prepared he said at last but it is inevitable that in face of the event one should experience a certain emotion and he gave a most unhilarious smile  i feel no emotion that i was not perfectly prepared for said his mother  i cant say that for myself said newman smiling but differently from the marquis i am happier than i expected to be i suppose its the sight of your happiness  dont exaggerate that said madame de bellegarde getting up and laying her hand upon her daughters arm you cant expect an honest old woman to thank you for taking away her beautiful only daughter  you forgot me dear madame said the young marquise demurely  yes she is very beautiful said newman  and when is the wedding pray asked young madame de bellegarde i must have a month to think over a dress  that must be discussed said the marquise  oh we will discuss it and let you know newman exclaimed  i have no doubt we shall agree said urbain  if you dont agree with madame de cintre you will be very unreasonable  come come urbain said young madame de bellegarde i must go straight to my tailors  the old lady had been standing with her hand on her daughters arm looking at her fixedly she gave a little sigh and murmured no i did not expect it you are a fortunate man she added turning to newman with an expressive nod  oh i know that he answered i feel tremendously proud i feel like crying it on the housetopslike stopping people in the street to tell them  madame de bellegarde narrowed her lips pray dont she said  the more people that know it the better newman declared i havent yet announced it here but i telegraphed it this morning to america  telegraphed it to america the old lady murmured  to new york to st louis and to san francisco those are the principal cities you know tomorrow i shall tell my friends here  have you many asked madame de bellegarde in a tone of which i am afraid that newman but partly measured the impertinence  enough to bring me a great many handshakes and congratulations to say nothing he added in a moment of those i shall receive from your friends  they will not use the telegraph said the marquise taking her departure  m de bellegarde whose wife her imagination having apparently taken flight to the tailors was fluttering her silken wings in emulation shook hands with newman and said with a more persuasive accent than the latter had ever heard him use you may count upon me then his wife led him away  valentin stood looking from his sister to our hero i hope you both reflected seriously he said  madame de cintre smiled we have neither your powers of reflection nor your depth of seriousness but we have done our best  well i have a great regard for each of you valentin continued you are charming young people but i am not satisfied on the whole that you belong to that small and superior classthat exquisite group composed of persons who are worthy to remain unmarried these are rare souls they are the salt of the earth but i dont mean to be invidious the marrying people are often very nice  valentin holds that women should marry and that men should not said madame de cintre i dont know how he arranges it  i arrange it by adoring you my sister said valentin ardently goodby  adore some one whom you can marry said newman i will arrange that for you some day i foresee that i am going to turn apostle  valentin was on the threshold he looked back a moment with a face that had turned grave i adore some one i cant marry he said and he dropped the portiere and departed  they dont like it said newman standing alone before madame de cintre  no she said after a moment they dont like it  well now do you mind that asked newman  yes she said after another interval  thats a mistake  i cant help it i should prefer that my mother were pleased  why the deuce demanded newman is she not pleased she gave you leave to marry me  very true i dont understand it and yet i do mind it as you say you will call it superstitious  that will depend upon how much you let it bother you then i shall call it an awful bore  i will keep it to myself said madame de cintre it shall not bother you and then they talked of their marriageday and madame de cintre assented unreservedly to newmans desire to have it fixed for an early date  newmans telegrams were answered with interest having dispatched but three electric missives he received no less than eight gratulatory bulletins in return he put them into his pocketbook and the next time he encountered old madame de bellegarde drew them forth and displayed them to her this it must be confessed was a slightly malicious stroke the reader must judge in what degree the offense was venial newman knew that the marquise disliked his telegrams though he could see no sufficient reason for it madame de cintre on the other hand liked them and most of them being of a humorous cast laughed at them immoderately and inquired into the character of their authors newman now that his prize was gained felt a peculiar desire that his triumph should be manifest he more than suspected that the bellegardes were keeping quiet about it and allowing it in their select circle but a limited resonance and it pleased him to think that if he were to take the trouble he might as he phrased it break all the windows no man likes being repudiated and yet newman if he was not flattered was not exactly offended he had not this good excuse for his somewhat aggressive impulse to promulgate his felicity his sentiment was of another quality he wanted for once to make the heads of the house of bellegarde feel him he knew not when he should have another chance he had had for the past six months a sense of the old lady and her son looking straight over his head and he was now resolved that they should toe a mark which he would give himself the satisfaction of drawing  it is like seeing a bottle emptied when the wine is poured too slowly he said to mrs tristram they make me want to joggle their elbows and force them to spill their wine  to this mrs tristram answered that he had better leave them alone and let them do things in their own way you must make allowances for them she said it is natural enough that they should hang fire a little they thought they accepted you when you made your application but they are not people of imagination they could not project themselves into the future and now they will have to begin again but they are people of honor and they will do whatever is necessary  newman spent a few moments in narroweyed meditation i am not hard on them he presently said and to prove it i will invite them all to a festival  to a festival  you have been laughing at my great gilded rooms all winter i will show you that they are good for something i will give a party what is the grandest thing one can do here i will hire all the great singers from the opera and all the first people from the theatre francais and i will give an entertainment  and whom will you invite  you first of all and then the old lady and her son and then every one among her friends whom i have met at her house or elsewhere every one who has shown me the minimum of politeness every duke of them and his wife and then all my friends without exception miss kitty upjohn miss dora finch general packard c p hatch and all the rest and every one shall know what it is about that is to celebrate my engagement to the countess de cintre what do you think of the idea  i think it is odious said mrs tristram and then in a moment i think it is delicious  the very next evening newman repaired to madame de bellegardes salon where he found her surrounded by her children and invited her to honor his poor dwelling by her presence on a certain evening a fortnight distant  the marquise stared a moment my dear sir she cried what do you want to do to me  to make you acquainted with a few people and then to place you in a very easy chair and ask you to listen to madame frezzolinis singing  you mean to give a concert  something of that sort  and to have a crowd of people  all my friends and i hope some of yours and your daughters i want to celebrate my engagement  it seemed to newman that madame de bellegarde turned pale she opened her fan a fine old painted fan of the last century and looked at the picture which represented a fete champetrea lady with a guitar singing and a group of dancers round a garlanded hermes  we go out so little murmured the marquis since my poor fathers death  but my dear father is still alive my friend said his wife i am only waiting for my invitation to accept it and she glanced with amiable confidence at newman it will be magnificent i am very sure of that  i am sorry to say to the discredit of newmans gallantry that this ladys invitation was not then and there bestowed he was giving all his attention to the old marquise she looked up at last smiling i cant think of letting you offer me a fete she said until i have offered you one we want to present you to our friends we will invite them all we have it very much at heart we must do things in order come to me about the 25th i will let you know the exact day immediately we shall not have any one so fine as madame frezzolini but we shall have some very good people after that you may talk of your own fete the old lady spoke with a certain quick eagerness smiling more agreeably as she went on  it seemed to newman a handsome proposal and such proposals always touched the sources of his goodnature he said to madame de bellegarde that he should be glad to come on the 25th or any other day and that it mattered very little whether he met his friends at her house or at his own i have said that newman was observant but it must be admitted that on this occasion he failed to notice a certain delicate glance which passed between madame de bellegarde and the marquis and which we may presume to have been a commentary upon the innocence displayed in that latter clause of his speech  valentin de bellegarde walked away with newman that evening and when they had left the rue de luniversite some distance behind them he said reflectively my mother is very strongvery strong then in answer to an interrogative movement of newmans he continued she was driven to the wall but you would never have thought it her fete of the 25th was an invention of the moment she had no idea whatever of giving a fete but finding it the only issue from your proposal she looked straight at the doseexcuse the expressionand bolted it as you saw without winking she is very strong  dear me said newman divided between relish and compassion i dont care a straw for her fete i am willing to take the will for the deed  no no said valentin with a little inconsequent touch of family pride the thing will be done now and done handsomely    chapter xv   valentin de bellegardes announcement of the secession of mademoiselle nioche from her fathers domicile and his irreverent reflections upon the attitude of this anxious parent in so grave a catastrophe received a practical commentary in the fact that m nioche was slow to seek another interview with his late pupil it had cost newman some disgust to be forced to assent to valentins somewhat cynical interpretation of the old mans philosophy and though circumstances seemed to indicate that he had not given himself up to a noble despair newman thought it very possible he might be suffering more keenly than was apparent m nioche had been in the habit of paying him a respectful little visit every two or three weeks and his absence might be a proof quite as much of extreme depression as of a desire to conceal the success with which he had patched up his sorrow newman presently learned from valentin several details touching this new phase of mademoiselle noemies career  i told you she was remarkable this unshrinking observer declared and the way she has managed this performance proves it she has had other chances but she was resolved to take none but the best she did you the honor to think for a while that you might be such a chance you were not so she gathered up her patience and waited a while longer at last her occasion came along and she made her move with her eyes wide open i am very sure she had no innocence to lose but she had all her respectability dubious little damsel as you thought her she had kept a firm hold of that nothing could be proved against her and she was determined not to let her reputation go till she had got her equivalent about her equivalent she had high ideas apparently her ideal has been satisfied it is fifty years old baldheaded and deaf but it is very easy about money  and where in the world asked newman did you pick up this valuable information  in conversation remember my frivolous habits in conversation with a young woman engaged in the humble trade of glovecleaner who keeps a small shop in the rue st roch m nioche lives in the same house up six pair of stairs across the court in and out of whose illswept doorway miss noemie has been flitting for the last five years the little glovecleaner was an old acquaintance she used to be the friend of a friend of mine who has married and dropped such friends i often saw her in his society as soon as i espied her behind her clear little windowpane i recollected her i had on a spotlessly fresh pair of gloves but i went in and held up my hands and said to her dear mademoiselle what will you ask me for cleaning these dear count she answered immediately i will clean them for you for nothing she had instantly recognized me and i had to hear her history for the last six years but after that i put her upon that of her neighbors she knows and admires noemie and she told me what i have just repeated  a month elapsed without m nioche reappearing and newman who every morning read two or three suicides in the figaro began to suspect that mortification proving stubborn he had sought a balm for his wounded pride in the waters of the seine he had a note of m nioches address in his pocketbook and finding himself one day in the quartier he determined in so far as he might to clear up his doubts he repaired to the house in the rue st roch which bore the recorded number and observed in a neighboring basement behind a dangling row of neatly inflated gloves the attentive physiognomy of bellegardes informanta sallow person in a dressinggownpeering into the street as if she were expecting that amiable nobleman to pass again but it was not to her that newman applied he simply asked of the portress if m nioche were at home the portress replied as the portress invariably replies that her lodger had gone out barely three minutes before but then through the little square hole of her lodgewindow taking the measure of newmans fortunes and seeing them by an unspecified process refresh the dry places of servitude to occupants of fifth floors on courts she added that m nioche would have had just time to reach the cafe de la patrie round the second corner to the left at which establishment he regularly spent his afternoons newman thanked her for the information took the second turning to the left and arrived at the cafe de la patrie he felt a momentary hesitation to go in was it not rather mean to follow up poor old nioche at that rate but there passed across his vision an image of a haggard little septuagenarian taking measured sips of a glass of sugar and water and finding them quite impotent to sweeten his desolation he opened the door and entered perceiving nothing at first but a dense cloud of tobacco smoke across this however in a corner he presently descried the figure of m nioche stirring the contents of a deep glass with a lady seated in front of him the ladys back was turned to newman but m nioche very soon perceived and recognized his visitor newman had gone toward him and the old man rose slowly gazing at him with a more blighted expression even than usual  if you are drinking hot punch said newman i suppose you are not dead thats all right dont move  m nioche stood staring with a fallen jaw not daring to put out his hand the lady who sat facing him turned round in her place and glanced upward with a spirited toss of her head displaying the agreeable features of his daughter she looked at newman sharply to see how he was looking at her theni dont know what she discoveredshe said graciously how d ye do monsieur wont you come into our little corner  did you comedid you come after me asked m nioche very softly  i went to your house to see what had become of you i thought you might be sick said newman  it is very good of you as always said the old man no i am not well yes i am seek  ask monsieur to sit down said mademoiselle nioche garcon bring a chair  will you do us the honor to seat said m nioche timorously and with a double foreignness of accent  newman said to himself that he had better see the thing out and he took a chair at the end of the table with mademoiselle nioche on his left and her father on the other side you will take something of course said miss noemie who was sipping a glass of madeira newman said that he believed not and then she turned to her papa with a smile what an honor eh he has come only for us m nioche drained his pungent glass at a long draught and looked out from eyes more lachrymose in consequence but you didnt come for me eh mademoiselle noemie went on you didnt expect to find me here  newman observed the change in her appearance she was very elegant and prettier than before she looked a year or two older and it was noticeable that to the eye she had only gained in respectability she looked ladylike she was dressed in quiet colors and wore her expensively unobtrusive toilet with a grace that might have come from years of practice her present selfpossession and aplomb struck newman as really infernal and he inclined to agree with valentin de bellegarde that the young lady was very remarkable no to tell the truth i didnt come for you he said and i didnt expect to find you i was told he added in a moment that you had left your father  quelle horreur cried mademoiselle nioche with a smile does one leave ones father you have the proof of the contrary  yes convincing proof said newman glancing at m nioche the old man caught his glance obliquely with his faded deprecating eye and then lifting his empty glass pretended to drink again  who told you that noemie demanded i know very well it was m de bellegarde why dont you say yes you are not polite  i am embarrassed said newman  i set you a better example i know m de bellegarde told you he knows a great deal about meor he thinks he does he has taken a great deal of trouble to find out but half of it isnt true in the first place i havent left my father i am much too fond of him isnt it so little father m de bellegarde is a charming young man it is impossible to be cleverer i know a good deal about him too you can tell him that when you next see him  no said newman with a sturdy grin i wont carry any messages for you  just as you please said mademoiselle nioche i dont depend upon you nor does m de bellegarde either he is very much interested in me he can be left to his own devices he is a contrast to you  oh he is a great contrast to me i have no doubt said newman but i dont exactly know how you mean it  i mean it in this way first of all he never offered to help me to a dot and a husband and mademoiselle nioche paused smiling i wont say that is in his favor for i do you justice what led you by the way to make me such a queer offer you didnt care for me  oh yes i did said newman  how so  it would have given me real pleasure to see you married to a respectable young fellow  with six thousand francs of income cried mademoiselle nioche do you call that caring for me im afraid you know little about women you were not galant you were not what you might have been  newman flushed a trifle fiercely come he exclaimed thats rather strong i had no idea i had been so shabby  mademoiselle nioche smiled as she took up her muff it is something at any rate to have made you angry  her father had leaned both his elbows on the table and his head bent forward was supported in his hands the thin white fingers of which were pressed over his ears in his position he was staring fixedly at the bottom of his empty glass and newman supposed he was not hearing mademoiselle noemie buttoned her furred jacket and pushed back her chair casting a glance charged with the consciousness of an expensive appearance first down over her flounces and then up at newman  you had better have remained an honest girl newman said quietly  m nioche continued to stare at the bottom of his glass and his daughter got up still bravely smiling you mean that i look so much like one thats more than most women do nowadays dont judge me yet a while she added i mean to succeed thats what i mean to do i leave you i dont mean to be seen in cafes for one thing i cant think what you want of my poor father hes very comfortable now it isnt his fault either au revoir little father and she tapped the old man on the head with her muff then she stopped a minute looking at newman tell m de bellegarde when he wants news of me to come and get it from me and she turned and departed the whiteaproned waiter with a bow holding the door wide open for her  m nioche sat motionless and newman hardly knew what to say to him the old man looked dismally foolish so you determined not to shoot her after all newman said presently  m nioche without moving raised his eyes and gave him a long peculiar look it seemed to confess everything and yet not to ask for pity nor to pretend on the other hand to a rugged ability to do without it it might have expressed the state of mind of an innocuous insect flat in shape and conscious of the impending pressure of a bootsole and reflecting that he was perhaps too flat to be crushed m nioches gaze was a profession of moral flatness you despise me terribly he said in the weakest possible voice  oh no said newman it is none of my business its a good plan to take things easily  i made you too many fine speeches m nioche added i meant them at the time  i am sure i am very glad you didnt shoot her said newman i was afraid you might have shot yourself that is why i came to look you up and he began to button his coat  neither said m nioche you despise me and i cant explain to you i hoped i shouldnt see you again  why thats rather shabby said newman you shouldnt drop your friends that way besides the last time you came to see me i thought you particularly jolly  yes i remember said m nioche musingly i was in a fever i didnt know what i said what i did it was delirium  ah well you are quieter now  m nioche was silent a moment as quiet as the grave he whispered softly  are you very unhappy  m nioche rubbed his forehead slowly and even pushed back his wig a little looking askance at his empty glass yesyes but thats an old story i have always been unhappy my daughter does what she will with me i take what she gives me good or bad i have no spirit and when you have no spirit you must keep quiet i shant trouble you any more  well said newman rather disgusted at the smooth operation of the old mans philosophy thats as you please  m nioche seemed to have been prepared to be despised but nevertheless he made a feeble movement of appeal from newmans faint praise after all he said she is my daughter and i can still look after her if she will do wrong why she will but there are many different paths there are degrees i can give her the benefitgive her the benefitand m nioche paused staring vaguely at newman who began to suspect that his brain had softenedthe benefit of my experience m nioche added  your experience inquired newman both amused and amazed  my experience of business said m nioche gravely  ah yes said newman laughing that will be a great advantage to her and then he said goodby and offered the poor foolish old man his hand  m nioche took it and leaned back against the wall holding it a moment and looking up at him i suppose you think my wits are going he said very likely i have always a pain in my head thats why i cant explain i cant tell you and shes so strong she makes me walk as she will anywhere but theres thistheres this and he stopped still staring up at newman his little white eyes expanded and glittered for a moment like those of a cat in the dark its not as it seems i havent forgiven her oh no  thats right dont said newman shes a bad case  its horrible its horrible said m nioche but do you want to know the truth i hate her i take what she gives me and i hate her more today she brought me three hundred francs they are here in my waistcoat pocket now i hate her almost cruelly no i havent forgiven her  why did you accept the money newman asked  if i hadnt said m nioche i should have hated her still more thats what misery is no i havent forgiven her  take care you dont hurt her said newman laughing again and with this he took his leave as he passed along the glazed side of the cafe on reaching the street he saw the old man motioning the waiter with a melancholy gesture to replenish his glass  one day a week after his visit to the cafe de la patrie he called upon valentin de bellegarde and by good fortune found him at home newman spoke of his interview with m nioche and his daughter and said he was afraid valentin had judged the old man correctly he had found the couple hobnobbing together in all amity the old gentlemans rigor was purely theoretic newman confessed that he was disappointed he should have expected to see m nioche take high ground  high ground my dear fellow said valentin laughing there is no high ground for him to take the only perceptible eminence in m nioches horizon is montmartre which is not an edifying quarter you cant go mountaineering in a flat country  he remarked indeed said newman that he has not forgiven her but shell never find it out  we must do him the justice to suppose he doesnt like the thing valentin rejoined mademoiselle nioche is like the great artists whose biographies we read who at the beginning of their career have suffered opposition in the domestic circle their vocation has not been recognized by their families but the world has done it justice mademoiselle nioche has a vocation  oh come said newman impatiently you take the little baggage too seriously  i know i do but when one has nothing to think about one must think of little baggages i suppose it is better to be serious about light things than not to be serious at all this little baggage entertains me  oh she has discovered that she knows you have been hunting her up and asking questions about her she is very much tickled by it thats rather annoying  annoying my dear fellow laughed valentin not the least  hanged if i should want to have a greedy little adventuress like that know i was giving myself such pains about her said newman  a pretty woman is always worth ones pains objected valentin mademoiselle nioche is welcome to be tickled by my curiosity and to know that i am tickled that she is tickled she is not so much tickled by the way  you had better go and tell her newman rejoined she gave me a message for you of some such drift  bless your quiet imagination said valentin i have been to see herthree times in five days she is a charming hostess we talk of shakespeare and the musical glasses she is extremely clever and a very curious type not at all coarse or wanting to be coarse determined not to be she means to take very good care of herself she is extremely perfect she is as hard and clearcut as some little figure of a seanymph in an antique intaglio and i will warrant that she has not a grain more of sentiment or heart than if she was scooped out of a big amethyst you cant scratch her even with a diamond extremely prettyreally when you know her she is wonderfully prettyintelligent determined ambitious unscrupulous capable of looking at a man strangled without changing color she is upon my honor extremely entertaining  its a fine list of attractions said newman they would serve as a policedetectives description of a favorite criminal i should sum them up by another word than entertaining  why that is just the word to use i dont say she is laudable or lovable i dont want her as my wife or my sister but she is a very curious and ingenious piece of machinery i like to see it in operation  well i have seen some very curious machines too said newman and once in a needle factory i saw a gentleman from the city who had stopped too near one of them picked up as neatly as if he had been prodded by a fork swallowed down straight and ground into small pieces  reentering his domicile late in the evening three days after madame de bellegarde had made her bargain with himthe expression is sufficiently correcttouching the entertainment at which she was to present him to the world he found on his table a card of goodly dimensions bearing an announcement that this lady would be at home on the 27th of the month at ten oclock in the evening he stuck it into the frame of his mirror and eyed it with some complacency it seemed an agreeable emblem of triumph documentary evidence that his prize was gained stretched out in a chair he was looking at it lovingly when valentin de bellegarde was shown into the room valentins glance presently followed the direction of newmans and he perceived his mothers invitation  and what have they put into the corner he asked not the customary music dancing or tableaux vivants they ought at least to put an american  oh there are to be several of us said newman mrs tristram told me today that she had received a card and sent an acceptance  ah then with mrs tristram and her husband you will have support my mother might have put on her card three americans but i suspect you will not lack amusement you will see a great many of the best people in france i mean the long pedigrees and the high noses and all that some of them are awful idiots i advise you to take them up cautiously  oh i guess i shall like them said newman i am prepared to like every one and everything in these days i am in high goodhumor  valentin looked at him a moment in silence and then dropped himself into a chair with an unwonted air of weariness  happy man he said with a sigh take care you dont become offensive  if any one chooses to take offense he may i have a good conscience said newman  so you are really in love with my sister  yes sir said newman after a pause  and she also  i guess she likes me said newman  what is the witchcraft you have used valentin asked how do you make love  oh i havent any general rules said newman in any way that seems acceptable  i suspect that if one knew it said valentin laughing you are a terrible customer you walk in sevenleague boots  there is something the matter with you tonight newman said in response to this you are vicious spare me all discordant sounds until after my marriage then when i have settled down for life i shall be better able to take things as they come  and when does your marriage take place  about six weeks hence  valentin was silent a while and then he said and you feel very confident about the future  confident i knew what i wanted exactly and i know what i have got  you are sure you are going to be happy  sure said newman so foolish a question deserves a foolish answer yes  you are not afraid of anything  what should i be afraid of you cant hurt me unless you kill me by some violent means that i should indeed consider a tremendous sell i want to live and i mean to live i cant die of illness i am too ridiculously tough and the time for dying of old age wont come round yet a while i cant lose my wife i shall take too good care of her i may lose my money or a large part of it but that wont matter for i shall make twice as much again so what have i to be afraid of  you are not afraid it may be rather a mistake for an american man of business to marry a french countess  for the countess possibly but not for the man of business if you mean me but my countess shall not be disappointed i answer for her happiness and as if he felt the impulse to celebrate his happy certitude by a bonfire he got up to throw a couple of logs upon the already blazing hearth valentin watched for a few moments the quickened flame and then with his head leaning on his hand gave a melancholy sigh got a headache newman asked  je suis triste said valentin with gallic simplicity  you are sad eh it is about the lady you said the other night that you adored and that you couldnt marry  did i really say that it seemed to me afterwards that the words had escaped me before claire it was bad taste but i felt gloomy as i spoke and i feel gloomy still why did you ever introduce me to that girl  oh its noemie is it lord deliver us you dont mean to say you are lovesick about her  lovesick no its not a grand passion but the coldblooded little demon sticks in my thoughts she has bitten me with those even little teeth of hers i feel as if i might turn rabid and do something crazy in consequence its very low its disgustingly low shes the most mercenary little jade in europe yet she really affects my peace of mind she is always running in my head its a striking contrast to your noble and virtuous attachmenta vile contrast it is rather pitiful that it should be the best i am able to do for myself at my present respectable age i am a nice young man eh en somme you cant warrant my future as you do your own  drop that girl short said newman dont go near her again and your future will do come over to america and i will get you a place in a bank  it is easy to say drop her said valentin with a light laugh you cant drop a pretty woman like that one must be polite even with noemie besides ill not have her suppose i am afraid of her  so between politeness and vanity you will get deeper into the mud keep them both for something better remember too that i didnt want to introduce you to her you insisted i had a sort of uneasy feeling about it  oh i dont reproach you said valentin heaven forbid i wouldnt for the world have missed knowing her she is really extraordinary the way she has already spread her wings is amazing i dont know when a woman has amused me more but excuse me he added in an instant she doesnt amuse you at second hand and the subject is an impure one let us talk of something else valentin introduced another topic but within five minutes newman observed that by a bold transition he had reverted to mademoiselle nioche and was giving pictures of her manners and quoting specimens of her mots these were very witty and for a young woman who six months before had been painting the most artless madonnas startlingly cynical but at last abruptly he stopped became thoughtful and for some time afterwards said nothing when he rose to go it was evident that his thoughts were still running upon mademoiselle nioche yes shes a frightful little monster he said    chapter xvi   the next ten days were the happiest that newman had ever known he saw madame de cintre every day and never saw either old madame de bellegarde or the elder of his prospective brothersinlaw madame de cintre at last seemed to think it becoming to apologize for their never being present they are much taken up she said with doing the honors of paris to lord deepmere there was a smile in her gravity as she made this declaration and it deepened as she added he is our seventh cousin you know and blood is thicker than water and then he is so interesting and with this she laughed  newman met young madame de bellegarde two or three times always roaming about with graceful vagueness as if in search of an unattainable ideal of amusement she always reminded him of a painted perfumebottle with a crack in it but he had grown to have a kindly feeling for her based on the fact of her owing conjugal allegiance to urbain de bellegarde he pitied m de bellegardes wife especially since she was a silly thirstilysmiling little brunette with a suggestion of an unregulated heart the small marquise sometimes looked at him with an intensity too marked not to be innocent for coquetry is more finely shaded she apparently wanted to ask him something or tell him something he wondered what it was but he was shy of giving her an opportunity because if her communication bore upon the aridity of her matrimonial lot he was at a loss to see how he could help her he had a fancy however of her coming up to him some day and saying after looking around behind her with a little passionate hiss i know you detest my husband let me have the pleasure of assuring you for once that you are right pity a poor woman who is married to a clockimage in papiermache possessing however in default of a competent knowledge of the principles of etiquette a very downright sense of the meanness of certain actions it seemed to him to belong to his position to keep on his guard he was not going to put it into the power of these people to say that in their house he had done anything unpleasant as it was madame de bellegarde used to give him news of the dress she meant to wear at his wedding and which had not yet in her creative imagination in spite of many interviews with the tailor resolved itself into its composite totality i told you pale blue bows on the sleeves at the elbows she said but today i dont see my blue bows at all i dont know what has become of them today i see pinka tender pink and then i pass through strange dull phases in which neither blue nor pink says anything to me and yet i must have the bows  have them green or yellow said newman  malheureux the little marquise would cry green bows would break your marriageyour children would be illegitimate  madame de cintre was calmly happy before the world and newman had the felicity of fancying that before him when the world was absent she was almost agitatedly happy she said very tender things i take no pleasure in you you never give me a chance to scold you to correct you i bargained for that i expected to enjoy it but you wont do anything dreadful you are dismally inoffensive it is very stupid there is no excitement for me i might as well be marrying some one else  i am afraid its the worst i can do newman would say in answer to this kindly overlook the deficiency he assured her that he at least would never scold her she was perfectly satisfactory if you only knew he said how exactly you are what i coveted and i am beginning to understand why i coveted it the having it makes all the difference that i expected never was a man so pleased with his good fortune you have been holding your head for a week past just as i wanted my wife to hold hers you say just the things i want her to say you walk about the room just as i want her to walk you have just the taste in dress that i want her to have in short you come up to the mark and i can tell you my mark was high  these observations seemed to make madame de cintre rather grave at last she said depend upon it i dont come up to the mark your mark is too high i am not all that you suppose i am a much smaller affair she is a magnificent woman your ideal pray how did she come to such perfection  she was never anything else newman said  i really believe madame de cintre went on that she is better than my own ideal do you know that is a very handsome compliment well sir i will make her my own  mrs tristram came to see her dear claire after newman had announced his engagement and she told our hero the next day that his good fortune was simply absurd for the ridiculous part of it is she said that you are evidently going to be as happy as if you were marrying miss smith or miss thompson i call it a brilliant match for you but you get brilliancy without paying any tax upon it those things are usually a compromise but here you have everything and nothing crowds anything else out you will be brilliantly happy as well newman thanked her for her pleasant encouraging way of saying things no woman could encourage or discourage better tristrams way of saying things was different he had been taken by his wife to call upon madame de cintre and he gave an account of the expedition  you dont catch me giving an opinion on your countess this time he said i put my foot in it once thats a dd underhand thing to do by the waycoming round to sound a fellow upon the woman you are going to marry you deserve anything you get then of course you rush and tell her and she takes care to make it pleasant for the poor spiteful wretch the first time he calls i will do you the justice to say however that you dont seem to have told madame de cintre or if you have shes uncommonly magnanimous she was very nice she was tremendously polite she and lizzie sat on the sofa pressing each others hands and calling each other chere belle and madame de cintre sent me with every third word a magnificent smile as if to give me to understand that i too was a handsome dear she quite made up for past neglect i assure you she was very pleasant and sociable only in an evil hour it came into her head to say that she must present us to her motherher mother wished to know your friends i didnt want to know her mother and i was on the point of telling lizzie to go in alone and let me wait for her outside but lizzie with her usual infernal ingenuity guessed my purpose and reduced me by a glance of her eye so they marched off arm in arm and i followed as i could we found the old lady in her armchair twiddling her aristocratic thumbs she looked at lizzie from head to foot but at that game lizzie to do her justice was a match for her my wife told her we were great friends of mr newman the marquise started a moment and then said oh mr newman my daughter has made up her mind to marry a mr newman then madame de cintre began to fondle lizzie again and said it was this dear lady that had planned the match and brought them together oh tis you i have to thank for my american soninlaw the old lady said to mrs tristram it was a very clever thought of yours be sure of my gratitude and then she began to look at me and presently said pray are you engaged in some species of manufacture i wanted to say that i manufactured broomsticks for old witches to ride on but lizzie got in ahead of me my husband madame la marquise she said belongs to that unfortunate class of persons who have no profession and no business and do very little good in the world to get her poke at the old woman she didnt care where she shoved me dear me said the marquise we all have our duties i am sorry mine compel me to take leave of you said lizzie and we bundled out again but you have a motherinlaw in all the force of the term  oh said newman my motherinlaw desires nothing better than to let me alone  betimes on the evening of the 27th he went to madame de bellegardes ball the old house in the rue de luniversite looked strangely brilliant in the circle of light projected from the outer gate a detachment of the populace stood watching the carriages roll in the court was illumined with flaring torches and the portico carpeted with crimson when newman arrived there were but a few people present the marquise and her two daughters were at the top of the staircase where the sallow old nymph in the angle peeped out from a bower of plants madame de bellegarde in purple and fine laces looked like an old lady painted by vandyke madame de cintre was dressed in white the old lady greeted newman with majestic formality and looking round her called several of the persons who were standing near they were elderly gentlemen of what valentin de bellegarde had designated as the highnosed category two or three of them wore cordons and stars they approached with measured alertness and the marquise said that she wished to present them to mr newman who was going to marry her daughter then she introduced successively three dukes three counts and a baron these gentlemen bowed and smiled most agreeably and newman indulged in a series of impartial handshakes accompanied by a happy to make your acquaintance sir he looked at madame de cintre but she was not looking at him if his personal selfconsciousness had been of a nature to make him constantly refer to her as the critic before whom in company he played his part he might have found it a flattering proof of her confidence that he never caught her eyes resting upon him it is a reflection newman did not make but we nevertheless risk it that in spite of this circumstance she probably saw every movement of his little finger young madame de bellegarde was dressed in an audacious toilet of crimson crape bestrewn with huge silver moonsthin crescent and full disks  you dont say anything about my dress she said to newman  i feel he answered as if i were looking at you through a telescope it is very strange  if it is strange it matches the occasion but i am not a heavenly body  i never saw the sky at midnight that particular shade of crimson said newman  that is my originality any one could have chosen blue my sisterinlaw would have chosen a lovely shade of blue with a dozen little delicate moons but i think crimson is much more amusing and i give my idea which is moonshine  moonshine and bloodshed said newman  a murder by moonlight laughed madame de bellegarde what a delicious idea for a toilet to make it complete there is the silver dagger you see stuck into my hair but here comes lord deepmere she added in a moment i must find out what he thinks of it lord deepmere came up looking very red in the face and laughing lord deepmere cant decide which he prefers my sisterinlaw or me said madame de bellegarde he likes claire because she is his cousin and me because i am not but he has no right to make love to claire whereas i am perfectly disponible it is very wrong to make love to a woman who is engaged but it is very wrong not to make love to a woman who is married  oh its very jolly making love to married women said lord deepmere because they cant ask you to marry them  is that what the others do the spinsters newman inquired  oh dear yes said lord deepmere in england all the girls ask a fellow to marry them  and a fellow brutally refuses said madame de bellegarde  why really you know a fellow cant marry any girl that asks him said his lordship  your cousin wont ask you she is going to marry mr newman  oh thats a very different thing laughed lord deepmere  you would have accepted her i suppose that makes me hope that after all you prefer me  oh when things are nice i never prefer one to the other said the young englishman i take them all  ah what a horror i wont be taken in that way i must be kept apart cried madame de bellegarde mr newman is much better he knows how to choose oh he chooses as if he were threading a needle he prefers madame de cintre to any conceivable creature or thing  well you cant help my being her cousin said lord deepmere to newman with candid hilarity  oh no i cant help that said newman laughing back neither can she  and you cant help my dancing with her said lord deepmere with sturdy simplicity  i could prevent that only by dancing with her myself said newman but unfortunately i dont know how to dance  oh you may dance without knowing how may you not milord said madame de bellegarde but to this lord deepmere replied that a fellow ought to know how to dance if he didnt want to make an ass of himself and at this moment urbain de bellegarde joined the group slowstepping and with his hands behind him  this is a very splendid entertainment said newman cheerfully the old house looks very bright  if you are pleased we are content said the marquis lifting his shoulders and bending them forward  oh i suspect every one is pleased said newman how can they help being pleased when the first thing they see as they come in is your sister standing there as beautiful as an angel  yes she is very beautiful rejoined the marquis solemnly but that is not so great a source of satisfaction to other people naturally as to you  yes i am satisfied marquis i am satisfied said newman with his protracted enunciation and now tell me he added looking round who some of your friends are  m de bellegarde looked about him in silence with his head bent and his hand raised to his lower lip which he slowly rubbed a stream of people had been pouring into the salon in which newman stood with his host the rooms were filling up and the spectacle had become brilliant it borrowed its splendor chiefly from the shining shoulders and profuse jewels of the women and from the voluminous elegance of their dresses there were no uniforms as madame de bellegardes door was inexorably closed against the myrmidons of the upstart power which then ruled the fortunes of france and the great company of smiling and chattering faces was not graced by any very frequent suggestions of harmonious beauty it is a pity nevertheless that newman had not been a physiognomist for a great many of the faces were irregularly agreeable expressive and suggestive if the occasion had been different they would hardly have pleased him he would have thought the women not pretty enough and the men too smirking but he was now in a humor to receive none but agreeable impressions and he looked no more narrowly than to perceive that every one was brilliant and to feel that the sun of their brilliancy was a part of his credit i will present you to some people said m de bellegarde after a while i will make a point of it in fact you will allow me  oh i will shake hands with any one you want said newman your mother just introduced me to half a dozen old gentlemen take care you dont pick up the same parties again  who are the gentlemen to whom my mother presented you  upon my word i forgot them said newman laughing the people here look very much alike  i suspect they have not forgotten you said the marquis and he began to walk through the rooms newman to keep near him in the crowd took his arm after which for some time the marquis walked straight along in silence at last reaching the farther end of the suite of receptionrooms newman found himself in the presence of a lady of monstrous proportions seated in a very capacious armchair with several persons standing in a semicircle round her this little group had divided as the marquis came up and m de bellegarde stepped forward and stood for an instant silent and obsequious with his hat raised to his lips as newman had seen some gentlemen stand in churches as soon as they entered their pews the lady indeed bore a very fair likeness to a reverend effigy in some idolatrous shrine she was monumentally stout and imperturbably serene her aspect was to newman almost formidable he had a troubled consciousness of a triple chin a small piercing eye a vast expanse of uncovered bosom a nodding and twinkling tiara of plumes and gems and an immense circumference of satin petticoat with her little circle of beholders this remarkable woman reminded him of the fat lady at a fair she fixed her small unwinking eyes at the newcomers  dear duchess said the marquis let me present you our good friend mr newman of whom you have heard us speak wishing to make mr newman known to those who are dear to us i could not possibly fail to begin with you  charmed dear friend charmed monsieur said the duchess in a voice which though small and shrill was not disagreeable while newman executed his obeisance i came on purpose to see monsieur i hope he appreciates the compliment you have only to look at me to do so sir she continued sweeping her person with a muchencompassing glance newman hardly knew what to say though it seemed that to a duchess who joked about her corpulence one might say almost anything on hearing that the duchess had come on purpose to see newman the gentlemen who surrounded her turned a little and looked at him with sympathetic curiosity the marquis with supernatural gravity mentioned to him the name of each while the gentleman who bore it bowed they were all what are called in france beaux noms i wanted extremely to see you the duchess went on cest positif in the first place i am very fond of the person you are going to marry she is the most charming creature in france mind you treat her well or you shall hear some news of me but you look as if you were good i am told you are very remarkable i have heard all sorts of extraordinary things about you voyons are they true  i dont know what you can have heard said newman  oh you have your legende we have heard that you have had a career the most checkered the most bizarre what is that about your having founded a city some ten years ago in the great west a city which contains today half a million of inhabitants isnt it half a million messieurs you are exclusive proprietor of this flourishing settlement and are consequently fabulously rich and you would be richer still if you didnt grant lands and houses free of rent to all newcomers who will pledge themselves never to smoke cigars at this game in three years we are told you are going to be made president of america  the duchess recited this amazing legend with a smooth selfpossession which gave the speech to newmans mind the air of being a bit of amusing dialogue in a play delivered by a veteran comic actress before she had ceased speaking he had burst into loud irrepressible laughter dear duchess dear duchess the marquis began to murmur soothingly two or three persons came to the door of the room to see who was laughing at the duchess but the lady continued with the soft serene assurance of a person who as a duchess was certain of being listened to and as a garrulous woman was independent of the pulse of her auditors but i know you are very remarkable you must be to have endeared yourself to this good marquis and to his admirable world they are very exacting i myself am not very sure at this hour of really possessing it eh bellegarde to please you i see one must be an american millionaire but your real triumph my dear sir is pleasing the countess she is as difficult as a princess in a fairy tale your success is a miracle what is your secret i dont ask you to reveal it before all these gentlemen but come and see me some day and give me a specimen of your talents  the secret is with madame de cintre said newman you must ask her for it it consists in her having a great deal of charity  very pretty said the duchess thats a very nice specimen to begin with what bellegarde are you already taking monsieur away  i have a duty to perform dear friend said the marquis pointing to the other groups  ah for you i know what that means well i have seen monsieur that is what i wanted he cant persuade me that he isnt very clever farewell  as newman passed on with his host he asked who the duchess was the greatest lady in france said the marquis m de bellegarde then presented his prospective brotherinlaw to some twenty other persons of both sexes selected apparently for their typically august character in some cases this character was written in good round hand upon the countenance of the wearer in others newman was thankful for such help as his companions impressively brief intimation contributed to the discovery of it there were large majestic men and small demonstrative men there were ugly ladies in yellow lace and quaint jewels and pretty ladies with white shoulders from which jewels and every thing else were absent every one gave newman extreme attention every one smiled every one was charmed to make his acquaintance every one looked at him with that soft hardness of good society which puts out its hand but keeps its fingers closed over the coin if the marquis was going about as a bearleader if the fiction of beauty and the beast was supposed to have found its companionpiece the general impression appeared to be that the bear was a very fair imitation of humanity newman found his reception among the marquiss friends very pleasant he could not have said more for it it was pleasant to be treated with so much explicit politeness it was pleasant to hear neatly turned civilities with a flavor of wit uttered from beneath carefullyshaped mustaches it was pleasant to see clever frenchwomenthey all seemed cleverturn their backs to their partners to get a good look at the strange american whom claire de cintre was to marry and reward the object of the exhibition with a charming smile at last as he turned away from a battery of smiles and other amenities newman caught the eye of the marquis looking at him heavily and thereupon for a single instant he checked himself am i behaving like a dd fool he asked himself am i stepping about like a terrier on his hind legs at this moment he perceived mrs tristram at the other side of the room and he waved his hand in farewell to m de bellegarde and made his way toward her  am i holding my head too high he asked do i look as if i had the lower end of a pulley fastened to my chin  you look like all happy men very ridiculous said mrs tristram its the usual thing neither better nor worse i have been watching you for the last ten minutes and i have been watching m de bellegarde he doesnt like it  the more credit to him for putting it through replied newman but i shall be generous i shant trouble him any more but i am very happy i cant stand still here please to take my arm and we will go for a walk  he led mrs tristram through all the rooms there were a great many of them and decorated for the occasion and filled with a stately crowd their somewhat tarnished nobleness recovered its lustre mrs tristram looking about her dropped a series of softlyincisive comments upon her fellowguests but newman made vague answers he hardly heard her his thoughts were elsewhere they were lost in a cheerful sense of success of attainment and victory his momentary care as to whether he looked like a fool passed away leaving him simply with a rich contentment he had got what he wanted the savor of success had always been highly agreeable to him and it had been his fortune to know it often but it had never before been so sweet been associated with so much that was brilliant and suggestive and entertaining the lights the flowers the music the crowd the splendid women the jewels the strangeness even of the universal murmur of a clever foreign tongue were all a vivid symbol and assurance of his having grasped his purpose and forced along his groove if newmans smile was larger than usual it was not tickled vanity that pulled the strings he had no wish to be shown with the finger or to achieve a personal success if he could have looked down at the scene invisible from a hole in the roof he would have enjoyed it quite as much it would have spoken to him about his own prosperity and deepened that easy feeling about life to which sooner or later he made all experience contribute just now the cup seemed full  it is a very pretty party said mrs tristram after they had walked a while i have seen nothing objectionable except my husband leaning against the wall and talking to an individual whom i suppose he takes for a duke but whom i more than suspect to be the functionary who attends to the lamps do you think you could separate them knock over a lamp  i doubt whether newman who saw no harm in tristrams conversing with an ingenious mechanic would have complied with this request but at this moment valentin de bellegarde drew near newman some weeks previously had presented madame de cintres youngest brother to mrs tristram for whose merits valentin professed a discriminating relish and to whom he had paid several visits  did you ever read keatss belle dame sans merci asked mrs tristram you remind me of the hero of the ballad       oh what can ail thee knightatarms      alone and palely loitering  if i am alone it is because i have been deprived of your society said valentin besides it is good manners for no man except newman to look happy this is all to his address it is not for you and me to go before the curtain  you promised me last spring said newman to mrs tristram that six months from that time i should get into a monstrous rage it seems to me the times up and yet the nearest i can come to doing anything rough now is to offer you a cafe glace  i told you we should do things grandly said valentin i dont allude to the cafes glaces but every one is here and my sister told me just now that urbain had been adorable  hes a good fellow hes a good fellow said newman i love him as a brother that reminds me that i ought to go and say something polite to your mother  let it be something very polite indeed said valentin it may be the last time you will feel so much like it  newman walked away almost disposed to clasp old madame de bellegarde round the waist he passed through several rooms and at last found the old marquise in the first saloon seated on a sofa with her young kinsman lord deepmere beside her the young man looked somewhat bored his hands were thrust into his pockets and his eyes were fixed upon the toes of his shoes his feet being thrust out in front of him madame de bellegarde appeared to have been talking to him with some intensity and to be waiting for an answer to what she had said or for some sign of the effect of her words her hands were folded in her lap and she was looking at his lordships simple physiognomy with an air of politely suppressed irritation  lord deepmere looked up as newman approached met his eyes and changed color  i am afraid i disturb an interesting interview said newman  madame de bellegarde rose and her companion rising at the same time she put her hand into his arm she answered nothing for an instant and then as he remained silent she said with a smile it would be polite for lord deepmere to say it was very interesting  oh im not polite cried his lordship but it was interesting  madame de bellegarde was giving you some good advice eh said newman toning you down a little  i was giving him some excellent advice said the marquise fixing her fresh cold eyes upon our hero its for him to take it  take it sirtake it newman exclaimed any advice the marquise gives you tonight must be good for tonight marquise you must speak from a cheerful comfortable spirit and that makes good advice you see everything going on so brightly and successfully round you your party is magnificent it was a very happy thought it is much better than that thing of mine would have been  if you are pleased i am satisfied said madame de bellegarde my desire was to please you  do you want to please me a little more said newman just drop our lordly friend i am sure he wants to be off and shake his heels a little then take my arm and walk through the rooms  my desire was to please you the old lady repeated and she liberated lord deepmere newman rather wondering at her docility if this young man is wise she added he will go and find my daughter and ask her to dance  i have been indorsing your advice said newman bending over her and laughing i suppose i must swallow that  lord deepmere wiped his forehead and departed and madame de bellegarde took newmans arm yes its a very pleasant sociable entertainment the latter declared as they proceeded on their circuit every one seems to know every one and to be glad to see every one the marquis has made me acquainted with ever so many people and i feel quite like one of the family its an occasion newman continued wanting to say something thoroughly kind and comfortable that i shall always remember and remember very pleasantly  i think it is an occasion that we shall none of us forget said the marquise with her pure neat enunciation  people made way for her as she passed others turned round and looked at her and she received a great many greetings and pressings of the hand all of which she accepted with the most delicate dignity but though she smiled upon every one she said nothing until she reached the last of the rooms where she found her elder son then this is enough sir she declared with measured softness to newman and turned to the marquis he put out both his hands and took both hers drawing her to a seat with an air of the tenderest veneration it was a most harmonious family group and newman discreetly retired he moved through the rooms for some time longer circulating freely overtopping most people by his great height renewing acquaintance with some of the groups to which urbain de bellegarde had presented him and expending generally the surplus of his equanimity he continued to find it all extremely agreeable but the most agreeable things have an end and the revelry on this occasion began to deepen to a close the music was sounding its ultimate strains and people were looking for the marquise to make their farewells there seemed to be some difficulty in finding her and newman heard a report that she had left the ball feeling faint she has succumbed to the emotions of the evening he heard a lady say poor dear marquise i can imagine all that they may have been for her but he learned immediately afterwards that she had recovered herself and was seated in an armchair near the doorway receiving parting compliments from great ladies who insisted upon her not rising he himself set out in quest of madame de cintre he had seen her move past him many times in the rapid circles of a waltz but in accordance with her explicit instructions he had exchanged no words with her since the beginning of the evening the whole house having been thrown open the apartments of the rezdechaussee were also accessible though a smaller number of persons had gathered there newman wandered through them observing a few scattered couples to whom this comparative seclusion appeared grateful and reached a small conservatory which opened into the garden the end of the conservatory was formed by a clear sheet of glass unmasked by plants and admitting the winter starlight so directly that a person standing there would seem to have passed into the open air two persons stood there now a lady and a gentleman the lady newman from within the room and although she had turned her back to it immediately recognized as madame de cintre he hesitated as to whether he would advance but as he did so she looked round feeling apparently that he was there she rested her eyes on him a moment and then turned again to her companion  it is almost a pity not to tell mr newman she said softly but in a tone that newman could hear  tell him if you like the gentleman answered in the voice of lord deepmere  oh tell me by all means said newman advancing  lord deepmere he observed was very red in the face and he had twisted his gloves into a tight cord as if he had been squeezing them dry these presumably were tokens of violent emotion and it seemed to newman that the traces of corresponding agitation were visible in madame de cintres face the two had been talking with much vivacity what i should tell you is only to my lords credit said madame de cintre smiling frankly enough  he wouldnt like it any better for that said my lord with his awkward laugh  come whats the mystery newman demanded clear it up i dont like mysteries  we must have some things we dont like and go without some we do said the ruddy young nobleman laughing still  its to lord deepmeres credit but it is not to every ones said madam de cintre so i shall say nothing about it you may be sure she added and she put out her hand to the englishman who took it half shyly half impetuously and now go and dance she said  oh yes i feel awfully like dancing he answered i shall go and get tipsy and he walked away with a gloomy guffaw  what has happened between you newman asked  i cant tell younow said madame de cintre nothing that need make you unhappy  has the little englishman been trying to make love to you  she hesitated and then she uttered a grave no hes a very honest little fellow  but you are agitated something is the matter  nothing i repeat that need make you unhappy my agitation is over some day i will tell you what it was not now i cant now  well i confess remarked newman i dont want to hear anything unpleasant i am satisfied with everythingmost of all with you i have seen all the ladies and talked with a great many of them but i am satisfied with you madame de cintre covered him for a moment with her large soft glance and then turned her eyes away into the starry night so they stood silent a moment side by side say you are satisfied with me said newman  he had to wait a moment for the answer but it came at last low yet distinct i am very happy  it was presently followed by a few words from another source which made them both turn round i am sadly afraid madame de cintre will take a chill i have ventured to bring a shawl mrs bread stood there softly solicitous holding a white drapery in her hand  thank you said madame de cintre the sight of those cold stars gives one a sense of frost i wont take your shawl but we will go back into the house  she passed back and newman followed her mrs bread standing respectfully aside to make way for them newman paused an instant before the old woman and she glanced up at him with a silent greeting oh yes he said you must come and live with us  well then sir if you will she answered you have not seen the last of me    chapter xvii   newman was fond of music and went often to the opera a couple of evenings after madame de bellegardes ball he sat listening to don giovanni having in honor of this work which he had never yet seen represented come to occupy his orchestrachair before the rising of the curtain frequently he took a large box and invited a party of his compatriots this was a mode of recreation to which he was much addicted he liked making up parties of his friends and conducting them to the theatre and taking them to drive on high drags or to dine at remote restaurants he liked doing things which involved his paying for people the vulgar truth is that he enjoyed treating them this was not because he was what is called purseproud handling money in public was on the contrary positively disagreeable to him he had a sort of personal modesty about it akin to what he would have felt about making a toilet before spectators but just as it was a gratification to him to be handsomely dressed just so it was a private satisfaction to him he enjoyed it very clandestinely to have interposed pecuniarily in a scheme of pleasure to set a large group of people in motion and transport them to a distance to have special conveyances to charter railwaycarriages and steamboats harmonized with his relish for bold processes and made hospitality seem more active and more to the purpose a few evenings before the occasion of which i speak he had invited several ladies and gentlemen to the opera to listen to madame albonia party which included miss dora finch it befell however that miss dora finch sitting near newman in the box discoursed brilliantly not only during the entractes but during many of the finest portions of the performance so that newman had really come away with an irritated sense that madame alboni had a thin shrill voice and that her musical phrase was much garnished with a laugh of the giggling order after this he promised himself to go for a while to the opera alone  when the curtain had fallen upon the first act of don giovanni he turned round in his place to observe the house presently in one of the boxes he perceived urbain de bellegarde and his wife the little marquise was sweeping the house very busily with a glass and newman supposing that she saw him determined to go and bid her good evening m de bellegarde was leaning against a column motionless looking straight in front of him with one hand in the breast of his white waistcoat and the other resting his hat on his thigh newman was about to leave his place when he noticed in that obscure region devoted to the small boxes which in france are called not inaptly bathingtubs a face which even the dim light and the distance could not make wholly indistinct it was the face of a young and pretty woman and it was surmounted with a coiffure of pink roses and diamonds this person was looking round the house and her fan was moving to and fro with the most practiced grace when she lowered it newman perceived a pair of plump white shoulders and the edge of a rosecolored dress beside her very close to the shoulders and talking apparently with an earnestness which it pleased her scantily to heed sat a young man with a red face and a very low shirtcollar a moments gazing left newman with no doubts the pretty young woman was noemie nioche he looked hard into the depths of the box thinking her father might perhaps be in attendance but from what he could see the young mans eloquence had no other auditor newman at last made his way out and in doing so he passed beneath the baignoire of mademoiselle noemie she saw him as he approached and gave him a nod and smile which seemed meant as an assurance that she was still a goodnatured girl in spite of her enviable rise in the world newman passed into the foyer and walked through it suddenly he paused in front of a gentleman seated on one of the divans the gentlemans elbows were on his knees he was leaning forward and staring at the pavement lost apparently in meditations of a somewhat gloomy cast but in spite of his bent head newman recognized him and in a moment sat down beside him then the gentleman looked up and displayed the expressive countenance of valentin de bellegarde  what in the world are you thinking of so hard asked newman  a subject that requires hard thinking to do it justice said valentin my immeasurable idiocy  what is the matter now  the matter now is that i am a man again and no more a fool than usual but i came within an inch of taking that girl au serieux  you mean the young lady below stairs in a baignoire in a pink dress said newman  did you notice what a brilliant kind of pink it was valentin inquired by way of answer it makes her look as white as new milk  white or black as you please but you have stopped going to see her  oh bless you no why should i stop i have changed but she hasnt said valentin i see she is a vulgar little wretch after all but she is as amusing as ever and one must be amused  well i am glad she strikes you so unpleasantly newman rejoiced i suppose you have swallowed all those fine words you used about her the other night you compared her to a sapphire or a topaz or an amethystsome precious stone what was it  i dont remember said valentin it may have been to a carbuncle but she wont make a fool of me now she has no real charm its an awfully low thing to make a mistake about a person of that sort  i congratulate you newman declared upon the scales having fallen from your eyes its a great triumph it ought to make you feel better  yes it makes me feel better said valentin gayly then checking himself he looked askance at newman i rather think you are laughing at me if you were not one of the family i would take it up  oh no im not laughing any more than i am one of the family you make me feel badly you are too clever a fellow you are made of too good stuff to spend your time in ups and downs over that class of goods the idea of splitting hairs about miss nioche it seems to me awfully foolish you say you have given up taking her seriously but you take her seriously so long as you take her at all  valentin turned round in his place and looked a while at newman wrinkling his forehead and rubbing his knees vous parlez dor but she has wonderfully pretty arms would you believe i didnt know it till this evening  but she is a vulgar little wretch remember all the same said newman  yes the other day she had the bad taste to begin to abuse her father to his face in my presence i shouldnt have expected it of her it was a disappointment heigho  why she cares no more for her father than for her doormat said newman i discovered that the first time i saw her  oh thats another affair she may think of the poor old beggar what she pleases but it was low in her to call him bad names it quite threw me off it was about a frilled petticoat that he was to have fetched from the washerwomans he appeared to have neglected this graceful duty she almost boxed his ears he stood there staring at her with his little blank eyes and smoothing his old hat with his coattail at last he turned round and went out without a word then i told her it was in very bad taste to speak so to ones papa she said she should be so thankful to me if i would mention it to her whenever her taste was at fault she had immense confidence in mine i told her i couldnt have the bother of forming her manners i had had an idea they were already formed after the best models she had disappointed me but i shall get over it said valentin gayly  oh times a great consoler newman answered with humorous sobriety he was silent a moment and then he added in another tone i wish you would think of what i said to you the other day come over to america with us and i will put you in the way of doing some business you have a very good head if you will only use it  valentin made a genial grimace my head is much obliged to you do you mean the place in a bank  there are several places but i suppose you would consider the bank the most aristocratic  valentin burst into a laugh my dear fellow at night all cats are gray when one derogates there are no degrees  newman answered nothing for a minute then i think you will find there are degrees in success he said with a certain dryness  valentin had leaned forward again with his elbows on his knees and he was scratching the pavement with his stick at last he said looking up do you really think i ought to do something  newman laid his hand on his companions arm and looked at him a moment through sagaciouslynarrowed eyelids try it and see you are not good enough for it but we will stretch a point  do you really think i can make some money i should like to see how it feels to have a little  do what i tell you and you shall be rich said newman think of it and he looked at his watch and prepared to resume his way to madame de bellegardes box  upon my word i will think of it said valentin i will go and listen to mozart another half houri can always think better to musicand profoundly meditate upon it  the marquis was with his wife when newman entered their box he was bland remote and correct as usual or as it seemed to newman even more than usual  what do you think of the opera asked our hero what do you think of the don  we all know what mozart is said the marquis our impressions dont date from this evening mozart is youth freshness brilliancy facilitya little too great facility perhaps but the execution is here and there deplorably rough  i am very curious to see how it ends said newman  you speak as if it were a feuilleton in the figaro observed the marquis you have surely seen the opera before  never said newman i am sure i should have remembered it donna elvira reminds me of madame de cintre i dont mean in her circumstances but in the music she sings  it is a very nice distinction laughed the marquis lightly there is no great possibility i imagine of madame de cintre being forsaken  not much said newman but what becomes of the don  the devil comes downor comes up said madame de bellegarde and carries him off i suppose zerlina reminds you of me  i will go to the foyer for a few moments said the marquis and give you a chance to say that the commanderthe man of stoneresembles me and he passed out of the box  the little marquise stared an instant at the velvet ledge of the balcony and then murmured not a man of stone a man of wood newman had taken her husbands empty chair she made no protest and then she turned suddenly and laid her closed fan upon his arm i am very glad you came in she said i want to ask you a favor i wanted to do so on thursday at my motherinlaws ball but you would give me no chance you were in such very good spirits that i thought you might grant my little favor then not that you look particularly doleful now it is something you must promise me now is the time to take you after you are married you will be good for nothing come promise  i never sign a paper without reading it first said newman show me your document  no you must sign with your eyes shut i will hold your hand come before you put your head into the noose you ought to be thankful to me for giving you a chance to do something amusing  if it is so amusing said newman it will be in even better season after i am married  in other words cried madame de bellegarde you will not do it at all you will be afraid of your wife  oh if the thing is intrinsically improper said newman i wont go into it if it is not i will do it after my marriage  you talk like a treatise on logic and english logic into the bargain exclaimed madame de bellegarde promise then after you are married after all i shall enjoy keeping you to it  well then after i am married said newman serenely  the little marquise hesitated a moment looking at him and he wondered what was coming i suppose you know what my life is she presently said i have no pleasure i see nothing i do nothing i live in paris as i might live at poitiers my motherinlaw calls mewhat is the pretty worda gadabout accuses me of going to unheardof places and thinks it ought to be joy enough for me to sit at home and count over my ancestors on my fingers but why should i bother about my ancestors i am sure they never bothered about me i dont propose to live with a green shade on my eyes i hold that things were made to look at my husband you know has principles and the first on the list is that the tuileries are dreadfully vulgar if the tuileries are vulgar his principles are tiresome if i chose i might have principles quite as well as he if they grew on ones family tree i should only have to give mine a shake to bring down a shower of the finest at any rate i prefer clever bonapartes to stupid bourbons  oh i see you want to go to court said newman vaguely conjecturing that she might wish him to appeal to the united states legation to smooth her way to the imperial halls  the marquise gave a little sharp laugh you are a thousand miles away i will take care of the tuileries myself the day i decide to go they will be very glad to have me sooner or later i shall dance in an imperial quadrille i know what you are going to say how will you dare but i shall dare i am afraid of my husband he is soft smooth irreproachable everything that you know but i am afraid of himhorribly afraid of him and yet i shall arrive at the tuileries but that will not be this winter nor perhaps next and meantime i must live for the moment i want to go somewhere else its my dream i want to go to the bal bullier  to the bal bullier repeated newman for whom the words at first meant nothing  the ball in the latin quarter where the students dance with their mistresses dont tell me you have not heard of it  oh yes said newman i have heard of it i remember now i have even been there and you want to go there  it is silly it is low it is anything you please but i want to go some of my friends have been and they say it is awfully drole my friends go everywhere it is only i who sit moping at home  it seems to me you are not at home now said newman and i shouldnt exactly say you were moping  i am bored to death i have been to the opera twice a week for the last eight years whenever i ask for anything my mouth is stopped with that pray madam havent you an opera box could a woman of taste want more in the first place my opera box was down in my contrat they have to give it to me tonight for instance i should have preferred a thousand times to go to the palais royal but my husband wont go to the palais royal because the ladies of the court go there so much you may imagine then whether he would take me to bulliers he says it is a mere imitationand a bad oneof what they do at the princess kleinfusss but as i dont go to the princess kleinfusss the next best thing is to go to bulliers it is my dream at any rate its a fixed idea all i ask of you is to give me your arm you are less compromising than any one else i dont know why but you are i can arrange it i shall risk something but that is my own affair besides fortune favors the bold dont refuse me it is my dream  newman gave a loud laugh it seemed to him hardly worth while to be the wife of the marquis de bellegarde a daughter of the crusaders heiress of six centuries of glories and traditions to have centred ones aspirations upon the sight of a couple of hundred young ladies kicking off young mens hats it struck him as a theme for the moralist but he had no time to moralize upon it the curtain rose again m de bellegarde returned and newman went back to his seat  he observed that valentin de bellegarde had taken his place in the baignoire of mademoiselle nioche behind this young lady and her companion where he was visible only if one carefully looked for him in the next act newman met him in the lobby and asked him if he had reflected upon possible emigration if you really meant to meditate he said you might have chosen a better place for it  oh the place was not bad said valentin i was not thinking of that girl i listened to the music and without thinking of the play or looking at the stage i turned over your proposal at first it seemed quite fantastic and then a certain fiddle in the orchestrai could distinguish itbegan to say as it scraped away why not why not and then in that rapid movement all the fiddles took it up and the conductors stick seemed to beat it in the air why not why not im sure i cant say i dont see why not i dont see why i shouldnt do something it appears to me really a very bright idea this sort of thing is certainly very stale and then i could come back with a trunk full of dollars besides i might possibly find it amusing they call me a raffine who knows but that i might discover an unsuspected charm in shopkeeping it would really have a certain romantic picturesque side it would look well in my biography it would look as if i were a strong man a firstrate man a man who dominated circumstances  never mind how it would look said newman it always looks well to have half a million of dollars there is no reason why you shouldnt have them if you will mind what i tell youi aloneand not talk to other parties he passed his arm into that of his companion and the two walked for some time up and down one of the less frequented corridors newmans imagination began to glow with the idea of converting his bright impracticable friend into a firstclass man of business he felt for the moment a sort of spiritual zeal the zeal of the propagandist its ardor was in part the result of that general discomfort which the sight of all uninvested capital produced in him so fine an intelligence as bellegardes ought to be dedicated to high uses the highest uses known to newmans experience were certain transcendent sagacities in the handling of railway stock and then his zeal was quickened by his personal kindness for valentin he had a sort of pity for him which he was well aware he never could have made the comte de bellegarde understand he never lost a sense of its being pitiable that valentin should think it a large life to revolve in varnished boots between the rue danjou and the rue de luniversite taking the boulevard des italiens on the way when over there in america ones promenade was a continent and ones boulevard stretched from new york to san francisco it mortified him moreover to think that valentin lacked money there was a painful grotesqueness in it it affected him as the ignorance of a companion otherwise without reproach touching some rudimentary branch of learning would have done there were things that one knew about as a matter of course he would have said in such a case just so if one pretended to be easy in the world one had money as a matter of course one had made it there was something almost ridiculously anomalous to newman in the sight of lively pretensions unaccompanied by large investments in railroads though i may add that he would not have maintained that such investments were in themselves a proper ground for pretensions i will make you do something he said to valentin i will put you through i know half a dozen things in which we can make a place for you you will see some lively work it will take you a little while to get used to the life but you will work in before long and at the end of six monthsafter you have done a thing or two on your own accountyou will like it and then it will be very pleasant for you having your sister over there it will be pleasant for her to have you too yes valentin continued newman pressing his friends arm genially i think i see just the opening for you keep quiet and ill push you right in  newman pursued this favoring strain for some time longer the two men strolled about for a quarter of an hour valentin listened and questioned many of his questions making newman laugh loud at the naivete of his ignorance of the vulgar processes of moneygetting smiling himself too half ironical and half curious and yet he was serious he was fascinated by newmans plain prose version of the legend of el dorado it is true however that though to accept an opening in an american mercantile house might be a bold original and in its consequences extremely agreeable thing to do he did not quite see himself objectively doing it so that when the bell rang to indicate the close of the entracte there was a certain mockheroism in his saying with his brilliant smile well then put me through push me in i make myself over to you dip me into the pot and turn me into gold  they had passed into the corridor which encircled the row of baignoires and valentin stopped in front of the dusky little box in which mademoiselle nioche had bestowed herself laying his hand on the doorknob oh come are you going back there asked newman  mon dieu oui said valentin  havent you another place  yes i have my usual place in the stalls  you had better go and occupy it then  i see her very well from there too added valentin serenely and tonight she is worth seeing but he added in a moment i have a particular reason for going back just now  oh i give you up said newman you are infatuated  no it is only this there is a young man in the box whom i shall annoy by going in and i want to annoy him  i am sorry to hear it said newman cant you leave the poor fellow alone  no he has given me cause the box is not his noemie came in alone and installed herself i went and spoke to her and in a few moments she asked me to go and get her fan from the pocket of her cloak which the ouvreuse had carried off in my absence this gentleman came in and took the chair beside noemie in which i had been sitting my reappearance disgusted him and he had the grossness to show it he came within an ace of being impertinent i dont know who he is he is some vulgar wretch i cant think where she picks up such acquaintances he has been drinking too but he knows what he is about just now in the second act he was unmannerly again i shall put in another appearance for ten minutestime enough to give him an opportunity to commit himself if he feels inclined i really cant let the brute suppose that he is keeping me out of the box  my dear fellow said newman remonstrantly what childs play you are not going to pick a quarrel about that girl i hope  that girl has nothing to do with it and i have no intention of picking a quarrel i am not a bully nor a fireeater i simply wish to make a point that a gentleman must  oh damn your point said newman that is the trouble with you frenchmen you must be always making points well he added be short but if you are going in for this kind of thing we must ship you off to america in advance  very good valentin answered whenever you please but if i go to america i must not let this gentleman suppose that it is to run away from him  and they separated at the end of the act newman observed that valentin was still in the baignoire he strolled into the corridor again expecting to meet him and when he was within a few yards of mademoiselle nioches box saw his friend pass out accompanied by the young man who had been seated beside its fair occupant the two gentlemen walked with some quickness of step to a distant part of the lobby where newman perceived them stop and stand talking the manner of each was perfectly quiet but the stranger who looked flushed had begun to wipe his face very emphatically with his pockethandkerchief by this time newman was abreast of the baignoire the door had been left ajar and he could see a pink dress inside he immediately went in mademoiselle nioche turned and greeted him with a brilliant smile  ah you have at last decided to come and see me she exclaimed you just save your politeness you find me in a fine moment sit down there was a very becoming little flush in her cheek and her eye had a noticeable spark you would have said that she had received some very good news  something has happened here said newman without sitting down  you find me in a very fine moment she repeated two gentlemenone of them is m de bellegarde the pleasure of whose acquaintance i owe to youhave just had words about your humble servant very big words too they cant come off without crossing swords a duelthat will give me a push cried mademoiselle noemie clapping her little hands cest ca qui pose une femme  you dont mean to say that bellegarde is going to fight about you exclaimed newman disgustedly  nothing else and she looked at him with a hard little smile no no you are not galant and if you prevent this affair i shall owe you a grudgeand pay my debt  newman uttered an imprecation which though briefit consisted simply of the interjection oh followed by a geographical or more correctly perhaps a theological noun in four lettershad better not be transferred to these pages he turned his back without more ceremony upon the pink dress and went out of the box in the corridor he found valentin and his companion walking towards him the latter was thrusting a card into his waistcoat pocket mademoiselle noemies jealous votary was a tall robust young man with a thick nose a prominent blue eye a germanic physiognomy and a massive watchchain when they reached the box valentin with an emphasized bow made way for him to pass in first newman touched valentins arm as a sign that he wished to speak with him and bellegarde answered that he would be with him in an instant valentin entered the box after the robust young man but a couple of minutes afterwards he reappeared largely smiling  she is immensely tickled he said she says we will make her fortune i dont want to be fatuous but i think it is very possible  so you are going to fight said newman  my dear fellow dont look so mortally disgusted it was not my choice the thing is all arranged  i told you so groaned newman  i told him so said valentin smiling  what did he do to you  my good friend it doesnt matter what he used an expressioni took it up  but i insist upon knowing i cant as your elder brother have you rushing into this sort of nonsense  i am very much obliged to you said valentin i have nothing to conceal but i cant go into particulars now and here  we will leave this place then you can tell me outside  oh no i cant leave this place why should i hurry away i will go to my orchestrastall and sit out the opera  you will not enjoy it you will be preoccupied  valentin looked at him a moment colored a little smiled and patted him on the arm you are delightfully simple before an affair a man is quiet the quietest thing i can do is to go straight to my place  ah said newman you want her to see you thereyou and your quietness i am not so simple it is a poor business  valentin remained and the two men in their respective places sat out the rest of the performance which was also enjoyed by mademoiselle nioche and her truculent admirer at the end newman joined valentin again and they went into the street together valentin shook his head at his friends proposal that he should get into newmans own vehicle and stopped on the edge of the pavement i must go off alone he said i must look up a couple of friends who will take charge of this matter  i will take charge of it newman declared put it into my hands  you are very kind but that is hardly possible in the first place you are as you said just now almost my brother you are about to marry my sister that alone disqualifies you it casts doubts on your impartiality and if it didnt it would be enough for me that i strongly suspect you of disapproving of the affair you would try to prevent a meeting  of course i should said newman whoever your friends are i hope they will do that  unquestionably they will they will urge that excuses be made proper excuses but you would be too goodnatured you wont do  newman was silent a moment he was keenly annoyed but he saw it was useless to attempt interference when is this precious performance to come off he asked  the sooner the better said valentin the day after tomorrow i hope  well said newman i have certainly a claim to know the facts i cant consent to shut my eyes to the matter  i shall be most happy to tell you the facts said valentin they are very simple and it will be quickly done but now everything depends on my putting my hands on my friends without delay i will jump into a cab you had better drive to my room and wait for me there i will turn up at the end of an hour  newman assented protestingly let his friend go and then betook himself to the picturesque little apartment in the rue danjou it was more than an hour before valentin returned but when he did so he was able to announce that he had found one of his desired friends and that this gentleman had taken upon himself the care of securing an associate newman had been sitting without lights by valentins faded fire upon which he had thrown a log the blaze played over the richlyencumbered little sittingroom and produced fantastic gleams and shadows he listened in silence to valentins account of what had passed between him and the gentleman whose card he had in his pocketm stanislas kapp of strasbourgafter his return to mademoiselle nioches box this hospitable young lady had espied an acquaintance on the other side of the house and had expressed her displeasure at his not having the civility to come and pay her a visit oh let him alone m stanislas kapp had hereupon exclaimed there are too many people in the box already and he had fixed his eyes with a demonstrative stare upon m de bellegarde valentin had promptly retorted that if there were too many people in the box it was easy for m kapp to diminish the number i shall be most happy to open the door for you m kapp exclaimed i shall be delighted to fling you into the pit valentin had answered oh do make a rumpus and get into the papers miss noemie had gleefully ejaculated m kapp turn him out or m de bellegarde pitch him into the pit into the orchestraanywhere i dont care who does which so long as you make a scene valentin answered that they would make no scene but that the gentleman would be so good as to step into the corridor with him in the corridor after a brief further exchange of words there had been an exchange of cards m stanislas kapp was very stiff he evidently meant to force his offence home  the man no doubt was insolent newman said but if you hadnt gone back into the box the thing wouldnt have happened  why dont you see valentin replied that the event proves the extreme propriety of my going back into the box m kapp wished to provoke me he was awaiting his chance in such a casethat is when he has been so to speak notifieda man must be on hand to receive the provocation my not returning would simply have been tantamount to my saying to m stanislas kapp oh if you are going to be disagreeable  you must manage it by yourself damned if ill help you that would have been a thoroughly sensible thing to say the only attraction for you seems to have been the prospect of m kapps impertinence newman went on you told me you were not going back for that girl  oh dont mention that girl any more murmured valentin shes a bore  with all my heart but if that is the way you feel about her why couldnt you let her alone  valentin shook his head with a fine smile i dont think you quite understand and i dont believe i can make you she understood the situation she knew what was in the air she was watching us  a cat may look at a king what difference does that make  why a man cant back down before a woman  i dont call her a woman you said yourself she was a stone cried newman  well valentin rejoined there is no disputing about tastes its a matter of feeling its measured by ones sense of honor  oh confound your sense of honor cried newman  it is vain talking said valentin words have passed and the thing is settled  newman turned away taking his hat then pausing with his hand on the door what are you going to use he asked  that is for m stanislas kapp as the challenged party to decide my own choice would be a short light sword i handle it well im an indifferent shot  newman had put on his hat he pushed it back gently scratching his forehead high up i wish it were pistols he said i could show you how to lodge a bullet  valentin broke into a laugh what is it some english poet says about consistency its a flower or a star or a jewel yours has the beauty of all three but he agreed to see newman again on the morrow after the details of his meeting with m stanislas kapp should have been arranged  in the course of the day newman received three lines from him saying that it had been decided that he should cross the frontier with his adversary and that he was to take the night express to geneva he should have time however to dine with newman in the afternoon newman called upon madame de cintre but his visit was brief she was as gracious and sympathetic as he had ever found her but she was sad and she confessed on newmans charging her with her red eyes that she had been crying valentin had been with her a couple of hours before and his visit had left her with a painful impression he had laughed and gossiped he had brought her no bad news he had only been in his manner rather more affectionate than usual his fraternal tenderness had touched her and on his departure she had burst into tears she had felt as if something strange and sad were going to happen she had tried to reason away the fancy and the effort had only given her a headache newman of course was perforce tonguetied about valentins projected duel and his dramatic talent was not equal to satirizing madame de cintres presentiment as pointedly as perfect security demanded before he went away he asked madame de cintre whether valentin had seen his mother  yes she said but he didnt make her cry  it was in newmans own apartment that valentin dined having brought his portmanteau so that he might adjourn directly to the railway m stanislas kapp had positively declined to make excuses and he on his side obviously had none to offer valentin had found out with whom he was dealing m stanislas kapp was the son of and heir of a rich brewer of strasbourg a youth of a sanguineousand sanguinarytemperament he was making ducks and drakes of the paternal brewery and although he passed in a general way for a good fellow he had already been observed to be quarrelsome after dinner que voulezvous said valentin brought up on beer he cant stand champagne he had chosen pistols valentin at dinner had an excellent appetite he made a point in view of his long journey of eating more than usual he took the liberty of suggesting to newman a slight modification in the composition of a certain fishsauce he thought it would be worth mentioning to the cook but newman had no thoughts for fishsauce he felt thoroughly discontented as he sat and watched his amiable and clever companion going through his excellent repast with the delicate deliberation of hereditary epicurism the folly of so charming a fellow traveling off to expose his agreeable young life for the sake of m stanislas and mademoiselle noemie struck him with intolerable force he had grown fond of valentin he felt now how fond and his sense of helplessness only increased his irritation  well this sort of thing may be all very well he cried at last but i declare i dont see it i cant stop you perhaps but at least i can protest i do protest violently  my dear fellow dont make a scene said valentin scenes in these cases are in very bad taste  your duel itself is a scene said newman thats all it is its a wretched theatrical affair why dont you take a band of music with you outright its dd barbarous and its dd corrupt both  oh i cant begin at this time of day to defend the theory of dueling said valentin it is our custom and i think it is a good thing quite apart from the goodness of the cause in which a duel may be fought it has a kind of picturesque charm which in this age of vile prose seems to me greatly to recommend it its a remnant of a highertempered time one ought to cling to it depend upon it a duel is never amiss  i dont know what you mean by a highertempered time said newman because your greatgrandfather was an ass is that any reason why you should be for my part i think we had better let our temper take care of itself it generally seems to me quite high enough i am not afraid of being too meek if your greatgrandfather were to make himself unpleasant to me i think i could manage him yet  my dear friend said valentin smiling you cant invent anything that will take the place of satisfaction for an insult to demand it and to give it are equally excellent arrangements  do you call this sort of thing satisfaction newman asked does it satisfy you to receive a present of the carcass of that coarse fop does it gratify you to make him a present of yours if a man hits you hit him back if a man libels you haul him up  haul him up into court oh that is very nasty said valentin  the nastiness is hisnot yours and for that matter what you are doing is not particularly nice you are too good for it i dont say you are the most useful man in the world or the cleverest or the most amiable but you are too good to go and get your throat cut for a prostitute  valentin flushed a little but he laughed i shant get my throat cut if i can help it moreover ones honor hasnt two different measures it only knows that it is hurt it doesnt ask when or how or where  the more fool it is said newman  valentin ceased to laugh he looked grave i beg you not to say any more he said if you do i shall almost fancy you dont care aboutaboutand he paused  about what  about that matterabout ones honor  fancy what you please said newman fancy while you are at it that i care about youthough you are not worth it but come back without damage he added in a moment and i will forgive you and then he continued as valentin was going i will ship you straight off to america  well answered valentin if i am to turn over a new page this may figure as a tailpiece to the old and then he lit another cigar and departed  blast that girl said newman as the door closed upon valentin    chapter xviii   newman went the next morning to see madame de cintre timing his visit so as to arrive after the noonday breakfast in the court of the hotel before the portico stood madame de bellegardes old square carriage the servant who opened the door answered newmans inquiry with a slightly embarrassed and hesitating murmur and at the same moment mrs bread appeared in the background dimvisaged as usual and wearing a large black bonnet and shawl  what is the matter asked newman is madame la comtesse at home or not  mrs bread advanced fixing her eyes upon him he observed that she held a sealed letter very delicately in her fingers the countess has left a message for you sir she has left this said mrs bread holding out the letter which newman took  left it is she out is she gone away  she is going away sir she is leaving town said mrs bread  leaving town exclaimed newman what has happened  it is not for me to say sir said mrs bread with her eyes on the ground but i thought it would come  what would come pray newman demanded he had broken the seal of the letter but he still questioned she is in the house she is visible  i dont think she expected you this morning the old waitingwoman replied she was to leave immediately  where is she going  to fleurieres  to fleurieres but surely i can see her  mrs bread hesitated a moment and then clasping together her two hands i will take you she said and she led the way upstairs at the top of the staircase she paused and fixed her dry sad eyes upon newman be very easy with her she said she is most unhappy then she went on to madame de cintres apartment newman perplexed and alarmed followed her rapidly mrs bread threw open the door and newman pushed back the curtain at the farther side of its deep embrasure in the middle of the room stood madame de cintre her face was pale and she was dressed for traveling behind her before the fireplace stood urbain de bellegarde looking at his fingernails near the marquis sat his mother buried in an armchair and with her eyes immediately fixing themselves upon newman he felt as soon as he entered the room that he was in the presence of something evil he was startled and pained as he would have been by a threatening cry in the stillness of the night he walked straight to madame de cintre and seized her by the hand  what is the matter he asked commandingly what is happening  urbain de bellegarde stared then left his place and came and leaned upon his mothers chair behind newmans sudden irruption had evidently discomposed both mother and son madame de cintre stood silent with her eyes resting upon newmans she had often looked at him with all her soul as it seemed to him but in this present gaze there was a sort of bottomless depth she was in distress it was the most touching thing he had ever seen his heart rose into his throat and he was on the point of turning to her companions with an angry challenge but she checked him pressing the hand that held her own  something very grave has happened she said i cannot marry you  newman dropped her hand and stood staring first at her and then at the others why not he asked as quietly as possible  madame de cintre almost smiled but the attempt was strange you must ask my mother you must ask my brother  why cant she marry me said newman looking at them  madame de bellegarde did not move in her place but she was as pale as her daughter the marquis looked down at her she said nothing for some moments but she kept her keen clear eyes upon newman bravely the marquis drew himself up and looked at the ceiling its impossible he said softly  its improper said madame de bellegarde  newman began to laugh oh you are fooling he exclaimed  my sister you have no time you are losing your train said the marquis  come is he mad asked newman  no dont think that said madame de cintre but i am going away  where are you going  to the country to fleurieres to be alone  to leave me said newman slowly  i cant see you now said madame de cintre  nowwhy not  i am ashamed said madame de cintre simply  newman turned toward the marquis what have you done to herwhat does it mean he asked with the same effort at calmness the fruit of his constant practice in taking things easily he was excited but excitement with him was only an intenser deliberateness it was the swimmer stripped  it means that i have given you up said madame de cintre it means that  her face was too charged with tragic expression not fully to confirm her words newman was profoundly shocked but he felt as yet no resentment against her he was amazed bewildered and the presence of the old marquise and her son seemed to smite his eyes like the glare of a watchmans lantern cant i see you alone he asked  it would be only more painful i hoped i should not see youi should escape i wrote to you goodby and she put out her hand again  newman put both his own into his pockets i will go with you he said  she laid her two hands on his arm will you grant me a last request and as she looked at him urging this her eyes filled with tears let me go alonelet me go in peace i cant call it peaceits death but let me bury myself sogoodby  newman passed his hand into his hair and stood slowly rubbing his head and looking through his keenlynarrowed eyes from one to the other of the three persons before him his lips were compressed and the two lines which had formed themselves beside his mouth might have made it appear at a first glance that he was smiling i have said that his excitement was an intenser deliberateness and now he looked grimly deliberate it seems very much as if you had interfered marquis he said slowly i thought you said you wouldnt interfere i know you dont like me but that doesnt make any difference i thought you promised me you wouldnt interfere i thought you swore on your honor that you wouldnt interfere dont you remember marquis  the marquis lifted his eyebrows but he was apparently determined to be even more urbane than usual he rested his two hands upon the back of his mothers chair and bent forward as if he were leaning over the edge of a pulpit or a lecturedesk he did not smile but he looked softly grave excuse me sir he said i assured you that i would not influence my sisters decision i adhered to the letter to my engagement did i not sister  dont appeal my son said the marquise your word is sufficient  yesshe accepted me said newman that is very true i cant deny that at least he added in a different tone turning to madame de cintre you did accept me  something in the tone seemed to move her strongly she turned away burying her face in her hands  but you have interfered now havent you inquired newman of the marquis  neither then nor now have i attempted to influence my sister i used no persuasion then i have used no persuasion today  and what have you used  we have used authority said madame de bellegarde in a rich belllike voice  ah you have used authority newman exclaimed they have used authority he went on turning to madame de cintre what is it how did they use it  my mother commanded said madame de cintre  commanded you to give me upi see and you obeyi see but why do you obey asked newman  madame de cintre looked across at the old marquise her eyes slowly measured her from head to foot i am afraid of my mother she said  madame de bellegarde rose with a certain quickness crying this is a most indecent scene  i have no wish to prolong it said madame de cintre and turning to the door she put out her hand again if you can pity me a little let me go alone  newman shook her hand quietly and firmly ill come down there he said the portiere dropped behind her and newman sank with a long breath into the nearest chair he leaned back in it resting his hands on the knobs of the arms and looking at madame de bellegarde and urbain there was a long silence they stood side by side with their heads high and their handsome eyebrows arched  so you make a distinction newman said at last you make a distinction between persuading and commanding its very neat but the distinction is in favor of commanding that rather spoils it  we have not the least objection to defining our position said m de bellegarde we understand that it should not at first appear to you quite clear we rather expected indeed that you should not do us justice  oh ill do you justice said newman dont be afraid please proceed  the marquise laid her hand on her sons arm as if to deprecate the attempt to define their position it is quite useless she said to try and arrange this matter so as to make it agreeable to you it can never be agreeable to you it is a disappointment and disappointments are unpleasant i thought it over carefully and tried to arrange it better but i only gave myself a headache and lost my sleep say what we will you will think yourself illtreated and you will publish your wrongs among your friends but we are not afraid of that besides your friends are not our friends and it will not matter think of us as you please i only beg you not to be violent i have never in my life been present at a violent scene of any kind and at my age i cant be expected to begin  is that all you have got to say asked newman slowly rising out of his chair thats a poor show for a clever lady like you marquise come try again  my mother goes to the point with her usual honesty and intrepidity said the marquis toying with his watchguard but it is perhaps well to say a little more we of course quite repudiate the charge of having broken faith with you we left you entirely at liberty to make yourself agreeable to my sister we left her quite at liberty to entertain your proposal when she accepted you we said nothing we therefore quite observed our promise it was only at a later stage of the affair and on quite a different basis as it were that we determined to speak it would have been better perhaps if we had spoken before but really you see nothing has yet been done  nothing has yet been done newman repeated the words unconscious of their comical effect he had lost the sense of what the marquis was saying m de bellegardes superior style was a mere humming in his ears all that he understood in his deep and simple indignation was that the matter was not a violent joke and that the people before him were perfectly serious do you suppose i can take this he asked do you suppose it can matter to me what you say do you suppose i can seriously listen to you you are simply crazy  madame de bellegarde gave a rap with her fan in the palm of her hand if you dont take it you can leave it sir it matters very little what you do my daughter has given you up  she doesnt mean it newman declared after a moment  i think i can assure you that she does said the marquis  poor woman what damnable thing have you done to her cried newman  gently gently murmured m de bellegarde  she told you said the old lady i commanded her  newman shook his head heavily this sort of thing cant be you know he said a man cant be used in this fashion you have got no right you have got no power  my power said madame de bellegarde is in my childrens obedience  in their fear your daughter said there is something very strange in it why should your daughter be afraid of you added newman after looking a moment at the old lady there is some foul play  the marquise met his gaze without flinching and as if she did not hear or heed what he said i did my best she said quietly i could endure it no longer  it was a bold experiment said the marquis  newman felt disposed to walk to him clutch his neck with his fingers and press his windpipe with his thumb i neednt tell you how you strike me he said of course you know that but i should think you would be afraid of your friendsall those people you introduced me to the other night there were some very nice people among them you may depend upon it there were some honest men and women  our friends approve us said m de bellegarde there is not a family among them that would have acted otherwise and however that may be we take the cue from no one the bellegardes have been used to set the example not to wait for it  you would have waited long before any one would have set you such an example as this exclaimed newman have i done anything wrong he demanded have i given you reason to change your opinion have you found out anything against me i cant imagine  our opinion said madame de bellegarde is quite the same as at firstexactly we have no illwill towards yourself we are very far from accusing you of misconduct since your relations with us began you have been i frankly confess lessless peculiar than i expected it is not your disposition that we object to it is your antecedents we really cannot reconcile ourselves to a commercial person we fancied in an evil hour that we could it was a great misfortune we determined to persevere to the end and to give you every advantage i was resolved that you should have no reason to accuse me of want of loyalty we let the thing certainly go very far we introduced you to our friends to tell the truth it was that i think that broke me down i succumbed to the scene that took place on thursday night in these rooms you must excuse me if what i say is disagreeable to you but we cannot release ourselves without an explanation  there can be no better proof of our good faith said the marquis than our committing ourselves to you in the eyes of the world the other evening we endeavored to bind ourselvesto tie our hands as it were  but it was that added his mother that opened our eyes and broke our bonds we should have been most uncomfortable you know she added in a moment that you were forewarned i told you we were very proud  newman took up his hat and began mechanically to smooth it the very fierceness of his scorn kept him from speaking you are not proud enough he observed at last  in all this matter said the marquis smiling i really see nothing but our humility  let us have no more discussion than is necessary resumed madame de bellegarde my daughter told you everything when she said she gave you up  i am not satisfied about your daughter said newman i want to know what you did to her it is all very easy talking about authority and saying you commanded her she didnt accept me blindly and she wouldnt have given me up blindly not that i believe yet she has really given me up she will talk it over with me but you have frightened her you have bullied her you have hurt her what was it you did to her  i did very little said madame de bellegarde in a tone which gave newman a chill when he afterwards remembered it  let me remind you that we offered you these explanations the marquis observed with the express understanding that you should abstain from violence of language  i am not violent newman answered it is you who are violent but i dont know that i have much more to say to you what you expect of me apparently is to go my way thanking you for favors received and promising never to trouble you again  we expect of you to act like a clever man said madame de bellegarde you have shown yourself that already and what we have done is altogether based upon your being so when one must submit one must since my daughter absolutely withdraws what will be the use of your making a noise  it remains to be seen whether your daughter absolutely withdraws your daughter and i are still very good friends nothing is changed in that as i say i will talk it over with her  that will be of no use said the old lady i know my daughter well enough to know that words spoken as she just now spoke to you are final besides she has promised me  i have no doubt her promise is worth a great deal more than your own said newman nevertheless i dont give her up  just as you please but if she wont even see youand she wontyour constancy must remain purely platonic  poor newman was feigning a greater confidence than he felt madame de cintres strange intensity had in fact struck a chill to his heart her face still impressed upon his vision had been a terribly vivid image of renunciation he felt sick and suddenly helpless he turned away and stood for a moment with his hand on the door then he faced about and after the briefest hesitation broke out with a different accent come think of what this must be to me and let her alone why should you object to me sowhats the matter with me i cant hurt you i wouldnt if i could im the most unobjectionable fellow in the world what if i am a commercial person what under the sun do you mean a commercial person i will be any sort of a person you want i never talked to you about business let her go and i will ask no questions i will take her away and you shall never see me or hear of me again i will stay in america if you like ill sign a paper promising never to come back to europe all i want is not to lose her  madame de bellegarde and her son exchanged a glance of lucid irony and urbain said my dear sir what you propose is hardly an improvement we have not the slightest objection to seeing you as an amiable foreigner and we have every reason for not wishing to be eternally separated from my sister we object to the marriage and in that way and m de bellegarde gave a small thin laugh she would be more married than ever  well then said newman where is this place of yoursfleurieres i know it is near some old city on a hill  precisely poitiers is on a hill said madame de bellegarde i dont know how old it is we are not afraid to tell you  it is poitiers is it very good said newman i shall immediately follow madame de cintre  the trains after this hour wont serve you said urbain  i shall hire a special train  that will be a very silly waste of money said madame de bellegarde  it will be time enough to talk about waste three days hence newman answered and clapping his hat on his head he departed  he did not immediately start for fleurieres he was too stunned and wounded for consecutive action he simply walked he walked straight before him following the river till he got out of the enceinte of paris he had a burning tingling sense of personal outrage he had never in his life received so absolute a check he had never been pulled up or as he would have said let down so short and he found the sensation intolerable he strode along tapping the trees and lampposts fiercely with his stick and inwardly raging to lose madame de cintre after he had taken such jubilant and triumphant possession of her was as great an affront to his pride as it was an injury to his happiness and to lose her by the interference and the dictation of others by an impudent old woman and a pretentious fop stepping in with their authority it was too preposterous it was too pitiful upon what he deemed the unblushing treachery of the bellegardes newman wasted little thought he consigned it once for all to eternal perdition but the treachery of madame de cintre herself amazed and confounded him there was a key to the mystery of course but he groped for it in vain only three days had elapsed since she stood beside him in the starlight beautiful and tranquil as the trust with which he had inspired her and told him that she was happy in the prospect of their marriage what was the meaning of the change of what infernal potion had she tasted poor newman had a terrible apprehension that she had really changed his very admiration for her attached the idea of force and weight to her rupture but he did not rail at her as false for he was sure she was unhappy in his walk he had crossed one of the bridges of the seine and he still followed unheedingly the long unbroken quay he had left paris behind him and he was almost in the country he was in the pleasant suburb of auteuil he stopped at last looked around him without seeing or caring for its pleasantness and then slowly turned and at a slower pace retraced his steps when he came abreast of the fantastic embankment known as the trocadero he reflected through his throbbing pain that he was near mrs tristrams dwelling and that mrs tristram on particular occasions had much of a womans kindness in her utterance he felt that he needed to pour out his ire and he took the road to her house mrs tristram was at home and alone and as soon as she had looked at him on his entering the room she told him that she knew what he had come for newman sat down heavily in silence looking at her  they have backed out she said well you may think it strange but i felt something the other night in the air presently he told her his story she listened with her eyes fixed on him when he had finished she said quietly they want her to marry lord deepmere newman stared he did not know that she knew anything about lord deepmere but i dont think she will mrs tristram added  she marry that poor little cub cried newman oh lord and yet why did she refuse me  but that isnt the only thing said mrs tristram they really couldnt endure you any longer they had overrated their courage i must say to give the devil his due that there is something rather fine in that it was your commercial quality in the abstract they couldnt swallow that is really aristocratic they wanted your money but they have given you up for an idea  newman frowned most ruefully and took up his hat again i thought you would encourage me he said with almost childlike sadness  excuse me she answered very gently i feel none the less sorry for you especially as i am at the bottom of your troubles i have not forgotten that i suggested the marriage to you i dont believe that madame de cintre has any intention of marrying lord deepmere it is true he is not younger than she as he looks he is thirtythree years old i looked in the peerage but noi cant believe her so horribly cruelly false  please say nothing against her said newman  poor woman she is cruel but of course you will go after her and you will plead powerfully do you know that as you are now mrs tristram pursued with characteristic audacity of comment you are extremely eloquent even without speaking to resist you a woman must have a very fixed idea in her head i wish i had done you a wrong that you might come to me in that fine fashion but go to madame de cintre at any rate and tell her that she is a puzzle even to me i am very curious to see how far family discipline will go  newman sat a while longer leaning his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands and mrs tristram continued to temper charity with philosophy and compassion with criticism at last she inquired and what does the count valentin say to it newman started he had not thought of valentin and his errand on the swiss frontier since the morning the reflection made him restless again and he took his leave he went straight to his apartment where upon the table of the vestibule he found a telegram it ran with the date and place as follows i am seriously ill please to come to me as soon as possible v b newman groaned at this miserable news and at the necessity of deferring his journey to the chateau de fleurieres but he wrote to madame de cintre these few lines they were all he had time for  i dont give you up and i dont really believe you give me up i dont understand it but we shall clear it up together i cant follow you today as i am called to see a friend at a distance who is very ill perhaps dying but i shall come to you as soon as i can leave my friend why shouldnt i say that he is your brother c n  after this he had only time to catch the night express to geneva    chapter xix   newman possessed a remarkable talent for sitting still when it was necessary and he had an opportunity to use it on his journey to switzerland the successive hours of the night brought him no sleep but he sat motionless in his corner of the railwaycarriage with his eyes closed and the most observant of his fellowtravelers might have envied him his apparent slumber toward morning slumber really came as an effect of mental rather than of physical fatigue he slept for a couple of hours and at last waking found his eyes resting upon one of the snowpowdered peaks of the jura behind which the sky was just reddening with the dawn but he saw neither the cold mountain nor the warm sky his consciousness began to throb again on the very instant with a sense of his wrong he got out of the train half an hour before it reached geneva in the cold morning twilight at the station indicated in valentins telegram a drowsy stationmaster was on the platform with a lantern and the hood of his overcoat over his head and near him stood a gentleman who advanced to meet newman this personage was a man of forty with a tall lean figure a sallow face a dark eye a neat mustache and a pair of fresh gloves he took off his hat looking very grave and pronounced newmans name our hero assented and said you are m de bellegardes friend  i unite with you in claiming that sad honor said the gentleman i had placed myself at m de bellegardes service in this melancholy affair together with m de grosjoyaux who is now at his bedside m de grosjoyaux i believe has had the honor of meeting you in paris but as he is a better nurse than i he remained with our poor friend bellegarde has been eagerly expecting you  and how is bellegarde said newman he was badly hit  the doctor has condemned him we brought a surgeon with us but he will die in the best sentiments i sent last evening for the cure of the nearest french village who spent an hour with him the cure was quite satisfied  heaven forgive us groaned newman i would rather the doctor were satisfied and can he see meshall he know me  when i left him half an hour ago he had fallen asleep after a feverish wakeful night but we shall see and newmans companion proceeded to lead the way out of the station to the village explaining as he went that the little party was lodged in the humblest of swiss inns where however they had succeeded in making m de bellegarde much more comfortable than could at first have been expected we are old companions in arms said valentins second it is not the first time that one of us has helped the other to lie easily it is a very nasty wound and the nastiest thing about it is that bellegardes adversary was not shot he put his bullet where he could it took it into its head to walk straight into bellegardes left side just below the heart  as they picked their way in the gray deceptive dawn between the manureheaps of the village street newmans new acquaintance narrated the particulars of the duel the conditions of the meeting had been that if the first exchange of shots should fail to satisfy one of the two gentlemen a second should take place valentins first bullet had done exactly what newmans companion was convinced he had intended it to do it had grazed the arm of m stanislas kapp just scratching the flesh m kapps own projectile meanwhile had passed at ten good inches from the person of valentin the representatives of m stanislas had demanded another shot which was granted valentin had then fired aside and the young alsatian had done effective execution i saw when we met him on the ground said newmans informant that he was not going to be commode it is a kind of bovine temperament valentin had immediately been installed at the inn and m stanislas and his friends had withdrawn to regions unknown the police authorities of the canton had waited upon the party at the inn had been extremely majestic and had drawn up a long procesverbal but it was probable that they would wink at so very gentlemanly a bit of bloodshed newman asked whether a message had not been sent to valentins family and learned that up to a late hour on the preceding evening valentin had opposed it he had refused to believe his wound was dangerous but after his interview with the cure he had consented and a telegram had been dispatched to his mother but the marquise had better hurry said newmans conductor  well its an abominable affair said newman thats all i have to say to say this at least in a tone of infinite disgust was an irresistible need  ah you dont approve questioned his conductor with curious urbanity  approve cried newman i wish that when i had him there night before last i had locked him up in my cabinet de toilette  valentins late second opened his eyes and shook his head up and down two or three times gravely with a little flutelike whistle but they had reached the inn and a stout maidservant in a nightcap was at the door with a lantern to take newmans travelingbag from the porter who trudged behind him valentin was lodged on the groundfloor at the back of the house and newmans companion went along a stonefaced passage and softly opened a door then he beckoned to newman who advanced and looked into the room which was lighted by a single shaded candle beside the fire sat m de grosjoyaux asleep in his dressinggowna little plump fair man whom newman had seen several times in valentins company on the bed lay valentin pale and still with his eyes closeda figure very shocking to newman who had seen it hitherto awake to its finger tips m de grosjoyauxs colleague pointed to an open door beyond and whispered that the doctor was within keeping guard so long as valentin slept or seemed to sleep of course newman could not approach him so our hero withdrew for the present committing himself to the care of the halfwaked bonne she took him to a room abovestairs and introduced him to a bed on which a magnified bolster in yellow calico figured as a counterpane newman lay down and in spite of his counterpane slept for three or four hours when he awoke the morning was advanced and the sun was filling his window and he heard outside of it the clucking of hens while he was dressing there came to his door a messenger from m de grosjoyaux and his companion proposing that he should breakfast with them presently he went downstairs to the little stonepaved diningroom where the maidservant who had taken off her nightcap was serving the repast m de grosjoyaux was there surprisingly fresh for a gentleman who had been playing sicknurse half the night rubbing his hands and watching the breakfast table attentively newman renewed acquaintance with him and learned that valentin was still sleeping the surgeon who had had a fairly tranquil night was at present sitting with him before m de grosjoyauxs associate reappeared newman learned that his name was m ledoux and that bellegardes acquaintance with him dated from the days when they served together in the pontifical zouaves m ledoux was the nephew of a distinguished ultramontane bishop at last the bishops nephew came in with a toilet in which an ingenious attempt at harmony with the peculiar situation was visible and with a gravity tempered by a decent deference to the best breakfast that the croix helvetique had ever set forth valentins servant who was allowed only in scanty measure the honor of watching with his master had been lending a light parisian hand in the kitchen the two frenchmen did their best to prove that if circumstances might overshadow they could not really obscure the national talent for conversation and m ledoux delivered a neat little eulogy on poor bellegarde whom he pronounced the most charming englishman he had ever known  do you call him an englishman newman asked  m ledoux smiled a moment and then made an epigram cest plus quun anglaiscest un anglomane newman said soberly that he had never noticed it and m de grosjoyaux remarked that it was really too soon to deliver a funeral oration upon poor bellegarde evidently said m ledoux but i couldnt help observing this morning to mr newman that when a man has taken such excellent measures for his salvation as our dear friend did last evening it seems almost a pity he should put it in peril again by returning to the world m ledoux was a great catholic and newman thought him a queer mixture his countenance by daylight had a sort of amiably saturnine cast he had a very large thin nose and looked like a spanish picture he appeared to think dueling a very perfect arrangement provided if one should get hit one could promptly see the priest he seemed to take a great satisfaction in valentins interview with the cure and yet his conversation did not at all indicate a sanctimonious habit of mind m ledoux had evidently a high sense of the becoming and was prepared to be urbane and tasteful on all points he was always furnished with a smile which pushed his mustache up under his nose and an explanation savoirvivreknowing how to livewas his specialty in which he included knowing how to die but as newman reflected with a good deal of dumb irritation he seemed disposed to delegate to others the application of his learning on this latter point m de grosjoyaux was of quite another complexion and appeared to regard his friends theological unction as the sign of an inaccessibly superior mind he was evidently doing his utmost with a kind of jovial tenderness to make life agreeable to valentin to the last and help him as little as possible to miss the boulevard des italiens but what chiefly occupied his mind was the mystery of a bungling brewers son making so neat a shot he himself could snuff a candle etc and yet he confessed that he could not have done better than this he hastened to add that on the present occasion he would have made a point of not doing so well it was not an occasion for that sort of murderous work que diable he would have picked out some quiet fleshy spot and just tapped it with a harmless ball m stanislas kapp had been deplorably heavyhanded but really when the world had come to that pass that one granted a meeting to a brewers son this was m de grosjoyauxs nearest approach to a generalization he kept looking through the window over the shoulder of m ledoux at a slender tree which stood at the end of a lane opposite to the inn and seemed to be measuring its distance from his extended arm and secretly wishing that since the subject had been introduced propriety did not forbid a little speculative pistolpractice  newman was in no humor to enjoy good company he could neither eat nor talk his soul was sore with grief and anger and the weight of his double sorrow was intolerable he sat with his eyes fixed upon his plate counting the minutes wishing at one moment that valentin would see him and leave him free to go in quest of madame de cintre and his lost happiness and mentally calling himself a vile brute the next for the impatient egotism of the wish he was very poor company himself and even his acute preoccupation and his general lack of the habit of pondering the impression he produced did not prevent him from reflecting that his companions must be puzzled to see how poor bellegarde came to take such a fancy to this taciturn yankee that he must needs have him at his deathbed after breakfast he strolled forth alone into the village and looked at the fountain the geese the open barn doors the brown bent old women showing their hugely darned stockingheels at the ends of their slowlyclicking sabots and the beautiful view of snowy alps and purple jura at either end of the little street the day was brilliant early spring was in the air and in the sunshine and the winters damp was trickling out of the cottage eaves it was birth and brightness for all nature even for chirping chickens and waddling goslings and it was to be death and burial for poor foolish generous delightful bellegarde newman walked as far as the village church and went into the small graveyard beside it where he sat down and looked at the awkward tablets which were planted around they were all sordid and hideous and newman could feel nothing but the hardness and coldness of death he got up and came back to the inn where he found m ledoux having coffee and a cigarette at a little green table which he had caused to be carried into the small garden newman learning that the doctor was still sitting with valentin asked m ledoux if he might not be allowed to relieve him he had a great desire to be useful to his poor friend this was easily arranged the doctor was very glad to go to bed he was a youthful and rather jaunty practitioner but he had a clever face and the ribbon of the legion of honor in his buttonhole newman listened attentively to the instructions he gave him before retiring and took mechanically from his hand a small volume which the surgeon recommended as a help to wakefulness and which turned out to be an old copy of faublas valentin was still lying with his eyes closed and there was no visible change in his condition newman sat down near him and for a long time narrowly watched him then his eyes wandered away with his thoughts upon his own situation and rested upon the chain of the alps disclosed by the drawing of the scant white cotton curtain of the window through which the sunshine passed and lay in squares upon the redtiled floor he tried to interweave his reflections with hope but he only half succeeded what had happened to him seemed to have in its violence and audacity the force of a real calamitythe strength and insolence of destiny herself it was unnatural and monstrous and he had no arms against it at last a sound struck upon the stillness and he heard valentins voice  it cant be about me you are pulling that long face he found when he turned that valentin was lying in the same position but his eyes were open and he was even trying to smile it was with a very slender strength that he returned the pressure of newmans hand i have been watching you for a quarter of an hour valentin went on you have been looking as black as thunder you are greatly disgusted with me i see well of course so am i  oh i shall not scold you said newman i feel too badly and how are you getting on  oh im getting off they have quite settled that havent they  thats for you to settle you can get well if you try said newman with resolute cheerfulness  my dear fellow how can i try trying is violent exercise and that sort of thing isnt in order for a man with a hole in his side as big as your hat that begins to bleed if he moves a hairsbreadth i knew you would come he continued i knew i should wake up and find you here so im not surprised but last night i was very impatient i didnt see how i could keep still until you came it was a matter of keeping still just like this as still as a mummy in his case you talk about trying i tried that well here i am yetthese twenty hours it seems like twenty days bellegarde talked slowly and feebly but distinctly enough it was visible however that he was in extreme pain and at last he closed his eyes newman begged him to remain silent and spare himself the doctor had left urgent orders oh said valentin let us eat and drink for tomorrowtomorrowand he paused again no not tomorrow perhaps but today i cant eat and drink but i can talk whats to be gained at this pass by renunrenunciation i mustnt use such big words i was always a chatterer lord how i have talked in my day  thats a reason for keeping quiet now said newman we know how well you talk you know  but valentin without heeding him went on in the same weak dying drawl i wanted to see you because you have seen my sister does she knowwill she come  newman was embarrassed yes by this time she must know  didnt you tell her valentin asked and then in a moment didnt you bring me any message from her his eyes rested upon newmans with a certain soft keenness  i didnt see her after i got your telegram said newman i wrote to her  and she sent you no answer  newman was obliged to reply that madame de cintre had left paris she went yesterday to fleurieres  yesterdayto fleurieres why did she go to fleurieres what day is this what day was yesterday ah then i shant see her said valentin sadly fleurieres is too far and then he closed his eyes again newman sat silent summoning pious invention to his aid but he was relieved at finding that valentin was apparently too weak to reason or to be curious bellegarde however presently went on and my motherand my brotherwill they come are they at fleurieres  they were in paris but i didnt see them either newman answered if they received your telegram in time they will have started this morning otherwise they will be obliged to wait for the nightexpress and they will arrive at the same hour as i did  they wont thank methey wont thank me valentin murmured they will pass an atrocious night and urbain doesnt like the early morning air i dont remember ever in my life to have seen him before noonbefore breakfast no one ever saw him we dont know how he is then perhaps hes different who knows posterity perhaps will know thats the time he works in his cabinet at the history of the princesses but i had to send for themhadnt i and then i want to see my mother sit there where you sit and say goodby to her perhaps after all i dont know her and she will have some surprise for me dont think you know her yet yourself perhaps she may surprise you but if i cant see claire i dont care for anything i have been thinking of itand in my dreams too why did she go to fleurieres today she never told me what has happened ah she ought to have guessed i was herethis way it is the first time in her life she ever disappointed me poor claire  you know we are not man and wife quite yetyour sister and i said newman she doesnt yet account to me for all her actions and after a fashion he smiled  valentin looked at him a moment have you quarreled  never never never newman exclaimed  how happily you say that said valentin you are going to be happyva in answer to this stroke of irony none the less powerful for being so unconscious all poor newman could do was to give a helpless and transparent stare valentin continued to fix him with his own rather overbright gaze and presently he said but something is the matter with you i watched you just now you havent a bridegrooms face  my dear fellow said newman how can i show you a bridegrooms face if you think i enjoy seeing you lie there and not being able to help you  why you are just the man to be cheerful dont forfeit your rights im a proof of your wisdom when was a man ever gloomy when he could say i told you so you told me so you know you did what you could about it you said some very good things i have thought them over but my dear friend i was right all the same this is the regular way  i didnt do what i ought said newman i ought to have done something else  for instance  oh something or other i ought to have treated you as a small boy  well im a very small boy now said valentin im rather less than an infant an infant is helpless but its generally voted promising im not promising eh society cant lose a less valuable member  newman was strongly moved he got up and turned his back upon his friend and walked away to the window where he stood looking out but only vaguely seeing no i dont like the look of your back valentin continued i have always been an observer of backs yours is quite out of sorts  newman returned to his bedside and begged him to be quiet be quiet and get well he said thats what you must do get well and help me  i told you you were in trouble how can i help you valentin asked  ill let you know when you are better you were always curious there is something to get well for newman answered with resolute animation  valentin closed his eyes and lay a long time without speaking he seemed even to have fallen asleep but at the end of half an hour he began to talk again i am rather sorry about that place in the bank who knows but what i might have become another rothschild but i wasnt meant for a banker bankers are not so easy to kill dont you think i have been very easy to kill its not like a serious man its really very mortifying its like telling your hostess you must go when you count upon her begging you to stay and then finding she does no such thing reallyso soon youve only just come life doesnt make me any such polite little speech  newman for some time said nothing but at last he broke out its a bad caseits a bad caseits the worst case i ever met i dont want to say anything unpleasant but i cant help it ive seen men dying beforeand ive seen men shot but it always seemed more natural they were not so clever as you damnationdamnation you might have done something better than this its about the meanest windingup of a mans affairs that i can imagine  valentin feebly waved his hand to and fro dont insistdont insist it is meandecidedly mean for you see at the bottomdown at the bottom in a little place as small as the end of a winefunneli agree with you  a few moments after this the doctor put his head through the halfopened door and perceiving that valentin was awake came in and felt his pulse he shook his head and declared that he had talked too muchten times too much nonsense said valentin a man sentenced to death can never talk too much have you never read an account of an execution in a newspaper dont they always set a lot of people at the prisonerlawyers reporters prieststo make him talk but its not mr newmans fault he sits there as mum as a deathshead  the doctor observed that it was time his patients wound should be dressed again mm de grosjoyaux and ledoux who had already witnessed this delicate operation taking newmans place as assistants newman withdrew and learned from his fellowwatchers that they had received a telegram from urbain de bellegarde to the effect that their message had been delivered in the rue de luniversite too late to allow him to take the morning train but that he would start with his mother in the evening newman wandered away into the village again and walked about restlessly for two or three hours the day seemed terribly long at dusk he came back and dined with the doctor and m ledoux the dressing of valentins wound had been a very critical operation the doctor didnt really see how he was to endure a repetition of it he then declared that he must beg of mr newman to deny himself for the present the satisfaction of sitting with m de bellegarde more than any one else apparently he had the flattering but inconvenient privilege of exciting him m ledoux at this swallowed a glass of wine in silence he must have been wondering what the deuce bellegarde found so exciting in the american  newman after dinner went up to his room where he sat for a long time staring at his lighted candle and thinking that valentin was dying downstairs late when the candle had burnt low there came a soft rap at his door the doctor stood there with a candlestick and a shrug  he must amuse himself still said valentins medical adviser he insists upon seeing you and i am afraid you must come i think at this rate that he will hardly outlast the night  newman went back to valentins room which he found lighted by a taper on the hearth valentin begged him to light a candle i want to see your face he said they say you excite me he went on as newman complied with this request and i confess i do feel excited but it isnt youits my own thoughts i have been thinkingthinking sit down there and let me look at you again newman seated himself folded his arms and bent a heavy gaze upon his friend he seemed to be playing a part mechanically in a lugubrious comedy valentin looked at him for some time yes this morning i was right you have something on your mind heavier than valentin de bellegarde come im a dying man and its indecent to deceive me something happened after i left paris it was not for nothing that my sister started off at this season of the year for fleurieres why was it it sticks in my crop i have been thinking it over and if you dont tell me i shall guess  i had better not tell you said newman it wont do you any good  if you think it will do me any good not to tell me you are very much mistaken there is trouble about your marriage  yes said newman there is trouble about my marriage  good and valentin was silent again they have stopped it  they have stopped it said newman now that he had spoken out he found a satisfaction in it which deepened as he went on your mother and brother have broken faith they have decided that it cant take place they have decided that i am not good enough after all they have taken back their word since you insist there it is  valentin gave a sort of groan lifted his hands a moment and then let them drop  i am sorry not to have anything better to tell you about them newman pursued but its not my fault i was indeed very unhappy when your telegram reached me i was quite upside down you may imagine whether i feel any better now  valentin moaned gaspingly as if his wound were throbbing broken faith broken faith he murmured and my sistermy sister  your sister is very unhappy she has consented to give me up i dont know why i dont know what they have done to her it must be something pretty bad in justice to her you ought to know it they have made her suffer i havent seen her alone but only before them we had an interview yesterday morning they came out flat in so many words they told me to go about my business it seems to me a very bad case im angry im sore im sick  valentin lay there staring with his eyes more brilliantly lighted his lips soundlessly parted and a flush of color in his pale face newman had never before uttered so many words in the plaintive key but now in speaking to valentin in the poor fellows extremity he had a feeling that he was making his complaint somewhere within the presence of the power that men pray to in trouble he felt his outgush of resentment as a sort of spiritual privilege  and clairesaid bellegardeclaire she has given you up  i dont really believe it said newman  no dont believe it dont believe it she is gaining time excuse her  i pity her said newman  poor claire murmured valentin but theybut theyand he paused again you saw them they dismissed you face to face  face to face they were very explicit  what did they say  they said they couldnt stand a commercial person  valentin put out his hand and laid it upon newmans arm and about their promisetheir engagement with you  they made a distinction they said it was to hold good only until madame de cintre accepted me  valentin lay staring a while and his flush died away dont tell me any more he said at last im ashamed  you you are the soul of honor said newman simply  valentin groaned and turned away his head for some time nothing more was said then valentin turned back again and found a certain force to press newmans arm its very badvery bad when my peoplewhen my racecome to that it is time for me to withdraw i believe in my sister she will explain excuse her if she cantif she cant forgive her she has suffered but for the others it is very badvery bad you take it very hard no its a shame to make you say so he closed his eyes and again there was a silence newman felt almost awed he had evoked a more solemn spirit than he expected presently valentin looked at him again removing his hand from his arm i apologize he said do you understand here on my deathbed i apologize for my family for my mother for my brother for the ancient house of bellegarde voila he added softly  newman for an answer took his hand and pressed it with a world of kindness valentin remained quiet and at the end of half an hour the doctor softly came in behind him through the halfopen door newman saw the two questioning faces of mm de grosjoyaux and ledoux the doctor laid his hand on valentins wrist and sat looking at him he gave no sign and the two gentlemen came in m ledoux having first beckoned to some one outside this was m le cure who carried in his hand an object unknown to newman and covered with a white napkin m le cure was short round and red he advanced pulling off his little black cap to newman and deposited his burden on the table and then he sat down in the best armchair with his hands folded across his person the other gentlemen had exchanged glances which expressed unanimity as to the timeliness of their presence but for a long time valentin neither spoke nor moved it was newmans belief afterwards that m le cure went to sleep at last abruptly valentin pronounced newmans name his friend went to him and he said in french you are not alone i want to speak to you alone newman looked at the doctor and the doctor looked at the cure who looked back at him and then the doctor and the cure together gave a shrug alonefor five minutes valentin repeated please leave us  the cure took up his burden again and led the way out followed by his companions newman closed the door behind them and came back to valentins bedside bellegarde had watched all this intently  its very bad its very bad he said after newman had seated himself close to him the more i think of it the worse it is  oh dont think of it said newman  but valentin went on without heeding him even if they should come round again the shamethe basenessis there  oh they wont come round said newman  well you can make them  make them  i can tell you somethinga great secretan immense secret you can use it against themfrighten them force them  a secret newman repeated the idea of letting valentin on his deathbed confide him an immense secret shocked him for the moment and made him draw back it seemed an illicit way of arriving at information and even had a vague analogy with listening at a keyhole then suddenly the thought of forcing madame de bellegarde and her son became attractive and newman bent his head closer to valentins lips for some time however the dying man said nothing more he only lay and looked at his friend with his kindled expanded troubled eye and newman began to believe that he had spoken in delirium but at last he said  there was something donesomething done at fleurieres it was foul play my fathersomething happened to him i dont know i have been ashamedafraid to know but i know there is something my mother knowsurbain knows  something happened to your father said newman urgently  valentin looked at him still more wideeyed he didnt get well  get well of what  but the immense effort which valentin had made first to decide to utter these words and then to bring them out appeared to have taken his last strength he lapsed again into silence and newman sat watching him do you understand he began again presently at fleurieres you can find out mrs bread knows tell her i begged you to ask her then tell them that and see it may help you if not tell every one it willit willhere valentins voice sank to the feeblest murmurit will avenge you  the words died away in a long soft groan newman stood up deeply impressed not knowing what to say his heart was beating violently thank you he said at last i am much obliged but valentin seemed not to hear him he remained silent and his silence continued at last newman went and opened the door m le cure reentered bearing his sacred vessel and followed by the three gentlemen and by valentins servant it was almost processional    chapter xx   valentin de bellegarde died tranquilly just as the cold faint march dawn began to illumine the faces of the little knot of friends gathered about his bedside an hour afterwards newman left the inn and drove to geneva he was naturally unwilling to be present at the arrival of madame de bellegarde and her firstborn at geneva for the moment he remained he was like a man who has had a fall and wants to sit still and count his bruises he instantly wrote to madame de cintre relating to her the circumstances of her brothers deathwith certain exceptionsand asking her what was the earliest moment at which he might hope that she would consent to see him m ledoux had told him that he had reason to know that valentins willbellegarde had a great deal of elegant personal property to dispose ofcontained a request that he should be buried near his father in the churchyard of fleurieres and newman intended that the state of his own relations with the family should not deprive him of the satisfaction of helping to pay the last earthly honors to the best fellow in the world he reflected that valentins friendship was older than urbains enmity and that at a funeral it was easy to escape notice madame de cintres answer to his letter enabled him to time his arrival at fleurieres this answer was very brief it ran as follows  i thank you for your letter and for your being with valentin it is a most inexpressible sorrow to me that i was not to see you will be nothing but a distress to me there is no need therefore to wait for what you call brighter days it is all one now and i shall have no brighter days come when you please only notify me first my brother is to be buried here on friday and my family is to remain here c de c  as soon as he received this letter newman went straight to paris and to poitiers the journey took him far southward through green touraine and across the farshining loire into a country where the early spring deepened about him as he went but he had never made a journey during which he heeded less what he would have called the lay of the land he obtained lodging at the inn at poitiers and the next morning drove in a couple of hours to the village of fleurieres but here preoccupied though he was he could not fail to notice the picturesqueness of the place it was what the french call a petit bourg it lay at the base of a sort of huge mound on the summit of which stood the crumbling ruins of a feudal castle much of whose sturdy material as well as that of the wall which dropped along the hill to inclose the clustered houses defensively had been absorbed into the very substance of the village the church was simply the former chapel of the castle fronting upon its grassgrown court which however was of generous enough width to have given up its quaintest corner to a little graveyard here the very headstones themselves seemed to sleep as they slanted into the grass the patient elbow of the rampart held them together on one side and in front far beneath their mossy lids the green plains and blue distances stretched away the way to church up the hill was impracticable to vehicles it was lined with peasants two or three rows deep who stood watching old madame de bellegarde slowly ascend it on the arm of her elder son behind the pallbearers of the other newman chose to lurk among the common mourners who murmured madame la comtesse as a tall figure veiled in black passed before them he stood in the dusky little church while the service was going forward but at the dismal tombside he turned away and walked down the hill he went back to poitiers and spent two days in which patience and impatience were singularly commingled on the third day he sent madame de cintre a note saying that he would call upon her in the afternoon and in accordance with this he again took his way to fleurieres he left his vehicle at the tavern in the village street and obeyed the simple instructions which were given him for finding the chateau  it is just beyond there said the landlord and pointed to the treetops of the park above the opposite houses newman followed the first crossroad to the rightit was bordered with mouldy cottagesand in a few moments saw before him the peaked roofs of the towers advancing farther he found himself before a vast iron gate rusty and closed here he paused a moment looking through the bars the chateau was near the road this was at once its merit and its defect but its aspect was extremely impressive newman learned afterwards from a guidebook of the province that it dated from the time of henry iv it presented to the wide paved area which preceded it and which was edged with shabby farmbuildings an immense facade of dark timestained brick flanked by two low wings each of which terminated in a little dutchlooking pavilion capped with a fantastic roof two towers rose behind and behind the towers was a mass of elms and beeches now just faintly green but the great feature was a wide green river which washed the foundations of the chateau the building rose from an island in the circling stream so that this formed a perfect moat spanned by a twoarched bridge without a parapet the dull brick walls which here and there made a grand straight sweep the ugly little cupolas of the wings the deepset windows the long steep pinnacles of mossy slate all mirrored themselves in the tranquil river newman rang at the gate and was almost frightened at the tone with which a big rusty bell above his head replied to him an old woman came out from the gatehouse and opened the creaking portal just wide enough for him to pass and he went in across the dry bare court and the little cracked white slabs of the causeway on the moat at the door of the chateau he waited for some moments and this gave him a chance to observe that fleurieres was not kept up and to reflect that it was a melancholy place of residence it looks said newman to himselfand i give the comparison for what it is worthlike a chinese penitentiary at last the door was opened by a servant whom he remembered to have seen in the rue de luniversite the mans dull face brightened as he perceived our hero for newman for indefinable reasons enjoyed the confidence of the liveried gentry the footman led the way across a great central vestibule with a pyramid of plants in tubs in the middle of glass doors all around to what appeared to be the principal drawingroom of the chateau newman crossed the threshold of a room of superb proportions which made him feel at first like a tourist with a guidebook and a cicerone awaiting a fee but when his guide had left him alone with the observation that he would call madame la comtesse newman perceived that the salon contained little that was remarkable save a dark ceiling with curiously carved rafters some curtains of elaborate antiquated tapestry and a dark oaken floor polished like a mirror he waited some minutes walking up and down but at length as he turned at the end of the room he saw that madame de cintre had come in by a distant door she wore a black dress and she stood looking at him as the length of the immense room lay between them he had time to look at her before they met in the middle of it  he was dismayed at the change in her appearance pale heavybrowed almost haggard with a sort of monastic rigidity in her dress she had little but her pure features in common with the woman whose radiant good grace he had hitherto admired she let her eyes rest on his own and she let him take her hand but her eyes looked like two rainy autumn moons and her touch was portentously lifeless  i was at your brothers funeral newman said then i waited three days but i could wait no longer  nothing can be lost or gained by waiting said madame de cintre but it was very considerate of you to wait wronged as you have been  im glad you think i have been wronged said newman with that oddly humorous accent with which he often uttered words of the gravest meaning  do i need to say so she asked i dont think i have wronged seriously many persons certainly not consciously to you to whom i have done this hard and cruel thing the only reparation i can make is to say i know it i feel it the reparation is pitifully small  oh its a great step forward said newman with a gracious smile of encouragement he pushed a chair towards her and held it looking at her urgently she sat down mechanically and he seated himself near her but in a moment he got up restlessly and stood before her she remained seated like a troubled creature who had passed through the stage of restlessness  i say nothing is to be gained by my seeing you she went on and yet i am very glad you came now i can tell you what i feel it is a selfish pleasure but it is one of the last i shall have and she paused with her great misty eyes fixed upon him i know how i have deceived and injured you i know how cruel and cowardly i have been i see it as vividly as you doi feel it to the ends of my fingers and she unclasped her hands which were locked together in her lap lifted them and dropped them at her side anything that you may have said of me in your angriest passion is nothing to what i have said to myself  in my angriest passion said newman i have said nothing hard of you the very worst thing i have said of you yet is that you are the loveliest of women and he seated himself before her again abruptly  she flushed a little but even her flush was pale that is because you think i will come back but i will not come back it is in that hope you have come here i know i am very sorry for you i would do almost anything for you to say that after what i have done seems simply impudent but what can i say that will not seem impudent to wrong you and apologizethat is easy enough i should not have wronged you she stopped a moment looking at him and motioned him to let her go on i ought never to have listened to you at first that was the wrong no good could come of it i felt it and yet i listened that was your fault i liked you too much i believed in you  and dont you believe in me now  more than ever but now it doesnt matter i have given you up  newman gave a powerful thump with his clenched fist upon his knee why why why he cried give me a reasona decent reason you are not a childyou are not a minor nor an idiot you are not obliged to drop me because your mother told you to such a reason isnt worthy of you  i know that its not worthy of me but its the only one i have to give after all said madame de cintre throwing out her hands think me an idiot and forget me that will be the simplest way  newman got up and walked away with a crushing sense that his cause was lost and yet with an equal inability to give up fighting he went to one of the great windows and looked out at the stiffly embanked river and the formal gardens which lay beyond it when he turned round madame de cintre had risen she stood there silent and passive you are not frank said newman you are not honest instead of saying that you are imbecile you should say that other people are wicked your mother and your brother have been false and cruel they have been so to me and i am sure they have been so to you why do you try to shield them why do you sacrifice me to them im not false im not cruel you dont know what you give up i can tell you thatyou dont they bully you and plot about you and iiand he paused holding out his hands she turned away and began to leave him you told me the other day that you were afraid of your mother he said following her what did you mean  madame de cintre shook her head i remember i was sorry afterwards  you were sorry when she came down and put on the thumbscrews in gods name what is it she does to you  nothing nothing that you can understand and now that i have given you up i must not complain of her to you  thats no reasoning cried newman complain of her on the contrary tell me all about it frankly and trustfully as you ought and we will talk it over so satisfactorily that you wont give me up  madame de cintre looked down some moments fixedly and then raising her eyes she said one good at least has come of this i have made you judge me more fairly you thought of me in a way that did me great honor i dont know why you had taken it into your head but it left me no loophole for escapeno chance to be the common weak creature i am it was not my fault i warned you from the first but i ought to have warned you more i ought to have convinced you that i was doomed to disappoint you but i was in a way too proud you see what my superiority amounts to i hope she went on raising her voice with a tremor which even then and there newman thought beautiful i am too proud to be honest i am not too proud to be faithless i am timid and cold and selfish i am afraid of being uncomfortable  and you call marrying me uncomfortable said newman staring  madame de cintre blushed a little and seemed to say that if begging his pardon in words was impudent she might at least thus mutely express her perfect comprehension of his finding her conduct odious it is not marrying you it is doing all that would go with it its the rupture the defiance the insisting upon being happy in my own way what right have i to be happy whenwhenand she paused  when what said newman  when others have been most unhappy  what others newman asked what have you to do with any others but me besides you said just now that you wanted happiness and that you should find it by obeying your mother you contradict yourself  yes i contradict myself that shows you that i am not even intelligent  you are laughing at me cried newman you are mocking me  she looked at him intently and an observer might have said that she was asking herself whether she might not most quickly end their common pain by confessing that she was mocking him no i am not she presently said  granting that you are not intelligent he went on that you are weak that you are common that you are nothing that i have believed you werewhat i ask of you is not heroic effort it is a very common effort there is a great deal on my side to make it easy the simple truth is that you dont care enough about me to make it  i am cold said madame de cintre i am as cold as that flowing river  newman gave a great rap on the floor with his stick and a long grim laugh good good he cried you go altogether too faryou overshoot the mark there isnt a woman in the world as bad as you would make yourself out i see your game its what i said you are blackening yourself to whiten others you dont want to give me up at all you like meyou like me i know you do you have shown it and i have felt it after that you may be as cold as you please they have bullied you i say they have tortured you its an outrage and i insist upon saving you from the extravagance of your own generosity would you chop off your hand if your mother requested it  madame de cintre looked a little frightened i spoke of my mother too blindly the other day i am my own mistress by law and by her approval she can do nothing to me she has done nothing she has never alluded to those hard words i used about her  she has made you feel them ill promise you said newman  its my conscience that makes me feel them  your conscience seems to me to be rather mixed exclaimed newman passionately  it has been in great trouble but now it is very clear said madame de cintre i dont give you up for any worldly advantage or for any worldly happiness  oh you dont give me up for lord deepmere i know said newman i wont pretend even to provoke you that i think that but thats what your mother and your brother wanted and your mother at that villainous ball of hersi liked it at the time but the very thought of it now makes me rabidtried to push him on to make up to you  who told you this said madame de cintre softly  not valentin i observed it i guessed it i didnt know at the time that i was observing it but it stuck in my memory and afterwards you recollect i saw lord deepmere with you in the conservatory you said then that you would tell me at another time what he had said to you  that was beforebefore this said madame de cintre  it doesnt matter said newman and besides i think i know hes an honest little englishman he came and told you what your mother was up tothat she wanted him to supplant me not being a commercial person if he would make you an offer she would undertake to bring you over and give me the slip lord deepmere isnt very intellectual so she had to spell it out to him he said he admired you no end and that he wanted you to know it but he didnt like being mixed up with that sort of underhand work and he came to you and told tales that was about the amount of it wasnt it and then you said you were perfectly happy  i dont see why we should talk of lord deepmere said madame de cintre it was not for that you came here and about my mother it doesnt matter what you suspect and what you know when once my mind has been made up as it is now i should not discuss these things discussing anything now is very idle we must try and live each as we can i believe you will be happy again even sometimes when you think of me when you do so think thisthat it was not easy and that i did the best i could i have things to reckon with that you dont know i mean i have feelings i must do as they force mei must i must they would haunt me otherwise she cried with vehemence they would kill me  i know what your feelings are they are superstitions they are the feeling that after all though i am a good fellow i have been in business the feeling that your mothers looks are law and your brothers words are gospel that you all hang together and that its a part of the everlasting proprieties that they should have a hand in everything you do it makes my blood boil that is cold you are right and what i feel here and newman struck his heart and became more poetical than he knew is a glowing fire  a spectator less preoccupied than madame de cintres distracted wooer would have felt sure from the first that her appealing calm of manner was the result of violent effort in spite of which the tide of agitation was rapidly rising on these last words of newmans it overflowed though at first she spoke low for fear of her voice betraying her no i was not righti am not cold i believe that if i am doing what seems so bad it is not mere weakness and falseness mr newman its like a religion i cant tell youi cant its cruel of you to insist i dont see why i shouldnt ask you to believe meand pity me its like a religion theres a curse upon the house i dont know whati dont know whydont ask me we must all bear it i have been too selfish i wanted to escape from it you offered me a great chancebesides my liking you it seemed good to change completely to break to go away and then i admired you but i cantit has overtaken and come back to me her selfcontrol had now completely abandoned her and her words were broken with long sobs why do such dreadful things happen to uswhy is my brother valentin killed like a beast in the midst of his youth and his gayety and his brightness and all that we loved him for why are there things i cant ask aboutthat i am afraid to know why are there places i cant look at sounds i cant hear why is it given to me to choose to decide in a case so hard and so terrible as this i am not meant for thati am not made for boldness and defiance i was made to be happy in a quiet natural way at this newman gave a most expressive groan but madame de cintre went on i was made to do gladly and gratefully what is expected of me my mother has always been very good to me thats all i can say i must not judge her i must not criticize her if i did it would come back to me i cant change  no said newman bitterly i must changeif i break in two in the effort  you are different you are a man you will get over it you have all kinds of consolation you were bornyou were trained to changes besidesbesides i shall always think of you  i dont care for that cried newman you are cruelyou are terribly cruel god forgive you you may have the best reasons and the finest feelings in the world that makes no difference you are a mystery to me i dont see how such hardness can go with such loveliness  madame de cintre fixed him a moment with her swimming eyes you believe i am hard then  newman answered her look and then broke out you are a perfect faultless creature stay by me  of course i am hard she went on whenever we give pain we are hard and we must give pain thats the worldthe hateful miserable world ah and she gave a long deep sigh i cant even say i am glad to have known youthough i am that too is to wrong you i can say nothing that is not cruel therefore let us part without more of this goodby and she put out her hand  newman stood and looked at it without taking it and raised his eyes to her face he felt himself like shedding tears of rage what are you going to do he asked where are you going  where i shall give no more pain and suspect no more evil i am going out of the world  out of the world  i am going into a convent  into a convent newman repeated the words with the deepest dismay it was as if she had said she was going into an hospital into a conventyou  i told you that it was not for my worldly advantage or pleasure i was leaving you  but still newman hardly understood you are going to be a nun he went on in a cellfor lifewith a gown and white veil  a nuna carmelite nun said madame de cintre for life with gods leave  the idea struck newman as too dark and horrible for belief and made him feel as he would have done if she had told him that she was going to mutilate her beautiful face or drink some potion that would make her mad he clasped his hands and began to tremble visibly  madame de cintre dont dont he said i beseech you on my knees if you like ill beseech you  she laid her hand upon his arm with a tender pitying almost reassuring gesture you dont understand she said you have wrong ideas its nothing horrible it is only peace and safety it is to be out of the world where such troubles as this come to the innocent to the best and for lifethats the blessing of it they cant begin again  newman dropped into a chair and sat looking at her with a long inarticulate murmur that this superb woman in whom he had seen all human grace and household force should turn from him and all the brightness that he offered herhim and his future and his fortune and his fidelityto muffle herself in ascetic rags and entomb herself in a cell was a confounding combination of the inexorable and the grotesque as the image deepened before him the grotesque seemed to expand and overspread it it was a reduction to the absurd of the trial to which he was subjected youyou a nun he exclaimed you with your beauty defacedyou behind locks and bars never never if i can prevent it and he sprang to his feet with a violent laugh  you cant prevent it said madame de cintre and it oughta littleto satisfy you do you suppose i will go on living in the world still beside you and yet not with you it is all arranged goodby goodby  this time he took her hand took it in both his own forever he said her lips made an inaudible movement and his own uttered a deep imprecation she closed her eyes as if with the pain of hearing it then he drew her towards him and clasped her to his breast he kissed her white face for an instant she resisted and for a moment she submitted then with force she disengaged herself and hurried away over the long shining floor the next moment the door closed behind her  newman made his way out as he could    chapter xxi   there is a pretty public walk at poitiers laid out upon the crest of the high hill around which the little city clusters planted with thick trees and looking down upon the fertile fields in which the old english princes fought for their right and held it newman paced up and down this quiet promenade for the greater part of the next day and let his eyes wander over the historic prospect but he would have been sadly at a loss to tell you afterwards whether the latter was made up of coalfields or of vineyards he was wholly given up to his grievance or which reflection by no means diminished the weight he feared that madame de cintre was irretrievably lost and yet as he would have said himself he didnt see his way clear to giving her up he found it impossible to turn his back upon fleurieres and its inhabitants it seemed to him that some germ of hope or reparation must lurk there somewhere if he could only stretch his arm out far enough to pluck it it was as if he had his hand on a doorknob and were closing his clenched fist upon it he had thumped he had called he had pressed the door with his powerful knee and shaken it with all his strength and dead damning silence had answered him and yet something held him theresomething hardened the grasp of his fingers newmans satisfaction had been too intense his whole plan too deliberate and mature his prospect of happiness too rich and comprehensive for this fine moral fabric to crumble at a stroke the very foundation seemed fatally injured and yet he felt a stubborn desire still to try to save the edifice he was filled with a sorer sense of wrong than he had ever known or than he had supposed it possible he should know to accept his injury and walk away without looking behind him was a stretch of goodnature of which he found himself incapable he looked behind him intently and continually and what he saw there did not assuage his resentment he saw himself trustful generous liberal patient easy pocketing frequent irritation and furnishing unlimited modesty to have eaten humble pie to have been snubbed and patronized and satirized and have consented to take it as one of the conditions of the bargainto have done this and done it all for nothing surely gave one a right to protest and to be turned off because one was a commercial person as if he had ever talked or dreamt of the commercial since his connection with the bellegardes beganas if he had made the least circumstance of the commercialas if he would not have consented to confound the commercial fifty times a day if it might have increased by a hairs breadth the chance of the bellegardes not playing him a trick granted that being commercial was fair ground for having a trick played upon one how little they knew about the class so designed and its enterprising way of not standing upon trifles it was in the light of his injury that the weight of newmans past endurance seemed so heavy his actual irritation had not been so great merged as it was in his vision of the cloudless blue that overarched his immediate wooing but now his sense of outrage was deep rancorous and ever present he felt that he was a good fellow wronged as for madame de cintres conduct it struck him with a kind of awe and the fact that he was powerless to understand it or feel the reality of its motives only deepened the force with which he had attached himself to her he had never let the fact of her catholicism trouble him catholicism to him was nothing but a name and to express a mistrust of the form in which her religious feelings had moulded themselves would have seemed to him on his own part a rather pretentious affectation of protestant zeal if such superb white flowers as that could bloom in catholic soil the soil was not insalubrious but it was one thing to be a catholic and another to turn nunon your hand there was something lugubriously comical in the way newmans thoroughly contemporaneous optimism was confronted with this dusky oldworld expedient to see a woman made for him and for motherhood to his children juggled away in this tragic travestyit was a thing to rub ones eyes over a nightmare an illusion a hoax but the hours passed away without disproving the thing and leaving him only the aftersense of the vehemence with which he had embraced madame de cintre he remembered her words and her looks he turned them over and tried to shake the mystery out of them and to infuse them with an endurable meaning what had she meant by her feeling being a kind of religion it was the religion simply of the family laws the religion of which her implacable little mother was the high priestess twist the thing about as her generosity would the one certain fact was that they had used force against her her generosity had tried to screen them but newmans heart rose into his throat at the thought that they should go scotfree  the twentyfour hours wore themselves away and the next morning newman sprang to his feet with the resolution to return to fleurieres and demand another interview with madame de bellegarde and her son he lost no time in putting it into practice as he rolled swiftly over the excellent road in the little caleche furnished him at the inn at poitiers he drew forth as it were from the very safe place in his mind to which he had consigned it the last information given him by poor valentin valentin had told him he could do something with it and newman thought it would be well to have it at hand this was of course not the first time lately that newman had given it his attention it was information in the roughit was dark and puzzling but newman was neither helpless nor afraid valentin had evidently meant to put him in possession of a powerful instrument though he could not be said to have placed the handle very securely within his grasp but if he had not really told him the secret he had at least given him the clew to ita clew of which that queer old mrs bread held the other end mrs bread had always looked to newman as if she knew secrets and as he apparently enjoyed her esteem he suspected she might be induced to share her knowledge with him so long as there was only mrs bread to deal with he felt easy as to what there was to find out he had only one fearthat it might not be bad enough then when the image of the marquise and her son rose before him again standing side by side the old womans hand in urbains arm and the same cold unsociable fixedness in the eyes of each he cried out to himself that the fear was groundless there was blood in the secret at the very last he arrived at fleurieres almost in a state of elation he had satisfied himself logically that in the presence of his threat of exposure they would as he mentally phrased it rattle down like unwound buckets he remembered indeed that he must first catch his harefirst ascertain what there was to expose but after that why shouldnt his happiness be as good as new again mother and son would drop their lovely victim in terror and take to hiding and madame de cintre left to herself would surely come back to him give her a chance and she would rise to the surface return to the light how could she fail to perceive that his house would be much the most comfortable sort of convent  newman as he had done before left his conveyance at the inn and walked the short remaining distance to the chateau when he reached the gate however a singular feeling took possession of hima feeling which strange as it may seem had its source in its unfathomable good nature he stood there a while looking through the bars at the large timestained face of the edifice and wondering to what crime it was that the dark old house with its flowery name had given convenient occasion it had given occasion first and last to tyrannies and sufferings enough newman said to himself it was an evillooking place to live in then suddenly came the reflectionwhat a horrible rubbishheap of iniquity to fumble in the attitude of inquisitor turned its ignobler face and with the same movement newman declared that the bellegardes should have another chance he would appeal once more directly to their sense of fairness and not to their fear and if they should be accessible to reason he need know nothing worse about them than what he already knew that was bad enough  the gatekeeper let him in through the same stiff crevice as before and he passed through the court and over the little rustic bridge on the moat the door was opened before he had reached it and as if to put his clemency to rout with the suggestion of a richer opportunity mrs bread stood there awaiting him her face as usual looked as hopelessly blank as the tidesmoothed seasand and her black garments seemed of an intenser sable newman had already learned that her strange inexpressiveness could be a vehicle for emotion and he was not surprised at the muffled vivacity with which she whispered i thought you would try again sir i was looking out for you  i am glad to see you said newman i think you are my friend  mrs bread looked at him opaquely i wish you well sir but its vain wishing now  you know then how they have treated me  oh sir said mrs bread dryly i know everything  newman hesitated a moment everything  mrs bread gave him a glance somewhat more lucent i know at least too much sir  one can never know too much i congratulate you i have come to see madame de bellegarde and her son newman added are they at home if they are not i will wait  my lady is always at home mrs bread replied and the marquis is mostly with her  please then tell themone or the other or boththat i am here and that i desire to see them  mrs bread hesitated may i take a great liberty sir  you have never taken a liberty but you have justified it said newman with diplomatic urbanity  mrs bread dropped her wrinkled eyelids as if she were curtseying but the curtsey stopped there the occasion was too grave you have come to plead with them again sir perhaps you dont know thisthat madame de cintre returned this morning to paris  ah shes gone and newman groaning smote the pavement with his stick  she has gone straight to the conventthe carmelites they call it i see you know sir my lady and the marquis take it very ill it was only last night she told them  ah she had kept it back then cried newman good good and they are very fierce  they are not pleased said mrs bread but they may well dislike it they tell me its most dreadful sir of all the nuns in christendom the carmelites are the worst you may say they are really not human sir they make you give up everythingforever and to think of her there if i was one that cried sir i could cry  newman looked at her an instant we mustnt cry mrs bread we must act go and call them and he made a movement to enter farther  but mrs bread gently checked him may i take another liberty i am told you were with my dearest mr valentin in his last hours if you would tell me a word about him the poor count was my own boy sir for the first year of his life he was hardly out of my arms i taught him to speak and the count spoke so well sir he always spoke well to his poor old bread when he grew up and took his pleasure he always had a kind word for me and to die in that wild way they have a story that he fought with a winemerchant i cant believe that sir and was he in great pain  you are a wise kind old woman mrs bread said newman i hoped i might see you with my own children in your arms perhaps i shall yet and he put out his hand mrs bread looked for a moment at his open palm and then as if fascinated by the novelty of the gesture extended her own ladylike fingers newman held her hand firmly and deliberately fixing his eyes upon her you want to know all about mr valentin he said  it would be a sad pleasure sir  i can tell you everything can you sometimes leave this place  the chateau sir i really dont know i never tried  try then try hard try this evening at dusk come to me in the old ruin there on the hill in the court before the church i will wait for you there i have something very important to tell you an old woman like you can do as she pleases  mrs bread stared wondering with parted lips is it from the count sir she asked  from the countfrom his deathbed said newman  i will come then i will be bold for once for him  she led newman into the great drawingroom with which he had already made acquaintance and retired to execute his commands newman waited a long time at last he was on the point of ringing and repeating his request he was looking round him for a bell when the marquis came in with his mother on his arm it will be seen that newman had a logical mind when i say that he declared to himself in perfect good faith as a result of valentins dark hints that his adversaries looked grossly wicked there is no mistake about it now he said to himself as they advanced theyre a bad lot they have pulled off the mask madame de bellegarde and her son certainly bore in their faces the signs of extreme perturbation they looked like people who had passed a sleepless night confronted moreover with an annoyance which they hoped they had disposed of it was not natural that they should have any very tender glances to bestow upon newman he stood before them and such eyebeams as they found available they leveled at him newman feeling as if the door of a sepulchre had suddenly been opened and the damp darkness were being exhaled  you see i have come back he said i have come to try again  it would be ridiculous said m de bellegarde to pretend that we are glad to see you or that we dont question the taste of your visit  oh dont talk about taste said newman with a laugh or that will bring us round to yours if i consulted my taste i certainly shouldnt come to see you besides i will make as short work as you please promise me to raise the blockadeto set madame de cintre at libertyand i will retire instantly  we hesitated as to whether we would see you said madame de bellegarde and we were on the point of declining the honor but it seemed to me that we should act with civility as we have always done and i wished to have the satisfaction of informing you that there are certain weaknesses that people of our way of feeling can be guilty of but once  you may be weak but once but you will be audacious many times madam newman answered i didnt come however for conversational purposes i came to say this simply that if you will write immediately to your daughter that you withdraw your opposition to her marriage i will take care of the rest you dont want her to turn nunyou know more about the horrors of it than i do marrying a commercial person is better than that give me a letter to her signed and sealed saying you retract and that she may marry me with your blessing and i will take it to her at the convent and bring her out theres your chancei call those easy terms  we look at the matter otherwise you know we call them very hard terms said urbain de bellegarde they had all remained standing rigidly in the middle of the room i think my mother will tell you that she would rather her daughter should become soeur catherine than mrs newman  but the old lady with the serenity of supreme power let her son make her epigrams for her she only smiled almost sweetly shaking her head and repeating but once mr newman but once  nothing that newman had ever seen or heard gave him such a sense of marble hardness as this movement and the tone that accompanied it could anything compel you he asked do you know of anything that would force you  this language sir said the marquis addressed to people in bereavement and grief is beyond all qualification  in most cases newman answered your objection would have some weight even admitting that madame de cintres present intentions make time precious but i have thought of what you speak of and i have come here today without scruple simply because i consider your brother and you two very different parties i see no connection between you your brother was ashamed of you lying there wounded and dying the poor fellow apologized to me for your conduct he apologized to me for that of his mother  for a moment the effect of these words was as if newman had struck a physical blow a quick flush leaped into the faces of madame de bellegarde and her son and they exchanged a glance like a twinkle of steel urbain uttered two words which newman but half heard but of which the sense came to him as it were in the reverberation of the sound le miserable  you show little respect for the living said madame de bellegarde but at least respect the dead dont profanedont insultthe memory of my innocent son  i speak the simple truth newman declared and i speak it for a purpose i repeat itdistinctly your son was utterly disgustedyour son apologized  urbain de bellegarde was frowning portentously and newman supposed he was frowning at poor valentins invidious image taken by surprise his scant affection for his brother had made a momentary concession to dishonor but not for an appreciable instant did his mother lower her flag you are immensely mistaken sir she said my son was sometimes light but he was never indecent he died faithful to his name  you simply misunderstood him said the marquis beginning to rally you affirm the impossible  oh i dont care for poor valentins apology said newman it was far more painful than pleasant to me this atrocious thing was not his fault he never hurt me or any one else he was the soul of honor but it shows how he took it  if you wish to prove that my poor brother in his last moments was out of his head we can only say that under the melancholy circumstances nothing was more possible but confine yourself to that  he was quite in his right mind said newman with gentle but dangerous doggedness i have never seen him so bright and clever it was terrible to see that witty capable fellow dying such a death you know i was very fond of your brother and i have further proof of his sanity newman concluded  the marquise gathered herself together majestically this is too gross she cried we decline to accept your story sirwe repudiate it urbain open the door she turned away with an imperious motion to her son and passed rapidly down the length of the room the marquis went with her and held the door open newman was left standing  he lifted his finger as a sign to m de bellegarde who closed the door behind his mother and stood waiting newman slowly advanced more silent for the moment than life the two men stood face to face then newman had a singular sensation he felt his sense of injury almost brimming over into jocularity come he said you dont treat me well at least admit that  m de bellegarde looked at him from head to foot and then in the most delicate bestbred voice i detest you personally he said  thats the way i feel to you but for politeness sake i dont say it said newman its singular i should want so much to be your brotherinlaw but i cant give it up let me try once more and he paused a moment you have a secretyou have a skeleton in the closet m de bellegarde continued to look at him hard but newman could not see whether his eyes betrayed anything the look of his eyes was always so strange newman paused again and then went on you and your mother have committed a crime at this m de bellegardes eyes certainly did change they seemed to flicker like blown candles newman could see that he was profoundly startled but there was something admirable in his selfcontrol  continue said m de bellegarde  newman lifted a finger and made it waver a little in the air need i continue you are trembling  pray where did you obtain this interesting information m de bellegarde asked very softly  i shall be strictly accurate said newman i wont pretend to know more than i do at present that is all i know you have done something that you must hide something that would damn you if it were known something that would disgrace the name you are so proud of i dont know what it is but i can find out persist in your present course and i will find out change it let your sister go in peace and i will leave you alone its a bargain  the marquis almost succeeded in looking untroubled the breaking up of the ice in his handsome countenance was an operation that was necessarily gradual but newmans mildlysyllabled argumentation seemed to press and press and presently he averted his eyes he stood some moments reflecting  my brother told you this he said looking up  newman hesitated a moment yes your brother told me  the marquis smiled handsomely didnt i say that he was out of his mind  he was out of his mind if i dont find out he was very much in it if i do  m de bellegarde gave a shrug eh sir find out or not as you please  i dont frighten you demanded newman  thats for you to judge  no its for you to judge at your leisure think it over feel yourself all round i will give you an hour or two i cant give you more for how do we know how fast they may be making madame de cintre a nun talk it over with your mother let her judge whether she is frightened i dont believe she is as easily frightened in general as you but you will see i will go and wait in the village at the inn and i beg you to let me know as soon as possible say by three oclock a simple yes or no on paper will do only you know in case of a yes i shall expect you this time to stick to your bargain and with this newman opened the door and let himself out the marquis did not move and newman retiring gave him another look at the inn in the village he repeated then he turned away altogether and passed out of the house  he was extremely excited by what he had been doing for it was inevitable that there should be a certain emotion in calling up the spectre of dishonor before a family a thousand years old but he went back to the inn and contrived to wait there deliberately for the next two hours he thought it more than probable that urbain de bellegarde would give no sign for an answer to his challenge in either sense would be a confession of guilt what he most expected was silencein other words defiance but he prayed that as he imagined it his shot might bring them down it did bring by three oclock a note delivered by a footman a note addressed in urbain de bellegardes handsome english hand it ran as follows  i cannot deny myself the satisfaction of letting you know that i return to paris tomorrow with my mother in order that we may see my sister and confirm her in the resolution which is the most effectual reply to your audacious pertinacity  henriurbain de bellegarde   newman put the letter into his pocket and continued his walk up and down the innparlor he had spent most of his time for the past week in walking up and down he continued to measure the length of the little salle of the armes de prance until the day began to wane when he went out to keep his rendezvous with mrs bread the path which led up the hill to the ruin was easy to find and newman in a short time had followed it to the top he passed beneath the rugged arch of the castle wall and looked about him in the early dusk for an old woman in black the castle yard was empty but the door of the church was open newman went into the little nave and of course found a deeper dusk than without a couple of tapers however twinkled on the altar and just enabled him to perceive a figure seated by one of the pillars closer inspection helped him to recognize mrs bread in spite of the fact that she was dressed with unwonted splendor she wore a large black silk bonnet with imposing bows of crape and an old black satin dress disposed itself in vaguely lustrous folds about her person she had judged it proper to the occasion to appear in her stateliest apparel she had been sitting with her eyes fixed upon the ground but when newman passed before her she looked up at him and then she rose  are you a catholic mrs bread he asked  no sir im a good churchofengland woman very low she answered but i thought i should be safer in here than outside i was never out in the evening before sir  we shall be safer said newman where no one can hear us and he led the way back into the castle court and then followed a path beside the church which he was sure must lead into another part of the ruin he was not deceived it wandered along the crest of the hill and terminated before a fragment of wall pierced by a rough aperture which had once been a door through this aperture newman passed and found himself in a nook peculiarly favorable to quiet conversation as probably many an earnest couple otherwise assorted than our friends had assured themselves the hill sloped abruptly away and on the remnant of its crest were scattered two or three fragments of stone beneath over the plain lay the gathered twilight through which in the near distance gleamed two or three lights from the chateau mrs bread rustled slowly after her guide and newman satisfying himself that one of the fallen stones was steady proposed to her to sit upon it she cautiously complied and he placed himself upon another near her    chapter xxii   i am very much obliged to you for coming newman said i hope it wont get you into trouble  i dont think i shall be missed my lady in these days is not fond of having me about her this was said with a certain fluttered eagerness which increased newmans sense of having inspired the old woman with confidence  from the first you know he answered you took an interest in my prospects you were on my side that gratified me i assure you and now that you know what they have done to me i am sure you are with me all the more  they have not done welli must say it said mrs bread but you mustnt blame the poor countess they pressed her hard  i would give a million of dollars to know what they did to her cried newman  mrs bread sat with a dull oblique gaze fixed upon the lights of the chateau they worked on her feelings they knew that was the way she is a delicate creature they made her feel wicked she is only too good  ah they made her feel wicked said newman slowly and then he repeated it they made her feel wickedthey made her feel wicked the words seemed to him for the moment a vivid description of infernal ingenuity  it was because she was so good that she gave uppoor sweet lady added mrs bread  but she was better to them than to me said newman  she was afraid said mrs bread very confidently she has always been afraid or at least for a long time that was the real trouble sir she was like a fair peach i may say with just one little speck she had one little sad spot you pushed her into the sunshine sir and it almost disappeared then they pulled her back into the shade and in a moment it began to spread before we knew it she was gone she was a delicate creature  this singular attestation of madame de cintres delicacy for all its singularity set newmans wound aching afresh i see he presently said she knew something bad about her mother  no sir she knew nothing said mrs bread holding her head very stiff and keeping her eyes fixed upon the glimmering windows of the chateau  she guessed something then or suspected it  she was afraid to know said mrs bread  but you know at any rate said newman  she slowly turned her vague eyes upon newman squeezing her hands together in her lap you are not quite faithful sir i thought it was to tell me about mr valentin you asked me to come here  oh the more we talk of mr valentin the better said newman thats exactly what i want i was with him as i told you in his last hour he was in a great deal of pain but he was quite himself you know what that means he was bright and lively and clever  oh he would always be clever sir said mrs bread and did he know of your trouble  yes he guessed it of himself  and what did he say to it  he said it was a disgrace to his namebut it was not the first  lord lord murmured mrs bread  he said that his mother and his brother had once put their heads together and invented something even worse  you shouldnt have listened to that sir  perhaps not but i did listen and i dont forget it now i want to know what it is they did  mrs bread gave a soft moan and you have enticed me up into this strange place to tell you  dont be alarmed said newman i wont say a word that shall be disagreeable to you tell me as it suits you and when it suits you only remember that it was mr valentins last wish that you should  did he say that  he said it with his last breathtell mrs bread i told you to ask her  why didnt he tell you himself  it was too long a story for a dying man he had no breath left in his body he could only say that he wanted me to knowthat wronged as i was it was my right to know  but how will it help you sir said mrs bread  thats for me to decide mr valentin believed it would and thats why he told me your name was almost the last word he spoke  mrs bread was evidently awestruck by this statement she shook her clasped hands slowly up and down excuse me sir she said if i take a great liberty is it the solemn truth you are speaking i must ask you that must i not sir  theres no offense it is the solemn truth i solemnly swear it mr valentin himself would certainly have told me more if he had been able  oh sir if he knew more  dont you suppose he did  theres no saying what he knew about anything said mrs bread with a mild headshake he was so mightily clever he could make you believe he knew things that he didnt and that he didnt know others that he had better not have known  i suspect he knew something about his brother that kept the marquis civil to him newman propounded he made the marquis feel him what he wanted now was to put me in his place he wanted to give me a chance to make the marquis feel me  mercy on us cried the old waitingwoman how wicked we all are  i dont know said newman some of us are wicked certainly i am very angry i am very sore and i am very bitter but i dont know that i am wicked i have been cruelly injured they have hurt me and i want to hurt them i dont deny that on the contrary i tell you plainly that it is the use i want to make of your secret  mrs bread seemed to hold her breath you want to publish themyou want to shame them  i want to bring them downdown down down i want to turn the tables upon themi want to mortify them as they mortified me they took me up into a high place and made me stand there for all the world to see me and then they stole behind me and pushed me into this bottomless pit where i lie howling and gnashing my teeth i made a fool of myself before all their friends but i shall make something worse of them  this passionate sally which newman uttered with the greater fervor that it was the first time he had had a chance to say all this aloud kindled two small sparks in mrs breads fixed eyes i suppose you have a right to your anger sir but think of the dishonor you will draw down on madame de cintre  madame de cintre is buried alive cried newman what are honor or dishonor to her the door of the tomb is at this moment closing behind her  yes its most awful moaned mrs bread  she has moved off like her brother valentin to give me room to work its as if it were done on purpose  surely said mrs bread apparently impressed by the ingenuity of this reflection she was silent for some moments then she added and would you bring my lady before the courts  the courts care nothing for my lady newman replied if she has committed a crime she will be nothing for the courts but a wicked old woman  and will they hang her sir  that depends upon what she has done and newman eyed mrs bread intently  it would break up the family most terribly sir  its time such a family should be broken up said newman with a laugh  and me at my age out of place sir sighed mrs bread  oh i will take care of you you shall come and live with me you shall be my housekeeper or anything you like i will pension you for life  dear dear sir you think of everything and she seemed to fall abrooding  newman watched her a while and then he said suddenly ah mrs bread you are too fond of my lady  she looked at him as quickly i wouldnt have you say that sir i dont think it any part of my duty to be fond of my lady i have served her faithfully this many a year but if she were to die tomorrow i believe before heaven i shouldnt shed a tear for her then after a pause i have no reason to love her mrs bread added the most she has done for me has been not to turn me out of the house newman felt that decidedly his companion was more and more confidentialthat if luxury is corrupting mrs breads conservative habits were already relaxed by the spiritual comfort of this preconcerted interview in a remarkable locality with a freespoken millionaire all his native shrewdness admonished him that his part was simply to let her take her timelet the charm of the occasion work so he said nothing he only looked at her kindly mrs bread sat nursing her lean elbows my lady once did me a great wrong she went on at last she has a terrible tongue when she is vexed it was many a year ago but i have never forgotten it i have never mentioned it to a human creature i have kept my grudge to myself i dare say i have been wicked but my grudge has grown old with me it has grown good for nothing too i dare say but it has lived along as i have lived it will die when i dienot before  and what is your grudge newman asked  mrs bread dropped her eyes and hesitated if i were a foreigner sir i should make less of telling you it comes harder to a decent englishwoman but i sometimes think i have picked up too many foreign ways what i was telling you belongs to a time when i was much younger and very different looking to what i am now i had a very high color sir if you can believe it indeed i was a very smart lass my lady was younger too and the late marquis was youngest of alli mean in the way he went on sir he had a very high spirit he was a magnificent man he was fond of his pleasure like most foreigners and it must be owned that he sometimes went rather below him to take it my lady was often jealous and if youll believe it sir she did me the honor to be jealous of me one day i had a red ribbon in my cap and my lady flew out at me and ordered me to take it off she accused me of putting it on to make the marquis look at me i dont know that i was impertinent but i spoke up like an honest girl and didnt count my words a red ribbon indeed as if it was my ribbons the marquis looked at my lady knew afterwards that i was perfectly respectable but she never said a word to show that she believed it but the marquis did mrs bread presently added i took off my red ribbon and put it away in a drawer where i have kept it to this day its faded now its a very pale pink but there it lies my grudge has faded too the red has all gone out of it but it lies here yet and mrs bread stroked her black satin bodice  newman listened with interest to this decent narrative which seemed to have opened up the deeps of memory to his companion then as she remained silent and seemed to be losing herself in retrospective meditation upon her perfect respectability he ventured upon a short cut to his goal so madame de bellegarde was jealous i see and m de bellegarde admired pretty women without distinction of class i suppose one mustnt be hard upon him for they probably didnt all behave so properly as you but years afterwards it could hardly have been jealousy that turned madame de bellegarde into a criminal  mrs bread gave a weary sigh we are using dreadful words sir but i dont care now i see you have your idea and i have no will of my own my will was the will of my children as i called them but i have lost my children now they are deadi may say it of both of them and what should i care for the living what is any one in the house to me nowwhat am i to them my lady objects to meshe has objected to me these thirty years i should have been glad to be something to young madame de bellegarde though i never was nurse to the present marquis when he was a baby i was too young they wouldnt trust me with him but his wife told her own maid mamselle clarisse the opinion she had of me perhaps you would like to hear it sir  oh immensely said newman  she said that if i would sit in her childrens schoolroom i should do very well for a penwiper when things have come to that i dont think i need stand upon ceremony  decidedly not said newman go on mrs bread  mrs bread however relapsed again into troubled dumbness and all newman could do was to fold his arms and wait but at last she appeared to have set her memories in order it was when the late marquis was an old man and his eldest son had been two years married it was when the time came on for marrying mademoiselle claire thats the way they talk of it here you know sir the marquiss health was bad he was very much broken down my lady had picked out m de cintre for no good reason that i could see but there are reasons i very well know that are beyond me and you must be high in the world to understand them old m de cintre was very high and my lady thought him almost as good as herself thats saying a good deal mr urbain took sides with his mother as he always did the trouble i believe was that my lady would give very little money and all the other gentlemen asked more it was only m de cintre that was satisfied the lord willed it he should have that one soft spot it was the only one he had he may have been very grand in his birth and he certainly was very grand in his bows and speeches but that was all the grandeur he had i think he was like what i have heard of comedians not that i have ever seen one but i know he painted his face he might paint it all he would he could never make me like it the marquis couldnt abide him and declared that sooner than take such a husband as that mademoiselle claire should take none at all he and my lady had a great scene it came even to our ears in the servants hall it was not their first quarrel if the truth must be told they were not a loving couple but they didnt often come to words because i think neither of them thought the others doings worth the trouble my lady had long ago got over her jealousy and she had taken to indifference in this i must say they were well matched the marquis was very easygoing he had a most gentlemanly temper he got angry only once a year but then it was very bad he always took to bed directly afterwards this time i speak of he took to bed as usual but he never got up again im afraid the poor gentleman was paying for his dissipation isnt it true they mostly do sir when they get old my lady and mr urbain kept quiet but i know my lady wrote letters to m de cintre the marquis got worse and the doctors gave him up my lady she gave him up too and if the truth must be told she gave up gladly when once he was out of the way she could do what she pleased with her daughter and it was all arranged that my poor innocent child should be handed over to m de cintre you dont know what mademoiselle was in those days sir she was the sweetest young creature in france and knew as little of what was going on around her as the lamb does of the butcher i used to nurse the marquis and i was always in his room it was here at fleurieres in the autumn we had a doctor from paris who came and stayed two or three weeks in the house then there came two others and there was a consultation and these two others as i said declared that the marquis couldnt be saved after this they went off pocketing their fees but the other one stayed and did what he could the marquis himself kept crying out that he wouldnt die that he didnt want to die that he would live and look after his daughter mademoiselle claire and the viscountthat was mr valentin you knowwere both in the house the doctor was a clever manthat i could see myselfand i think he believed that the marquis might get well we took good care of him he and i between us and one day when my lady had almost ordered her mourning my patient suddenly began to mend he got better and better till the doctor said he was out of danger what was killing him was the dreadful fits of pain in his stomach but little by little they stopped and the poor marquis began to make his jokes again the doctor found something that gave him great comfortsome white stuff that we kept in a great bottle on the chimneypiece i used to give it to the marquis through a glass tube it always made him easier then the doctor went away after telling me to keep on giving him the mixture whenever he was bad after that there was a little doctor from poitiers who came every day so we were alone in the housemy lady and her poor husband and their three children young madame de bellegarde had gone away with her little girl to her mothers you know she is very lively and her maid told me that she didnt like to be where people were dying mrs bread paused a moment and then she went on with the same quiet consistency i think you have guessed sir that when the marquis began to turn my lady was disappointed and she paused again bending upon newman a face which seemed to grow whiter as the darkness settled down upon them  newman had listened eagerlywith an eagerness greater even than that with which he had bent his ear to valentin de bellegardes last words every now and then as his companion looked up at him she reminded him of an ancient tabby cat protracting the enjoyment of a dish of milk even her triumph was measured and decorous the faculty of exultation had been chilled by disuse she presently continued late one night i was sitting by the marquis in his room the great red room in the west tower he had been complaining a little and i gave him a spoonful of the doctors dose my lady had been there in the early part of the evening she sat far more than an hour by his bed then she went away and left me alone after midnight she came back and her eldest son was with her they went to the bed and looked at the marquis and my lady took hold of his hand then she turned to me and said he was not so well i remember how the marquis without saying anything lay staring at her i can see his white face at this moment in the great black square between the bedcurtains i said i didnt think he was very bad and she told me to go to bedshe would sit a while with him when the marquis saw me going he gave a sort of groan and called out to me not to leave him but mr urbain opened the door for me and pointed the way out the present marquisperhaps you have noticed sirhas a very proud way of giving orders and i was there to take orders i went to my room but i wasnt easy i couldnt tell you why i didnt undress i sat there waiting and listening for what would you have said sir i couldnt have told you for surely a poor gentleman might be comfortable with his wife and his son it was as if i expected to hear the marquis moaning after me again i listened but i heard nothing it was a very still night i never knew a night so still at last the very stillness itself seemed to frighten me and i came out of my room and went very softly downstairs in the anteroom outside of the marquiss chamber i found mr urbain walking up and down he asked me what i wanted and i said i came back to relieve my lady he said he would relieve my lady and ordered me back to bed but as i stood there unwilling to turn away the door of the room opened and my lady came out i noticed she was very pale she was very strange she looked a moment at the count and at me and then she held out her arms to the count he went to her and she fell upon him and hid her face i went quickly past her into the room and to the marquiss bed he was lying there very white with his eyes shut like a corpse i took hold of his hand and spoke to him and he felt to me like a dead man then i turned round my lady and mr urbain were there my poor bread said my lady m le marquis is gone mr urbain knelt down by the bed and said softly mon pere mon pere i thought it wonderful strange and asked my lady what in the world had happened and why she hadnt called me she said nothing had happened that she had only been sitting there with the marquis very quiet she had closed her eyes thinking she might sleep and she had slept she didnt know how long when she woke up he was dead its death my son its death she said to the count mr urbain said they must have the doctor immediately from poitiers and that he would ride off and fetch him he kissed his fathers face and then he kissed his mother and went away my lady and i stood there at the bedside as i looked at the poor marquis it came into my head that he was not dead that he was in a kind of swoon and then my lady repeated my poor bread its death its death and i said yes my lady its certainly death i said just the opposite to what i believed it was my notion then my lady said we must wait for the doctor and we sat there and waited it was a long time the poor marquis neither stirred nor changed i have seen death before said my lady and its terribly like this yes please my lady said i and i kept thinking the night wore away without the counts coming back and my lady began to be frightened she was afraid he had had an accident in the dark or met with some wild people at last she got so restless that she went below to watch in the court for her sons return i sat there alone and the marquis never stirred  here mrs bread paused again and the most artistic of romancers could not have been more effective newman made a movement as if he were turning over the page of a novel so he was dead he exclaimed  three days afterwards he was in his grave said mrs bread sententiously in a little while i went away to the front of the house and looked out into the court and there before long i saw mr urbain ride in alone i waited a bit to hear him come upstairs with his mother but they stayed below and i went back to the marquiss room i went to the bed and held up the light to him but i dont know why i didnt let the candlestick fall the marquiss eyes were openopen wide they were staring at me i knelt down beside him and took his hands and begged him to tell me in the name of wonder whether he was alive or dead still he looked at me a long time and then he made me a sign to put my ear close to him i am dead he said i am dead the marquise has killed me i was all in a tremble i didnt understand him he seemed both a man and a corpse if you can fancy sir but youll get well now sir i said and then he whispered again ever so weak i wouldnt get well for a kingdom i wouldnt be that womans husband again and then he said more he said she had murdered him i asked him what she had done to him but he only replied murder murder and shell kill my daughter he said my poor unhappy child and he begged me to prevent that and then he said that he was dying that he was dead i was afraid to move or to leave him i was almost dead myself all of a sudden he asked me to get a pencil and write for him and then i had to tell him that i couldnt manage a pencil he asked me to hold him up in bed while he wrote himself and i said he could never never do such a thing but he seemed to have a kind of terror that gave him strength i found a pencil in the room and a piece of paper and a book and i put the paper on the book and the pencil into his hand and moved the candle near him you will think all this very strange sir and very strange it was the strangest part of it was that i believed he was dying and that i was eager to help him to write i sat on the bed and put my arm round him and held him up i felt very strong i believe i could have lifted him and carried him it was a wonder how he wrote but he did write in a big scratching hand he almost covered one side of the paper it seemed a long time i suppose it was three or four minutes he was groaning terribly all the while then he said it was ended and i let him down upon his pillows and he gave me the paper and told me to fold it and hide it and give it to those who would act upon it whom do you mean i said who are those who will act upon it but he only groaned for an answer he couldnt speak for weakness in a few minutes he told me to go and look at the bottle on the chimneypiece i knew the bottle he meant the white stuff that was good for his stomach i went and looked at it but it was empty when i came back his eyes were open and he was staring at me but soon he closed them and he said no more i hid the paper in my dress i didnt look at what was written upon it though i can read very well sir if i havent any handwriting i sat down near the bed but it was nearly half an hour before my lady and the count came in the marquis looked as he did when they left him and i never said a word about his having been otherwise mr urbain said that the doctor had been called to a person in childbirth but that he promised to set out for fleurieres immediately in another half hour he arrived and as soon as he had examined the marquis he said that we had had a false alarm the poor gentleman was very low but he was still living i watched my lady and her son when he said this to see if they looked at each other and i am obliged to admit that they didnt the doctor said there was no reason he should die he had been going on so well and then he wanted to know how he had suddenly fallen off he had left him so very hearty my lady told her little story againwhat she had told mr urbain and meand the doctor looked at her and said nothing he stayed all the next day at the chateau and hardly left the marquis i was always there mademoiselle and mr valentin came and looked at their father but he never stirred it was a strange deathly stupor my lady was always about her face was as white as her husbands and she looked very proud as i had seen her look when her orders or her wishes had been disobeyed it was as if the poor marquis had defied her and the way she took it made me afraid of her the apothecary from poitiers kept the marquis along through the day and we waited for the other doctor from paris who as i told you had been staying at fleurieres they had telegraphed for him early in the morning and in the evening he arrived he talked a bit outside with the doctor from poitiers and then they came in to see the marquis together i was with him and so was mr urbain my lady had been to receive the doctor from paris and she didnt come back with him into the room he sat down by the marquis i can see him there now with his hand on the marquiss wrist and mr urbain watching him with a little lookingglass in his hand im sure hes better said the little doctor from poitiers im sure hell come back a few moments after he had said this the marquis opened his eyes as if he were waking up and looked at us from one to the other i saw him look at me very softly as youd say at the same moment my lady came in on tiptoe she came up to the bed and put in her head between me and the count the marquis saw her and gave a long most wonderful moan he said something we couldnt understand and he seemed to have a kind of spasm he shook all over and then closed his eyes and the doctor jumped up and took hold of my lady he held her for a moment a bit roughly the marquis was stone dead this time there were those there that knew  newman felt as if he had been reading by starlight the report of highly important evidence in a great murder case and the paperthe paper he said excitedly what was written upon it  i cant tell you sir answered mrs bread i couldnt read it it was in french  but could no one else read it  i never asked a human creature  no one has ever seen it  if you see it youll be the first  newman seized the old womans hand in both his own and pressed it vigorously i thank you ever so much for that he cried i want to be the first i want it to be my property and no one elses youre the wisest old woman in europe and what did you do with the paper this information had made him feel extraordinarily strong give it to me quick  mrs bread got up with a certain majesty it is not so easy as that sir if you want the paper you must wait  but waiting is horrible you know urged newman  i am sure i have waited i have waited these many years said mrs bread  that is very true you have waited for me i wont forget it and yet how comes it you didnt do as m de bellegarde said show the paper to some one  to whom should i show it answered mrs bread mournfully it was not easy to know and manys the night i have lain awake thinking of it six months afterwards when they married mademoiselle to her vicious old husband i was very near bringing it out i thought it was my duty to do something with it and yet i was mightily afraid i didnt know what was written on the paper or how bad it might be and there was no one i could trust enough to ask and it seemed to me a cruel kindness to do that sweet young creature letting her know that her father had written her mother down so shamefully for thats what he did i suppose i thought she would rather be unhappy with her husband than be unhappy that way it was for her and for my dear mr valentin i kept quiet quiet i call it but for me it was a weary quietness it worried me terribly and it changed me altogether but for others i held my tongue and no one to this hour knows what passed between the poor marquis and me  but evidently there were suspicions said newman where did mr valentin get his ideas  it was the little doctor from poitiers he was very illsatisfied and he made a great talk he was a sharp frenchman and coming to the house as he did day after day i suppose he saw more than he seemed to see and indeed the way the poor marquis went off as soon as his eyes fell on my lady was a most shocking sight for anyone the medical gentleman from paris was much more accommodating and he hushed up the other but for all he could do mr valentin and mademoiselle heard something they knew their fathers death was somehow against nature of course they couldnt accuse their mother and as i tell you i was as dumb as that stone mr valentin used to look at me sometimes and his eyes seemed to shine as if he were thinking of asking me something i was dreadfully afraid he would speak and i always looked away and went about my business if i were to tell him i was sure he would hate me afterwards and that i could never have borne once i went up to him and took a great liberty i kissed him as i had kissed him when he was a child you oughtnt to look so sad sir i said believe your poor old bread such a gallant handsome young man can have nothing to be sad about and i think he understood me he understood that i was begging off and he made up his mind in his own way he went about with his unasked question in his mind as i did with my untold tale we were both afraid of bringing dishonor on a great house and it was the same with mademoiselle she didnt know what happened she wouldnt know my lady and mr urbain asked me no questions because they had no reason i was as still as a mouse when i was younger my lady thought me a hussy and now she thought me a fool how should i have any ideas  but you say the little doctor from poitiers made a talk said newman did no one take it up  i heard nothing of it sir they are always talking scandal in these foreign countries you may have noticedand i suppose they shook their heads over madame de bellegarde but after all what could they say the marquis had been ill and the marquis had died he had as good a right to die as any one the doctor couldnt say he had not come honestly by his cramps the next year the little doctor left the place and bought a practice in bordeaux and if there has been any gossip it died out and i dont think there could have been much gossip about my lady that any one would listen to my lady is so very respectable  newman at this last affirmation broke into an immense resounding laugh mrs bread had begun to move away from the spot where they were sitting and he helped her through the aperture in the wall and along the homeward path yes he said my ladys respectability is delicious it will be a great crash they reached the empty space in front of the church where they stopped a moment looking at each other with something of an air of closer fellowshiplike two sociable conspirators but what was it said newman what was it she did to her husband she didnt stab him or poison him  i dont know sir no one saw it  unless it was mr urbain you say he was walking up and down outside the room perhaps he looked through the keyhole but no i think that with his mother he would take it on trust  you may be sure i have often thought of it said mrs bread i am sure she didnt touch him with her hands i saw nothing on him anywhere i believe it was in this way he had a fit of his great pain and he asked her for his medicine instead of giving it to him she went and poured it away before his eyes then he saw what she meant and weak and helpless as he was he was frightened he was terrified you want to kill me he said yes m le marquis i want to kill you says my lady and sits down and fixes her eyes upon him you know my ladys eyes i think sir it was with them she killed him it was with the terrible strong will she put into them it was like a frost on flowers  well you are a very intelligent woman you have shown great discretion said newman i shall value your services as housekeeper extremely  they had begun to descend the hill and mrs bread said nothing until they reached the foot newman strolled lightly beside her his head was thrown back and he was gazing at all the stars he seemed to himself to be riding his vengeance along the milky way so you are serious sir about that said mrs bread softly  about your living with me why of course i will take care of you to the end of your days you cant live with those people any longer and you oughtnt to you know after this you give me the paper and you move away  it seems very flighty in me to be taking a new place at this time of life observed mrs bread lugubriously but if you are going to turn the house upside down i would rather be out of it  oh said newman in the cheerful tone of a man who feels rich in alternatives i dont think i shall bring in the constables if thats what you mean whatever madame de bellegarde did i am afraid the law cant take hold of it but i am glad of that it leaves it altogether to me  you are a mighty bold gentleman sir murmured mrs bread looking at him round the edge of her great bonnet  he walked with her back to the chateau the curfew had tolled for the laborious villagers of fleurieres and the street was unlighted and empty she promised him that he should have the marquiss manuscript in half an hour mrs bread choosing not to go in by the great gate they passed round by a winding lane to a door in the wall of the park of which she had the key and which would enable her to enter the chateau from behind newman arranged with her that he should await outside the wall her return with the coveted document  she went in and his half hour in the dusky lane seemed very long but he had plenty to think about at last the door in the wall opened and mrs bread stood there with one hand on the latch and the other holding out a scrap of white paper folded small in a moment he was master of it and it had passed into his waistcoat pocket come and see me in paris he said we are to settle your future you know and i will translate poor m de bellegardes french to you never had he felt so grateful as at this moment for m nioches instructions  mrs breads dull eyes had followed the disappearance of the paper and she gave a heavy sigh well you have done what you would with me sir and i suppose you will do it again you must take care of me now you are a terribly positive gentleman  just now said newman im a terribly impatient gentleman and he bade her goodnight and walked rapidly back to the inn he ordered his vehicle to be prepared for his return to poitiers and then he shut the door of the common salle and strode toward the solitary lamp on the chimneypiece he pulled out the paper and quickly unfolded it it was covered with pencilmarks which at first in the feeble light seemed indistinct but newmans fierce curiosity forced a meaning from the tremulous signs the english of them was as follows   my wife has tried to kill me and she has done it i am dying dying horribly it is to marry my dear daughter to m de cintre with all my soul i protesti forbid it i am not insaneask the doctors ask mrs b it was alone with me here tonight she attacked me and put me to death it is murder if murder ever was ask the doctors  henriurbain de bellegarde    chapter xxiii   newman returned to paris the second day after his interview with mrs bread the morrow he had spent at poitiers reading over and over again the little document which he had lodged in his pocketbook and thinking what he would do in the circumstances and how he would do it he would not have said that poitiers was an amusing place yet the day seemed very short domiciled once more in the boulevard haussmann he walked over to the rue de luniversite and inquired of madame de bellegardes portress whether the marquise had come back the portress told him that she had arrived with m le marquis on the preceding day and further informed him that if he desired to enter madame de bellegarde and her son were both at home as she said these words the little whitefaced old woman who peered out of the dusky gatehouse of the hotel de bellegarde gave a small wicked smilea smile which seemed to newman to mean go in if you dare she was evidently versed in the current domestic history she was placed where she could feel the pulse of the house newman stood a moment twisting his mustache and looking at her then he abruptly turned away but this was not because he was afraid to go inthough he doubted whether if he did so he should be able to make his way unchallenged into the presence of madame de cintres relatives confidenceexcessive confidence perhapsquite as much as timidity prompted his retreat he was nursing his thunderbolt he loved it he was unwilling to part with it he seemed to be holding it aloft in the rumbling vaguelyflashing air directly over the heads of his victims and he fancied he could see their pale upturned faces few specimens of the human countenance had ever given him such pleasure as these lighted in the lurid fashion i have hinted at and he was disposed to sip the cup of contemplative revenge in a leisurely fashion it must be added too that he was at a loss to see exactly how he could arrange to witness the operation of his thunder to send in his card to madame de bellegarde would be a waste of ceremony she would certainly decline to receive him on the other hand he could not force his way into her presence it annoyed him keenly to think that he might be reduced to the blind satisfaction of writing her a letter but he consoled himself in a measure with the reflection that a letter might lead to an interview he went home and feeling rather tirednursing a vengeance was it must be confessed a rather fatiguing process it took a good deal out of oneflung himself into one of his brocaded fauteuils stretched his legs thrust his hands into his pockets and while he watched the reflected sunset fading from the ornate housetops on the opposite side of the boulevard began mentally to compose a cool epistle to madame de bellegarde while he was so occupied his servant threw open the door and announced ceremoniously madame brett  newman roused himself expectantly and in a few moments perceived upon his threshold the worthy woman with whom he had conversed to such good purpose on the starlit hilltop of fleurieres mrs bread had made for this visit the same toilet as for her former expedition newman was struck with her distinguished appearance his lamp was not lit and as her large grave face gazed at him through the light dusk from under the shadow of her ample bonnet he felt the incongruity of such a person presenting herself as a servant he greeted her with high geniality and bade her come in and sit down and make herself comfortable there was something which might have touched the springs both of mirth and of melancholy in the ancient maidenliness with which mrs bread endeavored to comply with these directions she was not playing at being fluttered which would have been simply ridiculous she was doing her best to carry herself as a person so humble that for her even embarrassment would have been pretentious but evidently she had never dreamed of its being in her horoscope to pay a visit at nightfall to a friendly single gentleman who lived in theatricallooking rooms on one of the new boulevards  i truly hope i am not forgetting my place sir she murmured  forgetting your place cried newman why you are remembering it this is your place you know you are already in my service your wages as housekeeper began a fortnight ago i can tell you my house wants keeping why dont you take off your bonnet and stay  take off my bonnet said mrs bread with timid literalness oh sir i havent my cap and with your leave sir i couldnt keep house in my best gown  never mind your gown said newman cheerfully you shall have a better gown than that  mrs bread stared solemnly and then stretched her hands over her lustreless satin skirt as if the perilous side of her situation were defining itself oh sir i am fond of my own clothes she murmured  i hope you have left those wicked people at any rate said newman  well sir here i am said mrs bread thats all i can tell you here i sit poor catherine bread its a strange place for me to be i dont know myself i never supposed i was so bold but indeed sir i have gone as far as my own strength will bear me  oh come mrs bread said newman almost caressingly dont make yourself uncomfortable nows the time to feel lively you know  she began to speak again with a trembling voice i think it would be more respectable if i couldif i couldand her voice trembled to a pause  if you could give up this sort of thing altogether said newman kindly trying to anticipate her meaning which he supposed might be a wish to retire from service  if i could give up everything sir all i should ask is a decent protestant burial  burial cried newman with a burst of laughter why to bury you now would be a sad piece of extravagance its only rascals who have to be buried to get respectable honest folks like you and me can live our time outand live together come did you bring your baggage  my box is locked and corded but i havent yet spoken to my lady  speak to her then and have done with it i should like to have your chance cried newman  i would gladly give it you sir i have passed some weary hours in my ladys dressingroom but this will be one of the longest she will tax me with ingratitude  well said newman so long as you can tax her with murder  oh sir i cant not i sighed mrs bread  you dont mean to say anything about it so much the better leave that to me  if she calls me a thankless old woman said mrs bread i shall have nothing to say but it is better so she softly added she shall be my lady to the last that will be more respectable  and then you will come to me and i shall be your gentleman said newman that will be more respectable still  mrs bread rose with lowered eyes and stood a moment then looking up she rested her eyes upon newmans face the disordered proprieties were somehow settling to rest she looked at newman so long and so fixedly with such a dull intense devotedness that he himself might have had a pretext for embarrassment at last she said gently you are not looking well sir  thats natural enough said newman i have nothing to feel well about to be very indifferent and very fierce very dull and very jovial very sick and very lively all at oncewhy it rather mixes one up  mrs bread gave a noiseless sigh i can tell you something that will make you feel duller still if you want to feel all one way about madame de cintre  what can you tell me newman demanded not that you have seen her  she shook her head no indeed sir nor ever shall thats the dullness of it nor my lady nor m de bellegarde  you mean that she is kept so close  close close said mrs bread very softly  these words for an instant seemed to check the beating of newmans heart he leaned back in his chair staring up at the old woman they have tried to see her and she wouldntshe couldnt  she refusedforever i had it from my ladys own maid said mrs bread who had it from my lady to speak of it to such a person my lady must have felt the shock madame de cintre wont see them now and now is her only chance a while hence she will have no chance  you mean the other womenthe mothers the daughters the sisters what is it they call themwont let her  it is what they call the rule of the houseor of the order i believe said mrs bread there is no rule so strict as that of the carmelites the bad women in the reformatories are fine ladies to them they wear old brown cloaksso the femme de chambre told methat you wouldnt use for a horse blanket and the poor countess was so fond of softfeeling dresses she would never have anything stiff they sleep on the ground mrs bread went on they are no better no betterand she hesitated for a comparisonthey are no better than tinkers wives they give up everything down to the very name their poor old nurses called them by they give up father and mother brother and sisterto say nothing of other persons mrs bread delicately added they wear a shroud under their brown cloaks and a rope round their waists and they get up on winter nights and go off into cold places to pray to the virgin mary the virgin mary is a hard mistress  mrs bread dwelling on these terrible facts sat dryeyed and pale with her hands clasped in her satin lap newman gave a melancholy groan and fell forward leaning his head on his hands there was a long silence broken only by the ticking of the great gilded clock on the chimneypiece  where is this placewhere is the convent newman asked at last looking up  there are two houses said mrs bread i found out i thought you would like to knowthough its poor comfort i think one is in the avenue de messine they have learned that madame de cintre is there the other is in the rue denfer thats a terrible name i suppose you know what it means  newman got up and walked away to the end of his long room when he came back mrs bread had got up and stood by the fire with folded hands tell me this he said can i get near hereven if i dont see her can i look through a grating or some such thing at the place where she is  it is said that all women love a lover and mrs breads sense of the preestablished harmony which kept servants in their place even as planets in their orbits not that mrs bread had ever consciously likened herself to a planet barely availed to temper the maternal melancholy with which she leaned her head on one side and gazed at her new employer she probably felt for the moment as if forty years before she had held him also in her arms that wouldnt help you sir it would only make her seem farther away  i want to go there at all events said newman avenue de messine you say and what is it they call themselves  carmelites said mrs bread  i shall remember that  mrs bread hesitated a moment and then its my duty to tell you this sir she went on the convent has a chapel and some people are admitted on sunday to the mass you dont see the poor creatures that are shut up there but i am told you can hear them sing its a wonder they have any heart for singing some sunday i shall make bold to go it seems to me i should know her voice in fifty  newman looked at his visitor very gratefully then he held out his hand and shook hers thank you he said if any one can get in i will a moment later mrs bread proposed deferentially to retire but he checked her and put a lighted candle into her hand there are half a dozen rooms there i dont use he said pointing through an open door go and look at them and take your choice you can live in the one you like best from this bewildering opportunity mrs bread at first recoiled but finally yielding to newmans gentle reassuring push she wandered off into the dusk with her tremulous taper she remained absent a quarter of an hour during which newman paced up and down stopped occasionally to look out of the window at the lights on the boulevard and then resumed his walk mrs breads relish for her investigation apparently increased as she proceeded but at last she reappeared and deposited her candlestick on the chimneypiece  well have you picked one out asked newman  a room sir they are all too fine for a dingy old body like me there isnt one that hasnt a bit of gilding  its only tinsel mrs bread said newman if you stay there a while it will all peel off of itself and he gave a dismal smile  oh sir there are things enough peeling off already rejoined mrs bread with a headshake since i was there i thought i would look about me i dont believe you know sir the corners are most dreadful you do want a housekeeper that you do you want a tidy englishwoman that isnt above taking hold of a broom  newman assured her that he suspected if he had not measured his domestic abuses and that to reform them was a mission worthy of her powers she held her candlestick aloft again and looked around the salon with compassionate glances then she intimated that she accepted the mission and that its sacred character would sustain her in her rupture with madame de bellegarde with this she curtsied herself away  she came back the next day with her worldly goods and newman going into his drawingroom found her upon her aged knees before a divan sewing up some detached fringe he questioned her as to her leavetaking with her late mistress and she said it had proved easier than she feared i was perfectly civil sir but the lord helped me to remember that a good woman has no call to tremble before a bad one  i should think so cried newman and does she know you have come to me  she asked me where i was going and i mentioned your name said mrs bread  what did she say to that  she looked at me very hard and she turned very red then she bade me leave her i was all ready to go and i had got the coachman who is an englishman to bring down my poor box and to fetch me a cab but when i went down myself to the gate i found it closed my lady had sent orders to the porter not to let me pass and by the same orders the porters wifeshe is a dreadful sly old bodyhad gone out in a cab to fetch home m de bellegarde from his club  newman slapped his knee she is scared she is scared he cried exultantly  i was frightened too sir said mrs bread but i was also mightily vexed i took it very high with the porter and asked him by what right he used violence to an honorable englishwoman who had lived in the house for thirty years before he was heard of oh sir i was very grand and i brought the man down he drew his bolts and let me out and i promised the cabman something handsome if he would drive fast but he was terribly slow it seemed as if we should never reach your blessed door i am all of a tremble still it took me five minutes just now to thread my needle  newman told her with a gleeful laugh that if she chose she might have a little maid on purpose to thread her needles and he went away murmuring to himself again that the old woman was scaredshe was scared  he had not shown mrs tristram the little paper that he carried in his pocketbook but since his return to paris he had seen her several times and she had told him that he seemed to her to be in a strange wayan even stranger way than his sad situation made natural had his disappointment gone to his head he looked like a man who was going to be ill and yet she had never seen him more restless and active one day he would sit hanging his head and looking as if he were firmly resolved never to smile again another he would indulge in laughter that was almost unseemly and make jokes that were bad even for him if he was trying to carry off his sorrow he at such times really went too far she begged him of all things not to be strange feeling in a measure responsible as she did for the affair which had turned out so ill for him she could endure anything but his strangeness he might be melancholy if he would or he might be stoical he might be cross and cantankerous with her and ask her why she had ever dared to meddle with his destiny to this she would submit for this she would make allowances only for heavens sake let him not be incoherent that would be extremely unpleasant it was like people talking in their sleep they always frightened her and mrs tristram intimated that taking very high ground as regards the moral obligation which events had laid upon her she proposed not to rest quiet until she should have confronted him with the least inadequate substitute for madame de cintre that the two hemispheres contained  oh said newman we are even now and we had better not open a new account you may bury me some day but you shall never marry me its too rough i hope at any rate he added that there is nothing incoherent in thisthat i want to go next sunday to the carmelite chapel in the avenue de messine you know one of the catholic ministersan abbe is that iti have seen him here you know that motherly old gentleman with the big waistband please ask him if i need a special leave to go in and if i do beg him to obtain it for me  mrs tristram gave expression to the liveliest joy i am so glad you have asked me to do something she cried you shall get into the chapel if the abbe is disfrocked for his share in it and two days afterwards she told him that it was all arranged the abbe was enchanted to serve him and if he would present himself civilly at the convent gate there would be no difficulty    chapter xxiv   sunday was as yet two days off but meanwhile to beguile his impatience newman took his way to the avenue de messine and got what comfort he could in staring at the blank outer wall of madame de cintres present residence the street in question as some travelers will remember adjoins the parc monceau which is one of the prettiest corners of paris the quarter has an air of modern opulence and convenience which seems at variance with the ascetic institution and the impression made upon newmans gloomilyirritated gaze by the freshlooking windowless expanse behind which the woman he loved was perhaps even then pledging herself to pass the rest of her days was less exasperating than he had feared the place suggested a convent with the modern improvementsan asylum in which privacy though unbroken might be not quite identical with privation and meditation though monotonous might be of a cheerful cast and yet he knew the case was otherwise only at present it was not a reality to him it was too strange and too mocking to be real it was like a page torn out of a romance with no context in his own experience  on sunday morning at the hour which mrs tristram had indicated he rang at the gate in the blank wall it instantly opened and admitted him into a clean coldlooking court from beyond which a dull plain edifice looked down upon him a robust lay sister with a cheerful complexion emerged from a porters lodge and on his stating his errand pointed to the open door of the chapel an edifice which occupied the right side of the court and was preceded by the high flight of steps newman ascended the steps and immediately entered the open door service had not yet begun the place was dimly lighted and it was some moments before he could distinguish its features then he saw it was divided by a large close iron screen into two unequal portions the altar was on the hither side of the screen and between it and the entrance were disposed several benches and chairs three or four of these were occupied by vague motionless figuresfigures that he presently perceived to be women deeply absorbed in their devotion the place seemed to newman very cold the smell of the incense itself was cold besides this there was a twinkle of tapers and here and there a glow of colored glass newman seated himself the praying women kept still with their backs turned he saw they were visitors like himself and he would have liked to see their faces for he believed that they were the mourning mothers and sisters of other women who had had the same pitiless courage as madame de cintre but they were better off than he for they at least shared the faith to which the others had sacrificed themselves three or four persons came in two of them were elderly gentlemen every one was very quiet newman fastened his eyes upon the screen behind the altar that was the convent the real convent the place where she was but he could see nothing no light came through the crevices he got up and approached the partition very gently trying to look through but behind it there was darkness with nothing stirring he went back to his place and after that a priest and two altar boys came in and began to say mass newman watched their genuflections and gyrations with a grim still enmity they seemed aids and abettors of madame de cintres desertion they were mouthing and droning out their triumph the priests long dismal intonings acted upon his nerves and deepened his wrath there was something defiant in his unintelligible drawl it seemed meant for newman himself suddenly there arose from the depths of the chapel from behind the inexorable grating a sound which drew his attention from the altarthe sound of a strange lugubrious chant uttered by womens voices it began softly but it presently grew louder and as it increased it became more of a wail and a dirge it was the chant of the carmelite nuns their only human utterance it was their dirge over their buried affections and over the vanity of earthly desires at first newman was bewilderedalmost stunnedby the strangeness of the sound then as he comprehended its meaning he listened intently and his heart began to throb he listened for madame de cintres voice and in the very heart of the tuneless harmony he imagined he made it out we are obliged to believe that he was wrong inasmuch as she had obviously not yet had time to become a member of the invisible sisterhood the chant kept on mechanical and monotonous with dismal repetitions and despairing cadences it was hideous it was horrible as it continued newman felt that he needed all his selfcontrol he was growing more agitated he felt tears in his eyes at last as in its full force the thought came over him that this confused impersonal wail was all that either he or the world she had deserted should ever hear of the voice he had found so sweet he felt that he could bear it no longer he rose abruptly and made his way out on the threshold he paused listened again to the dreary strain and then hastily descended into the court as he did so he saw the good sister with the highcolored cheeks and the fanlike frill to her coiffure who had admitted him was in conference at the gate with two persons who had just come in a second glance informed him that these persons were madame de bellegarde and her son and that they were about to avail themselves of that method of approach to madame de cintre which newman had found but a mockery of consolation as he crossed the court m de bellegarde recognized him the marquis was coming to the steps leading his mother the old lady also gave newman a look and it resembled that of her son both faces expressed a franker perturbation something more akin to the humbleness of dismay than newman had yet seen in them evidently he startled the bellegardes and they had not their grand behavior immediately in hand newman hurried past them guided only by the desire to get out of the convent walls and into the street the gate opened itself at his approach he strode over the threshold and it closed behind him a carriage which appeared to have been standing there was just turning away from the sidewalk newman looked at it for a moment blankly then he became conscious through the dusky mist that swam before his eyes that a lady seated in it was bowing to him the vehicle had turned away before he recognized her it was an ancient landau with one half the cover lowered the ladys bow was very positive and accompanied with a smile a little girl was seated beside her he raised his hat and then the lady bade the coachman stop the carriage halted again beside the pavement and she sat there and beckoned to newmanbeckoned with the demonstrative grace of madame urbain de bellegarde newman hesitated a moment before he obeyed her summons during this moment he had time to curse his stupidity for letting the others escape him he had been wondering how he could get at them fool that he was for not stopping them then and there what better place than beneath the very prison walls to which they had consigned the promise of his joy he had been too bewildered to stop them but now he felt ready to wait for them at the gate madame urbain with a certain attractive petulance beckoned to him again and this time he went over to the carriage she leaned out and gave him her hand looking at him kindly and smiling  ah monsieur she said you dont include me in your wrath i had nothing to do with it  oh i dont suppose you could have prevented it newman answered in a tone which was not that of studied gallantry  what you say is too true for me to resent the small account it makes of my influence i forgive you at any rate because you look as if you had seen a ghost  i have said newman  i am glad then i didnt go in with madame de bellegarde and my husband you must have seen them eh was the meeting affectionate did you hear the chanting they say its like the lamentations of the damned i wouldnt go in one is certain to hear that soon enough poor clairein a white shroud and a big brown cloak thats the toilette of the carmelites you know well she was always fond of long loose things but i must not speak of her to you only i must say that i am very sorry for you that if i could have helped you i would and that i think every one has been very shabby i was afraid of it you know i felt it in the air for a fortnight before it came when i saw you at my motherinlaws ball taking it all so easily i felt as if you were dancing on your grave but what could i do i wish you all the good i can think of you will say that isnt much yes they have been very shabby i am not a bit afraid to say it i assure you every one thinks so we are not all like that i am sorry i am not going to see you again you know i think you very good company i would prove it by asking you to get into the carriage and drive with me for a quarter of an hour while i wait for my motherinlaw only if we were seenconsidering what has passed and every one knows you have been turned awayit might be thought i was going a little too far even for me but i shall see you sometimessomewhere eh you knowthis was said in englishwe have a plan for a little amusement  newman stood there with his hand on the carriagedoor listening to this consolatory murmur with an unlighted eye he hardly knew what madame de bellegarde was saying he was only conscious that she was chattering ineffectively but suddenly it occurred to him that with her pretty professions there was a way of making her effective she might help him to get at the old woman and the marquis they are coming back soonyour companions he said you are waiting for them  they will hear the mass out there is nothing to keep them longer claire has refused to see them  i want to speak to them said newman and you can help me you can do me a favor delay your return for five minutes and give me a chance at them i will wait for them here  madame de bellegarde clasped her hands with a tender grimace my poor friend what do you want to do to them to beg them to come back to you it will be wasted words they will never come back  i want to speak to them all the same pray do what i ask you stay away and leave them to me for five minutes you neednt be afraid i shall not be violent i am very quiet  yes you look very quiet if they had le coeur tendre you would move them but they havent however i will do better for you than what you propose the understanding is not that i shall come back for them i am going into the parc monceau with my little girl to give her a walk and my motherinlaw who comes so rarely into this quarter is to profit by the same opportunity to take the air we are to wait for her in the park where my husband is to bring her to us follow me now just within the gates i shall get out of my carriage sit down on a chair in some quiet corner and i will bring them near you theres devotion for you le reste vous regarde  this proposal seemed to newman extremely felicitous it revived his drooping spirit and he reflected that madame urbain was not such a goose as she seemed he promised immediately to overtake her and the carriage drove away  the parc monceau is a very pretty piece of landscapegardening but newman passing into it bestowed little attention upon its elegant vegetation which was full of the freshness of spring he found madame de bellegarde promptly seated in one of the quiet corners of which she had spoken while before her in the alley her little girl attended by the footman and the lapdog walked up and down as if she were taking a lesson in deportment newman sat down beside the mamma and she talked a great deal apparently with the design of convincing him thatif he would only see itpoor dear claire did not belong to the most fascinating type of woman she was too tall and thin too stiff and cold her mouth was too wide and her nose too narrow she had no dimples anywhere and then she was eccentric eccentric in cold blood she was an anglaise after all newman was very impatient he was counting the minutes until his victims should reappear he sat silent leaning upon his cane looking absently and insensibly at the little marquise at length madame de bellegarde said she would walk toward the gate of the park and meet her companions but before she went she dropped her eyes and after playing a moment with the lace of her sleeve looked up again at newman  do you remember she asked the promise you made me three weeks ago and then as newman vainly consulting his memory was obliged to confess that the promise had escaped it she declared that he had made her at the time a very queer answeran answer at which viewing it in the light of the sequel she had fair ground for taking offense you promised to take me to bulliers after your marriage after your marriageyou made a great point of that three days after that your marriage was broken off do you know when i heard the news the first thing i said to myself oh heaven now he wont go with me to bulliers and i really began to wonder if you had not been expecting the rupture  oh my dear lady murmured newman looking down the path to see if the others were not coming  i shall be goodnatured said madame de bellegarde one must not ask too much of a gentleman who is in love with a cloistered nun besides i cant go to bulliers while we are in mourning but i havent given it up for that the partie is arranged i have my cavalier lord deepmere if you please he has gone back to his dear dublin but a few months hence i am to name any evening and he will come over from ireland on purpose thats what i call gallantry  shortly after this madame de bellegarde walked away with her little girl newman sat in his place the time seemed terribly long he felt how fiercely his quarter of an hour in the convent chapel had raked over the glowing coals of his resentment madame de bellegarde kept him waiting but she proved as good as her word at last she reappeared at the end of the path with her little girl and her footman beside her slowly walked her husband with his mother on his arm they were a long time advancing during which newman sat unmoved tingling as he was with passion it was extremely characteristic of him that he was able to moderate his expression of it as he would have turned down a flaring gasburner his native coolness shrewdness and deliberateness his lifelong submissiveness to the sentiment that words were acts and acts were steps in life and that in this matter of taking steps curveting and prancing were exclusively reserved for quadrupeds and foreignersall this admonished him that rightful wrath had no connection with being a fool and indulging in spectacular violence so as he rose when old madame de bellegarde and her son were close to him he only felt very tall and light he had been sitting beside some shrubbery in such a way as not to be noticeable at a distance but m de bellegarde had evidently already perceived him his mother and he were holding their course but newman stepped in front of them and they were obliged to pause he lifted his hat slightly and looked at them for a moment they were pale with amazement and disgust  excuse me for stopping you he said in a low tone but i must profit by the occasion i have ten words to say to you will you listen to them  the marquis glared at him and then turned to his mother can mr newman possibly have anything to say that is worth our listening to  i assure you i have something said newman besides it is my duty to say it its a notificationa warning  your duty said old madame de bellegarde her thin lips curving like scorched paper that is your affair not ours  madame urbain meanwhile had seized her little girl by the hand with a gesture of surprise and impatience which struck newman intent as he was upon his own words with its dramatic effectiveness if mr newman is going to make a scene in public she exclaimed i will take my poor child out of the melee she is too young to see such naughtiness and she instantly resumed her walk  you had much better listen to me newman went on whether you do or not things will be disagreeable for you but at any rate you will be prepared  we have already heard something of your threats said the marquis and you know what we think of them  you think a good deal more than you admit a moment newman added in reply to an exclamation of the old lady i remember perfectly that we are in a public place and you see i am very quiet i am not going to tell your secret to the passersby i shall keep it to begin with for certain picked listeners any one who observes us will think that we are having a friendly chat and that i am complimenting you madam on your venerable virtues  the marquis gave three short sharp raps on the ground with his stick i demand of you to step out of our path he hissed  newman instantly complied and m de bellegarde stepped forward with his mother then newman said half an hour hence madame de bellegarde will regret that she didnt learn exactly what i mean  the marquise had taken a few steps but at these words she paused looking at newman with eyes like two scintillating globules of ice you are like a peddler with something to sell she said with a little cold laugh which only partially concealed the tremor in her voice  oh no not to sell newman rejoined i give it to you for nothing and he approached nearer to her looking her straight in the eyes you killed your husband he said almost in a whisper that is you tried once and failed and then without trying you succeeded  madame de bellegarde closed her eyes and gave a little cough which as a piece of dissimulation struck newman as really heroic dear mother said the marquis does this stuff amuse you so much  the rest is more amusing said newman you had better not lose it  madame de bellegarde opened her eyes the scintillations had gone out of them they were fixed and dead but she smiled superbly with her narrow little lips and repeated newmans word amusing have i killed some one else  i dont count your daughter said newman though i might your husband knew what you were doing i have a proof of it whose existence you have never suspected and he turned to the marquis who was terribly whitewhiter than newman had ever seen any one out of a picture a paper written by the hand and signed with the name of henriurbain de bellegarde written after you madame had left him for dead and while you sir had gonenot very fastfor the doctor  the marquis looked at his mother she turned away looking vaguely round her i must sit down she said in a low tone going toward the bench on which newman had been sitting  couldnt you have spoken to me alone said the marquis to newman with a strange look  well yes if i could have been sure of speaking to your mother alone too newman answered but i have had to take you as i could get you  madame de bellegarde with a movement very eloquent of what he would have called her grit her steelcold pluck and her instinctive appeal to her own personal resources drew her hand out of her sons arm and went and seated herself upon the bench there she remained with her hands folded in her lap looking straight at newman the expression of her face was such that he fancied at first that she was smiling but he went and stood in front of her and saw that her elegant features were distorted by agitation he saw however equally that she was resisting her agitation with all the rigor of her inflexible will and there was nothing like either fear or submission in her stony stare she had been startled but she was not terrified newman had an exasperating feeling that she would get the better of him still he would not have believed it possible that he could so utterly fail to be touched by the sight of a woman criminal or other in so tight a place madame de bellegarde gave a glance at her son which seemed tantamount to an injunction to be silent and leave her to her own devices the marquis stood beside her with his hands behind him looking at newman  what paper is this you speak of asked the old lady with an imitation of tranquillity which would have been applauded in a veteran actress  exactly what i have told you said newman a paper written by your husband after you had left him for dead and during the couple of hours before you returned you see he had the time you shouldnt have stayed away so long it declares distinctly his wifes murderous intent  i should like to see it madame de bellegarde observed  i thought you might said newman and i have taken a copy and he drew from his waistcoat pocket a small folded sheet  give it to my son said madame de bellegarde newman handed it to the marquis whose mother glancing at him said simply look at it m de bellegardes eyes had a pale eagerness which it was useless for him to try to dissimulate he took the paper in his lightgloved fingers and opened it there was a silence during which he read it he had more than time to read it but still he said nothing he stood staring at it where is the original asked madame de bellegarde in a voice which was really a consummate negation of impatience  in a very safe place of course i cant show you that said newman you might want to take hold of it he added with conscious quaintness but thats a very correct copyexcept of course the handwriting i am keeping the original to show some one else  m de bellegarde at last looked up and his eyes were still very eager to whom do you mean to show it  well im thinking of beginning with the duchess said newman that stout lady i saw at your ball she asked me to come and see her you know i thought at the moment i shouldnt have much to say to her but my little document will give us something to talk about  you had better keep it my son said madame de bellegarde  by all means said newman keep it and show it to your mother when you get home  and after showing it to the duchessasked the marquis folding the paper and putting it away  well ill take up the dukes said newman then the counts and the baronsall the people you had the cruelty to introduce me to in a character of which you meant immediately to deprive me i have made out a list  for a moment neither madame de bellegarde nor her son said a word the old lady sat with her eyes upon the ground m de bellegardes blanched pupils were fixed upon her face then looking at newman is that all you have to say she asked  no i want to say a few words more i want to say that i hope you quite understand what im about this is my revenge you know you have treated me before the worldconvened for the express purposeas if i were not good enough for you i mean to show the world that however bad i may be you are not quite the people to say it  madame de bellegarde was silent again and then she broke her silence her selfpossession continued to be extraordinary i neednt ask you who has been your accomplice mrs bread told me that you had purchased her services  dont accuse mrs bread of venality said newman she has kept your secret all these years she has given you a long respite it was beneath her eyes your husband wrote that paper he put it into her hands with a solemn injunction that she was to make it public she was too goodhearted to make use of it  the old lady appeared for an instant to hesitate and then she was my husbands mistress she said softly this was the only concession to selfdefense that she condescended to make  i doubt that said newman  madame de bellegarde got up from her bench it was not to your opinions i undertook to listen and if you have nothing left but them to tell me i think this remarkable interview may terminate and turning to the marquis she took his arm again my son she said say something  m de bellegarde looked down at his mother passing his hand over his forehead and then tenderly caressingly what shall i say he asked  there is only one thing to say said the marquise that it was really not worth while to have interrupted our walk  but the marquis thought he could improve this your papers a forgery he said to newman  newman shook his head a little with a tranquil smile m de bellegarde he said your mother does better she has done better all along from the first of my knowing you youre a mighty plucky woman madam he continued its a great pity you have made me your enemy i should have been one of your greatest admirers  mon pauvre ami said madame de bellegarde to her son in french and as if she had not heard these words you must take me immediately to my carriage  newman stepped back and let them leave him he watched them a moment and saw madame urbain with her little girl come out of a bypath to meet them the old lady stooped and kissed her grandchild damn it she is plucky said newman and he walked home with a slight sense of being balked she was so inexpressively defiant but on reflection he decided that what he had witnessed was no real sense of security still less a real innocence it was only a very superior style of brazen assurance wait till she reads the paper he said to himself and he concluded that he should hear from her soon  he heard sooner than he expected the next morning before midday when he was about to give orders for his breakfast to be served m de bellegardes card was brought to him she has read the paper and she has passed a bad night said newman he instantly admitted his visitor who came in with the air of the ambassador of a great power meeting the delegate of a barbarous tribe whom an absurd accident had enabled for the moment to be abominably annoying the ambassador at all events had passed a bad night and his faultlessly careful toilet only threw into relief the frigid rancor in his eyes and the mottled tones of his refined complexion he stood before newman a moment breathing quickly and softly and shaking his forefinger curtly as his host pointed to a chair  what i have come to say is soon said he declared and can only be said without ceremony  i am good for as much or for as little as you desire said newman  the marquis looked round the room a moment and then on what terms will you part with your scrap of paper  on none and while newman with his head on one side and his hands behind him sounded the marquiss turbid gaze with his own he added certainly that is not worth sitting down about  m de bellegarde meditated a moment as if he had not heard newmans refusal my mother and i last evening he said talked over your story you will be surprised to learn that we think your little document isaand he held back his word a momentis genuine  you forget that with you i am used to surprises exclaimed newman with a laugh  the very smallest amount of respect that we owe to my fathers memory the marquis continued makes us desire that he should not be held up to the world as the author of soso infernal an attack upon the reputation of a wife whose only fault was that she had been submissive to accumulated injury  oh i see said newman its for your fathers sake and he laughed the laugh in which he indulged when he was most amuseda noiseless laugh with his lips closed  but m de bellegardes gravity held good there are a few of my fathers particular friends for whom the knowledge of soso unfortunate aninspirationwould be a real grief even say we firmly established by medical evidence the presumption of a mind disordered by fever il en resterait quelque chose at the best it would look ill in him very ill  dont try medical evidence said newman dont touch the doctors and they wont touch you i dont mind your knowing that i have not written to them  newman fancied that he saw signs in m de bellegardes discolored mask that this information was extremely pertinent but it may have been merely fancy for the marquis remained majestically argumentative for instance madame doutreville he said of whom you spoke yesterday i can imagine nothing that would shock her more  oh i am quite prepared to shock madame doutreville you know thats on the cards i expect to shock a great many people  m de bellegarde examined for a moment the stitching on the back of one of his gloves then without looking up we dont offer you money he said that we supposed to be useless  newman turning away took a few turns about the room and then came back what do you offer me by what i can make out the generosity is all to be on my side  the marquis dropped his arms at his side and held his head a little higher what we offer you is a chancea chance that a gentleman should appreciate a chance to abstain from inflicting a terrible blot upon the memory of a man who certainly had his faults but who personally had done you no wrong  there are two things to say to that said newman the first is as regards appreciating your chance that you dont consider me a gentleman thats your great point you know its a poor rule that wont work both ways the second is thatwell in a word you are talking great nonsense  newman who in the midst of his bitterness had as i have said kept well before his eyes a certain ideal of saying nothing rude was immediately somewhat regretfully conscious of the sharpness of these words but he speedily observed that the marquis took them more quietly than might have been expected m de bellegarde like the stately ambassador that he was continued the policy of ignoring what was disagreeable in his adversarys replies he gazed at the gilded arabesques on the opposite wall and then presently transferred his glance to newman as if he too were a large grotesque in a rather vulgar system of chamberdecoration i suppose you know that as regards yourself it wont do at all  how do you mean it wont do  why of course you damn yourself but i suppose thats in your programme you propose to throw mud at us you believe you hope that some of it may stick we know of course it cant explained the marquis in a tone of conscious lucidity but you take the chance and are willing at any rate to show that you yourself have dirty hands  thats a good comparison at least half of it is said newman i take the chance of something sticking but as regards my hands they are clean i have taken the matter up with my fingertips  m de bellegarde looked a moment into his hat all our friends are quite with us he said they would have done exactly as we have done  i shall believe that when i hear them say it meanwhile i shall think better of human nature  the marquis looked into his hat again madame de cintre was extremely fond of her father if she knew of the existence of the few written words of which you propose to make this scandalous use she would demand of you proudly for his sake to give it up to her and she would destroy it without reading it  very possibly newman rejoined but she will not know i was in that convent yesterday and i know what she is doing lord deliver us you can guess whether it made me feel forgiving  m de bellegarde appeared to have nothing more to suggest but he continued to stand there rigid and elegant as a man who believed that his mere personal presence had an argumentative value newman watched him and without yielding an inch on the main issue felt an incongruously goodnatured impulse to help him to retreat in good order  your visits a failure you see he said you offer too little  propose something yourself said the marquis  give me back madame de cintre in the same state in which you took her from me  m de bellegarde threw back his head and his pale face flushed never he said  you cant  we wouldnt if we could in the sentiment which led us to deprecate her marriage nothing is changed  deprecate is good cried newman it was hardly worth while to come here only to tell me that you are not ashamed of yourselves i could have guessed that  the marquis slowly walked toward the door and newman following opened it for him what you propose to do will be very disagreeable m de bellegarde said that is very evident but it will be nothing more  as i understand it newman answered that will be quite enough  m de bellegarde stood for a moment looking on the ground as if he were ransacking his ingenuity to see what else he could do to save his fathers reputation then with a little cold sigh he seemed to signify that he regretfully surrendered the late marquis to the penalty of his turpitude he gave a hardly perceptible shrug took his neat umbrella from the servant in the vestibule and with his gentlemanly walk passed out newman stood listening till he heard the door close then he slowly exclaimed well i ought to begin to be satisfied now    chapter xxv   newman called upon the comical duchess and found her at home an old gentleman with a high nose and a goldheaded cane was just taking leave of her he made newman a protracted obeisance as he retired and our hero supposed that he was one of the mysterious grandees with whom he had shaken hands at madame de bellegardes ball the duchess in her armchair from which she did not move with a great flowerpot on one side of her a pile of pinkcovered novels on the other and a large piece of tapestry depending from her lap presented an expansive and imposing front but her aspect was in the highest degree gracious and there was nothing in her manner to check the effusion of his confidence she talked to him about flowers and books getting launched with marvelous promptitude about the theatres about the peculiar institutions of his native country about the humidity of paris about the pretty complexions of the american ladies about his impressions of france and his opinion of its female inhabitants all this was a brilliant monologue on the part of the duchess who like many of her countrywomen was a person of an affirmative rather than an interrogative cast of mind who made mots and put them herself into circulation and who was apt to offer you a present of a convenient little opinion neatly enveloped in the gilt paper of a happy gallicism newman had come to her with a grievance but he found himself in an atmosphere in which apparently no cognizance was taken of grievance an atmosphere into which the chill of discomfort had never penetrated and which seemed exclusively made up of mild sweet stale intellectual perfumes the feeling with which he had watched madame doutreville at the treacherous festival of the bellegardes came back to him she struck him as a wonderful old lady in a comedy particularly well up in her part he observed before long that she asked him no questions about their common friends she made no allusion to the circumstances under which he had been presented to her she neither feigned ignorance of a change in these circumstances nor pretended to condole with him upon it but she smiled and discoursed and compared the tendertinted wools of her tapestry as if the bellegardes and their wickedness were not of this world she is fighting shy said newman to himself and having made the observation he was prompted to observe farther how the duchess would carry off her indifference she did so in a masterly manner there was not a gleam of disguised consciousness in those small clear demonstrative eyes which constituted her nearest claim to personal loveliness there was not a symptom of apprehension that newman would trench upon the ground she proposed to avoid upon my word she does it very well he tacitly commented they all hold together bravely and whether any one else can trust them or not they can certainly trust each other  newman at this juncture fell to admiring the duchess for her fine manners he felt most accurately that she was not a grain less urbane than she would have been if his marriage were still in prospect but he felt also that she was not a particle more urbane he had come so reasoned the duchessheaven knew why he had come after what had happened and for the half hour therefore she would be charmante but she would never see him again finding no readymade opportunity to tell his story newman pondered these things more dispassionately than might have been expected he stretched his legs as usual and even chuckled a little appreciatively and noiselessly and then as the duchess went on relating a mot with which her mother had snubbed the great napoleon it occurred to newman that her evasion of a chapter of french history more interesting to himself might possibly be the result of an extreme consideration for his feelings perhaps it was delicacy on the duchesss partnot policy he was on the point of saying something himself to make the chance which he had determined to give her still better when the servant announced another visitor the duchess on hearing the nameit was that of an italian princegave a little imperceptible pout and said to newman rapidly i beg you to remain i desire this visit to be short newman said to himself at this that madame doutreville intended after all that they should discuss the bellegardes together  the prince was a short stout man with a head disproportionately large he had a dusky complexion and a bushy eyebrow beneath which his eye wore a fixed and somewhat defiant expression he seemed to be challenging you to insinuate that he was topheavy the duchess judging from her charge to newman regarded him as a bore but this was not apparent from the unchecked flow of her conversation she made a fresh series of mots characterized with great felicity the italian intellect and the taste of the figs at sorrento predicted the ultimate future of the italian kingdom disgust with the brutal sardinian rule and complete reversion throughout the peninsula to the sacred sway of the holy father and finally gave a history of the love affairs of the princess x this narrative provoked some rectifications on the part of the prince who as he said pretended to know something about that matter and having satisfied himself that newman was in no laughing mood either with regard to the size of his head or anything else he entered into the controversy with an animation for which the duchess when she set him down as a bore could not have been prepared the sentimental vicissitudes of the princess xled to a discussion of the heart history of florentine nobility in general the duchess had spent five weeks in florence and had gathered much information on the subject this was merged in turn in an examination of the italian heart per se the duchess took a brilliantly heterodox viewthought it the least susceptible organ of its kind that she had ever encountered related examples of its want of susceptibility and at last declared that for her the italians were a people of ice the prince became flame to refute her and his visit really proved charming newman was naturally out of the conversation he sat with his head a little on one side watching the interlocutors the duchess as she talked frequently looked at him with a smile as if to intimate in the charming manner of her nation that it lay only with him to say something very much to the point but he said nothing at all and at last his thoughts began to wander a singular feeling came over hima sudden sense of the folly of his errand what under the sun had he to say to the duchess after all wherein would it profit him to tell her that the bellegardes were traitors and that the old lady into the bargain was a murderess he seemed morally to have turned a sort of somersault and to find things looking differently in consequence he felt a sudden stiffening of his will and quickening of his reserve what in the world had he been thinking of when he fancied the duchess could help him and that it would conduce to his comfort to make her think ill of the bellegardes what did her opinion of the bellegardes matter to him it was only a shade more important than the opinion the bellegardes entertained of her the duchess help himthat cold stout soft artificial woman help himshe who in the last twenty minutes had built up between them a wall of polite conversation in which she evidently flattered herself that he would never find a gate had it come to thatthat he was asking favors of conceited people and appealing for sympathy where he had no sympathy to give he rested his arms on his knees and sat for some minutes staring into his hat as he did so his ears tingledhe had come very near being an ass whether or no the duchess would hear his story he wouldnt tell it was he to sit there another half hour for the sake of exposing the bellegardes the bellegardes be hanged he got up abruptly and advanced to shake hands with his hostess  you cant stay longer she asked very graciously  i am afraid not he said  she hesitated a moment and then i had an idea you had something particular to say to me she declared  newman looked at her he felt a little dizzy for the moment he seemed to be turning his somersault again the little italian prince came to his help ah madam who has not that he softly sighed  dont teach mr newman to say fadaises said the duchess it is his merit that he doesnt know how  yes i dont know how to say fadaises said newman and i dont want to say anything unpleasant  i am sure you are very considerate said the duchess with a smile and she gave him a little nod for goodby with which he took his departure  once in the street he stood for some time on the pavement wondering whether after all he was not an ass not to have discharged his pistol and then again he decided that to talk to any one whomsoever about the bellegardes would be extremely disagreeable to him the least disagreeable thing under the circumstances was to banish them from his mind and never think of them again indecision had not hitherto been one of newmans weaknesses and in this case it was not of long duration for three days after this he did not or at least he tried not to think of the bellegardes he dined with mrs tristram and on her mentioning their name he begged her almost severely to desist this gave tom tristram a muchcoveted opportunity to offer his condolences  he leaned forward laying his hand on newmans arm compressing his lips and shaking his head the fact is my dear fellow you see that you ought never to have gone into it it was not your doing i knowit was all my wife if you want to come down on her ill stand off i give you leave to hit her as hard as you like you know she has never had a word of reproach from me in her life and i think she is in need of something of the kind why didnt you listen to me you know i didnt believe in the thing i thought it at the best an amiable delusion i dont profess to be a don juan or a gay lothariothat class of man you know but i do pretend to know something about the harder sex i have never disliked a woman in my life that she has not turned out badly i was not at all deceived in lizzie for instance i always had my doubts about her whatever you may think of my present situation i must at least admit that i got into it with my eyes open now suppose you had got into something like this box with madame de cintre you may depend upon it she would have turned out a stiff one and upon my word i dont see where you could have found your comfort not from the marquis my dear newman he wasnt a man you could go and talk things over with in a sociable commonsense way did he ever seem to want to have you on the premisesdid he ever try to see you alone did he ever ask you to come and smoke a cigar with him of an evening or step in when you had been calling on the ladies and take something i dont think you would have got much encouragement out of him and as for the old lady she struck one as an uncommonly strong dose they have a great expression here you know they call it sympathetic everything is sympatheticor ought to be now madame de bellegarde is about as sympathetic as that mustardpot theyre a dd coldblooded lot any way i felt it awfully at that ball of theirs i felt as if i were walking up and down in the armory in the tower of london my dear boy dont think me a vulgar brute for hinting at it but you may depend upon it all they wanted was your money i know something about that i can tell when people want ones money why they stopped wanting yours i dont know i suppose because they could get some one elses without working so hard for it it isnt worth finding out it may be that it was not madame de cintre that backed out first very likely the old woman put her up to it i suspect she and her mother are really as thick as thieves eh you are well out of it my boy make up your mind to that if i express myself strongly it is all because i love you so much and from that point of view i may say i should as soon have thought of making up to that piece of pale highmightiness as i should have thought of making up to the obelisk in the place des la concorde  newman sat gazing at tristram during this harangue with a lacklustre eye never yet had he seemed to himself to have outgrown so completely the phase of equal comradeship with tom tristram mrs tristrams glance at her husband had more of a spark she turned to newman with a slightly lurid smile you must at least do justice she said to the felicity with which mr tristram repairs the indiscretions of a too zealous wife  but even without the aid of tom tristrams conversational felicities newman would have begun to think of the bellegardes again he could cease to think of them only when he ceased to think of his loss and privation and the days had as yet but scantily lightened the weight of this incommodity in vain mrs tristram begged him to cheer up she assured him that the sight of his countenance made her miserable  how can i help it he demanded with a trembling voice i feel like a widowerand a widower who has not even the consolation of going to stand beside the grave of his wifewho has not the right to wear so much mourning as a weed on his hat i feel he added in a moment as if my wife had been murdered and her assassins were still at large  mrs tristram made no immediate rejoinder but at last she said with a smile which in so far as it was a forced one was less successfully simulated than such smiles on her lips usually were are you very sure that you would have been happy  newman stared a moment and then shook his head thats weak he said that wont do  well said mrs tristram with a more triumphant bravery i dont believe you would have been happy  newman gave a little laugh say i should have been miserable then its a misery i should have preferred to any happiness  mrs tristram began to muse i should have been curious to see it would have been very strange  was it from curiosity that you urged me to try and marry her  a little said mrs tristram growing still more audacious newman gave her the one angry look he had been destined ever to give her turned away and took up his hat she watched him a moment and then she said that sounds very cruel but it is less so than it sounds curiosity has a share in almost everything i do i wanted very much to see first whether such a marriage could actually take place second what would happen if it should take place  so you didnt believe said newman resentfully  yes i believedi believed that it would take place and that you would be happy otherwise i should have been among my speculations a very heartless creature but she continued laying her hand upon newmans arm and hazarding a grave smile it was the highest flight ever taken by a tolerably bold imagination  shortly after this she recommended him to leave paris and travel for three months change of scene would do him good and he would forget his misfortune sooner in absence from the objects which had witnessed it i really feel newman rejoined as if to leave you at least would do me goodand cost me very little effort you are growing cynical you shock me and pain me  very good said mrs tristram goodnaturedly or cynically as may be thought most probable i shall certainly see you again  newman was very willing to get away from paris the brilliant streets he had walked through in his happier hours and which then seemed to wear a higher brilliancy in honor of his happiness appeared now to be in the secret of his defeat and to look down upon it in shining mockery he would go somewhere he cared little where and he made his preparations then one morning at haphazard he drove to the train that would transport him to boulogne and dispatch him thence to the shores of britain as he rolled along in the train he asked himself what had become of his revenge and he was able to say that it was provisionally pigeonholed in a very safe place it would keep till called for  he arrived in london in the midst of what is called the season and it seemed to him at first that he might here put himself in the way of being diverted from his heavyheartedness he knew no one in all england but the spectacle of the mighty metropolis roused him somewhat from his apathy anything that was enormous usually found favor with newman and the multitudinous energies and industries of england stirred within him a dull vivacity of contemplation it is on record that the weather at that moment was of the finest english quality he took long walks and explored london in every direction he sat by the hour in kensington gardens and beside the adjoining drive watching the people and the horses and the carriages the rosy english beauties the wonderful english dandies and the splendid flunkies he went to the opera and found it better than in paris he went to the theatre and found a surprising charm in listening to dialogue the finest points of which came within the range of his comprehension he made several excursions into the country recommended by the waiter at his hotel with whom on this and similar points he had established confidential relations he watched the deer in windsor forest and admired the thames from richmond hill he ate whitebait and brownbread and butter at greenwich and strolled in the grassy shadow of the cathedral of canterbury he also visited the tower of london and madame tussauds exhibition one day he thought he would go to sheffield and then thinking again he gave it up why should he go to sheffield he had a feeling that the link which bound him to a possible interest in the manufacture of cutlery was broken he had no desire for an inside view of any successful enterprise whatever and he would not have given the smallest sum for the privilege of talking over the details of the most splendid business with the shrewdest of overseers  one afternoon he had walked into hyde park and was slowly threading his way through the human maze which edges the drive the stream of carriages was no less dense and newman as usual marveled at the strange dingy figures which he saw taking the air in some of the stateliest vehicles they reminded him of what he had read of eastern and southern countries in which grotesque idols and fetiches were sometimes taken out of their temples and carried abroad in golden chariots to be displayed to the multitude he saw a great many pretty cheeks beneath highplumed hats as he squeezed his way through serried waves of crumpled muslin and sitting on little chairs at the base of the great serious english trees he observed a number of quieteyed maidens who seemed only to remind him afresh that the magic of beauty had gone out of the world with madame de cintre to say nothing of other damsels whose eyes were not quiet and who struck him still more as a satire on possible consolation he had been walking for some time when directly in front of him borne back by the summer breeze he heard a few words uttered in that bright parisian idiom from which his ears had begun to alienate themselves the voice in which the words were spoken made them seem even more like a thing with which he had once been familiar and as he bent his eyes it lent an identity to the commonplace elegance of the back hair and shoulders of a young lady walking in the same direction as himself mademoiselle nioche apparently had come to seek a more rapid advancement in london and another glance led newman to suppose that she had found it a gentleman was strolling beside her lending a most attentive ear to her conversation and too entranced to open his lips newman did not hear his voice but perceived that he presented the dorsal expression of a welldressed englishman mademoiselle nioche was attracting attention the ladies who passed her turned round to survey the parisian perfection of her toilet a great cataract of flounces rolled down from the young ladys waist to newmans feet he had to step aside to avoid treading upon them he stepped aside indeed with a decision of movement which the occasion scarcely demanded for even this imperfect glimpse of miss noemie had excited his displeasure she seemed an odious blot upon the face of nature he wanted to put her out of his sight he thought of valentin de bellegarde still green in the earth of his burialhis young life clipped by this flourishing impudence the perfume of the young ladys finery sickened him he turned his head and tried to deflect his course but the pressure of the crowd kept him near her a few minutes longer so that he heard what she was saying  ah i am sure he will miss me she murmured it was very cruel in me to leave him i am afraid you will think me a very heartless creature he might perfectly well have come with us i dont think he is very well she added it seemed to me today that he was not very gay  newman wondered whom she was talking about but just then an opening among his neighbors enabled him to turn away and he said to himself that she was probably paying a tribute to british propriety and playing at tender solicitude about her papa was that miserable old man still treading the path of vice in her train was he still giving her the benefit of his experience of affairs and had he crossed the sea to serve as her interpreter newman walked some distance farther and then began to retrace his steps taking care not to traverse again the orbit of mademoiselle nioche at last he looked for a chair under the trees but he had some difficulty in finding an empty one he was about to give up the search when he saw a gentleman rise from the seat he had been occupying leaving newman to take it without looking at his neighbors he sat there for some time without heeding them his attention was lost in the irritation and bitterness produced by his recent glimpse of miss noemies iniquitous vitality but at the end of a quarter of an hour dropping his eyes he perceived a small pugdog squatted upon the path near his feeta diminutive but very perfect specimen of its interesting species the pug was sniffing at the fashionable world as it passed him with his little black muzzle and was kept from extending his investigation by a large blue ribbon attached to his collar with an enormous rosette and held in the hand of a person seated next to newman to this person newman transferred his attention and immediately perceived that he was the object of all that of his neighbor who was staring up at him from a pair of little fixed white eyes these eyes newman instantly recognized he had been sitting for the last quarter of an hour beside m nioche he had vaguely felt that some one was staring at him m nioche continued to stare he appeared afraid to move even to the extent of evading newmans glance  dear me said newman are you here too and he looked at his neighbors helplessness more grimly than he knew m nioche had a new hat and a pair of kid gloves his clothes too seemed to belong to a more recent antiquity than of yore over his arm was suspended a ladys mantillaa light and brilliant tissue fringed with white lacewhich had apparently been committed to his keeping and the little dogs blue ribbon was wound tightly round his hand there was no expression of recognition in his faceor of anything indeed save a sort of feeble fascinated dread newman looked at the pug and the lace mantilla and then he met the old mans eyes again you know me i see he pursued you might have spoken to me before m nioche still said nothing but it seemed to newman that his eyes began faintly to water i didnt expect our hero went on to meet you so far fromfrom the cafe de la patrie the old man remained silent but decidedly newman had touched the source of tears his neighbor sat staring and newman added whats the matter m nioche you used to talkto talk very prettily dont you remember you even gave lessons in conversation  at this m nioche decided to change his attitude he stooped and picked up the pug lifted it to his face and wiped his eyes on its little soft back im afraid to speak to you he presently said looking over the puppys shoulder i hoped you wouldnt notice me i should have moved away but i was afraid that if i moved you would notice me so i sat very still  i suspect you have a bad conscience sir said newman  the old man put down the little dog and held it carefully in his lap then he shook his head with his eyes still fixed upon his interlocutor no mr newman i have a good conscience he murmured  then why should you want to slink away from me  becausebecause you dont understand my position  oh i think you once explained it to me said newman but it seems improved  improved exclaimed m nioche under his breath do you call this improvement and he glanced at the treasures in his arms  why you are on your travels newman rejoined a visit to london in the season is certainly a sign of prosperity  m nioche in answer to this cruel piece of irony lifted the puppy up to his face again peering at newman with his small blank eyeholes there was something almost imbecile in the movement and newman hardly knew whether he was taking refuge in a convenient affectation of unreason or whether he had in fact paid for his dishonor by the loss of his wits in the latter case just now he felt little more tenderly to the foolish old man than in the former responsible or not he was equally an accomplice of his detestably mischievous daughter newman was going to leave him abruptly when a ray of entreaty appeared to disengage itself from the old mans misty gaze are you going away he asked  do you want me to stay said newman  i should have left youfrom consideration but my dignity suffers at your leaving methat way  have you got anything particular to say to me  m nioche looked around him to see that no one was listening and then he said very softly but distinctly i have not forgiven her  newman gave a short laugh but the old man seemed for the moment not to perceive it he was gazing away absently at some metaphysical image of his implacability it doesnt much matter whether you forgive her or not said newman there are other people who wont i assure you  what has she done m nioche softly questioned turning round again i dont know what she does you know  she has done a devilish mischief it doesnt matter what said newman shes a nuisance she ought to be stopped  m nioche stealthily put out his hand and laid it very gently upon newmans arm stopped yes he whispered thats it stopped short she is running awayshe must be stopped then he paused a moment and looked round him i mean to stop her he went on i am only waiting for my chance  i see said newman laughing briefly again she is running away and you are running after her you have run a long distance  but m nioche stared insistently i shall stop her he softly repeated  he had hardly spoken when the crowd in front of them separated as if by the impulse to make way for an important personage presently through the opening advanced mademoiselle nioche attended by the gentleman whom newman had lately observed his face being now presented to our hero the latter recognized the irregular features the hardly more regular complexion and the amiable expression of lord deepmere noemie on finding herself suddenly confronted with newman who like m nioche had risen from his seat faltered for a barely perceptible instant she gave him a little nod as if she had seen him yesterday and then with a goodnatured smile tiens how we keep meeting she said she looked consummately pretty and the front of her dress was a wonderful work of art she went up to her father stretching out her hands for the little dog which he submissively placed in them and she began to kiss it and murmur over it to think of leaving him all alonewhat a wicked abominable creature he must believe me he has been very unwell she added turning and affecting to explain to newman with a spark of infernal impudence fine as a needlepoint in her eye i dont think the english climate agrees with him  it seems to agree wonderfully well with his mistress said newman  do you mean me i have never been better thank you miss noemie declared but with milordand she gave a brilliant glance at her late companionhow can one help being well she seated herself in the chair from which her father had risen and began to arrange the little dogs rosette  lord deepmere carried off such embarrassment as might be incidental to this unexpected encounter with the inferior grace of a male and a briton he blushed a good deal and greeted the object of his late momentary aspiration to rivalry in the favor of a person other than the mistress of the invalid pug with an awkward nod and a rapid ejaculationan ejaculation to which newman who often found it hard to understand the speech of english people was able to attach no meaning then the young man stood there with his hand on his hip and with a conscious grin staring askance at miss noemie suddenly an idea seemed to strike him and he said turning to newman oh you know her  yes said newman i know her i dont believe you do  oh dear yes i do said lord deepmere with another grin i knew her in parisby my poor cousin bellegarde you know he knew her poor fellow didnt he it was she you know who was at the bottom of his affair awfully sad wasnt it continued the young man talking off his embarrassment as his simple nature permitted they got up some story about its being for the pope about the other man having said something against the popes morals they always do that you know they put it on the pope because bellegarde was once in the zouaves but it was about her moralsshe was the pope lord deepmere pursued directing an eye illumined by this pleasantry toward mademoiselle nioche who was bending gracefully over her lapdog apparently absorbed in conversation with it i dare say you think it rather odd that i shouldakeep up the acquaintance the young man resumed but she couldnt help it you know and bellegarde was only my twentieth cousin i dare say you think its rather cheeky my showing with her in hyde park but you see she isnt known yet and shes in such very good formand lord deepmeres conclusion was lost in the attesting glance which he again directed toward the young lady  newman turned away he was having more of her than he relished m nioche had stepped aside on his daughters approach and he stood there within a very small compass looking down hard at the ground it had never yet as between him and newman been so apposite to place on record the fact that he had not forgiven his daughter as newman was moving away he looked up and drew near to him and newman seeing the old man had something particular to say bent his head for an instant  you will see it some day in the papers murmured m nioche  our hero departed to hide his smile and to this day though the newspapers form his principal reading his eyes have not been arrested by any paragraph forming a sequel to this announcement    chapter xxvi   in that uninitiated observation of the great spectacle of english life upon which i have touched it might be supposed that newman passed a great many dull days but the dullness of his days pleased him his melancholy which was settling into a secondary stage like a healing wound had in it a certain acrid palatable sweetness he had company in his thoughts and for the present he wanted no other he had no desire to make acquaintances and he left untouched a couple of notes of introduction which had been sent him by tom tristram he thought a great deal of madame de cintresometimes with a dogged tranquillity which might have seemed for a quarter of an hour at a time a near neighbor to forgetfulness he lived over again the happiest hours he had knownthat silver chain of numbered days in which his afternoon visits tending sensibly to the ideal result had subtilized his good humor to a sort of spiritual intoxication he came back to reality after such reveries with a somewhat muffled shock he had begun to feel the need of accepting the unchangeable at other times the reality became an infamy again and the unchangeable an imposture and he gave himself up to his angry restlessness till he was weary but on the whole he fell into a rather reflective mood without in the least intending it or knowing it he attempted to read the moral of his strange misadventure he asked himself in his quieter hours whether perhaps after all he was more commercial than was pleasant we know that it was in obedience to a strong reaction against questions exclusively commercial that he had come out to pick up aesthetic entertainment in europe it may therefore be understood that he was able to conceive that a man might be too commercial he was very willing to grant it but the concession as to his own case was not made with any very oppressive sense of shame if he had been too commercial he was ready to forget it for in being so he had done no man any wrong that might not be as easily forgotten he reflected with sober placidity that at least there were no monuments of his meanness scattered about the world if there was any reason in the nature of things why his connection with business should have cast a shadow upon a connectioneven a connection brokenwith a woman justly proud he was willing to sponge it out of his life forever the thing seemed a possibility he could not feel it doubtless as keenly as some people and it hardly seemed worth while to flap his wings very hard to rise to the idea but he could feel it enough to make any sacrifice that still remained to be made as to what such sacrifice was now to be made to here newman stopped short before a blank wall over which there sometimes played a shadowy imagery he had a fancy of carrying out his life as he would have directed it if madame de cintre had been left to himof making it a religion to do nothing that she would have disliked in this certainly there was no sacrifice but there was a pale oblique ray of inspiration it would be lonely entertainmenta good deal like a man talking to himself in the mirror for want of better company yet the idea yielded newman several half hours dumb exaltation as he sat with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched over the relics of an expensively poor dinner in the undying english twilight if however his commercial imagination was dead he felt no contempt for the surviving actualities begotten by it he was glad he had been prosperous and had been a great man of business rather than a small one he was extremely glad he was rich he felt no impulse to sell all he had and give to the poor or to retire into meditative economy and asceticism he was glad he was rich and tolerably young it was possible to think too much about buying and selling it was a gain to have a good slice of life left in which not to think about them come what should he think about now again and again newman could think only of one thing his thoughts always came back to it and as they did so with an emotional rush which seemed physically to express itself in a sudden upward choking he leaned forwardthe waiter having left the roomand resting his arms on the table buried his troubled face  he remained in england till midsummer and spent a month in the country wandering about cathedrals castles and ruins several times taking a walk from his inn into meadows and parks he stopped by a wellworn stile looked across through the early evening at a gray church tower with its dusky nimbus of thickcircling swallows and remembered that this might have been part of the entertainment of his honeymoon he had never been so much alone or indulged so little in accidental dialogue the period of recreation appointed by mrs tristram had at last expired and he asked himself what he should do now mrs tristram had written to him proposing to him that he should join her in the pyrenees but he was not in the humor to return to france the simplest thing was to repair to liverpool and embark on the first american steamer newman made his way to the great seaport and secured his berth and the night before sailing he sat in his room at the hotel staring down vacantly and wearily at an open portmanteau a number of papers were lying upon it which he had been meaning to look over some of them might conveniently be destroyed but at last he shuffled them roughly together and pushed them into a corner of the valise they were business papers and he was in no humor for sifting them then he drew forth his pocketbook and took out a paper of smaller size than those he had dismissed he did not unfold it he simply sat looking at the back of it if he had momentarily entertained the idea of destroying it the idea quickly expired what the paper suggested was the feeling that lay in his innermost heart and that no reviving cheerfulness could long quenchthe feeling that after all and above all he was a good fellow wronged with it came a hearty hope that the bellegardes were enjoying their suspense as to what he would do yet the more it was prolonged the more they would enjoy it he had hung fire once yes perhaps in his present queer state of mind he might hang fire again but he restored the little paper to his pocketbook very tenderly and felt better for thinking of the suspense of the bellegardes he felt better every time he thought of it after that as he sailed the summer seas he landed in new york and journeyed across the continent to san francisco and nothing that he observed by the way contributed to mitigate his sense of being a good fellow wronged  he saw a great many other good fellowshis old friendsbut he told none of them of the trick that had been played him he said simply that the lady he was to have married had changed her mind and when he was asked if he had changed his own he said suppose we change the subject he told his friends that he had brought home no new ideas from europe and his conduct probably struck them as an eloquent proof of failing invention he took no interest in chatting about his affairs and manifested no desire to look over his accounts he asked half a dozen questions which like those of an eminent physician inquiring for particular symptoms showed that he still knew what he was talking about but he made no comments and gave no directions he not only puzzled the gentlemen on the stock exchange but he was himself surprised at the extent of his indifference as it seemed only to increase he made an effort to combat it he tried to interest himself and to take up his old occupations but they appeared unreal to him do what he would he somehow could not believe in them sometimes he began to fear that there was something the matter with his head that his brain perhaps had softened and that the end of his strong activities had come this idea came back to him with an exasperating force a hopeless helpless loafer useful to no one and detestable to himselfthis was what the treachery of the bellegardes had made of him in his restless idleness he came back from san francisco to new york and sat for three days in the lobby of his hotel looking out through a huge wall of plateglass at the unceasing stream of pretty girls in parisianlooking dresses undulating past with little parcels nursed against their neat figures at the end of three days he returned to san francisco and having arrived there he wished he had stayed away he had nothing to do his occupation was gone and it seemed to him that he should never find it again he had nothing to do here he sometimes said to himself but there was something beyond the ocean that he was still to do something that he had left undone experimentally and speculatively to see if it could content itself to remain undone but it was not content it kept pulling at his heartstrings and thumping at his reason it murmured in his ears and hovered perpetually before his eyes it interposed between all new resolutions and their fulfillment it seemed like a stubborn ghost dumbly entreating to be laid till that was done he should never be able to do anything else  one day toward the end of the winter after a long interval he received a letter from mrs tristram who apparently was animated by a charitable desire to amuse and distract her correspondent she gave him much paris gossip talked of general packard and miss kitty upjohn enumerated the new plays at the theatre and inclosed a note from her husband who had gone down to spend a month at nice then came her signature and after this her postscript the latter consisted of these few lines i heard three days since from my friend the abbe aubert that madame de cintre last week took the veil at the carmelites it was on her twentyseventh birthday and she took the name of her patroness st veronica sister veronica has a lifetime before her  this letter came to newman in the morning in the evening he started for paris his wound began to ache with its first fierceness and during his long bleak journey the thought of madame de cintres lifetime passed within prison walls on whose outer side he might stand kept him perpetual company now he would fix himself in paris forever he would extort a sort of happiness from the knowledge that if she was not there at least the stony sepulchre that held her was he descended unannounced upon mrs bread whom he found keeping lonely watch in his great empty saloons on the boulevard haussmann they were as neat as a dutch village mrs breads only occupation had been removing individual dustparticles she made no complaint however of her loneliness for in her philosophy a servant was but a mysteriously projected machine and it would be as fantastic for a housekeeper to comment upon a gentlemans absences as for a clock to remark upon not being wound up no particular clock mrs bread supposed went all the time and no particular servant could enjoy all the sunshine diffused by the career of an exacting master she ventured nevertheless to express a modest hope that newman meant to remain a while in paris newman laid his hand on hers and shook it gently i mean to remain forever he said  he went after this to see mrs tristram to whom he had telegraphed and who expected him she looked at him a moment and shook her head this wont do she said you have come back too soon he sat down and asked about her husband and her children tried even to inquire about miss dora finch in the midst of thisdo you know where she is he asked abruptly  mrs tristram hesitated a moment of course he couldnt mean miss dora finch then she answered properly she has gone to the other housein the rue denfer after newman had sat a while longer looking very sombre she went on you are not so good a man as i thought you are moreyou are more  more what newman asked  more unforgiving  good god cried newman do you expect me to forgive  no not that i have forgiven so of course you cant but you might forget you have a worse temper about it than i should have expected you look wickedyou look dangerous  i may be dangerous he said but i am not wicked no i am not wicked and he got up to go mrs tristram asked him to come back to dinner but he answered that he did not feel like pledging himself to be present at an entertainment even as a solitary guest later in the evening if he should be able he would come  he walked away through the city beside the seine and over it and took the direction of the rue denfer the day had the softness of early spring but the weather was gray and humid newman found himself in a part of paris which he little knewa region of convents and prisons of streets bordered by long dead walls and traversed by a few wayfarers at the intersection of two of these streets stood the house of the carmelitesa dull plain edifice with a highshouldered blank wall all round it from without newman could see its upper windows its steep roof and its chimneys but these things revealed no symptoms of human life the place looked dumb deaf inanimate the pale dead discolored wall stretched beneath it far down the empty side streeta vista without a human figure newman stood there a long time there were no passers he was free to gaze his fill this seemed the goal of his journey it was what he had come for it was a strange satisfaction and yet it was a satisfaction the barren stillness of the place seemed to be his own release from ineffectual longing it told him that the woman within was lost beyond recall and that the days and years of the future would pile themselves above her like the huge immovable slab of a tomb these days and years in this place would always be just so gray and silent suddenly from the thought of their seeing him stand there again the charm utterly departed he would never stand there again it was gratuitous dreariness he turned away with a heavy heart but with a heart lighter than the one he had brought everything was over and he too at last could rest he walked down through narrow winding streets to the edge of the seine again and there he saw close above him the soft vast towers of notre dame he crossed one of the bridges and stood a moment in the empty place before the great cathedral then he went in beneath the grosslyimaged portals he wandered some distance up the nave and sat down in the splendid dimness he sat a long time he heard faraway bells chiming off at long intervals to the rest of the world he was very tired this was the best place he could be in he said no prayers he had no prayers to say he had nothing to be thankful for and he had nothing to ask nothing to ask because now he must take care of himself but a great cathedral offers a very various hospitality and newman sat in his place because while he was there he was out of the world the most unpleasant thing that had ever happened to him had reached its formal conclusion as it were he could close the book and put it away he leaned his head for a long time on the chair in front of him when he took it up he felt that he was himself again somewhere in his mind a tight knot seemed to have loosened he thought of the bellegardes he had almost forgotten them he remembered them as people he had meant to do something to he gave a groan as he remembered what he had meant to do he was annoyed at having meant to do it the bottom suddenly had fallen out of his revenge whether it was christian charity or unregenerate good naturewhat it was in the background of his souli dont pretend to say but newmans last thought was that of course he would let the bellegardes go if he had spoken it aloud he would have said that he didnt want to hurt them he was ashamed of having wanted to hurt them they had hurt him but such things were really not his game at last he got up and came out of the darkening church not with the elastic step of a man who had won a victory or taken a resolve but strolling soberly like a goodnatured man who is still a little ashamed  going home he said to mrs bread that he must trouble her to put back his things into the portmanteau she had unpacked the evening before his gentle stewardess looked at him through eyes a trifle bedimmed dear me sir she exclaimed i thought you said that you were going to stay forever  i meant that i was going to stay away forever said newman kindly and since his departure from paris on the following day he has certainly not returned the gilded apartments i have so often spoken of stand ready to receive him but they serve only as a spacious residence for mrs bread who wanders eternally from room to room adjusting the tassels of the curtains and keeps her wages which are regularly brought her by a bankers clerk in a great pink sevres vase on the drawingroom mantelshelf  late in the evening newman went to mrs tristrams and found tom tristram by the domestic fireside im glad to see you back in paris this gentleman declared you know its really the only place for a white man to live mr tristram made his friend welcome according to his own rosy light and offered him a convenient resume of the francoamerican gossip of the last six months then at last he got up and said he would go for half an hour to the club i suppose a man who has been for six months in california wants a little intellectual conversation ill let my wife have a go at you  newman shook hands heartily with his host but did not ask him to remain and then he relapsed into his place on the sofa opposite to mrs tristram she presently asked him what he had done after leaving her nothing particular said newman  you struck me she rejoined as a man with a plot in his head you looked as if you were bent on some sinister errand and after you had left me i wondered whether i ought to have let you go  i only went over to the other side of the riverto the carmelites said newman  mrs tristram looked at him a moment and smiled what did you do there try to scale the wall  i did nothing i looked at the place for a few minutes and then came away  mrs tristram gave him a sympathetic glance you didnt happen to meet m de bellegarde she asked staring hopelessly at the convent wall as well i am told he takes his sisters conduct very hard  no i didnt meet him i am happy to say newman answered after a pause  they are in the country mrs tristram went on atwhat is the name of the placefleurieres they returned there at the time you left paris and have been spending the year in extreme seclusion the little marquise must enjoy it i expect to hear that she has eloped with her daughters musicmaster  newman was looking at the light woodfire but he listened to this with extreme interest at last he spoke i mean never to mention the name of those people again and i dont want to hear anything more about them and then he took out his pocketbook and drew forth a scrap of paper he looked at it an instant then got up and stood by the fire i am going to burn them up he said i am glad to have you as a witness there they go and he tossed the paper into the flame  mrs tristram sat with her embroidery needle suspended what is that paper she asked  newman leaning against the fireplace stretched his arms and drew a longer breath than usual then after a moment i can tell you now he said it was a paper containing a secret of the bellegardessomething which would damn them if it were known  mrs tristram dropped her embroidery with a reproachful moan ah why didnt you show it to me  i thought of showing it to youi thought of showing it to every one i thought of paying my debt to the bellegardes that way so i told them and i frightened them they have been staying in the country as you tell me to keep out of the explosion but i have given it up  mrs tristram began to take slow stitches again have you quite given it up  oh yes  is it very bad this secret  yes very bad  for myself said mrs tristram i am sorry you have given it up i should have liked immensely to see your paper they have wronged me too you know as your sponsor and guarantee and it would have served for my revenge as well how did you come into possession of your secret  its a long story but honestly at any rate  and they knew you were master of it  oh i told them  dear me how interesting cried mrs tristram and you humbled them at your feet  newman was silent a moment no not at all they pretended not to carenot to be afraid but i know they did carethey were afraid  are you very sure  newman stared a moment yes im sure  mrs tristram resumed her slow stitches they defied you eh  yes said newman it was about that  you tried by the threat of exposure to make them retract mrs tristram pursued  yes but they wouldnt i gave them their choice and they chose to take their chance of bluffing off the charge and convicting me of fraud but they were frightened newman added and i have had all the vengeance i want  it is most provoking said mrs tristram to hear you talk of the charge when the charge is burnt up is it quite consumed she asked glancing at the fire  newman assured her that there was nothing left of it well then she said i suppose there is no harm in saying that you probably did not make them so very uncomfortable my impression would be that since as you say they defied you it was because they believed that after all you would never really come to the point their confidence after counsel taken of each other was not in their innocence nor in their talent for bluffing things off it was in your remarkable good nature you see they were right  newman instinctively turned to see if the little paper was in fact consumed but there was nothing left of it
