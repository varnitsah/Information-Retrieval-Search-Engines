 ye hae heard whigs crack o the saints in the bass my faith a gruesome tale how the remnant paid at a tippeny rate for a quart o hapenny ale but ill tell ye anither tale o the bass thatll hearten ye up to hear sae i pledge ye to middleton first in a glass and a health to the young chevalier  the bass stands frae north berwick law a league or less to sea about its feet the breakers beat abune the seamaws flee theres castle stark and dungeon dark wherein the godly lay that made their rant for the covenant through mony a weary day for twal years lang the caverns rang wi preaching prayer and psalm yed think the winds were soughing wild when a the winds were calm there wad they preach each saint to each and glower as the soldiers pass and peden wared his malison on a bonny leaguer lass as she stood and daffed while the warders laughed and wha sae blithe as she but a wind o ill worked his warlock will and flang her out to sea then wha sae bright as the saints that night and an angel came say they and sang in the cell where the righteous dwell but he took na a saint away there yet might they be for nane could flee and nane daurd break the jail and still the sobbing o the sea might mix wi their warlock wail but then came in black echtyecht and bluidy echtynine wi cess and press and presbytery and a the dule sin syne the saints won free wi the power o the key and cavaliers maun pine it was halyburton middleton and roy and young dunbar that livingstone took on cromdale haughs in the last fight of the war and they were warded in the bass till the time they should be slain where bluidy mitchell and blackader and earlston lang had lain four lads alone gainst a garrison but glory crowns their names for they brought it to pass that they took the bass and they held it for king james  it isna by preaching half the night yell burst a dungeon door it wasna by dint o psalmody they broke the hold they four for lang years three that rock in the sea bade wullie wanbeard gae swing and england and scotland fause may be but the bass rock stands for the king  theres but ae pass gangs up the bass its guarded wi strong gates four and still as the soldiers went to the sea they steikit them door by door and this did they do when they helped a crew that brought their coals on shore thither all had gone save three men alone  then middleton gripped his man halyburton felled the sergeant lad dunbar seized the gunner swan roy bound their hands in hempen bands and the cavaliers were free and they trained the guns on the soldier loons that were down wi the boat by the sea then middleton cried frae the high cliffside and his voice garrd the auld rocks ring will ye stand or flee by the land or sea for i hold the bass for the king  they had nae desire to face the fire it was mair than men might do so they een sailed back in the auld coalsmack a sorry and shame faced crew and they hirpled doun to edinburgh toun wi the story of their shames how the prisoners bold had broken hold and kept the bass for king james  king james he has sent them guns and men and the whigs they guard the bass but they never could catch the cavaliers who took toll of ships that pass they fared wild and free as the birds o the sea and at night they went on the wing and they lifted the kye o whigs far and nigh and they revelled and drank to the king  then wullie wanbeard sends his ships to siege the bass in form and first shall they break the fortress down and syne the rock theyll storm after twa days fight they fled in the night and glad eneuch to go with their rigging rent and their powder spent and many a man laid low  so for lang years three did they sweep the sea but a closer watch was set till nae food had they but twa ounce a day o meal was the maist theyd get and men fight but tame on an empty wame so they sent a flag o truce and blithe were the privy council then when the whigs had heard that news twa lords they sent wi a strang intent to be dour on each cavalier but wi french cakes fine and his last drap o wine did middleton make them cheer on the muzzles o guns he put coats and caps and he set them aboot the was and the whigs thocht then he had food and men to stand for the rightfu cause so he got a he craved and his men were saved and nane might say them nay wi sword by side and flag o pride free men might they gang their way they might fare to france they might bide at hame and the better their grace to buy wullie wanbeards purse maun pay the keep o the men that did him defy  men never hae gotten sic terms o peace since first men went to war as got halyburton and middleton and roy and the young dunbar sae i drink to ye here to the young chevalier  i hae said ye an auld mans say and there may hae been mightier deeds of arms but there never was nane sae gay    three portraits of prince charles    1731  beautiful face of a child lighted with laughter and glee mirthful and tender and wild my heart is heavy for thee  1744  beautiful face of a youth as an eagle poised to fly forth to the old land loyal of truth to the hills and the sounds of the north fair face daring and proud lo the shadow of doom even now the fate of thy line like a cloud rests on the grace of thy brow  1773  cruel and angry face hateful and heavy with wine where are the gladness the grace the beauty the mirth that were thine  ah my prince it were well hadst thou to the gods been dear  to have fallen where keppoch fell with the warpipe loud in thine ear to have died with never a stain on the fair white rose of renown to have fallen fighting in vain for thy father thy faith and thy crown more than thy marble pile with its women weeping for thee were to dream in thine ancient isle to the endless dirge of the sea but the fates deemed otherwise far thou sleepest from home from the tears of the northern skies in the secular dust of rome      a city of death and the dead but thither a pilgrim came wearing on weary head the crowns of years and fame little the lucrine lake or tivoli said to him scarce did the memories wake of the faroff years and dim for he stood by avernus shore but he dreamed of a northern glen and he murmured over and oer for charlie and his men and his feet to death that went crept forth to st peters shrine and the latest minstrel bent oer the last of the stuart line    from omar khayyam    rhymed from the prose version of mr justin huntly mcarthy  the paradise they bid us fast to win hath wine and women is it then a sin to live as we shall live in paradise and make a heaven of earth ere heaven begin  the wise may search the world from end to end from dusty nook to dusty nook my friend and nothing better find than girls and wine of all the things they neither make nor mend  nay listen thou who walking on lifes way hast seen no lovelock of thy loves grow grey listen and love thy life and let the wheel of heaven go spinning its own wilful way  man is a flagon and his soul the wine man is a lamp wherein the soul doth shine man is a shaken reed wherein that wind the soul doth ever rustle and repine  each morn i say tonight i will repent repent and each night go the way i went  the way of wine but now that reigns the rose lord of repentance rage not but relent  i wish to drink of wineso deep so deep  the scent of wine my sepulchre shall steep and they the revellers by omars tomb shall breathe it and in wine shall fall asleep  before the rent walls of a ruined town lay the kings skull whereby a bird flew down and where he sang is all thy clash of arms where the sonorous trumps of thy renown    aesop    he sat among the woods he heard the sylvan merriment  he saw the pranks of butterfly and bird the humours of the ape the daw  and in the lion or the frog  in all the life of moor and fen in ass and peacock stork and dog he read similitudes of men  of these from those he cried we come our hearts our brains descend from these and lo the beasts no more were dumb but answered out of brakes and trees  not ours they cried degenerate if ours at all they cried again ye fools who war with god and fate who strive and toil  strange race of men  for we are neither bond nor free for we have neither slaves nor kings but near to natures heart are we and conscious of her secret things  content are we to fall asleep and well content to wake no more we do not laugh we do not weep nor look behind us and before  but were there cause for moan or mirth tis we not you should sigh or scorn oh latest children of the earth most childish children earth has borne      they spoke but that misshapen slave told never of the thing he heard and unto men their portraits gave in likenesses of beast and bird    les roses de sadi    this morning i vowed i would bring thee my roses they were thrust in the band that my bodice encloses but the breastknots were broken the roses went free the breastknots were broken the roses together floated forth on the wings of the wind and the weather and they drifted afar down the streams of the sea  and the sea was as red as when sunset uncloses but my raiment is sweet from the scent of the roses thou shalt know love how fragrant a memory can be    the haunted tower    suggested by a poem of theophile gautier  in front he saw the donjon tall deep in the woods and stayed to scan the guards that slept along the wall or dozed upon the bartizan he marked the drowsy flag that hung unwaved by wind unfrayed by shower he listened to the birds that sung go forth and win the haunted tower the tangled brake made way for him the twisted brambles bent aside and lo he pierced the forest dim and lo he won the fairy bride for he was young but ah we find all we whose beards are flecked with grey our fairy castles far behind we watch it from the darkling way twas ours that palace in our youth we revelled there in happy cheer who scarce dare visit now in sooth le vieux chateau de souvenir for not the boughs of forest green begird that castle far away there is a mist where we have been that weeps about it cold and grey and if we seek to travel back tis through a thicket dim and sere with many a grave beside the track and many a haunting form of fear dead leaves are wet among the moss with weed and thistle overgrown  a ruined barge within the fosse a castle built of crumbling stone the drawbridge drops from rusty chains there comes no challenge from the hold no squire nor dame nor knight remains of all who dwelt with us of old and there is silence in the hall no sound of songs no ray of fire but gloom where all was glad and all is darkened with a vain desire and every pictures fading fast of fair jehanne or cydalise lo the white shadows hurrying past below the boughs of dripping trees      ah rise and march and look not back now the long way has brought us here we may not turn and seek the track to the old chateau de souvenir    boatsong    adrift with starlit skies above with starlit seas below we move with all the suns that move with all the seas that flow for bond or free earth sky and sea wheel with one central will and thy heart drifteth on to me and only time stands still  between two shores of death we drift behind are things forgot before the tide is racing swift to shores man knoweth not above the sky is far and cold below the moaning sea sweeps oer the loves that were of old but thou love love thou me  ah lonely are the ocean ways and dangerous the deep and frail the fairy barque that strays above the seas asleep ah toil no more with helm or oar we drift or bond or free on yon far shore the breakers roar but thou love love thou me    lost love    who wins his love shall lose her who loses her shall gain for still the spirit woos her a soul without a stain and memory still pursues her with longings not in vain  he loses her who gains her who watches day by day the dust of time that stains her the griefs that leave her grey the flesh that yet enchains her whose grace hath passed away  oh happier he who gains not the love some seem to gain the joy that custom stains not shall still with him remain the loveliness that wanes not the love that neer can wane  in dreams she grows not older the lands of dream among though all the world wax colder though all the songs be sung in dreams doth he behold her still fair and kind and young    the promise of helen    whom hast thou longed for most true love of mine whom hast thou loved and lost lo she is thine  she that another wed breaks from her vow she that hath long been dead wakes for thee now  dreams haunt the hapless bed ghosts haunt the night life crowns her living head love and delight  nay not a dream nor ghost nay but divine she that was loved and lost waits to be thine    the restoration of romance to h r h r l s a c d and s w    king

pomona road and gardens n were pure as they were fair  in other districts much i fear that vulgar language shocks the ear but brawling wives or noisy men were never heard of there  no burglar fixed his dread abode in that secure retreat there were no publichouses nigh but chapels low and churches high you might have thought pomona road a quite ideal beat  yet that was not at all the view taken by b 13 that active and intelligent policeman deemed that he was meant profound detective deeds to do and that repose was mean  now there was nothing to detect pomona road along  none faked a cly nor cracked a crib nor prigged a wipe nor told a fib minds cultivated and select slip rarely into wrong  thus bored to desolation went the peeler on his beat he know not love he did not care if love be born on mountains bare nay crime to punish or prevent was more than dalliance sweet  the weary wanderer day by day was marked by howard fry  a neighbouring philanthropist who saw what that policeman missed  a sympathetic welladay hed moan and pipe his eye  what can i do asked howard fry to soothe that brothers pain his glance when first we met was keen most martial and erect his mien what mien may mean i know not i but he must joy again  ill start on a career of crime i will said howard fry  he spake and acted  deeds of bale with which i do not stain my tale he wrought like mad time after time yet wrought them blushfully  and now when buses night by night were stopped conductors slain when youths and men and maids unwed were stabbed or knocked upon the head then b 13 grew sternly bright and was himself again  pomona road and gardens n are now a name of fear commercial travellers flee in haste revolvers girt about the waist are worn by city gentlemen who have their mansions near  but b 13 elated goes detection in his eye while howard fry does deeds of bale with which i do not stain my tale to lighten that policemans woes but does them blushfully  moral  such is

  in light of sunrise and sunsetting the long days lingered in forgetting that ever passion keen to hold what may not tarry was of old beyond the doubtful stream whose flood runs red waisthigh with slain mens blood  was beauty once a thing that died was pleasure never satisfied was rest still broken by the vain desire of action bringing pain to die in vapid rest again all this was quite forgotten there no winter brought us cold and care nor spring gave promise unfulfilled nor with the heavy summer killed the languid days droop autumnwards so magical a season guards the constant prime of a green june so slumbrous is the rivers tune that knows no thunder of rushing rains nor ever in the summer wanes like waters of the summertime in lands far from the fairy clime  alas no words can bring the bloom of fairyland the lost perfume the sweet low light the magic air to minds of who have not been there alas no words nor any spell can lull the heart that knows too well the towers that by the river stand the lost fair world of fairyland  ah would that i had never been the lover of the fairy queen or would that i again might be asleep below the eildon tree and see her ride the forest way as on that morning of the may  or would that through the little town the grey old place of ercildoune and all along the sleepy street the soft fall of the white deers feet came with the mystical

broadsword and cut the green boughs of the tree and strew the green boughs on the ground to make a soft deathbed for me  and you must bring the holy priest that i may sained be for i have lived a roving life fifty years under the greenwood tree  and you shall make a grave for me and dig it deep and wide that i may turn about and dream with my old gun by my side  and leave a window to the east

hugo    since i have set my lips to your full cup my sweet since i my pallid face between your hands have laid since i have known your soul and all the bloom of it and all the perfume rare now buried in the shade  since it was given to me to hear one happy while the words wherein your heart spoke all its mysteries since i have seen you weep and since i have seen you smile your lips upon my lips and your eyes upon my eyes  since i have known above my forehead glance and gleam a ray a single ray of your star veiled always since i have felt the fall upon my lifetimes stream of one rosepetal plucked from the roses of your days  i now am bold to say to the swiftchanging hours pass pass upon your way for i grow never old fleet to the dark abyss with all your fading flowers one rose that none may pluck within my heart i hold  your flying wings may smite but they can never spill the cup fulfilled of love from which my lips are wet my heart has far more fire than you have frost to chill my soul more love than you can make my soul forget    silentia lunaefrom ronsard    hide this one night thy crescent kindly moon so shall endymion faithful prove and rest loving and unawakened on thy

the bright noon  thou knowst o moon the bitter power of love tis told how shepherd pan found ways to move with a small gift thy heart and of your grace sweet stars be kind to this not alien fire

makes sunrise jealous of her rosy red when dawn upon the dew of dawning glows graces and loves within her breast repose the woods are faint with the sweet odour shed till rains and heavy suns have smitten dead the languid flower and the loose leaves unclose   so this the perfect beauty of our days when heaven and earth were vocal of her praise the fates have slain and her sweet soul reposes and tears i bring and sighs and on her tomb pour milk and scatter buds of many a bloom that dead as living rose may be with roses    the poets apology    no the muse has gone away does not haunt me much today everything she had to say has been said twas not much at any time she could hitch into a rhyme never was the muse sublime who has fled  any one who takes her in may observe shes rather thin little more than bone and skin is the muse scanty sacrifice she won when her very best shed done and at her they poked their fun in reviews  rhymes in truth are stubborn things and to rhyme she clung and clings but whatever song she sings scarcely sells if her tone be grave they say give us something rather gay if shes skittish then they pray something else  much she loved for wading shod to go
