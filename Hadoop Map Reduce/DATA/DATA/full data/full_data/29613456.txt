29613456	the pawns count  by  e phillips oppenheim   1918   foreword  i am for england and england only john lutchester the englishman asserted  i am for japan and japan only nikasti the jap insisted  i am for germany first and america afterwards oscar fischer the germanamerican pronounced  i am for america first america only america always pamela van teyl the american girl declared  they were all right except the germanamerican     chapter i   mefiezvous  taisezvous  les oreilles ennemies vous ecoutent  the usual little crowd was waiting in the lobby of a fashionable london restaurant a few minutes before the popular luncheon hour pamela van teyl a very beautiful american girl dressed in the extreme of fashion which she seemed somehow to justify directed the attention of her companions to the notice affixed to the wall facing them  except she declared for you poor dears who have been hurt that is the first thing i have seen in england which makes me realise that you are at war  the younger of her two escorts captain richard holderness who wore the uniform of a wellknown cavalry regiment glanced at the notice a little impatiently  what rot it seems he exclaimed we get fed up with that sort of thing in france its always the same at every little railway station and every little inn mefiezvous taisezvous they might spare us over here  john lutchester a tall cleanshaven man dressed in civilian clothes raised his eyeglass and read out the notice languidly  well i dont know he observed some of you service fellowsnot the regulars of coursedo gas a good deal when you come back i dont suppose you any of you know anything so it doesnt really matter he added glancing at his watch  armys full of johnnies who come from god knows where nowadays holderness assented gloomily no wonder they cant keep their mouths shut  seems to me you need them all miss pamela van teyl remarked with a smile  of course we do holderness assented and heaven forbid that any of us regulars should say a word against them jolly good stuff in them too as the germans found out last month  all the same lutchester continued still studying the notice news does run over london like quicksilver if you step down to the american bar here for instance youll find that charles is one of the bestinformed men about the war in london he has patrons in the army in the navy and in the flying corps and its astonishing how communicative they seem to become after the second or third cocktail  cocktail mark you miss van teyl holderness pointed out we poor englishmen could keep our tongues from wagging before we acquired some of your american habits  the habits are all right pamela retorted its your heads that are wrong  the most valued product of your country lutchester murmured is more dangerous to our hearts than to our heads  she made a little grimace and turned away holding out her hand to a new arrivala tall broadshouldered man with a strong cold face and keen grey eyes aggressive even behind his goldrimmed spectacles there was a queer change in his face as his eyes met pamelas he seemed suddenly to become more human his pleasure at seeing her was certainly more than the usual transatlantic politeness  mr fischer she exclaimed they are saying hard things about our country please protect me  he bowed over her fingers then he looked up his tone was impressive  if i thought that you needed protection miss van teyl  well i can assure you that i do she interrupted laughing you know my friends dont you  i think i have that pleasure the american replied shaking hands with lutchester and holderness  now well get an independent opinion the former observed pointing to the wall we were discussing that notice mr fischer youre almost as much a londoner as a new yorker what do you thinkis it superfluous or not  fischer read it out and smiled  well he admitted in america we dont lay much store by that sort of thing but i dont know as were very good judges about what goes on over here i shouldnt call this place anyway a hotbed of intrigue excuse me  he moved off to greet some incoming guestsa wellknown stockbroker and his partner lutchester looked after him curiously  is mr fischer one of your typical millionaires miss van teyl he asked  she shrugged her shoulders  we have no typical millionaires she assured him they come from all classes and all states  fischer is a westerner isnt he  pamela nodded but did not pursue the conversation her eyes were fixed upon a girl who had just entered and who was looking a little doubtfully around a girl plainly but smartly dressed with fluffy light hair dark eyes and a very pleasant expression pamela who was critical of her own sex found the newcomer attractive  is that by any chance one of our missing guests captain holderness she inquired turning towards him i dont know why but i have an idea that it is your sister  by jove yes the young man assented stepping forward here we are molly and at last you are going to meet miss van teyl ive bored molly stiff talking about you he explained as pamela held out her hand  the girls who stood talking together for a moment presented rather a striking contrast molly holderness was pretty but usual pamela was beautiful and unusual she had the long slim body of a new york girl the complexion and eyes of a southerner the savoir faire of a frenchwoman she was extraordinarily cosmopolitan and yet extraordinarily american she impressed every one as she did molly holderness at that moment with a sense of charm one could almost accept as truth her own statementthat she valued her looks chiefly because they helped people to forget that she had brains  i wont admit that i have ever been bored miss van teyl molly holderness assured her but dick has certainly told me all sorts of wonderful things about youhow kind you were in new york and what a delightful surprise it was to see you down at the hospital at nice i am afraid he must have been a terrible crock then  got well in no time as soon as miss van teyl came along holderness declared it was a bit dreary down there at first none of my lot were sent south and a familiar face means a good deal when youve got your lungs full of that rotten gas and are feeling like nothing on earth i wonder where that idiot sandy is i told him to be here a quarter of an hour before you othersthought we might have had a quiet chat first will you stand by the girls for a moment lutchester while i have a look round he added  he hobbled away one of the thousands who were thronging the streets and public places of londonbrave simpleminded young men all of them with tangled recollections in their brains of blood and fire and hell and a game leg or a lost arm to remind them that the whole thing was not a nightmare he looked a little disconsolately around and was on the point of rejoining the others when the friend for whom he was searching came hurriedly through the turnstile doors  sandy old chap holderness exclaimed with an air of relief here you are at last  cheero dick was the lighthearted reply fearfully sorry im late but listenjust listen for one moment  the newcomer threw his hat and coat to the attendant he was a rather short freckled young man with a broad high forehead and lightcoloured hair his eyes just now were filled with the enthusiasm which trembled in his tone  dick he continued gripping his friends arm tightly im late i know but ive great news ive motored straight up from salisbury plain ive done it i swear to you dick ive done it  done what holderness demanded a little bewildered  ive perfected my explosivethe thing i was telling you about last week was the triumphant reply the whole worlds struggling for it dick the german chemists have been working night and day for three years just for one little formula and ive got it one of my shells which fell in a wood at daylight this morning killed every living thing within a mile of it the bark fell off the trees and the labourers in a field beyond threw down their implements and ran for their lives its the principle of intensification the poison feeds on its own vapours the formulaive got it in my pocketbook  look here old fellow holderness interrupted its all splendid of course and im dying to hear you talk about it but come along now and be introduced to miss van teyl mollys over there waiting and were all half starved  so am i was the cheerful answer hullo lutchester how are you just one moment i must get a wash i motored straight through and im choked with dust where do i go  ill show you lutchester volunteered hurry up  the two men sprang up the stairs towards the dressingroom and holderness strolled back to where his sister and pamela were talking to a small dark young man with rather high cheekbones and olive complexion pamela turned around with a smile  i have found an old friend she told him baron sunyeacaptain holderness baron sunyea used to be in the japanese embassy at washington  the two men shook hands  i was interested the japanese said slowly in your conversation just now about that notice your young friend was telling you news very loudly indeed it seemed to me which you would not like known across the north sea am i not right  in a sense you are of course holderness admitted but here at henryswhy the place is like a club where are the enemies ears to come from i should like to know  where we least expect to find them as a rule was the grave reply  quite right lutchester who had just rejoined them agreed they still say you know that our home secret service is just as bad as our foreign secret service is good  holderness smiled in somewhat superior fashion  cant say that i have much faith in that spy talk he declared no doubt there was any quantity of espionage before the war but its pretty well weeded out now i say how good civilisation is he went on his eyes dwelling lovingly on the interior of the restaurant tophole isnt it lutchesterthese smart girls with their furs and violets and perfumes the little note of music in the distance the cheerful clatter of plates the smiling faces of the waiters and the undercurrent of pleasant voices dont laugh at me please miss van teyl ive three weeks more of it by georgeperhaps more i dont go up before my board till thursday fortnight dash it i wish sandy would hurry up  you never told me how you got your wound pamela observed as the conversation flagged for a moment  cant even remember was the careless reply we were all scrapping away as hard as we could one afternoon and nearly a dozen of us got the knock all at the same time its quite all right now though except for the stiffness it was the gas did me in what a fellow sandy is you people must be starving  they waited for another five minutes then holderness limped towards the stairs with a little imprecation lutchester stopped him  dont you go holderness he begged ill find him and bring him down by the scruff of the neck  he strode up the stairs on a mission which ended in unexpected failure presently he returned a slight frown upon his forehead  i am awfully sorry he announced but i cant find him anywhere i left him washing his hands and he said hed be down in a moment are you quite sure that we havent missed him  there hasnt been a sign of him molly declared promptly i am so hungry that my eyes have been glued upon the staircase all the time  pamela who had slipped away a few moments before rejoined them with a little expression of surprise  isnt captain graham here yet she asked incredulously  not a sign of him holderness replied queer set out isnt it we wont wait a moment longer take my sister and miss van teyl in will you he went on laying his hand on lutchesters shoulder ferrani will look after you ill follow directly  the chief maitre dhotel advanced to meet them with a gesture of invitation and led them to a table arranged for five the restaurant was crowded and the coloured band from the space against the wall on their left was playing a lively onestep ferrani was buttonholed by an important client as they crossed the threshold and they lingered for a moment waiting for his guidance whilst they stood there a curious thing happened the leader of the orchestra seemed to draw his fingers recklessly across the strings of his instrument and to produce a discord which was almost appalling a halfpained halfamused exclamation rippled down the room for a moment the music ceased the conductor who was responsible for the disturbance was sitting motionless his hand hanging down by his side his features remained imperturbable but the gleam of his white teeth and a livid little streak under his eyes gave to his usually goodhumoured face an utterly altered almost a malignant expression ferrani stepped across and spoke to him for a moment angrily the man took up his instrument waved his hand and the music recommenced in a subdued note pamela turned to the chief maitre dhotel who had now rejoined them  what an extraordinary breakdown she exclaimed is your leader a man of nerves  never have i heard such a thing in all my days ferrani assured them fervently joseph is one of the most wonderful performers in the world his control over his instrument is marvellous captain holderness asked particularly for this table  they seated themselves at the table reserved for them against the wall their cicerone was withdrawing with a low bow but pamela leaned over to speak to him  your music she told him is quite wonderful the orchestra consists entirely of americans i suppose  entirely madam ferrani assented they are real southern darkies from joseph the leader down to little peter who blows the motorhorn  pamelas interest in the matter remained unabated  i tell you it makes one feel almost homesick to hear them play she went on with a little sigh did they come direct from the states  ferrani shook his head  from paris madam before that for a little time they were at the winter garden in berlin they made quite a european tour of it before they arrived here  and he is the leaderthe man whom you call joseph pamela observed a broad goodhumoured facenot much intelligence i should imagine  ferranis protest was vigorous and gesticulatory he evidently had ideas of his own concerning joseph  more perhaps than you would think madam he declared he knows how to make a bargain believe me it cost us more than i would like to tell you to get these fellows here  pamela looked him in the eyes  be careful monsieur ferrani she advised that it does not cost you more to get rid of them  she leaned back in her place apparently tired of the subject and ferrani a little puzzled made his bow and withdrew the music was once more in full swing their luncheon was served and lutchester did his best to entertain his companions their eyes however every few seconds strayed towards the door there was no sign of the missing guest     chapter ii   molly holderness for whom grahams absence possessed perhaps more significance than the others relapsed very soon into a strained and anxious silence pamela and lutchester on the other hand divided their attention between a very excellent luncheon and an even flow of personal almost inquisitorial conversation  you will find pamela warned her companion almost as they took their places that i am a very curious person i am more interested in people than in events tell me something about your work at the war office  i am not at the war office he replied  well what is it that you do then she asked captain holderness told me that you had been out in france fighting but that you had some sort of official position at home now  i am at the ministry of munitions he explained  well tell me about that then she suggested is it as exciting as fighting  he shook his head  it has advantages he admitted but i should scarcely say that excitement figured amongst them  she looked at him thoughtfully lutchester was a little over thirtyfive years of age tall and of sinewy build his colouring was neutral his complexion inclined to be pale his mouth straight and firm his grey eyes rather deepset without possessing any of the stereotyped qualifications he was sufficiently goodlooking  i wonder you didnt prefer soldiering she observed  he smiled for a moment and pamela felt unreasonably annoyed at the twinkle in his eyes  i am not a soldier by profession he said but i went out with the expeditionary force and had a year of it they kept me here after a slight wound to take up my old work again  your old work she repeated i didnt know there was such a thing as a ministry of munitions before the war  he deliberately changed the conversation directing pamelas attention to the crowded condition of the room  gay scene isnt it he remarked  very she assented drily  do you come here to dance he inquired  she shook her head  you must remember that i have been living in paris for some months she told him you wont be annoyed if i tell you that the way you english people are taking the war simply maddens me your young soldiers talk about it as though it were a sort of picnic your middleaged clubmen seem to think that it was invented to give them a fresh interest in their newspapers and the rest of you seem to think of nothing but the money you are making and paris no i dont think i should care to dance here  lutchester nodded but pamela fancied somehow or other that his attitude was not wholly sympathetic his tone with its slight note of admonition irritated her  you must be careful he said not to be too much misled by externals  pamela opened her lips for a quick reply but checked herself  captain holderness and ferrani had entered the room and were approaching their table talking earnestly the latter especially was looking perplexed and anxious  its the queerest thing i ever knew holderness pronounced weve searched every hole and corner upstairs and there isnt a sign of sandy  have you tried the bar lutchester inquired  both the bar and the grillroom ferrani assured him  if he had been suddenly taken ill molly murmured  but there is no place in which he could have been taken ill which we have not searched ferrani reminded her  and besides holderness intervened sandy was in the very pink of health and bubbling over with highspirits  one noticed that lutchester remarked a little drily  he might almost have been called garrulous pamela agreed  ferrani took grave leave of them and holderness seated himself at the table  well lets get on with luncheon anyway he advised its no good bothering the best thing we can do is to conclude that the impossible has happenedthat sandy has met with some pals and will be here presently  or possibly lutchester suggested that he has done what certainly seems the most reasonable thinggone straight off to the war office with his formula and forgotten all about us let us return the compliment and forget all about him  they finished their luncheon a little more cheerfully as the cigarettes were handed round pamelas eyes looked longingly at a tray of turkish coffee which was passing  im a rotten host holderness declared but to tell you the truth this queer prank of sandys has driven everything else out of my mind here hassan  the coloured man in gorgeous oriental livery turned at once with a smile he approached the table bowing to each of them in turn pamela watched him intently and as his eyes met hers hassans hands began to shake  the waiter is bringing us ordinary coffee holderness explained please countermand it and bring us turkish coffee for four  the man had lost his savoir faire his wonderful smile had turned into something sickly his bland speech of thanks into a mumble he turned away almost sheepishly  hassan doesnt seem to like us today molly remarked  i should have said that he was drunk her brother observed looking after him curiously  there was certainly something the matter with hassan for it was at least a quarter of an hour before he reappeared and served his specially prepared concoction with the usual ceremony but with more restraint molly and the two men after hassan had sprinkled the contents of his mysterious little flask into their coffee gave him their hands for the customary salute when he came to pamela he hesitated she shook her head and he fell back bowing respectfully his hand tracing cabalistic signs across his heart for a moment before he departed he raised his eyes and glanced at her it was like the mute appeal of some hurt or frightened animal  you dont approve of hassans little ceremony lutchester asked her  she shrugged her shoulders  in america she observed i think we look upon coloured people of any sort a little differently well weve certainly given your friend a chance she went on glancing at the little jewelled watch upon her wrist weve outstayed almost every one here  their host paid the bill and they strolled reluctantly towards the door holderness and pamela a few steps behind  now what are your sister and mr lutchester studying again the latter inquired as they reached the lobby  molly had paused once more before the notice on the wall which seemed somehow to have fascinated her she read it out lingering on every word  mefiezvous taisezvous les oreilles ennemies vous ecoutent  holderness listened with a frown then he turned suddenly to lutchester who was standing by his side  it would be too ridiculous wouldnt ityou couldnt in any way connect the idea behind that notice with sandys disappearance  i was wondering about that myself lutchester confessed to tell you the truth i have been wondering all luncheontime if ever a man broke the letter and the spirit of that simple warning i should say your excitable young friend captain graham did  but here at henrys holderness protested with friends on every side isnt it a little too ridiculous well wait until the last person is out of the place anyway he added  the crowd soon began to thin ferrani seeing them still waiting approached with a little bow  your friend he asked he has not arrived eh  no sign of him holderness replied gloomily  what about his hat and coat ferrani inquired with a sudden inspiration  great idea holderness assented turning towards the cloakroom attendant dont you remember my friend james he went on he arrived about halfpast one and threw his coat and hat over to you  the attendant nodded and glanced towards an empty peg  i remember him quite well sir he acknowledged number sixtyseven was his number  where are his things then  gone sir the man replied  do you remember his asking for them  the attendant shook his head  cant say that i do sir he acknowledged but theyve gone right enough  a party of outgoing guests claimed the mans attention holderness turned away  this thing is getting on my nerves he declared does it seem likely that sandy should chuck his luncheon without a word of explanation come out and get his coat and hat and walk off and besides where was he all the time we were looking for him  it was unanswerable inexplicable they all looked at one another almost helplessly pamela held out her hand  well she announced i am sorry but im afraid that i must go i have a great many things to attend to this afternoon  you are going away soon lutchester inquired  she hesitated and at that moment mr fischer who had been saying farewell to his guests turned towards her  you are not thinking of the trip home yet miss van teyl he asked  oh i dont know she answered a little evasively im out of humour with london just now  perhaps we shall be fellowpassengers on thursday he ventured i am going over on the new york  i never make plans she told him  in any case mr fischer continued i shall anticipate our early meeting in new york i heard from your brother only yesterday  she looked at him with a slight frown  from james  mr fischer nodded  why i didnt know she observed that you and he were acquainted  i have had large transactions with his firm and naturally i have seen a good deal of mr van teyl the other explained he looks after the interests of us western clients  pamela turned a little abruptly away and lutchester walked with her to the door  you will let me see that they bring your car round he asked  she shook her head  thank you no she replied holding out her hand i have not yet said goodby to captain holderness and his sister goodby mr lutchester  her farewell was purposely chilly it seemed as though the slight sparring in which they had indulged throughout luncheontime had found its culmination in an antipathy which she had no desire to conceal lutchester however only smiled  nowadays he observed that is a word which it is never necessary to use  she withdrew her hand from his somewhat too tenacious clasp something in his manner puzzled as well as irritated her  do you mean that you too are thinking of taking a holiday from your strenuous labours she asked perhaps america is the safest country in the world just now for an englishman who  she stopped short realising the lengths towards which her causeless pique was carrying her  prefers departmental work to fighting were you going to add he said quietly well perhaps you are right at any rate i will content myself by saying au revoir  he passed through the turnstile door and disappeared pamela made her adieux to holderness and his sister and then recognising some acquaintances turned back into the restaurant to speak to them fischer who had just received his hat and cane from the cloakroom attendant stood watching her     chapter iii   pamela after a brief conversation with her friends once more left the restaurant in the lobby she called ferrani to her  has mr fischer gone ferrani she asked  not two minutes ago the man replied you wish to speak to him i can stop him even now  she shook her head  on the contrary she said drily mr fischer represents a type of my countrymen of whom i am not very fond he is a great patron of yours is he not  he is a large shareholder in the company ferrani confessed  then your restaurant will prosper she told him mr fischer has the name of being very fortunate that was a wonderful luncheon you gave us today  madame is very kind  will you do me a favour  ferranis gesture was allexpressive words were entirely superfluous  i want two addresses please first the address of joseph your head musician and secondly the address of hassan your coffeemaker  ferrani effectually concealed any surprise he might have felt he tore a page from his pocketbook  both i know he declared hassan lodges at a shop eighty yards away the name is haines and there are newspaper placards outside the door  that is quite enough pamela murmured  as for monsieur joseph ferrani continued that is a different matter he has i understand a small flat in tower mansions tower street leading off the edgware road the number is 18c so  he wrote it down and passed it to her pamela thanked him and stood up  now that i have done as you asked me ferrani concluded let me add a word both these men are already off duty and have left the restaurant if you wish to communicate with either of them i advise you to do so by letter  you are a very courteous gentleman mr ferrani pamela declared dropping him a little mock curtsey and good morning  she made her way into the street outside shook her head to the commissionaires upraised whistle and strolled along until she came to a cross street down which several motorcars were waiting she approached onea very handsome limousineand checked the driver who would have sprung from his seat  george she said i am going to pay a call at a disreputablelooking newsshop just where i am pointing you cant bring the car there as the street is too narrow you might follow me on foot and be about  the young man touched his hat and obeyed a few yards down the street pamela found her destination and entered a gloomy little shop a slatternly woman looked at her curiously from behind the counter  i am told that hassan lodges here the coffeemaker from henrys pamela began  the woman looked at her in a peculiar fashion  well  i wish to see him  you cant then was the curt answer hes at his prayers  at what pamela exclaimed  at his prayers the woman repeated brusquely there she added throwing open the door which led into the premises behind cant you hear him poor soul hes been pinching some more charms from ladies bracelets or something of the sort i reckon hes always in trouble he goes on like this for an hour or so and then he forgives himself  pamela stood by the open door and listenedlistened to a strange wailing chant which rose and fell with almost weird monotony  very interesting she observed i have heard that sort of thing before now will you kindly tell hassan that i wish to speak to him or shall i go and find him for myself  well youve got some brass the woman declared with a sneer  and some gold pamela assented passing a pound note over to the woman  do you want to see him alone the latter asked almost snatching at the note but still regarding pamela with distrustful curiosity  of course was the calm reply  the woman opened her lips and closed them again sniffed and led the way down a short passage at the end of which was a door  there you are she muttered throwing it open youve arst for it mind taint my business  she slouched her way back again into the shop at first pamela could scarcely see anything except a dark figure on his knees before a closed and shrouded window then she saw hassan rise to his feet saw the glitter of his eyes  pull up the blind hassan she directed  he came a step nearer to her the gloom in the apartment was extraordinary only his shape and his eyes were visible  do as i tell you she ordered pull up the blind it will be better  he hesitated then he obeyed even then the interior of the room seemed shadowy and obscure pamela could only see in contrast with the rest of the house that it was wonderfully and spotlessly clean in one corner barely concealed by a low screen his bed stood upon the floor hassan muttered something in an oriental tongue pamela interrupted him she spoke in the soothing tone one uses towards a child  thats all right hassan she said sorry to have interrupted you at your prayers but it had to be done you know me  yes mistress he answered unwillingly i your dragoman one year in cairo what you want here mistress  you know that i know she went on that you are a turk and a mohammedan and not an egyptian at all  yes mistress you know that he muttered  and you also know she continued that if i give you away to the authorities you will be sent at once to a very uncomfortable internment camp where you wont even have an opportunity to wash more than once a day where you will have to herd with all sorts of people who will make fun of your colour and your religion  dont mistress he shouted suddenly you will not tell i think you will not tell  he was sidling a little towards her again one of those curious changes seemed to have transformed him from a dumb passive creature into a savage there was menace in his eyes she waved him back without moving  i have come to make a bargain with you hassan she said just a few words that is all not quite so near please  he paused there was a moments silence his face was within a foot of hers lowering black bestial her eyes met his without a tremor her full sweet lips only curved into a faintly contemptuous line  you cannot frighten me hassan she declared no man has ever done that and outside i have a chauffeur with muscles of iron who waits for me be reasonable listen there are secrets connected with your restaurant  i know nothing he began at once nothing mistressnothing  quite naturally she continued i only need one piece of information a man disappeared there this morning i just have to find him thats all there is about it at halfpast one he was inveigled into the musicians room and by some means or other rendered unconscious at three oclock he had been removed i want to know what became of him you help me and the whole world can believe you to be an egyptian for the rest of their lives if you cant help me it is rather unfortunate for you because i shall tell the police at once who and what you are dont waste time hassan  he stood thinking rubbing his hands and bowing before her yet as she knew very well with murder in his heart once she saw his long fingers raised a little  quite useless hassan she warned him they hang you in england you know for any little trifle such as you are thinking of be sensible and i may even leave a few pound notes behind me  mistress should ask joseph he muttered i know nothing  oh mistress is going to ask joseph all right she assured him but i want a little information from you too youve got to earn your freedom you know hassan come what do they do with the people who disappear from the restaurant  not understand was the almost piteous reply  pamela sighed she had again the air of one being patient with a child  see here hassan she went on a few days ago i went over that restaurant from top to bottom with the manager there is the musicians room isnt there just over the entrance hall i suppose those little glass places in the floor are movable and then one can hear every word that is spoken below i am right so far am i not  hassan answered nothing his breathing however had become a little deeper  an unsuspecting person passing from the toilet rooms upstairs could easily be induced to enter i think that there must be another exit from that room yes  yes hassan faltered  to where  the winecellars  and from there  hassan was suddenly voluble truth unlocked his tongue  not know mistressnot know another thing no one enters winecellar but three men one of those not know if i guessi hassani look at little chapel left standing in waste place perhaps i wonder sometimes but i not know  pamela drew three notes from her gold purse smoothed them out and handed them over  three pounds hassan silence and good day youll live longer if you open your windows now and then and get a little fresh air instead of praying yourself hoarse  again the black figure swayed perilously towards her she affected not to notice not to notice the hand which seemed for a moment as though it would snatch the door handle from her grasp she passed out pleasantly and without haste the last sound she heard was a groan  done your bit o business eh the landlady asked curiously  pamela nodded assent  rather an odd sort of lodger for you isnt he  not so odd as his visitors the woman retorted with an evil sneer  pamela passed into the narrow street and drew a long sigh of relief then she entered her car and gave the chauffeur an address from the slip of paper which she carried in her hand when they stopped outside the little block of flats he prepared to follow her  tough neighbourhood this madam he said  maybe george she replied waving him back but youve got to stay down here if the man i am going to see thought i was frightened of him i wouldnt have a chance if i am not down in half an hour you can try number 18c  the chauffeur resumed his place on the drivingseat of the car pamela heartily disliking her surroundings was escorted by a shabby porter to a shabbier lift  youll find mr joseph in the lift boy assured her with a grin  pamela found the number at the end of an unswept stone passage at her third summons the door was cautiously opened by a large repulsivelooking woman with a mass of peroxidised hair she stared at her visitor first in amazement then in rapidly gathering resentment  mr joseph is at home she admitted truculently in response to pamelas inquiry what might you be wanting with him  if you will be so good as to let me in i will explain to mr joseph pamela replied  the woman seemed on the point of slamming the door suddenly there was a voice from behind her shoulder joseph appearednot the smiling joyous joseph of henrys but a sullenlooking negro dressed in shirt and trousers only with a heavy underlip and frowning forehead  let the lady pass and get into the kitchen nora he ordered come this way mam  pamela followed her guide into a parlour redolent of stale cigar smoke with oilcloth on the floor and varnished walls an abode even more horrible than hassans lair joseph closed the door carefully behind him and made no apology for his dishabille he simply faced pamela  say what is it you want with me he demanded truculently  a trifle she answered the key of the chapel in the little plot of waste ground next henrys  she meant him to be staggered and he was he reeled back for a moment  what the hell are you talking about he gasped  facts pamela replied do you want to save yourself joseph you can do it if you choose  he folded his arms and stood in front of the closed door without a collar his neck bulged unpleasantly behind there was nothing whatever left of the suave and genial chef dorchestra  save myself from what eh just let me get wise about it  pamelas eyebrows were daintily elevated  dear me she murmured i thought you were more intelligent listen you know where we met last let me remind you you were playing in the winter garden at berlin and the gentleman whom i was with an attache at the american embassy spoke to you he told me a good deal about your past life joseph and your present one you are in the pay of the secret service of germany am i to go to scotland yard and tell them so  he looked at her wickedly  youd have to get out of here first  dont be silly she advised him contemptuously remember youre talking to an american woman and dont waste your breath you can be in the secret service of any country you like without interference from me on the other hand theres just one thing i want from you  what is it i havent got any key  i want to discover exactly what has become of captain graham she declared  what the guy that missed his lunch today he growled  i see you know all about it she continued equably  so hes your spark is he joseph observed slowly his eyes blinking as he leaned a little forward  on the contrary pamela replied i have never met him however thats beside the point do i have the key of that chapel  you do not  have you got it  right here joseph assented dangling it before her eyes  i think its a fair bargain im offering you she reminded him you lose the key and keep your place you only have to keep your mouth shut and nothing happens  nothing doing the negro declared shortly keys as important as this aint lost if i part with it i get the chuck and i probably get into the same mess as the others if i keep it  if you keep it pamela interrupted you will probably stand with your back to the light in the tower within the next few days theyve left off being lenient with spies over here  he looked at her and there were things in his eyes which few women in the world could have seen without terror pamelas lips only came a little closer together she pressed the inside of the ring upon her third finger and a ray of green fire seemed to shoot forward  i guess im up against it he growled taking a step forward ill have something of whats coming to me if i swing for it  his arm was suddenly around her his face hideously close he gave a little snarl as he felt the pinprick through his shirt sleeve then he went spinning round and round with his hand to his head  what in gods name he spluttered what in hell  he reeled against the horsehair easychair and slipped on to the floor pamela calmly closed her ring stooped over him withdrew the key from his pocket crossed the room and the dingy little hall with swift footsteps and without waiting for the lift fled down the stone steps before she reached the bottom she heard the shrill ringing of the lift bell the angry shouting of the woman pamela however strolled quietly out and took her place in the car  back to the hotel george she directed the chauffeur dont stop if they call to you from the flats  the young man sprang up to his seat and the car glided off pamela leaned forward and looked at herself in the mirror there was a shade more colour in her face perhaps than usual but her low waves of chestnut hair were unruffled she used her powder puff with attentive skill and leaned back  thats the disagreeable part of it over anyway she sighed to herself contentedly     chapter iv   the last of the supperguests had left henrys restaurant the commissionaires whistle was silent the light laughter and frivolous adieux of the departing guests seemed to have melted away into a world somewhere beyond the pale of the unseasonable fog the little strip of waste ground adjoining was wrapped in gloom and silence the exterior of the bare and deserted chapel long since unconsecrate was dull and lifeless inside however began the march of strange things first of all the pinprick of light of a tiny electric torch seemed as though it had risen from the floor and hassan pushing back a trapdoor stepped into the bare dusty conventicle he listened for a moment then made a tour of the windows touched a spring in the wall and drew down long thick blinds afterwards he passed between the row of dilapidated benches and paused at the entrance door he stooped down examined the keyless lock shook it gently gazed upwards and downwards as though in vain search of bolts that were never there his white teeth gleamed for a moment in the darkness he turned away with a little shiver  not my fault he muttered to himself not my fault  he listened for a moment intently as though for footsteps outside the disturbance however came from the other end of the building there was a sharp knocking from the trapdoor by which he had ascended he touched an electric knob the place was dimly yet sufficiently illuminated he hastened towards the further end of the place and pulled up the trapdoor a melancholylooking little procession slowly emerged first of all came joseph stepping backwards supporting the head and shoulders of graham still bound and gagged after him came a dark swarthyfaced wine waiter who supported grahams feet behind followed fischer carrying his silk hat and cane in his hand he paused for a moment as he stepped on the floor of the chapel and brushed the dust from his trousers  you can take out the gag now he ordered the two men there isnt much shout in him  they laid him upon a couch and joseph obeyed the order grahams head swung helplessly on one side his eyes opened however and he struggled for consciousness his lips twitched for a moment in these long hours he had almost forgotten the habit of speech the words when they came sounded strange to him  whatwhere am i what do you want with me  fischer laid his hat and stick upon a table on which also stood a telephone instrument  the formula my young friend he replied for that wonderful explosive of which you spoke in the lobby  a sudden accession of nervous strength brought something almost like passion into the young mans reply although to himself there still seemed some unreality in the words which might have come from the walls or the roofsurely not from his lips  ill see you damned first  fischer smiled the man was goodlooking in his way but this was a pale and ugly smile  my request was merely a matter of courtesy he remarked the difficulty of searching you is not formidable it would have been undertaken long ago but for the fact that the restaurant has been crowded and gags sometimes slip besides there was no hurry observe  he leaned over graham who for the first time struggled furiously but ineffectually with his bonds his fingers all the time were straining towards the inside pocket of his coat fischer nodded understandingly  allow me to anticipate you he said  with a quick thrust he drew a little handful of papers from the pocket of his captive one by one he glanced them through and flung them on to the floor as he came towards the end of his search however his expression of confident complacency vanished his lips shrivelled up a little his eyes narrowed the last folded sheet of papera little perfumed note from peggy thanking sandy for his beautiful roseshe crumpled fiercely into a little ball he opened his lips to speak then he paused a new light broke in upon him the fury had passed from sandy grahams face in its stead there was an expression of blank astonishment  where is the formula fischer asked fiercely  there was no reply sandy graham was still staring at the little pile of papers upon the floor fischer made a brief examination of the other pockets then he stepped back his voice shook his face was dark and malevolent  joseph hassan juleslisten to me he ordered did any one else enter the musicians room whilst he was lying in the alcove  impossible jules declared  the door was locked hassan murmured  stop joseph exclaimed  fischer wheeled round upon him  well he exclaimed get on then who  joseph moistened his lips he was still feeling sore and dizzy but he began to see his way  you noticed perhaps he said the american girlthe beautiful young lady with this guys friends she was waiting with the others for captain graham to come down i saw her go up the stairs i saw her come down again three minutes later  miss van teyl fischer exclaimed with a frown youre mad joseph  the negro laughed grimly  am i he retorted i tell you this master fischer she was in berlin where i was and she was at the embassy every day she was asked to leave there they put her over the frontier into holland i knew her when she came into the restaurant shes no society young lady she aint bet you she was on to the goods  fischer hesitated for a moment the thoughts were chasing one another through his brain then he took up the receiver from the telephone instrument which stood upon the table  1560 mayfair he asked in a low tone  they all stood listening grouped around grahams writhing figure  hullo is that claridges hotel fischer went on i am speaking from giros put me through if you please to miss van teyls apartments what repeat that will you thank you  fischer laid down the receiver he turned towards the others he was breathing a little quickly and his eyes glittered behind his goldrimmed spectacles  miss van teyl he announced has left for tilbury she is going out on the lapland this morning my god shes got the formula  there was a moments silence joseph was standing by with a wicked look on his face  i saw her slip away he muttered and i watched her come down again there was just time  fischer turned suddenly to where graham was lying he drew a sheet of writing paper from the rack upon the table and a pencil from his pocket there was an evil and concentrated significance in his tone  that formula he said can be written again i think you had better write it  ill see you damned first was the weak but prompt reply  fischer bent a little lower over the prostrate figure look here he went on we dont run risks like this for nothing youre better dead than alive so far as we are concerned anyway wed planned to take the formula from you and you can guess the rest there are cellars underneath here into which no one ever goes who matters now heres a chance of life for you write down that formulatruthfully mindand well discuss the matter of taking your parole  see you damned first graham repeated his voice a little more tremulous but still convincing  fischer stood upright and turned to jules  get a bottle of brandy and a glass he ordered  the man pushed open the trapdoor and disappeared he came back again in a few moments with a bottle in one hand and a glass in the other fischer poured out some of the cordial and drew a small table up to grahams side  there he said loosening the cord around his left wrist drink that and think it over we shall be gone for about ten minutes if you change your mind before ring that little handbell if you have not changed your mind when we return it will be the cellars  beasts graham muttered  fischer shrugged his shoulders for a moment he had straightened himself his face had softened but it was in tune with his thoughts  i would twist the necks of a million fools like you he said for the sake of  he paused leaving his sentence uncompleted and beckoned to the other men they followed him through the trapdoor and down into the cellars below the place was once more silent graham rolled from side to side drew a long breath and tugged vainly at his bonds the effort overtaxed his strength he seemed to feel the darkness closing in upon him the rushing of the sea in his ears     chapter v   so far as sandy graham was concerned his unconsciousness might have lasted an hour or a day as a matter of fact it was scarcely a minute after the disappearance of fischer and his confederates when he was conscious of a rush of cold air in the place and beheld the vision of a tiny flash of light at the lower end of the gloomy building immediately afterwards he heard the soft closing of a door and beheld a tall shadowy figure slowly approaching he lay quite still and looked at it and his heart began to beat with hope one of the lights had been left burning and there was something in the bearing and attitude of the man who finally came to a standstill by his side which was entirely reassuring  lutchester he faltered my god how did you get here  offices of a young lady lutchester observed producing a knife from his pocket allow me  he cut the cords which still secured grahams limbs then he looked around him  how did they bring you here he whispered i suppose there is a passage from the restaurant  up through a trapdoor there graham explained pointing  lutchester stood over it and listened intently  then he turned around lifted the glass of brandy from the table smelt it approvingly and tasted it  excellent he pronounced the 1840 allow me  he refilled the glass and handed it to sandy who gulped down the contents the effect was almost instantaneous in less than a minute he had staggered to his feet  feel strong enough to walk about fifty yards lutchester inquired  id walk to hell to get out of this place was the prompt reply  lutchester took his arm and they passed down the dusty aisle between the wormeaten and decaying benches and through the outside door which lutchester closed and locked behind them the rush of cold air was like new life to graham  i can walk all right now he muttered my god well give these fellows hell for this  they made their very difficult way across a plot of ground from which a row of dilapidated cottages had been razed to the ground the fog still hung around them and seemed to bring with it a curious silence although the dying traffic from one of the main thoroughfares reached them in muffled notes lutchester climbed to the top of a pile of rubbish and then turning around held out his hand  up here he directed  graham struggled up until he stood by his companions side the latter stood quite still listening for a moment then he climbed a little higher and swung around holding out his hand once more  im on top of the wall he said come on  grahams knees were shaking but with lutchesters help he staggered up and reached his side on the pavement below a man in chauffeurs livery was standing holding out his hands and by the side of the curbstone a closed car was waiting somehow or other the two reached the pavement lutchester almost pushed his companion into the limousine and stepped in after him the chauffeur sprang to his seat and the car glided off graham just realised that there was a woman by his side whose face was vaguely familiar then the waves broke in upon his ears once more  i was right then it seems pamela observed approvingly you were just the man for this little affair  lutchester sighed  unfortunately he confessed a messenger boy would have been as effective i stumbled over to the chapelrubber shoes you observe he remarked pointing downwardsand soon discovered that blinds had been let down all round and that there were people inside there was just a faint chink in one and i caught a glimpse of several men your friend oscar amongst them having he went on an immense regard for my personal safety i was hesitating what means to adopt when the lights were lowered and it seemed to me that the men were disappearing  do go on pamela murmured this is most exciting  in a sense it was disappointing lutchester complained i had pictured for myself a dramatic entrance  a quiet turning of the key a soft approachowing to my shoes he reminded hera cough perhaps or a breath  discovery me with a revolver in my hand pointed to the archvillainif you stir youre a dead man  natural collapse of the villain with my left hand i slash the bonds which hold graham with my right i cover the miscreants one of them perhaps might creep behind me and i hesitate if i move my revolver the other two will get the drop on mei think that is the correct expression a wonderful moment that miss van teyl  but it didnt happen she protested  ah i forgot that he acknowledged still i was prepared i had the revolver all right but as you say it didnt happen i made my way to the chapel door let myself in found our friend lying in a halfcomatose state upon one of the blue plush henry sofas in the shadow of a horrible deal pulpit i gathered that he had been left there to reflect upon his sins there was a bottle of remarkably fine brandy within reach which i tested and with which i dosed our friend here i then cut away his bonds arm in arm we walked down the aisle i locked up the place threw the key away kicked my shins halfadozen times crossing that disgusting little plot of land climbed boldly to the top of the wall and behold  pamela smiled upon him in congratulatory fashion  on the whole she said i am quite glad that i telephoned to you  you showed a sound discretion he admitted  if he had not been lame she confessed i should have sent to captain holderness  that would have been a great mistake lutchester assured her holderness is a good fellow but devoid of imagination he is great on constituted authority he would have probably marched up with a squad of heavyfooted policemenand found nothing  yet i must confess pamela persisted with a frankness unaccountable even to herself that if i could have thought of any one else i should never have telephoned to you  and why not  because i should not have classified you as being of the adventurous type she declared  lutchester looked injured  after all he protested that is not my fault that is due to your singular lack of perception however i am able to return the compliment i for my part should have thought that you were more interested in the fashions than in paying exceedingly rash visits to degenerate orientals and negroes  perhaps some day she remarked we may understand one another better  he met her gaze with a certain seriousness  i hope that we may he said  for some reason they were both silent for a moment her tone had changed a little when she spoke again  you are sure she asked that you do not mind my leaving the rest of this affair in your hands there are reasons which i cannot tell you of just now which make me anxious not to appear in it at all  i accept the charge as a privilege he assented we are within a few yards of my rooms now i promise you that i will look after captain graham and advise him as to the proper course for him to pursue  the car came to a standstill  this then she said holding out her hand will be goodby for the present  he held her fingers for a moment without reply quite suddenly she decided that she liked him then he lifted graham who was half asleep half unconscious to his feet and assisted him from the car  where shall i tell the man to go to he inquired  he knows she answered with sudden taciturnity  wherever it may be then he replied bon voyage     chapter vi   it was about halfanhour later when sandy graham opened his eyes and began to feel the life once more warm in his veins he was seated in the most comfortable easychair of john lutchesters bachelor sittingroom by his side was a coffee equipage and a decanter of brandy his head still throbbed and his bones ached but his mind was beginning to grow clearer lutchester who had been seated at the writing table swung round in his chair at the sound of his guests movement  feeling better eh he asked  i am all right now was the somewhat shaky reply got a head like a turnip and a tongue like a limekiln but im beginningto feel myself  hows your memory  hazy let me see my god ive been robbed havent i  so i imagine lutchester replied you rather asked for it didnt you  graham moved uneasily in his place he had suddenly the feeling of being back at schooland in the presence of the headmaster  i suppose i did in a way he admitted but at henryswhy ive always looked upon the place as a club more than anything else  i am afraid that i cant agree with you there lutchester observed i should consider henrys a remarkably cosmopolitan restaurant where a man in your position should exercise more than even ordinary restraint  i suppose i was wrong graham muttered but i had been working for about ten hours on end and then rushed up to london in the car to try and keep my appointment with holderness  stop anywhere on the way  we had a few drinks graham confessed i was so done up perhaps i had more than i meant to however its no use bothering about that now ive been robbed and thats all there is about it could we get on to scotland yard from here  we could but i dont think we will lutchester replied  graham was puzzled  why not he demanded that formula was the most wonderful thing that has ever been put together and the whole things so simple ive been afraid every second that some one else might stumble upon it  it is without doubt a great loss lutchester admitted all the same i dont fancy that its a scotland yard business exactly have you any idea who robbed you  graham paused to think his eyes were still troubled and uncertain  its coming back to me he muttered i remember that beastly barn of a chapel there were jules and that musician fellow and the big american he emptied my pockets  why of course i remember how angry he was  my pocketbook was gone they left me alone to write out the formula again and then you came how on earth did you tumble on to my being there lutchester  it was miss pamela van teyl whom you must thank lutchester told him not me it seems she knew more about henrys than any of us shed come up against some of the crew in berlin and she guessed they were holding you for that formula she got the key out of one of those men and then telephoned to me for my help  and i never even thanked her graham murmured weakly  there was a moments silence the recovering mans consciousness of his position and of events was evidently as yet incomplete he sat up suddenly in his chair gripping the sides of it his eyes were large with reminiscent trouble  my pocketbook had gone when they searched me he muttered  are you sure that you had it with you when you came into henrys lutchester inquired  absolutely certain  do you think you can remember now what happened when you went upstairs  i reached the lavatory all rightyou were with me then werent you graham said reflectively i hung up my coat while i washed but there was no one else in the room then you went downstairs and i brushed my hair and just stopped to light a cigarette you know that on the righthand side of the landing there is a room where the musicians change joseph that black devil was standing in the doorway he grinned as i came into sight lady wants to speak to you for a moment captain graham he said well you know how harmless the fellow looksjust a goodnatured smiling nigger i never dreamed of anything wrong as a matter of fact i thought that peggy vincentthats a young lady i often go to henrys withwanted to have a word with me before i joined our party i stepped inside the room and thats just about all i can remember it must have been jolly quick his arm shot round my neck the door was closed and that other brutehassan i think it washeld something over my face  but that room was searched lutchester reminded him  well i came to just a little graham explained i found that i was in a sort of cupboard place behind the lockers these fellows have for their clothes it opens with a spring lock and youd never notice it searching the room  who was the first person you saw when you recovered consciousness  grahams forehead was wrinkled in the effort to remember  i cant quite get hold of it he confessed but i have a sort of fancy i cant altogether get rid of that there was a woman about  lutchester looked at the end of the cigarette he had just lit  a woman he repeated thats queer  i cant remember anything definitely until i woke up in that chapel graham continued but when they searched me and found that the pocketbook had gone fischer the big american muttered some womans name i was queer just at the moment but it sounded very much to me like miss van teyls he rang her up on the telephone  did they suspect miss van teyl then of having taken your pocketbook  graham shook his head  i lost the drift of things just then he admitted she couldnt have done in any case forgive me but arent we wasting time mr lutchester we must do something couldnt you ring up scotland yard now  i certainly could lutchester assented but as i told you just now i dont think that i will  graham stared at him  but why not  for certain very definite reasons with which you neednt trouble yourself just now lutchester pronounced the formula has gone without a doubt but it certainly isnt in the hands of any of the people at henrys  but theres that american fellowfischer graham exclaimed he was the ringleader  just so lutchester murmured thoughtfully however he hasnt got the formula  but he planned the attack upon me graham protested he is an enemya germansheltering himself under his american naturalization surely were going for him  hes a wrong un of course lutchester admitted but he hasnt got the formula  but we must do something graham continued his anger rising as his strength returned why the place is a perfect den of conspirators i expect ferrani himself is in it and theres that other maitre dhotel jules and those black beasts joseph and hassan besides fischer my god they shall pay for this  lutchester nodded  i dare say they will he admitted but not quite in the way you are thinking of  graham half rose to his feet  look here he said im sane enough now arent i and in my proper senses you are not going to suggest that we dont turn the police on to that damned place  i certainly am was the brief reply  graham was aghast  what do you mean to do then  leave them alone for the present not one of them has the formula not one of them even knows where it is  but the attack upon me  you asked for all you got lutchester told him curtly and perhaps a little more  the first tinge of colour came back to grahams cheeks his eyes flashed with anger  perhaps i did he admitted but that doesnt alter the fact that im going to have some of my own back out of them  lutchester crossed his legs and turned round in his chair for the first time he directly faced his visitor his tone though not unkindly was imperative  young fellow he said youll have to listen to me about this  a smouldering sense of revolt suddenly found words  listen to you what the devil have you got to do with it graham demanded  i hate to remind any one of an obligation lutchester answered but i am under the impression that together with miss van teyl of course i rescued you from an exceedingly inconvenient situation  i havent had time yet to tell you how grateful i am graham said awkwardly you were a brick of course and how you and miss van teyl tumbled on to the whole thing i cant imagine but i dont understand what youre getting at now you cant suggest that i am to leave these fellows alone and not give information to the police  the character of the place lutchester assured him is already perfectly well known to the heads of the police the matter will be dealt with but not in the way you suggest and so far as regards fischer i do not wish him interfered with for the present  you do not wish him interfered with graham repeated where the devil do you come in at all  you can leave me out of the matter for the present you want the formula back dont you  my god yes graham muttered fervently its all very well to give one a pencil and a piece of paper and say write it out but there are calculations and proportions  precisely lutchester interrupted you want it back again why not let fischer do the business he has an idea where its gone the thing to do seems to me to follow him  to follow fischer graham repeated vaguely  precisely if he thinks the formula is in england fischer will stay in england if he thinks that it has gone abroad he will go abroad if we leave him free we can watch which he does  graham swallowed half a wineglassful of the brandy by his side then he leaned forward  look here he said youll forgive me if i repeat myself and ask you once morewhat the hell has all this got to do with you  just this much lutchester replied that i insist upon your taking the course of action in this matter which i propose  you mean graham protested working himself gradually into a state of wrath that i am to go back to my rooms as though nothing had happened see holderness and the others tomorrow and not have a word of explanation to offer that i am to leave those blackguards at henrys to try their dirty games on some one else and let fischer the man who was fully inclined to become my murderer go away unharmed i think not mr lutchester i am much obliged for your help but you are talking piffle  what do you propose to do then  i am going round to scotland yard myself  lutchester rose to his feet  stay where you are for a minute please he begged  he passed into a smaller room and graham could hear faintly the sound of the telephone in a minute or two his host returned  go in there and speak graham he invited you will find some one you know at the other end  graham did as he was bidden and lutchester closed the door after him for a few minutes the latter sat in his chair smoking quietly his eyes fixed upon the fire then his unwilling guest reappeared he came into the room a little unsteadily and looked with new eyes at the man who seemed so unaccountably to have taken over the control of his affairs  i dont understand all this he muttered who the devil are you anyway lutchester  a very ordinary person i can assure you was the quiet reply however you are satisfied i suppose that my advice is good  yes i am satisfied graham answered nervously you know thatthat im under arrest  lutchester nodded  well youre not asking for my sympathy i suppose he observed drily  the young man flushed  i know that i behaved like a fool he admitted all the same ive been working night and day for weeks on this problem i havent even been up to town once i must say i think they seem inclined to be a little hard on me  no one is going to be in the least hard on you lutchester assured him you have committed a frightful indiscretion and all that is asked of you now is to keep your mouth shut if you do that i think a way will be found for you out of your troubles  but what is to become of me graham demanded  i understand that you are to be taken to northumberland tomorrow lutchester informed him there you will be allowed every facility for fresh experiments in the meantime i have promised to give you a shakedown here for the night you will find a soldier on guard outside your door but you can treat him as your servant  you are very kind graham faltered a little vaguely if only i could understand  lutchester rose to his feet his manner became more serious his tone had in it a note of finality  captain graham he interrupted dont try to understand i will tell you as much as this if it helps you henrys restaurant will be placed under the closest surveillance but we wish nothing disturbed there at the moment until we have discovered the future plans of mr oscar fischer  the big germanamerican graham muttered hes the man you ought to get hold of  some day i hope that we may lutchester declared for the moment however we want him undisturbed you would scarcely believe it perhaps if i told you that the theft of your formulas is only a slight thing compared to the bigger business that man has on hand there is something else at the back of his head which is worth heaven and earth to us to understand we want the formula and we shall have it but more than anything else in the world we want to know why fischer has pledged his word in berlin to bring this war to an end within three months we have to find that out and we are going to find it outfrom him you see i have treated you with confidence captain graham now let me show you to your room graham put his hand to his forehead  i feel as though this were some sort of nightmare he muttered ive known you for several months mr lutchester and i have never heard you say a serious word you dance at henrys you made a good soldier they said but youd had enough of it in twelve months you play auction bridge in the afternoons and you talk about the war as though it were simply an irritating circumstance and tonight  lutchester threw open the door of his own bedroom and pointed to the bathroom beyond  my man has put out everything he thinks you may want he said try and get a good nights sleep and graham  yes  dont bother your head about me and dont ask any more questions     chapter vii   the lapland was two days out from tilbury before pamela appeared on deck followed by her maid with an armful of cushions and the deck steward with her rugs she had scarcely made herself comfortable in a sunny corner when she was aware of the approach of a large familiar figure her astonishment was entirely genuine  mr fischer she exclaimed why how on earth did you catch this steamer i thought you were coming on the thursday boat  some inducement to change my mind mr fischer replied drawing a chair up to her side  meaning me  i guess thats so  of course im exceedingly flattered pamela observed or rather i should be if i believed you but i dont see how you could leave a supperparty at henrys and go straight to tilbury  say how did you know i was supping at henrys he inquired  because i was there for luncheon myself as you know she answered carelessly and i heard you order your table for supper  mr fischer nodded reminiscently  i always wind up with a little supper at henrys on my last night in london he remarked it left me two hours to get down to tilbury but it dont take me long to start for anywhere when i once make up my mind thats the american of us i suppose besides i never need much in the way of luggage i keep clothes over on the other side and clothes in new york and a grip always ready packed for a journey  youre so typical she murmured smiling  i dont know about that he replied my business makes it necessary for me to be always on the go have you heard from your brother lately  pamela shook her head  jimmy is the most terrible correspondent she complained i dont think ive had any mail from him for two months  you didnt know that he and i were sharing rooms together then in the plaza hotel i suppose  pamela turned her head a little and gazed at her companion in genuine surprise  sharing rooms in the plaza hotel she repeated you and jimmy  i guess thats so mr fischer assented we were doing business together one day and the subject cropped up somehow or other your brother was thinking of making a move and id just been shown these rooms which were a trifle on the large side for me i made him an offer and he jumped at it  i hope youre not leading james into extravagant ways she remarked anxiously i loved his little apartment in fortysecond street and it was so inexpensive  your brothers share of these rooms isnt anything more than he can afford mr fischer assured her that i can promise you i guess his firm is doing well just now if theyve many more clients like me they are  it is very nice of you to put business in his way pamela said thoughtfully i wonder why you do it mr fischer  why shouldnt i  well pamela went on her eyes travelling out seaward for a moment you seem to be one of those sort of men mr fischer who never do anything without an object  some powers of observation he admitted blithely  you have an object in being kind to jimmy then  mr fischer produced a cigar case and selected a cheroot  mind my smoking  not in the least the only time i mind things is when people dont answer my questions  i was only kind of hesitating mr fischer went on leaning back once more in his chair you want the truth dont you  i never think anything else is worth while  in the first place then her companion began your brother belongs to what i suppose is known as the exclusive set in new york i am a westerner with few friends there through him i have obtained introductions to several people whom it was interesting to me from a business point of view to know  i see pamela murmured you are at least frank mr fischer  i am going to be more frank still he promised her then another reason of course was because i liked him and a third which i am not sure wasnt the chief of all because he was your brother  pamela laughed gaily  is that necessary  necessary or not its the truth he assured her i am a man of quick impressions and lasting ones  but weve never met except on a steamer pamela reminded him  i know its the fashion mr fischer said to turn up ones nose at steamer acquaintances it isnt like that with me you see i dont have as much opportunity of meeting folk as some others perhaps the most interesting people ive known socially ive met on steamers i sat at your table side by side with you miss van teyl for seven days a few months ago i guess ill remember those seven days as long as i live  pamela turned her head and looked at him the faintly derisive smile died away from her lips the man was in earnest a certain curiosity stole into her eyes as the seconds passed she studied his hard strong face with its great jaw and prominent forehead the mouth a little too full and belying the rest of his physiognomy yet with its own peculiar strength he had taken off his spectacles and it seemed to her that the cold flinty light of his eyes had caught for a moment some touch of the softer blue of the sea or the sky seated he lost some of the awkwardness of his too great and illcarried height it seemed to her that he was at least a person to be reckoned with either in friendship or enmity  are you an american born mr fischer she asked him  he shook his head  i was born at offenbach he told her near frankfurt my father brought me out to america when i was eleven years old  you must find the present condition of things a little trying for you she observed  oscar fischer put on his glasses again he did not answer for several moments  that opens up a subject miss van teyl he said which some day i should like to discuss with you  why not now she invited i feel much more inclined for conversation than reading  tell me then to begin with he asked thoughtfully on which side are your sympathies  i try to do my duty as an american citizen she replied promptly and that is to have no sympathies our dear country has set the world an example of what neutrality should be i think it is the duty of us americans to try and bring ourselves into exactly the same line of feeling  he changed his position a little uneasily his attitude became less of a sprawl his eyes were fixed upon her face  i fear he said that we are going to begin by a disagreement i do not consider that america has realised in the least the duties of a neutral nation  you must explain that at once if you please before we go any further pamela insisted  is this neutrality fischer demanded his rather harsh voice almost raucous now with a touch of real feeling america ships daily millions of dollars worth of those things that make war possible to france to italy above all to england she keeps them supplied with ammunition clothing scientific instruments fooda dozen things which make war easier to germany she sends nothing is that neutrality  but america is perfectly willing to deal in the same way with germany pamela pointed out german agents can come and place their orders and take away whatever they want the market is as much open to her as to the allies  fischer was sitting bolt upright in his chair now there was a little spot of colour in his cheeks and his eyes flashed behind his spectacles he struck the side of the chair he was very angry  that is jesuitical he declared it is perfectly wellknown that germany is not in a position to fetch munitions from america therefore i say that there is no neutrality in supplying one side in the war with goods which the other is unable to procure  then you place upon america the onus of germanys naval inferiority pamela remarked drily  germanys maritime inferiority does not exist mr fischer protested when the moment arrives that the high seas fleet comes out for action the world will know the truth  then hadnt it better come pamela suggested and clear the ocean for your commerce  that isnt the point fischer insisted we have wandered from the main issue i say that america abandons its neutrality when it helps the allies to continue the war  i dont think you will find pamela replied that international law prevents any neutral country from supplying either combatant with munitions if one country can fetch the things and the other cant that is the misfortune of the country that cant for one moment look at the matter from englands point of view she has built up a mighty navy to keep the seas clear for exactly this purposeto continue her commerce from abroad germany instead has built up a mighty army with which she has overrun europe germany has had the advantage from her army why shouldnt england have the advantage from her navy  let me ask you the question you asked me a few minutes ago her companion begged were you born in americaor england  i was born in america pamela told him so were my parents and my grandparents i claim to be american to the backbone i claim even to treat any sympathies i might have in this affair as prejudices and not even to allow them a single corner in my brain  mr fischer sat quite still for several moments he was struggling very hard to keep his temper in the end he succeeded  we will not then pursue the subject of americas neutrality he said because it is obvious that we disagree fundamentally but tell me this now as an american and a patriot which do you think would be better for americathat germany and austria won this war or the allies  upon that question i have not altogether made up my mind pamela confessed  then there is room there for a discussion mr fischer pointed out eagerly i should like to put my views before you on this matter  and i should love to hear them pamela replied but i feel just now as though we had talked enough politics do you know that i came up on deck in a state of great agitation  submarine alarms from the stewardess mr fischer suggested  i am not afraid of submarines but i have a most profound dislike for thieves pamela declared  you have not had anything stolen he asked quickly  i have not pamela replied but the only reason seems to be that i have nothing worth stealing when i got back from luncheon this afternoon i found that my stateroom had been systematically searched  she turned her head a little lazily and looked at her neighbour his expression was entirely sympathetic  your jewellery  deposited with the purser  i congratulate you he said  nothing has been stolen she observed but one hates the feeling of insecurity all the same both my steward and stewardess are old friends it must have been a very clever person who found his way into my room  a very clever person mr fischer objected would have known that you had deposited your jewels with the purser  if it was my jewels of which they were in search pamela murmured by the bye do you remember all that fuss about the disappearance of a young soldier that morning at henrys  fischer nodded  i heard something about it he confessed they were talking about it at dinnertime  i had an idea that you might be interested pamela went on he was rather a foolish young man he came into the restaurant telling every one at the top of his voice that he had made a great discovery even in london which is i should think the most prosaic city in the world there must be people who are on the lookout to pick up war secrets  even in london as you remark fischer assented  you didnt hear the end of the affair i suppose she asked him  the steward had arrived with afternoon tea fischer threw into the sea the cigar which he had been smoking  i do not think he said that the end has been reached yet  pamela sighed  les oreilles ennemies she quoted i suppose one has to be careful everywhere     chapter viii   it was one evening towards the end of the voyage and about an hour after dinner a huge form loomed out of the darkness continuing its steady promenade along the unlit portion of the deck pamela moved by some caprice abandoned her caution of the last few days and called out  mr fischer  he stopped short the sparks flew from the red end of his cigar which he tossed into the sea he hastened towards her  miss van teyl he replied a little hesitatingly  how clever of you to know my voice she observed i am in the humour to talk will you sit down please  mr fischer humbly drew a chair to her side  i had an idea he said that you had been avoiding me the last two or three days  i have she admitted  have i offended you then  scarcely that she replied only you see it seemed waste of time to talk to you with the foils on and a little dangerous perhaps to talk to you with them off  his face reflected his admiration  miss van teyl he declared you are quite a wonderful person i have never believed very much in women before perhaps that is the reason why i have never married  dear me are you a womanhater she asked  he looked at her steadfastly  i have made use of women as playthings he confessed until i met you i never thought of them as companions as partners  she laughed at him through the darkness and at the sound of her laugh his eyes glowed  really i am very much flattered she said you give me credit for intelligence then  i give you credit for every gift a woman should have he answered enthusiastically i recognise in you the woman i have sometimes dreamed of  again she laughed  dont tell me mr fischer she protested that ever in your practical life you have spent a single moment in dreams  i have spent many he assured her but they have all been since i knew you  pamela sighed  i have never been through a voyage she observed without a love affair still i never suspected you mr fischer  you suspected me perhaps of other things  she nodded  i am full of suspicions about you she admitted i am not going to tell you what they are of course  there is one thing of which i am guilty he confessed i should like to tell you about it right now  could i guess it  youre clever enough  you like me dont you mr fischer  better than any woman in the world he answered promptly and my confession iswell just that will you marry me  pamela shook her head  quite early in life she confided i made up my mind that i would never give a definite answer to any one who proposed to me on a steamer i suppose its the wind or is it the stars or the silence or what i have known the sanest of men even like you mr fischer become quite maudlin  i am brimful of common sense at the present moment he declared earnestly you and i could do great things together if only i could get you to look at one certain matter from my point of view to see it as i see it  a political matter she inquired naively  i want to try and persuade you he confessed that america has everything in the world to gain from germanys success and everything to lose if the allies should triumph in this war and great britain should continue her tyranny of the seas  its an extraordinarily interesting subject pamela admitted  it is almost as absorbing he declared as the other matter which just now lies even nearer to my heart  she withdrew her fingers from his sudden clutch  mr fischer she told him what i said just now was quite final i will not be made love to on a steamer  when we land he continued eagerly you will be coming to see your brother wont you  she nodded  of course i am coming to the plaza hotel that i suppose is good news for you mr fischer  of course it is he answered but why do you say so  it will give you so many opportunities she murmured  of seeing you  she shook her head  of searching my belongings  there was a moments silence she heard his quick breath through the darkness his voice assumed its harsher tone  you believe that it was i who searched your stateroom  i am sure that it was you or some one acting for you  what is it then of which i am in search he demanded  captain grahams formula she replied i think you want that a good deal more than you want me  you have it then he asked fiercely  she sighed  you jump so to conclusions i didnt say so  you went up the stairs  you were the only person who went up just at that one psychological moment he had his pocketbook with him when he came inhe told holderness so  and when you searched him it was gone she remarked calmly dear me  how do you know that i searched him fischer demanded  how dare you ask me to give away my secrets she replied  listen he began striving with an almost painful effort to keep his voice down to the level of a whisper you and i together we could do the most marvellous things i could let you into all my schemes they are great they will be successful after the war is over  he held his breath for a moment the tramp of approaching footsteps warned him of the coming of an intruder the captain came to a standstill before their chairs and saluted  miss van teyl he said there will be a mutiny in the saloon if you dont come down and sing  she almost sprang to her feet the ship was rolling a little and she laid her fingers upon his arm  i meant to come long ago she declared but mr fischer has been so interesting you will finish telling me your experiences another time wont you she called out over her shoulder there is so much that i still want to hear  fischers reply was almost ungracious he watched their departure in silence and afterwards leaned further back in his chair with long nervous fingers he drew a black cigar from his case and lit it then he folded his arms for more than half an hour he sat there motionless smoking furiously he looked out into the chaos of the windy darkness he heard voices riding upon the seas shrieking and calling to him voices to which he had been deaf too long the burden of these later years of turbulent brazen selfish struggling rolled back he had been a sentimentalist once a willing seeker after things which seemed to have passed him by at his age he told himself a man should still find more than one place in the world     chapter ix   james van teyl glanced curiously at the small dark figure standing patiently before him and then back again at the wireless cable which he held in his fingers he was just back from a tiring day in wall street and was reclining in the most comfortable easychair of his hotel plaza sittingroom  gee he murmured this beats me the last thing i should have thought we wanted here was a valet the fellow who looks after this suite has scarcely anything else to do what did you say your name was  nikasti sir  van teyl carefully reconsidered the cable it certainly seemed to leave no room for misunderstanding  please engage for our service as valet nikasti see that he enters on his duties at once hope land this evening your sister on board sends lovef  well that seems clear enough the young man muttered thrusting the form into his waistcoat pocket youre here to stay i guess nikasti i see youve brought your kit along  in case you decided to engage me sir the man replied  oh you are engaged right enough van teyl assured him youd better make the best job you can of putting out my evening clothes if you ring for the floor valet hell help you the bedrooms are through that door  very good sir  i am going down to the barbers now van teyl continued rising to his feet just remember this nikastiwhat a name by the bye  i could be called kato the man suggested  kato for me all the time his prospective employer agreed well listen my sister miss van teyl arrives from europe on the lapland this evening if she comes in or rings up say im here and i want to see her at once you understand  i understand sir  van teyl strolled out and kato disappeared into the inner room the floor valet dressed in the dark blue livery of the hotel was already laying out his masters dinner clothes he eyed the intruder a little truculently  who are you anyway he inquired  my name is nikasti was the quiet reply mr van teyl has engaged me as his valet to wait upon him and mr fischer  the man laid down the shirt into which he was fixing the studs  thats some news he remarked bitterly  to wait on mr van teyl and mr fischer eh what the hell do they want you for  nikasti shook his head slowly he was very small and his dark eyes seemed filled with melancholy  it is not for a very long time he ventured  long enough to do me out of my five dollars tip every week the man grumbled im a married man too and a good american blast you fellows coming and taking our jobs away cant think what they let you into the country for  i am sorry nikasti murmured  your sorrow dont bring me in my five dollars the valet retorted bitterly theres only two suites on this floor to work for anyway and this is the only one worth a cent  i am taking the situation the other explained for the sake of experience i do not wish to rob you of your earnings i will pay you the five dollars a week while i stay here you shall help me with the work  thats a deal my little yellowskinned kid the valet agreed in a tone of relief ill show you where the things are kept  his new coadjutor bowed  the telephone is ringing in the masters room he observed you shall remain here and i will answer it  that goes jappy the man acquiesced if its a young lady take her name but dont say that mr van teyls about forward young baggages some of them are  nikasti glided from the room closed the door and approached the telephone receiver  yes he acknowledged these are the rooms of mr van teyl no madam mr van teyl is not in at present  there was a moments pause nikastis face was impenetrable as he listened but his eyes glowed  yes i understand madam he said softly you are miss van teyl and you wish to speak to your brother the moment mr van teyl returns i will ring you up or fetch you  he replaced the receiver upon its hook and returned to the bedroom for some little time he was initiated into the mysteries of his new masters studs boots and shoes and general taste in wearing apparel then the latter entered the sittingroom and nikasti obeyed his summons  anyone called me up he inquired  no one sir  van teyl glanced at the clock in an undecided manner  ill change right away he decided just set things to rights in here fill my cigarette case and hang round by the telephone  nikasti bowed and the young man disappeared into the inner room his new attendant waited until the door was closed then he removed the receiver from its hook laid it upon the table and moved stealthily towards the open fireplace for several moments he remained in an attitude of listening then with quick lithe fingers he drew from his pocket a cable dispatch reread it with an air of complete absorption and committed it to the flames he watched it burn and turned away from the contemplation of its grey ashes with a sigh of content suddenly he started the door of the sittingroom had been opened and closed a tall broadshouldered man wearing goldrimmed spectacles a long travelling coat and a homburg hat was standing watching him nikasti was only momentarily disturbed his look of gentle inquiry was perfect  you wish to see my mastermr van teyl he asked  where is he fischer demanded  he is dressing in the next apartment i will take him your name  fischer threw his coat and hat upon the table  thatll do directly he replied so youre nikasti  they looked at one another for a moment the face of the japanese was smooth bland and imperturbable his eyes were innocent even of any question fischers forehead was wrinkled and his brows drawn close together  i am nikasti the other acknowledgedkato nikasti mr van teyl has just engaged me as his valet  you can take off the gloves fischer told him i am oscar fischer  oscar fischer nikasti repeated  yes  burning something when i came in werent you looked like a cable eh  a dispatch from london nikasti confided  nothing that would interest me eh  it was a family message was the calm response it did not concern the affair which is between us  how came you to speak english like this fischer inquired  i was at oxford university for two years nikasti told him and in the embassy at london for five more  before you took up your present job eh  nikasti assented silently fischer glanced around as though to make sure that they were still alone  i have the communication with me he announced which we are to discuss the terms of our proposal are clearly set out and they are signed by the highest of all himself the letter embodying them was handed to me three weeks ago today in berlin have you been to washington  nikasti shook his head  i do not go to washington he said you will understand that diplomatically as you would put it i do not exist neither is it necessary i am here to listen  fischer nodded  there need be very little delay then he observed before we get to work  nikasti bowed and raised his forefinger in warning  i think he whispered that mr van teyl has finished dressing     chapter x   van teyl as he hastened forward to meet his friend presented at first sight a very good type of the wellgroomed athletic young american he was over six feet tall with smooth dark hair brushed back from his forehead a strong cleanshaven face and good features only as he drew nearer there was evident a slight unnatural quivering at the corner of his lips the cordiality of his greeting too was a little overdone  welcome home fischer why man youre looking fine had a pleasant voyage  storms for the first few daysafter that all right fischer replied  any submarines  not a sight of one seen your sister yet  not yet ive been waiting about for a telephone message she hadnt arrived a few minutes ago  fischer frowned  i want us three to meetyou and she and ithe first moment she sets foot in the hotel he declared  whats the hurry van teyl demanded you must have seen plenty of her the last ten days  that fischer insisted was a different matter see here jimmy ill be frank with you  he walked to the door of the bedroom opened it and looked inside its sole occupant was nikasti who was at the far end putting away some clothes fischer closed the door firmly and returned  i want you to understand this james he began your sister is meddling in certain things shed best leave alone  van teyl lit a cigarette  no use talking to me he observed pamelas her own mistress and shes gone her own way ever since she came of age  shes got to quit fischer pronounced thats all there is about it you and i will have to talk this out where are you dining  downstairs van teyl replied gloomily i was thinking of waiting for pamela  you leave word to have your people let you know directly she arrives fischer advised and come along with me  van teyl allowed himself to be led towards the door nikasti with a due sense of his new duties glided past them rang for the lift and watched them descend fischer turned at once towards the dining room  thank god were in a civilised country he observed and that i dont have to change when i dont want to  they found a quiet table and fischer displaying much interest in the menu ordered a somewhat extensive dinner  grapefruit and maryland chicken are worth coming back to he declared now see here james lets get to business youve got to help me with your sister  but how van teyl demanded pamela and i are good pals of course but she has a will of her own in all she does and i dont fancy that anything i could say would influence her very much  there are two things about your sister fischer continued the first is that shes got to quit this secret service business shes got herself mixed up in  dont talk nonsense van teyl exclaimed pamela doesnt care a fig about politics  fischer grunted scornfully  you dont know much about your sister young fellow he said internal politics over here may not interest her a cent but shes crazy about america as a country and shes shrewd enough to see things coming that a great many of you over here arent looking for anyway she came bang up against me in a little scheme i had on the night before i left europe and somewhere about her shes got concealed a document which id gladly buy for a quarter of a million dollars  van teyl drank off his second cocktail  some money he observed how did she come by the prize  played up for it just as i did fischer replied she was clever enough to make use of my scaffolding and got up the ladder first im not squealing but ive got to have that document whatever it costs me  van teyl was silent for a moment there was an undercurrent of something threatening in his companions manner of which he had taken note  and the second thing you mentioned he asked what is that  fischer as though to give due emphasis to his statement indulged in a brief pause then he leaned a little forward and spoke very slowly and very forcibly  i want to marry her he declared  van teyl learned back in his chair and gazed at his visavis in blank astonishment  you must be a damned fool fischer he exclaimed  you think so was the unruffled reply i wonder why  ill tell you why if you want to know van teyl continued bluntly i know of four of the richest and bestlooking young men in america two ambassadors an english peer and an italian prince who have proposed to pamela during the last twelve months alone she refused every one of them  well fischer remarked she must marry some time  van teyl looked at him insolently  i shouldnt think youd have a dogs chance he pronounced  there was a little glitter behind fischers spectacles  up till now he admitted smoothly i have not been fortunate i must confess however that i was hoping for your good offices  pamela wouldnt take the slightest notice of anything i might say van teyl declared besides i should hate you to marry her  a little blunt are you not my young friend fischer remarked amiably still to continue there is also the matter of that document i must confess that i exercised all my ingenuity to obtain possession of it on the steamer  you would van teyl muttered  your sister however fischer continued was wise enough to have it locked up in the pursers safe the moment she set foot upon the steamer she gave me the slip when she got it back and eluded me somehow on the quay she will scarcely have had time to part with it yet though when she arrives here tonight it will in all probability be in her possession  well van teyl demanded you dont suggest that i should rob her of it i suppose  not at all fischer replied on the other hand you might very well induce her to give it up voluntarily or at least to treat with me  you dont know pamela was van teyls curt reply  i know her sufficiently fischer went on leaning over the table to believe that she would sacrifice a great deal to save her brother from sing sing  van teyl took the thrust badly he started as though he had been stabbed and his face became almost ghastly in its pallor he tossed off a glass of wine hastily  just what do you mean by that he asked thickly  are you prepared fischer continued to have me visit your office tomorrow morning and examine my accounts and securities in the presence of your partners  why not van teyl faltered what the hell do you mean  i mean james van teyl his companion declared that i should find you a matter of a hundred thousand dollars short i mean that youve realised on some of my securities gambled on your own account with the proceeds and lost you did this as regards one stock at least with a forged transfer which i hold  van teyl looked almost piteously around life seemed suddenly to have become an unreal thingthe crowds of welldressed diners the gentle splashing of the water from the fountains in the winter garden the distant murmuring of music from behind the canopy of palms so this was the end of it all that week he had hoped against hope he had been told of a sure thing next week he had meant to have a great gamble everything was to have gone his way after all and now it was too late fischer knew and fischer was a cruel man  the unnatural silence came to an end only fischers voice seemed to come from a long way off  drink your wine james van teyl he advised and listen to me youve been under obligations to me from the start i meant you to be i brought a great business to your firm and i insisted upon having you interested i had a motive as i have for most things i do you are well placed socially in new york and i am not you are also above suspicion which i am not it suited me to take this suite in the plaza nominally in our joint names but to pay the whole account myself it suited me because i required the shelter of your social position you understand  i always understand van teyl muttered  just so only whereas you simply thought me a snob i had in reality a different and very definite purpose we come now however to your present obligation to me i can if i choose tear up your forged transfer submit to the loss of my money and leave you secure i shall do so if you are able to induce your sister to hand over to me those few lines of writingto which believe me she has no earthly rightand to accept me as a prospective suitor  van teyl was drinking steadily now but every mouthful of food seemed almost to choke him redeyed and defiant he faced his torturer  youre talking rot he declared pamela wouldnt marry you if you were the last man on earth and if shes got anything she wants to keep shell keep it  and see her brother disgraced fischer reminded him tried at the criminal court for theft and sent to sing sing its a good name in new york yours you know the van teyls have held up their heads high for more than one generation your sister will not fancy seeing it dragged down into the mire  for a single moment the young man seemed about to throw himself upon his companion fischer perfectly unmoved watched him nevertheless like a cat  better sit tight he enjoined drop it now or people will be watching us i have ordered some of the old brandy a liqueur or two will steady you perhaps afterwards we will go upstairs and take your sister into our confidence  van teyl nodded  very well he agreed hoarsely well hear what pamela has to say     chapter xi   nikasti with a low bow watched the disappearance of the lift into which his two new masters james van teyl and oscar fischer had stepped he waited until the indicator registered its safe arrival on the ground floor then he slowly retraced his steps along the corridor entered the sittingroom and took up the telephone receiver which was still lying upon the table  will you give me number 77 he askedmiss van teyls suite  there was a moments silencethen a voice at the other end to which he made obeisance  it is miss van teyl who speaks i am mr van teyls valet mr van teyl is here now and will be glad if you will come in  he replaced the receiver listened and waited in a few moments there was the sound of a light footstep outside the door was opened and pamela entered she was still wearing the grey tailormade costume in which she had left the steamer  why where is mr van teyl she asked looking around the room i have been ringing up for the last ten minutes and couldnt get any answer i did not realise that it was the next suite  mr van teyl is close at hand madam nikasti replied if you will kindly be seated i will fetch him  how long have you been valet here pamela asked curiously  for a few hours only madam was the grave reply if you will be so good as to wait  he bowed low and left the room pamela took up an evening paper and for a few minutes buried herself in its contents then suddenly she held it away from her and listened a queer and unaccountable impulse inspired her with a certain mistrust there was no sound of movement in the adjoining bedchamber nor any sign of her brothers presence she opened the door and peered in it was empty and in darkness then moved by that same unaccountable impulse she crossed the room and listened at the door which led into her own suite and which she perceived was bolted on this side as well as her own she listened at first idly afterwards breathlessly in a few moments she was convinced that her senses were not playing her false some one was moving stealthily about in her room the key to which was even at that moment in her hand she hastened to the door to be confronted by another surprise the handle turned but the door refused to open she was locked in  pamela was both generous and insistent in the matter of bells she found four and she rang them all together the consequences were speedy and in their way satisfactory nikasti himself a breathless chambermaid a hurt but dignified waiter and the floor valet who had not even stopped to put on his coat entered together they seemed a little stupefied at finding pamela alone and no sign of any disturbance  why was i locked in here pamela demanded indignantly taking them en bloc  there was a little chorus of noncomprehension nikasti stepped forward waved to the others to be silent and bowed almost to the ground  it was a mistake easily to be understood madam he explained the handle is a little stiff perhaps but the door was not locked we all reached here together i myself barely a yard in advance no key was usedand behold  pamela was disposed to argue but a moments reflection induced her to change her mind this falsehood of nikastis was at least interesting she waved the hotel servants away  i am sorry to have troubled you she said i will remember it when i pay my bill  they took their leave nikasti showing them out when the last had departed he turned back to the centre table from the other side of which pamela was watching him curiously  i cannot imagine she remarked how i could have made such a mistake about the door i tried it twice or three times and it certainly seemed to me to be locked  nikasti moved a step nearer towards her something of the servility of his manner had gone for the first time she looked at him closely appreciated the tense immobility of his features the still penetrating light of his cold eyes a queer premonition of trouble for a moment unsteadied her  there was no mistake he said softly the door was locked  even then she did not fully understand the position she leaned a little towards him  it was locked she repeated  i locked it he told her it is locked now securely i have been searching in your room for something which i did not find i think that you had better give it to me it will save trouble  are you mad she demanded breathlessly  do i seem so he replied there is no person more sane than i i require from you the formula of the new explosive which you stole in henrys restaurant eleven days ago  the sense of mystery passed it was simply trouble of the ordinary sort from an unexpected source  dear me she murmured every one seems interested in my little adventure how did you hear about it  i destroyed the cable telling me of all that happened only a few minutes ago he explained it was the foolish talk of the young inventor which gave his secret to the world to scramble for  it was very clever of your informant she remarked to suggest that i was the fortunate thief why not oscar fischer it was his plot not mine  the eyes of the little japanese seemed suddenly to narrow he realised quite well that she was talking simply to gain time  madam he insisted the formula it is for my country and for my country i would risk much  i do not doubt it she replied but if i hold it i hold it for my country too and there is nothing you would risk for japan from which i should shrink for america  he laid his hands upon the table she turned her ring and clenched her hand she could see his spring coming realised in those few seconds that here was an opponent of more desperate and subtle calibre than joseph whether her wits might have failed her fate remained her friend there was a knock at the door  you hear she cried breathlessly there is some one there shall i call out  his hands and knee were gone from the table he was once more his old self so completely the servant that for a moment even pamela was puzzled it seemed as though the events of the last few seconds might have been part of a disordered dream nikasti played to the cue of her fevered question and entirely ignored them he opened the door with a respectful flourishand john lutchester walked in     chapter xii   pamelas first shock of surprise did not readily pass in the first place john lutchesters appearance in america at all was entirely unexpected in the second by what possible means could he have arrived at this precise and psychological moment  you she exclaimed a little helplessly mr lutchester  he smiled as he shook hands nikasti had slipped noiselessly from the room pamela made no effort to detain him she had a curious feeling that the things which had passed between them concerned their two selves only so had no desire whatever to hand him over to retributive justice  you are surprised he observed so far as my presence here is concerned i knew quite well that i was coming some time ago but it was one of those matters you understand miss van teyl that one is scarcely at liberty to talk about i am here in connection with my work  your work she repeated weakly i thought that you were in the ministry of munitions  precisely he admitted i have a travelling inspectorship you see i dont mind telling you this but it is just as well if you will forgive my mentioning it miss van teyl that these things are not spoken of to any one my business over here is supposed to be secret i am going round some of the factories from which we are drawing supplies  she drew a long breath and began to feel a little more like herself  well after this she declared i shall be surprised at nothing i have had one shock already this evening and you are the second  the first i trust was not disagreeable  she shrugged her shoulders  without flattering you she answered i think i could say that i prefer the second  i had an idea lutchester remarked diffidently that my arrival seemed either opportune or inopportunei could not quite tell which were you in any way troubled or embarrassed by the presence of the little japanese gentleman  of course not she replied why he is jimmys valet  how absurd of me lutchester murmured by the bye if jimmy is your brothermr van teyli have a letter to him from a pal in towndicky green it was to present it that i found my way up here this evening i was told that he might put me in the way of a little golf during my spare time over here  he produced the note and laid it upon the table pamela glanced at it and then at lutchester he was carefully dressed in dinner clothes black tie and white waistcoat he was as usual perfectly groomed and immaculate he had what she could only describe to herself as an everyday air about him he seemed entirely free from any mental pressure or the wear and tear of great events  golf she repeated wonderingly you expect to have a little spare time then  well i hope so lutchester replied one must have exercise by the bye he went on is your brother in do you happen to know perhaps it would be more convenient if i came round in the morning i am staying in the hotel  oh for goodness sake dont go away she begged jimmy will be here presently for certain to tell you the truth we have been rather playing hideandseek this evening but it hasnt been altogether his fault please sit down over thereyou will find cigarettes on the sideboardand talk to me  delighted he agreed taking the chair opposite to her i suppose you want to know what became of poor graham  a sudden bewilderment appeared in her face she leaned towards him her forehead was knitted her eyes puzzled there was a new problem to be solved  why mr lutchester she demanded how on earth did you get here  across the atlantic he replied amiably bit too far the other way round  yes but what on she persisted i went straight on to the lapland after we parted last week and only arrived here an hour or so ago there was no other passenger steamer sailing for three days  i was a stowaway he told her confidentiallyhelped to shovel coals all the way over  dont talk nonsense she protested a little sharply i dislike mysteries look at you a stowaway indeed tell me the truth at once  he leaned forward in his chair towards her an ingenuous smile parted his lips he had the air of a schoolboy repeating a mischievous secret  the fact is miss van teyl he confided i dont want it talked about you know but i had a joy ride over  a what  a joy ride he repeated a cousin of mine is in command of a destroyer and she was under orders to sail for new york he hadnt the slightest right really to bring a passenger as she was coming over on a special mission but i had word about the trip over here so i slipped on board late one nightnot a word to any one you understandandwell here i am a more awful voyage he went on impressively you couldnt imagine i was sore all over within twentyfour hours of starting theres practically no deck on those things you know for sitting out or anything of that sort the british navys nowhere for comfort i can tell you the biggest liner for me going back  pamela was still a little dazed lutchesters story did not sound in the least convincing for the moment however she accepted his account of himself  tell me now she begged about captain graham  you havent heard then  i have heard nothing how should i hear  i took him straight back to my rooms after we left you lutchester began he was in an awful state of nerves and drugs and drink then i put him to bed as soon as i could and rang up a pal of mine at the war office to take him in hand  do you believe she asked curiously that he had really been robbed of his formula  those amiable people who were interviewing him in the chapel seemed to think so lutchester observed  but you what do you think she persisted he smiled in superior fashion  i find it rather hard to bring myself to believe that any one would take the trouble he confided i have heard it said in my department that there have been thirtyone new explosives invented since the beginning of the war two of them only are in use and theyre not much better than the old stuff  pamela nodded understandingly  all the same she remarked i am not at all sure that was the case with captain grahams invention there were rumours for days before that something wonderful was happening on salisbury plain they had to cover up whole acres of ground after his last experiments and a man who was down there told me that it seemed just as though the life had been sucked out of it  where did you collect all this information her visitor inquired  she shrugged her shoulders  one hears everything in london  lutchester was sitting with his fingertips pressed together for a moment his attention seemed fixed upon them  there are things he said which one hears too in the far corners of the worldon the atlantic for instance  you have had some news she interrupted  it is really a private piece of information he told her and it wont be in the papersnot the way the thing happened anywaybut i dont suppose theres any harm in telling you as we were both more or less mixed up in the affair graham was shot the next day on his way up to northumberland  shot she exclaimed incredulously  murdered if youd like the whole thrill lutchester continued of course we didnt get many particulars in the wireless but we gathered that he was shot by some one passing him in a more powerful car on a lonely stretch of the great north road  pamela shuddered she was for the moment profoundly impressed a certain air of unreality which had hung over the events of that night was suddenly banished the whole tragedy rose up before her eyes the effect of it was almost stupefying  gave me quite a shock lutchester confided somehow or other i had never been able to take that night quite seriously there was more than a dash of melodrama in it wasnt there seems now as though those fellows must have been in earnest though  and as though captain grahams formula she reminded him gravely was the real thing  whereupon lutchester observed our first interest in the affair receives a certain stimulus some one stole the formula to judge from the behaviour of those amiable gentlemen connected with henrys restaurant it wasnt they some one had been before them have you any theories miss van teyl  i can tell you who has she replied do you remember when we were all grouped around that noticemefiezvous taisezvous les oreilles ennemies vous ecoutent  of course i do he assented  do you remember baron sunyea making a remark afterwards he had been standing by and heard everything graham said  cant say that i do lutchester regretted but i remember seeing him about the place  you promise to say or do nothing without my permission if i tell you something she went on  naturally  see then how diplomacy or secret service work or whatever you like to call it can gather the ends of the world together only a quarter of an hour ago that japanese valet of my brothers having searched my rooms in vain demanded from me that formula  from you lutchester gasped but you havent got it  of course not on the other hand sunyea pitched upon me as being one of the possible thieves and cabled his instructions over  have you got it he asked abruptly  if i had she smiled i should not tell you  but come he expostulated the things no use to you  so baron sunyea evidently thought she laughed well leave that if you dont mind  lutchester was still looking a little bewildered  i had an idea when i came in he muttered that things were a little scrappy between you and the japanese gentleman  she was suddenly serious  now that i have told you the truth she said i really ought to thank you you certainly seem to have a knack of appearing when you are wanted  fluke this time im afraid he acknowledged but i rather like the suggestion you ought to see a great deal of me miss van teyl do you realise that i am a stranger in new york and any hospitality you can show me may be doubly rewarded are you going to take me round and show me the sights  are you going to have any time for sightseeing  well i hope so why not a fellow cant do more than a certain number of hours work in a day  she looked at him curiously  and yet she murmured you expect to win the war  of course we shall win the war he assured her confidently you havent any doubt about that yourself have you miss van teyl  i dont know she told him calmly  lutchester was almost horrified he rose to his feet and stood looking down at his companion  tell me what on earth you mean he demanded we always win in the long run even if we muddle things about a little  i was just contrasting in my mind she said thoughtfully some of the germans whom i have met since the war with some of the englishmen they are taking it very seriously you know mr lutchester they dont find time for luncheon parties or sightseeing  thats just their way he protested they turn themselves into machines they are what we used to call suckers at school but you can take my word for it that before next autumn they will be on the run  you call them suckers she observed thats because theyre always working always studying always experimenting supposing they got hold of something like this new explosive  first of all he told her i dont believe in it and secondly if it exists the formula isnt in their hands  supposing it is in mine she suggested i might sell it to them  id trust you all the time he laughed lightheartedly i cant see you giving a leg up to the huns will you lunch with me at one oclock tomorrow please  certainly not she replied you must attend to your work whatever it is  thats all very well he grumbled but every one has an hour off for luncheon  people who win wars dont lunch she declared severely heres jimmyi can hear his voiceand hes brought some one up with him illlet you know about lunch  the door opened james van teyl and fischer entered together     chapter xiii   the first few seconds after the entrance of the two men were monopolised by the greetings of pamela with her brother fischer stood a little in the background his eyes fixed upon lutchester his brain was used to emergencies but he found himself here confronted by an unanswerable problem  say this is mr lutchester isnt it he inquired holding out his hand  the same lutchester assented politely we met at henrys some ten days ago didnt we  mr lutchester has brought us a letter from dicky green jimmy pamela explained as she withdrew from her brothers arms quite unnecessary as it happens because i met him in london just before we sailed  very glad to meet you mr lutchester jimmy declared wringing his hand with american cordiality dickys an old pal of mineone of the best we graduated in the same year from harvard  conversation for a few minutes was platitudinous van teyl although he showed few signs of his recent excesses was noisy and boisterous clutching at this brief escape from a situation which he dreaded fischer on the other hand remained in the background ominously silent thinking rapidly speculating and theorising as to the coincidence if it were coincidence of finding lutchester and pamela together he listened to the formers polite conversation never once letting his eyes wander from his face all his thoughts were concentrated upon one problem the mysterious escape of sandy graham which had sent him flying from the country remained unsolved of pamelas share in it he had already his suspicions was it possible that lutchester was the other and the central figure in that remarkable rescue he waited his opportunity and during a momentary lull in the cheerful conversation broke in with his first question  say mr lutchester you havent any twin brother have you  no brother at all lutchester admitted  then how did you get over here you were at henrys werent you on the night the lapland sailed you didnt cross with us and theres no other steamer due for two days  then i cant be here lutchester declared the things impossible  guess youll have to explain if you want to save me from a sleepless night fischer persisted  lutchester smiled he had the air of one enjoying the situation immensely  well he said i have had to confess to miss van teyl here so i may as well make a clean breast of it to you to every one else i meet in new york i shall say that i came over on the lapland i really came over on a destroyer  fischers face seemed to become more set and grim than ever  a british destroyer he muttered to himself  it was kind of a joy ride lutchester explained confidentially a cousin of mine who was in command came in to see me and say goodby just after id received my orders from the head of my department to come out here on the next steamer and he smuggled me on board that night mums the word though if you please we asked nobodys leave it would have taken about a month to have heard anything definite from the admiralty  a british destroyer come across the atlantic eh mr fischer muttered she must have come out on a special mission then i imagine  that is not for me to say lutchester observed with stiff reticence  pamela suddenly and purposely intervened she turned towards fischer  mr lutchester brought some rather curious news she observed he got it by wireless do you remember all the fuss there was about the disappearance of captain holderness friend at henrys  i heard something about it he admitted grimly  well captain graham was in my party so naturally i was more interested than any one else to all appearance he entered henrys restaurant walked up the stairs and disappeared into the skies the place was ransacked everywhere for him but he never turned up well the very next day he was murdered in a motorcar on his way to northumberland  incredible fischer murmured  seems a queer set out lutchester remarked but its quite true he was supposed to have discovered a marvellous new explosive the formula for which had been stolen he was on his way up to northumberland to make fresh experiments  for myself i have little faith fischer observed in any new explosives in germany they believe i understand that the limit of destructiveness has been attained  the germans should know lutchester admitted carelessly im afraid they are still a good deal ahead of us in most scientific matters i will take the liberty of calling some time tomorrow miss van teyl and hope i shall have the pleasure of improving my acquaintance with your brother good night mr fischer  are you staying in the hotel the latter inquired  on the fifteenth floor was the somewhat gloomy reply i shant be able to shave in front of the window without feeling giddy however i suppose thats america goodby everybody  with a little inclusive and farewell bow he disappeared they heard him make his way down the corridor and ring for the lift rather a curious silence ensued which was broken at last by pamela  is that she asked throwing herself into an easychair and selecting a cigarette just an ordinary type of a nice wellbred unintelligent selfsufficient englishman or  or what fischer asked with interest  pamela watched the smoke curl from the end of her cigarette  well i scarcely know how to finish she confessed only sometimes when i am talking to him i feel that he can scarcely be as big a fool as he seems and then i wonder jimmy she went on shaking her head at him youre not looking well youve been sitting up too late and getting into bad habits during my absence open confession now if you please if its a girl i shall give you my blessing  van teyl groaned and said nothing a foreboding of impending trouble depressed pamela she turned towards fischer and found in his grim face confirmation of her fears  what does this mean she demanded  your brother will explain fischer replied it is better that he should tell you everything  everything she repeated what is there to tell what have you to do with my brother anyway she added fiercely  you must not look at me as though i were in any way to blame for what has happened was the insistent reply on the contrary i have been very lenient with your brother i am still prepared to be lenientupon certain conditions  the light of battle was in pamelas eyes she fought against the significance of the mans ominous words this was his first blow then and directed against her  i begin to understand she said please go on let me hear everything  van teyl had turned to the sideboard he mixed and drank off a whisky and soda then he swung around  ill make a clean breast of it in a few words pamela he promised ive gambled with fischers money lost it forged a transfer of his certificates to meet my liabilities and i am in his power he could have me hammered and chucked into sing sing if he wanted to thats all there is about it  pamela stood the shock well she turned to fischer  how much of this are you responsible for she asked  that he objected is an impotent question it is not i who had the moulding of your brothers character it is not i who made him a forger and a weakling  van teyls arm was upraised an oath broke from his lips pamela seized him firmly and drew him away  be quiet james she begged let us hear what mr fischer is going to do about it  that depends upon you was the cold reply  pamela stood at the head of the table between the two men and laughed her brother had sunk into a chair and his head had dropped moodily upon his folded arms she looked from one to the other and a new sense of strength inspired her she felt that if she were not indeed entirely mistress of the situation yet the elements of triumph were there to her hand  this is living at any rate she declared first of all i discover that your japanese servant is a spy  nikasti van teyl interrupted furiously blast him i knew that there was something wrong about that fellow fischer  fischer frowned  whats he been up to he inquired  well to begin with pamela explained he searched my room then he locked me in here and was proceeding to threaten me when fortunately mr lutchester arrived  threaten youwhat about fischer demanded  he seemed to have an absurd idea pamela explained sweetly that i might have somewhere concealed upon my person the formula which was stolen from captain graham last monday week at henrys restaurant it makes quite a small world of it doesnt it  i will deal with nikasti for this fischer promised if it is true meanwhile  no sooner have i got over that little shock pamela went on than you turn up with this melodramatic story and an offer from mr fischer which i can read in his face really i feel that i shall hear the buzz of a cinema machine in a moment how much do you owe him jimmy  eightynine thousand dollars the young man groaned  ill write you a cheque tomorrow morning pamela promised will that do mr fischer  it is the last thing i desire was the calm reply  really well perhaps now you will come to the point perhaps you will tell me what it is that you do want  stolen property fischer announced deliberatelystolen property however to which i have a greater right than you  she laughed at him mockingly  i think not mr fischer she said you really dont deserve it you know  and why not  just see how you have bungled you bait the trap the poor man walks into it and you allow another to forestall you not only that but you actually allow japan to come into the game and but for mr lutchesters appearance we might both of us have been left planté là no mr fischer you dont deserve the formula and you shall not have it ill pay my brothers debt to you in dollarsno other way  dollars mr fischer told her sternly will never buy the forged transfer dollars will never keep your brother out of the city police court or sing sing afterwards there isnt much future for a young man who has been through it  van teyl was upon him suddenly with a low murderous cry fischer had no time to resist no chance of success if he had attempted it he was borne backwards on to the lounge his assailants hand upon his throat the young man was beside himself with drink and fury the words poured from his lips incoherent hot with rage  youhound youve made my life a hell youve plotted and schemed to get me into your power there do you feel the life going out of you my sister indeed you you scum of the earth you   james  the sound of pamelas voice unnerved him his fit of passion was spent she dragged him easily away  dont be a fool jimmy she begged you cant settle accounts like that  cant i he muttered if wed been alone pamela  my god if he and i had been alone here  jimmy she said youre a fool and youve been drinking fetch the water bottle  he obeyed and she dashed water in fischers face presently he opened his eyes groaned and sat up there were two livid marks upon his throat van teyl watched him like a crouching animal his eyes were still lit with sullen fire the lust for killing was upon him fischer sat up and blinked he felt the atmosphere of the room and he knew his danger his hand stole into his hip pocket and a small revolver suddenly flashed upon his knees he drew a long breath of relief he was like a fugitive who had found sanctuary  so thats the game james van teyl is it he exclaimed now listen  he adjusted the revolver with a click his cruel long fingers were pressed around its stock  i am not threatening you he went on i am not fond of violence and i dont believe in it this is just in case you come a single yard nearer to me now miss van teyl my business is with you we wont fence any longer you will hand over to me the pocketbook which you stole from captain graham in henrys restaurant hand it over to me intact you understand in return i will give you the forged transfer of stock and leave it to your sense of honour as to whether you care to pay your brothers debt or not if you decline to consider my proposition i shall ring up joseph neville your brothers senior partner i shall not even wait for tomorrow mind i shall make an appointment and i shall place in his hands the proof of your brothers robbery  perhaps pamela murmured i was wrong to stop you jimmy anything else mr fischer  just this i would rather have carried this matter through in a friendly fashion for reasons at which i think you can guess  she shook her head  you flatter my intelligence she told him scornfully  i will explain then i desire to offer myself as your suitor  she laughed at him without restraint or consideration  i would rather marry my brothers valet she declared  you are entirely wrong he protested you are wrong too in holding up cards against me we are on the same side you are an american and so am i i swear that i desire nothing that is not for your good you have wonderful gifts and i have great wealth and opportunities i have also a sincere and very heartfelt admiration for you  i have never been more flattered pamela scoffed  he looked a little wistfully from one to the other antagonism and dislike were written in their faces even pamela who was skilled in the art of subterfuge made little effort to conceal her aversion nevertheless he continued doggedly  what does it matter he demanded who handles this formulayou or i our faces are turned in the same direction there is this difference only with me i want to make it the basis of a kindlier feeling in washington towards my fathers country  pamelas eyebrows were raised  are you sure she asked that the formula itself would not find its way into your fathers country  as to that i pledge my word he replied i am an american citizen  looks like it doesnt he van teyl jeered  tell us what you have been doing in berlin then pamela inquired  i had a definite mission there fischer assured them which i hope to bring to a definite conclusion if you are an american citizen in the broadest sense of the word england is no more to you than germany i want to place before some responsible person in the american government a proposalan official proposalthe acceptance of which will be in years to come of immense benefit to her  and the quid pro quo pamela asked gently  i am not here for the purpose of gratifying curiosity fischer replied but if you will take this matter up seriously you shall be the person through whom this proposal shall be brought before the american government the whole of the negotiations shall be conducted through you if you succeed you will be known throughout history as the woman who saved america from her great and growing danger if you fail you will be no worse off than you are now  and you propose to hand over the conduct of these negotiations to me pamela observed in return for what  the pocketbook which you took from captain graham  so there we are back again at the commencement of our discussion pamela remarked are you going to repeat that you want this formula for washington and not for berlin  my first idea fischer confessed was to hand it over to germany i have changed my views germany has great explosives of her own this formula shall be used in a different fashion it shall be a lever in the coming negotiations between america and germany  we have had a great deal of conversation to no practical purpose pamela declared why are you so sure that i have the formula  fischer frowned slightly he had recovered himself now and his tone was as steady and quiet as ever only occasionally his eyes wandered to where james van teyl was fidgetting about the table and at such times his fingers tightened upon the stock of his revolver  it is practically certain that you have the papers he pointed out you were the first person to go up the stairs after graham had been rendered unconscious joseph admits that he had been forced to leave himthe orchestra was waiting to play he was alone in that little room that you should have known of its existence and his presence there is surprising but nothing more furthermore i am convinced that you were in some way concerned with his rescue later you visited hassan and you visited joseph from the latter you procured the key of the chapel if only he had had the courage to tell the truthwell we will let that pass you have the papers miss van teyl i am bidding a great price for them if you are a wise woman you will not hesitate  there was a knock at the door they all three turned towards it a little impatiently even pamela and her brother felt the grip of an absorbing problem to their surprise it was lutchester who reappeared upon the threshold in his hand he held a small sealed packet  so sorry to disturb you all he apologised i have something here which i believe belongs to you miss van teyl i thought id better bring it up and explain from the way your little japanese friend was holding on to it i thought it might be important it is a little torn but that isnt my fault  he held it out to pamela it was a long packet torn open at one end from it was protruding a worn brown pocketbook pamelas hand closed upon it mechanically there was a dazed look in her eyes fischers fingers stole once more towards the pocket into which at lutchesters entrance he had slipped his revolver     chapter xiv   lutchester to all appearance remained sublimely unconscious of the tension which his words and appearance seemed to have created he had strolled a little further into the room and was looking down at the packet which he still held  you are wondering how i got hold of this of course he observed just one of those simple little coincidences which either mean a great deal or nothing at all  how did you know it was mine pamela asked almost under her breath  ill explain lutchester continued i was in the lobby of the hotel a few minutes ago when i heard the fire bell outside i hurried out and watched the engines go by from the sidewalk i have always been rather interested in  never mind that please go on pamela asked almost under her breath  certainly lutchester assented on the way back then i saw a little japanese who was coming out of the hotel knocked down by a taxicab which skidded nearly into the door i dont think he was badly hurtim not even sure that he was hurt at all i picked up this packet from the spot where he had been lying and i was on the point of taking it to the office when i saw your name upon it miss van teyl in what seemed to me to be your own handwriting so i thought id bring it up  he laid it upon the table pamelas eyes seemed fastened upon it she turned it over nervously  it is very kind of you mr lutchester she murmured  ill be perfectly frank he went on i should have found out where the little man who dropped it had disappeared to and restored it to him but i fanciedof course i may have been wrongthat you and he were having some sort of a disagreement a few minutes ago when i happened to come in anyway that was in my mind and i thought id run no risks  you did the very kindest and most considerate thing pamela declared  the little japanese must have been our new valet james van teyl observed im beginning to think that he is not going to be much of an acquisition  youll probably see something of him in a few minutes lutchester remarked i will wish you good night miss van teyl good night  pamelas reiterated thanks were murmured and perfunctory even james van teyls hospitable instincts seemed numbed they allowed lutchester to depart with scarcely a word with the closing of the door speech brought them some relief from a state of tension which was becoming intolerable even then fischer at first said nothing he had risen noiselessly to his feet his right hand was in the sidepocket of his coat his eyes were fixed upon the table  so this is why you insisted upon a valet james van teyl exclaimed his voice thick with anger hes planted here to rob for you is that it eh fischer  pamela drew the packet towards her and stood with her right palm covering it fischer seemed still at a loss for words  i can assure you he said at last fervently that if that packet was stolen from miss van teyl by nikasti it was done without my instigation it is as much a surprise to me as to any of you we can congratulate ourselves that it is not on the way to japan  pamela nodded  he is speaking the truth she asserted nikasti is not out to steal for others he is playing the same game as all of us only he is playing it for his own hand mr fischer has brought him here for some purpose of his own without a doubt but i am quite sure that nikasti never meant to be any ones catspaw  believe me that is the truth fischer agreed i will admit that i brought nikasti here with a purpose but upon my honour i swear that until this evening i never dreamed that he even knew of the existence of the formula  oh we are not the only people in the world who are clever pamela declared with an unnatural little laugh the first man who took note of sandy grahams silly words as he rushed into henrys was baron sunyea i saw him stiffen as he listened he even uttered a word of remonstrance japan in london heard japan in your sittingroom here in ten days time knew everything there was to be known  i didnt bring nikasti here for this fischer insisted  perhaps not pamela conceded but if youre a good american what are you doing at all with a japanese secret agent  if you trust me you shall know fischer promised listen to reason let us have finished with one affair at a time you very nearly lost that formula to japan hand over the pocketbook you see how dangerous it is for it to remain in your possession ill keep my share of the bargain ill put my scheme before you come be reasonable see heres the forged transfer  he drew a paper from his pocket and spread it out upon the table his long hairy fingers were shaking with nervousness  come make it a deal he persisted you can pay me the defalcations or not as you choose there is your brothers freedom and the honour of your name in exchange for that pocketbook  pamela after all her hesitation seemed to make up her mind with startling suddenness she thrust the pocketbook towards fischer took the transfer from his fingers and tore it into small pieces  i give in she said this time you have scored we will talk about the other matter tomorrow  fischer buttoned up the packet carefully in his breast pocket his eyes glittered he turned towards the door on the threshold he looked around he stretched out his hand towards pamela  believe me you have done well he assured her hoarsely i shall keep my word i will set you in the path of great things  he left the room and they heard the furious ringing of the lift bell pamela was tearing into smaller pieces the forged transfer van teyl a little pale but with new life in his frame was watching the fragments upon the floor there was a tap at the door nikasti entered pamelas fingers paused in their task van teyl stared at him the newcomer was carrying the evening papers which he laid down upon the table  is there anything more i can do before i go to bed sir he asked with his usual reverential little bow  arent you hurt van teyl exclaimed  hurt nikasti replied wonderingly oh no  werent you knocked down by a taxicab pamela asked outside the hotel  nikasti looked from one to the other with an air of gentle surprise  i have been to my rooms in the servants quarters he told them on the upper floor i have not been downstairs at all i have been unpacking and arranging my own humble belongings  van teyl clasped his forehead  let me get this he exclaimed you havent been down in the lobby of the hotel you havent been knocked down by a taxicab that skidded you havent lost a pocketbook which you had previously stolen from my sister  nikasti shook his head he seemed completely mystified he watched pamelas face carefully  perhaps there has been some mistake he suggested quietly my english is sometimes not very good i would not dream of trying to rob the young lady i have not lost any pocketbook i have not descended lower down in the hotel than this floor  van teyl waved him away accepted his farewell salutation and waited until the door was closed  look here pamela he protested turning almost appealingly towards her my brain wasnt made for this sort of thing what in thunder does it all mean  pamela looked at the fragments of paper upon the floor and sank back in an easy chair  jimmy she confided i dont know     chapter xv   pamela opened her eyes the next morning upon a distinctly pleasing sight at the foot of her bed was an enormous basket of pink carnations on the counterpane by her side lay a smaller cluster of twelve very beautiful dark red gloire de dijon roses attached to these latter was a note  when did these flowers come leah pamela asked the maid who was moving about the room  an hour ago madam the girl told her  read the name on the card pamela directed pointing to the mass of pink blossoms  mr oscar h fischer the girl read out with respectful compliments  pamela smiled  he doesnt know then she murmured to herself get my bath ready leah  the maid disappeared into the inner room pamela tore open the note attached to the roses by her side and read it slowly through  dear miss van teyl  i am so very sorry but the luncheon we had halfplanned for today must be postponed i have an urgent message to go south to inspectbut no secrets its horribly disappointing i hope we may meet in a few days  sincerely yours  john lutchester  pamela laid down the note conscious of an indefined but distinct sensation of disappointment after all it was not so wonderful to wake up and find oneself in new york the sun was pleasant the little puffs of air which came in through the window across the park delightful and exhilarating yet something had gone out of the day accustomed to selfanalysis she asked herself swiftlywhat it was without a doubt something to do with lutchesters departure she tried to face the question of her disappointment was it possible to feel any real interest in a man who preferred a government post to the army at such a time and who had brought his golf clubs out to america her imagination for a moment revolved around the problem of his apparently uninteresting and yet in some respects contradictory personality was it really her fancy or had she every now and then detected behind that flamboyant manner traces of something deeper and more serious something which seemed to indicate a life and aims of which nothing appeared upon the surface she clasped her knees and sat up in bed listening to the sound of the running water in the next room was there any possible explanation of his opportune appearance on the night before with a dummy pocketbook and a concocted story the cleverest man on earth could surely never have gauged her position with fischer and intervened in such a manner at the psychological moment  yet he had done it she reflected gazing thoughtfully at fischers gift if indeed he knew what was passing around him to that extent how much more knowledge might he not possess she felt the little silken belt around her waist at least there was no one who could take sandy grahams secret from her until she chose to give it up supposing for a moment that lutchester was also out for the great things was he fooled by her attitude if he knew so much he must know that the secret remained with her perhaps after all he was only a philanderer in intrigue  pamela bathed and dressed sent for her brother and to his horror insisted upon an american breakfast  its quite time i came back to look after you jimmy she said severely as she watched him send away his grapefruit and gaze helplessly at his bacon and eggs youre going to turn over a new leaf young man  i shant be sorry he confessed fervently i tell you pamela when you have a thing like this hanging over you its hellsome hell you just want to drown your thoughts and keep going all the time  she nodded sagely  well thats over now jimmy she said and i meant you to listen to me its more than likely that mr fischer may find out at any moment that the mysterious pocketbook which came from heaven knows where is a faked one he may be horrid about it  while we are on that van teyl interrupted i couldnt sleep a wink last night for trying to imagine where on earth that fellow lutchester came in and what his game was  i have a headache this morning trying to puzzle out the same thing pamela told him  he seems such an ordinary sort of chap van teyl continued thoughtfully good sportsman no doubt and all that sort of thing but the last fellow in the world to concoct a yarn and if he did what was his object  jimmy his sister begged lets quit of course i know a little more than you do but the little more that i do know only makes it more confusing now to make it worse hes gone away  what this morning  gone away on his government work pamela announced i had a note and some roses from him dont lets talk about it jimmy i keep on getting new ideas and it makes my brain whirl i want to talk about you  im a rotten lot to talk about he sighed  she patted his hand  youre nothing of the sort dear and youve got to remember now that youre out of the trouble but listen hurry down to the office as early as you can and set about straightening things out so that if mr fischer tries to make trouble he wont be able to do it theres my cheque for eightynine thousand dollars i made out last night before i went to bed she added passing it over to him just replace what stocks youre short of and get yourself out of the mess and dont waste any time about it  his face glowed as he looked across the table  youre the most wonderful sister pamela  nonsense she interrupted nonsense i ought not to have left you alone all this time and besides im pretty sure he helped you into this trouble for his own ends anyway we are all right now i shall be in new york for a few days before i go to washington when i do go you must see whether you can get leave and come with me  thats bully he declared ill get leave right enough theres never been less doing in wall street but say pamela i dont seem to half understand whats going on youve given up most of your friends and you spend months away there in europe in all sorts of corners now you come back and you seem mixed up in regular secret service work where do you come in anyway what are you going to washington for  she smiled  queer tastes havent i jimmy  queer for a girl  thats prejudice she objected shaking her head nowadays there are few things a woman cant do to tell you the truth my new interest in life started three years ago when uncle theodore found out that i was going to rome for the winter  so uncle theodore started it did he  she nodded  thats the worst of having an uncle in the administration isnt it well of course he gave me letters to every one in rome and i found out what he wanted quite easily and without the inquiries going through the embassy at all sometimes as you can understand thats a great advantage i found it simply fascinatingthe work i meanand after three or four more commissionswell they recognised me at washington i have been to most of the capitals in europe at different times with small affairs to arrange at each or information to get sometimes its been just about commercial things since the war though of course its been more exciting than ever if i were an englishwoman instead of an american i could tell them some things in london which theyd find pretty surprising its not my affair though and i keep what information i do pick up until it works in with something else for our own good i knew quite well in berlin for instance to speak of something youve heard of that henrys restaurant in london was being used as a centre of espionage by the germans that is why i was on the lookout the day i went there  you mean the day that pocketbook was stolen that the whole world seems crazy about van teyl asked  she nodded  i believe it is perfectly true she said that a young man called graham has invented an entirely new explosive the formula for which he brought to henrys with him that day it isnt only what happens when the shell explodes but a sort of putrefaction sets in all round and they say that everything within a mile dies there were spies down even watching his experiments there were spies following him up to london there were spies in henrys restaurant when like a fool he gave the thing away fischer was the ringleader of this lot and he meant having the formula from graham that night i dont want to bore you jimmy but i got there first  bore me the young man repeated why its like a modern arabian nights i cant imagine you in the thick of this sort of thing pamela  its very easy to slip into the way of anything you like she answered i knew exactly what they were going to do to captain graham and i got there before them when they searched him the formula had gone fischer caught my steamer and worried me all the way over he thought he had us in a corner last night and then a miracle happened  you mean that fellow lutchester turning up  yes i mean that pamela admitted  say didnt that jap fellow get the pocketbook from your rooms at all then van teyl asked i couldnt follow it all last night  he searched my rooms pamela replied and failed to find it afterwards when he and i were alone in your sittingroom heaven knows what would have happened but for the miraculous arrival of mr lutchester whom i had left behind in london come to pay an evening call in the hotel plaza new york  van teyl shook his head slowly got up from his seat lit a cigarette and came back again  pam he confessed my brain wont stand it youre not going to tell me that lutchesters in the game why a simpler sort of fellow i never spoke to  i cant make up my own mind about mr lutchester pamela sighed he helped me in london on the night i sailedin fact he was very useful indeedbut why he invented that story about nikasti brought a dummy pocketbook into the room and helped us out of all our troubles unless it was by sheer and brilliant instinct i cannot imagine  let me get on to this van teyl said even the pocketbook was a fake then  she nodded  i shouldnt be likely to leave things i risk my life for about my bedroom she told him  where is it thenthe real thing he asked  she smiled  if you must know jimmy she confided dropping her voice its in a little compartment of a silk belt around my waist it will remain there until i get to washington or until mr haskall comes to me  haskall the government explosives man  pamela nodded  even he wont get it without government authority  now tell me pamela van teyl went onyoure a farseeing girli suppose we should get it in the neck from germany some day or other if the germans won why dont you hand the formula over to the british and give them a chance to get ahead  thats a sensible question jimmy and ill try to answer it pamela promised because when once the shells are made and used the secret will be gone i think it very likely that it would enable england to win the war but you see i am an american not english and im all american i have been in touch with things pretty closely for some time now and i see trouble ahead for us before very long i cant exactly tell you where its coming from but i feel it i want america to have something up her sleeve thats why  youre a great girl pamela her brother declared im off downtown feeling a different man and pamela i havent said much but god bless you and as long as i live im going as straight as a die ive had my lesson  he bent over her a little clumsily and kissed her pamela walked to the door with him  be a dear she called out and come back early and jimmy   hullo  put things right at the office at once she whispered with emphasis fischer hasnt found out yet i sent him a message this morning thanking him for the carnations and asking him to walk with me in the park after breakfast i shall keep him away till lunch time at least  the young man looked at her and at nikasti who out in the corridor was holding his hat and cane then he chuckled  and they say that things dont happen in new york he murmured as he turned away     chapter xvi   an elderly new yorker a man of fashion renowned for his social perceptions pressed his companions arm at the entrance to central park and pointed to pamela  there goes a typical new york girl he said and the bestlooking ive seen for many a long day you can go all round europe freddie and not see a girl with a face and figure like that she had that frank way too of looking you in the eyes  i know the other assented gibsons girls all had it kind of look which seems to sayi know you find me nice and i dont mind i wonder whether youre nice too  pamela strolled along the park with fischer by her side she wore a tailormade costume of black and white tweed and a smart hat in which yellow seemed the predominating colour her shoes her gloves the little tie about her throat were all the last word in the simple elegance of suitability fischer walked by her sidea powerful determined figure in a carefullypressed blue serge suit and a brown homburg hat he wore a rose in his buttonhole and he carried a caneboth unusual circumstances after fifty years of strenuous living mr fischer seemed suddenly to have found a new thing in the world  this is a pleasant idea of yours miss van teyl he said  i havent disturbed your morning i hope she asked  i guess if you have it isnt the way you mean he replied youve disturbed a good deal of my time and thoughts lately  well youve had your own way now she sighed looking at him out of the corner of her eyes i suppose you always get your own way in the end dont you mr fischer  generally he admitted i tell you though miss van teyl he went on earnestly if youre alluding to last nights affair i hated the whole business it was my duty and the opportunity was there but with what i have i am satisfied with reference to that little debt of your brothers  please dont say a word mr fischer she interrupted you will find that all put right as soon as you get down to wall street tell me what have you done with your prize  mr fischer looked very humble  miss van teyl he said for certain reasons i am going to tell you the truth perhaps it will be the best in the long run we may even before long be working together so i start by being honest with you the pocketbook is by now on its way to germany  to germany she exclaimed and after all your promises  ah but think miss van teyl he pleaded i throw aside all subterfuge in your heart you know well what i am and what i stand for i deny it no longer i am a germanamerican working for germany simply because america does not need my help if america were at war with any country in the world my brains my knowledge my wealth would be hers but now it is different germany is surrounded by many enemies and she calls for her sons all over the world to remember the fatherland you can sympathise a little with my unfortunate country miss van teyl and yet remain a good american you are not angry with me  i suppose i ought to be but i am not in the least she assured him i never had any doubt as to the destination of that packet  that he admitted is a relief to me let us wipe the matter from our memories miss van teyl  one word she begged and that only of curiosity did you examine the contents of the pocketbook  he turned his head and looked at her for a moment he had lost the greater spontaneity of his new self he was again the cold calculating machine  no he answered except to take out and destroy what seemed to be a few private memoranda there was a bill for flowers a note from a young ladysome rubbish of that sort the remaining papers were all calculations and figures chemical formulae  are you a chemist mr fischer she inquired  not in the least he acknowledged i recognised just enough of the formulae on the last page to realise that there were entirely new elements being dealt with  she nodded  i only asked out of curiosity i agree let us put it out of our thoughts you see i am generous we have fought a battle you and i and i have lost yet we remain friends  it is more than your friendship that i want miss van teyl he pleaded his voice shaking a little i am years older than you i know and by your standards i fear unattractive but you love power and i have it i will take you into my schemes i will show you how those live who stand behind the clouds and wield the thunders  she looked at him with genuine surprise it was necessary to readjust some of her impressions of him oscar fischer was after all a human being  what you say is all very well so far as it goes she told him i admit that a life of scheming and adventure attracts me i love power i can think of nothing more wonderful than to feel the machinery of the worldthe political worldroar or die away according to the touch of ones fingers oh yes were alike so far as that is concerned but there is a very vital difference you are only an american by accident i am one by descent for me there doesnt exist any other country for you germany comes first  but cant you realise he went on eagerly that even this is for the best america today is hypnotised by a maudlin sentimental affection for england a country from whom she never received anything but harm we want to change that we want to kill for ever the misunderstandings between the two greatest nations in the world my creed of life could be yours too without a single lapse from your patriotism friendship alliance brotherhood between germany and america that would be my text  shall i be perfectly frank pamela asked  nothing else is worth while was the instant answer  well then she continued i can quite see that germany has everything to gain from americas friendship but i cannot see the quid pro quo  and yet it is so clear fischer insisted your own cloud may not be very large just now but it is growing and before you know it it will be upon you can you not realise why japan is keeping out of this war she is conserving her strength millions flow into her coffers week by week in a few years time japan for the first time in her history will know what it is to possess solid wealth what does she want it for do you think she has no dreams of european aggression or her soldiers would be fighting there now china is hers for the taking a rich prize ready to fall into her mouth at any moment but the end and aim of all japanese policy the secret mecca of her desires is to repay with the sword the insults your country has heaped upon her it is for that believe me that her arsenals are working night and day her soldiers are training her fleet is in reserve while you haggle about a few volunteers japan is strengthening and perfecting a mighty army for one purpose and one purpose only unless you wake up you will be in the position that great britain was in two years ago even now work though you may you will never wholly make up for lost time the one chance for you is friendship with germany  will germany be in a position to help us after the war pamela asked  never doubt it fischer replied vehemently before peace is signed the sea power of england will be broken financially she will be ruined she is a country without economic science without foresight without statesmen the days of her golden opportunities have passed frittered away unless we of our great pity bind up her wounds england will bleed to death before the war is over  that you must remember pamela said practically is your point of view  i could tell you things he began  dont she begged i know what your outlook is now be definite leaving aside that other matter what is your proposition to me  fischer walked for a while in silence they had turned back some time since and were once more nearing the plaza  you ask me to leave out what is most vital he said at last i have never been married miss van teyl i am wealthy i am promised great honours at the end of this war when that comes i shall rest if you will be my wife you can choose your home you can choose your title  she shook her head  but i am not sure that i even like you mr fischer she objected we have fought in opposite camps and you have had the bad taste to be victorious besides which you were perfectly brutal to james and i am not at all sure that i dont resent your bargain with me as a matter of fact i am feeling very bitter towards you  you should not he remonstrated earnestly remember that after all women are only dabblers in diplomacy their very physique prevents them from playing the final game you have brains of course but there are other thingsexperience courage resource you would be a wonderful helpmate miss van teyl even if your individual and unaided efforts have not been entirely successful  she sighed pamela just then was a picture of engaging humility  it is so hard for me she murmured i do not want to marry yet i do not wish to think of it and so far as you are concerned mr fischerwell i am simply furious when i think of your attitude last night but i love adventures  i will promise you all the adventures that can be crammed into your life he urged  but be more definite she persisted where should we start you are over here now on some important mission tell me more about it  i cannot just yet he answered all that i can promise you is that if i am successful it will stop the war just as surely as captain grahams new explosive  i thought you were going to make a confidante of me she complained  he suddenly gripped her arm it was the first time he had touched her and she felt a queer surging of the blood to her head a sudden and almost uncontrollable repulsion the touch of his long fingers was like flame his eyes behind their sheltering spectacles glowed in a curious disconcerting fashion  to the woman who was my pledged wife he said i would tell everything from the woman who gave me her hand and became my ally i would have no secrets come i have a message more than a message to the american people i am taking it to washington before many hours have passed if it is your will it should be you to whom i will deliver it  pamela walked on with her head in the air fischer was leaning a little towards her every now and then his mouth twitched slightly his eyes seemed to be seeking to reach the back of her brain  please go now she begged i cant think clearly while you are here and i want to make up my mind i will send to you when i am ready     chapter xvii   pamela sat that afternoon on the balcony of the country club at baltusrol and approved of her surroundings below her stretched a pleasant vista of rolling greensward dotted here and there with the figures of the golfers beyond the misty blue background of rising hills  i cant tell you how peaceful this all seems jimmy she said to her brother who had brought her out in his automobile one doesnt notice the air of strain over on the continent because its the same everywhere but it gets a little on ones nerves all the same i positively love it here  its fine to have you was the hearty response gee that fellow coming to the sixteenth hole can play some  pamela directed her attention idly towards the figure which her brother indicateda man in light tweeds who played with an easy and graceful swing and with the air of one to whom the game presented no difficulties whatever she watched him drive for the seventeentha long raking ball fully fifty yards further than his opponents watched him play a perfect mashie shot to the green and hole out in three  a birdie james van teyl murmured i say pamela  she took no notice her eyes were still following the figure of the golfer she watched him drive at the last hole play a chip shot on to the green and hit the hole for a three the frown deepened upon her forehead she was looking very uncompromising when the two men ascended the steps  i didnt know mr lutchester that there were any factories down this way she remarked severely as he paused before her in surprise  for a single moment she fancied that she saw a flash of annoyance in his eyes it was gone so swiftly however that she remained uncertain he held out his hand laughing  fairly caught out miss van teyl he confessed you see i was tempted and i fell  his companion an elderly cleanshaven man passed on pamela glanced after him  who is your opponent she asked  just some one i picked up on the tee lutchester explained how is our friend fischer this morning  i walked with him for an hour in the park pamela replied he seemed quite cheerful i have scarcely thanked you yet for returning the pocketbook have i  his face was inscrutable  couldnt keep a thing that didnt belong to me could i he observed  you have a marvellous gift for discovering lost property she murmured  for discovering the owners you mean he retorted with a little bow  youre some golfer i see mr lutchester van teyl interposed  i was on my game today lutchester admitted with a little luck at the seventh he continued earnestly i might have tied the amateur record you see my ballbut there i mustnt bore you now i must look after my opponent and stand him a drink we shall meet again i daresay  lutchester passed on and pamela glanced up at her brother  is he a sphinx or a fool she whispered  dont ask me van teyl replied seems to me you were a bit rough on him anyway i dont see why the fellow shouldnt have a days holiday before he gets to work if i had his swing it would interfere with my career i know that well enough  did you recognise the man with whom he was playing pamela inquired  cant say that i did his face seems familiar too  go and see if you can find out his name pamela begged it isnt ordinary curiosity i really want to know  thats easy enough van teyl replied rising from his place and ill order tea at the same time  pamela leaned a little further back in her chair her eyes seemed to be fixed upon the pleasant prospect of wooded slopes and green upwardstretching sward as a matter of fact she saw only two faces fischers and lutchesters her chief impulse in life for the immediate present seemed to have resolved itself into a fierce almost a passionate curiosity it was the riddle of those two brains which she was so anxious to solve  fischer the cold subtle intriguer with schemes at the back of his mind which she knew quite well that even in the moment of his weakness he intended to keep to himself and lutchester with his almost cynical devotion to pleasure yet with his unaccountable habit of suggesting a strength and qualities to which he neither laid nor established any claim of the two men it was lutchester who piqued her with whom she would have found more pleasure in the battle of wits she found herself alternately furious and puzzled with him yet her uneasiness concerning him possessed more disquieting more fascinating possibilities than any of the emotions inspired by the other man  van teyl returned to her presently a little impressed  thought i knew that chaps face he observed its eli hamblin senator hamblin you know  a friend and confidant of the president she murmured a westerner too i wonder what hes doing here  jimmy  hallo sis  youve just got to be a dear pamela begged go to the caddy master or professional or some one and find out whether mr lutchester met him here by accident or whether they arrived together  youll turn me into a regular sleuthhound he laughed however here goes  he strolled off again and pamela found herself forced to become mundane and frivolous whilst she chatted with some newlyarrived acquaintances it was not until some little time after her brothers return that she found herself alone with him  well she asked eagerly  they arrived within a few minutes of one another van teyl announced senator hamblin bought a couple of new balls and made some inquiries about the course but said nothing about playing lutchester who appears not to have known him came up later and asked him if hed like a game thats all i could find out  pamela pointed to a little cloud of dust in the distance  and there they go she observed together  van teyl threw himself into a chair and accepted the cup of tea which his sister handed him  well he inquired what do you make of it  theres more in that question than you think james pamela replied all the same i think i shall be able to answer it in a few days  another little crowd of acquaintances discovered them and pamela was soon surrounded by a fresh group of admirers they all went out presently to inspect the new tennis courts pamela and her brother were beset with invitations  you positively must stay down and dine with us and go home by moonlight mrs saunders a lively young matron with a large country house close by insisted jimmys neglected me terribly these last few months and as for you pamela i havent seen you for a year  id love to if we can pamela assured her but jimmy will have to telephone first  then do be quick about it mrs saunders begged it doesnt matter a bit about clothes weve twenty people staying in the house now and half of us wont change if that makes you more comfortable jimmy if you fail at that telephone ill never forgive you  but van teyl who had caught the little motion of his sisters head towards the city proved equal to the occasion he returned presently driving the car  got to go he announced as he made his farewells cant be helped pamela frightfully sorry mrs saunders we are wanted up in new york  pamela sighed  i was so afraid of it she regretted as she waved her adieux      an hour or so later the city broke before them in murky waves pamela who had been leaning back in the car deep in thought sat up  you are a perfect dear james she said do you think you could stand having mr fischer to dinner one evening this week  sure he replied a little curiously if you want to keep friends with him for any reason i dont bear him any illwill  i just want to talk to him pamela murmured thats all     chapter xviii   there was a ripple of interest and a good deal of curiosity that afternoon in the lounge and entrance hall of the hotel plaza when a tall greymoustached gentleman of military bearing descended from the automobile which had brought him from the station and handed in his name at the desk inquiring for mr fischer  will you send my name upthe baron von schwerin he directed  the clerk who had recognised the newcomer took him under his personal care  mr fischer is up in his rooms expecting you baron he announced if youll come this way ill take you up  the baron followed his guide to the lift and along the corridor to the suite of rooms occupied by mr fischer and his young friend james van teyl mr fischer himself opened the door the two men clasped hands cordially and the clerk discreetly withdrew  back with us once more fischer von schwerin exclaimed fervently you are wonderful tell me he added looking around we are to be alone here  absolutely fischer replied the young man i share these apartments withjames van teylhas taken his sister out to baltusrol they will not be back until seven oclock we are sure of solitude  good von schwerin exclaimed and you have newsi can see it in your face  fischer rolled up easy chairs and produced a box of cigars  yes he assented with a little glitter in his eyes i have news things have moved with me i think that with the help of an idiotic englishman we shall solve the riddle of what our professors have called the consuming explosive i sent the formula home to germany by a trusty hand only a few hours ago  capital von schwerin declared it was arranged in london that  partly in london and partly here fischer replied  von schwerin made a grimace  if you can find those who are willing to help you here you are fortunate indeed he sighed my lifes work has lain amongst these people in the days of peace all seemed favourable to us since the war even those people whom i thought my friends seem to have lost their heads to have lost their reasoning powers  after all fischer muttered it is race calling to race but come we have more direct business on hand nikasti is here  von schwerin nodded a little gloomily  washington knows nothing of his coming he observed i attended the baron yungs reception last week informally i threw out very broad hints but yung would not be drawn nikasti represents the secret service of japan unofficially and without responsibility  nevertheless fischer pointed out what he says will reach the ear of his country and reach it quickly youve gone through the papers i sent you  carefully von schwerin replied and the autograph letter  that i have fischer announced i will fetch nikasti  he crossed the room and opened the door leading into the bedchambers  are you there kato he cried  i am coming sir was the instant reply  nikasti appeared a few moments later he was carrying a dress coat on his arm and he held a clothes brush in his hand it was obvious that he had studied with nice care the details of his new part  you can sit down nikasti fischer invited this is the baron von schwerin he has something to say to you  nikasti bowed very low he declined the chair however to which fischer pointed  i am your valet and the valet of mr van teyl he murmured it is not fitting for me to be seated i listen  von schwerin drew his chair a little nearer  i plunge at once he said into the middle of things there is always the fear that we may be disturbed  nikasti inclined his head  it is best he agreed  you are aware von schwerin continued that the imperial government of germany has already made formal overtures through a third party to the emperor of japan with reference to an alteration in our relations  there was talk of this in tokio nikasti observed softly japan however is under obligationstreaty obligations her honour demands that these should be kept  the honour of a country baron von schwerin acknowledged is without doubt a sacred charge upon her rulers but above all things in heaven or on earth the interests of her people must be their first consideration if a time should come when the two might seem to clash then it is the task of the statesman to recognise this fact  nikasti bowed  it is spoken he confessed like a great man  your country von schwerin continued is at war with mine because it seemed to her rulers that her interests lay with the allies rather than with germany i will admit that my country was at fault we did not recognise to its full extent the value of friendship with japan we did not bid high enough for your favours asia concerned us very little we looked upon the destruction of our interests there in the same spirit as that with which we contemplated the loss of our colonies all that might happen would be temporary our influence in asia our colonies will remain with us or perish according to the result of the war in europe but our statesmen overlooked one thing  our factories nikasti murmured  precisely we have had our agents all over the world for years some are good a few are easily deceived there is no country in the world where apparently so much liberty is granted to foreigners as in japan there is no country where the capacity for manufacture and output has been so grossly underestimated by our agents as yours  nikasti smiled  i had something to do with that he announced it was karl neumann was it not on whom you relied i supplied him with much information  von schwerins face clouded for a moment  you mean that you fooled him i suppose he said well it is all part of the game that is over now we want your exports to russia stopped  ah nikasti murmured reflectively stopped  we ask no favours von schwerin continued the issue of the war is written across the face of the skies for those who care to read  nikasti looked downwards at the dress coat which he was carrying then he glanced up at von schwerin  perhaps our eyes have been dazzled he said will you not interpret  the end of the war will be a peace of exhaustion von schwerin explained our loftier dreams of conquest we must abandon germany has played her part but austria alas has failed peace will leave us all very much where we were very well then i ask you what has japan gained you answer china i deny it yet even if it were true it will take you five hundred years to make a great country of china suppose for a moment you had been on the other side what about australia new zealand  are those things under present consideration nikasti queried  why not von schwerin replied listen close your exports to russia within the next thirty days build up for yourselves a stock of ammunition add to your fleet and prepare within a year of the cessation of war there is no reason why your national dream should not be realised your fleet may sail for san francisco the german fleet shall make a simultaneous attack upon the eastern coast of massachusetts and new york  the german fleet nikasti repeated and england  von schwerins eyes flashed for a moment  if the english fleet is still in being he declared it will be a crippled and defeated fleet but for the sake of your point of view i will assume that it exists even then there will be nothing to prevent the german fleet from steaming in what waters it pleases if our shells fall upon new york on the day when your warships are sighted off the californian coast do you suppose that america could resist with her seaboard her fleet is contemptible for her wealth her army is a farce she has neglected for a great many years to pay her national insurance she is the one country in the world who can be bled for the price of empires  fischer who had been smoking furiously spat out the end of a fresh cigar  it will be a just retribution he interposed with smothered fierceness under the guise of neutrality america has been responsible for the lives of hundreds of thousands of my countrymen that we never can we never shall forget the wealth which makes these people fat is bloodmoney and germany will take her vengeance  for whom do you speak nikasti inquired  von schwerin rose from his place  for the greatest of all  do i take anything but words to tokio the japanese asked softly  fischer unfolded a pocketbook and drew from it a parchment envelope  you take this letter he said which i brought over myself from berlin signed and written not more than three weeks ago i ask you to believe in no vague promises i bring you the pledged faith of the greatest ruler on earth what do you say nikasti will you accept our mission will you go back to tokio and see the emperor  nikasti bowed  i will go back he promised i will sail as soon as i can make arrangements but i cannot tell you what the issue may be we japanese are not a selfseeking nation above and higher than all things are our ideals and our honour i cannot tell what answer our sovereign may give to this  these are the days when the truest patriotism demands the most sublime sacrifices von schwerin declared above all the ethics of individuals comes the supreme necessity of selfpreservation  the japanese smiled slightly  ah he said there speaks the philosophy of your country baron the paean of materialism  the destinies of nations baron von schwerin exclaimed are above the manmade laws of a sentimental religion one needs nowadays more than to survive it is necessary to flourish  nikasti stood suddenly to attention  it is mr van teyl who returns he warned them  he glided from the room shaking out a little the dress coat which he had been carrying the two men looked after him fischer threw his cigar savagely away and lit another  curse these orientals he muttered they listen and listen and one never knows van teyl wont be here for hours that was just an excuse to get away  but there was a smile of triumph on von schwerins lips  i know them better than you do fischer he declared nikasti is our man     chapter xix   high up in one of the topmost chambers of the hotel plaza nikasti after his conference with von schwerin and fischer sought solitude he opened the high windows out of which he could scarcely see dragged up a chest of drawers and perched himself oriental fashion on the top his long yellow fingers intertwined around his knees his soft brown eyes gazing over the wooded slopes of the park he was away from the clamour of tongues from the poisoned clouds of sophistry even from the disturbance of his own thoughts incited by specious arguments to some form of reciprocity here he sat in the clouds and searched for the true things his eyes seemed to be travelling over the battlefields of europe he saw the swaying fortunes of mighty armies he looked into council chambers he seemed to feel the pulses of the great world force which kept going this most amazing juggernaut he saw the furnaces of japan blazing by night and day saw the forms of hundreds of thousands of his fellow creatures bent to their task saw the streams of ships leaving his ports laden down with stores saw the great guns speeding across siberia the endless trains of ammunition the rifles food for the faminestricken giants who beat upon the air with empty fists he saw the gold come streaming back he saw it poured into the banks the pockets of the merchants the homes of his people he saw brightening days throughout the land he saw the slow but splendid strength of the nation rejoicing in its new possibilities and beyond that what wealth was the great means towards the great end but if the great end were once lost sight of there was no more hideous poison than that stream of enervating prosperity he remembered his own diatribes concerning the decadence of england how he had pointed to the gold poison to the easy living of the poor the blatant luxury of the rich he had pointed to the soft limbs the cities which had become pools of sensuality to the daily life which calling for no effort had seen the passing of the spirit and the triumph of the gross and what about his own people mankind was the same the world over the gold which was bringing strength and life to the nation might very soon exude the same poisonous fumes might very soon be laying its thrall upon a people to whom living had become an easier thing however it might be for other the western nations for his own he firmly believed that war alone with its thousand privations its call to the chivalry of his people was the one great safeguard china the days had gone by when the taking of china could inspire it was to greater things they must look australia new zealand had any western race the right to flaunt her empires flag in asiatic seas and america once again he felt the slow rising of wrath as he recalled the insults of past years  the adventurous sons of his country treated like savages and negroes by that uncultured stronglimbed race of coarsefibered unimaginative materialists there was a call indeed to the soul of his country to avenge to make safe the homes and lives of her colonists across the seas he looked into the council chambers of the wise men of his race he saw the men whose word would tell he watched their faces turned towards him waiting heard the beginning of the conflict of thoughts and mindsblind fidelity to the cause which they had espoused or a rougher more splendid more selfish stroke for the greatness of japan and japan only if we break our faith we lose our honour one murmured there is no honour save the care of my people he heard one of his greatest countrymen reply  so he sat and thought revolved in his mind arguments morals philosophy it was the problem which had confronted the great emperor his own ancestor who had lived for three months on the floor of the temple asking but one question of the silent powers through what gate shall i lead my nation to greatness  the senses of the man who crouched in his curious attitude with his eyes still piercing the heavens were mobile and extraordinary things no disturbing sounds had reached him from outside his isolation seemed complete and impregnable yet without turning his head he was perfectly conscious of the slow opening of the door his whole frame stiffened he was conscious for one bitter second of a lapse from the careful guarding of his ways that second passed however and left him prepared even for danger his brain and muscles alike tense he turned his head the expression of slow surprise which even parted his lips and narrowed his eyes was only half assumed  what do you wish he asked  lutchester did not for a moment reply he had closed the door behind him carefully and was looking around the room now with evident interest its bareness of furniture and decoration were noteworthy but on the top of the ugly chest of drawers was a great bowl of roses a queer little ivory figure set in an arched frame of coppera figure almost sacerdotal with its face turned towards the eastand a little shower of rose leaves which could scarcely have fallen there by accident at the foot of the pedestal lutchester inclined his head gravely as he looked towards it a gesture entirely reverential almost an obeisance nikastis eyes were clouded with curiosity he slipped down to the ground  i have travelled in your country lutchester said gravely as though in explanation i have visited your temples i may say that i have prayed there  and now nikasti asked  i am for my country what you are for yours lutchester proceeded you see i know when it is best to speak the truth i am in new york because you are in new york and if you leave on saturday for japan it may happenof this i am not surebut i say that it may happen that i shall accompany you  i shall be much honoured nikasti murmured  you came here lutchester continued to meet an emissary from berlin your country which could listen to no official word from any one of her official enemies can yet through you learn what is in their minds you have seen today fischer and the baron von schwerin fischer has probably presented to you the letter which he has brought from berlin von schwerin has expounded further the proposition and the price which form part of his offer  nikastis face was imperturbable but there was trouble in his eyes  you have found your way to much knowledge he muttered  i must find my way to more i must know what germany offers you i must know what is at the back of your mind when you repeat this offer in tokio  you can make then the unwilling speak nikasti demanded  even that is amongst the possibilities lutchester affirmed strange things have been done for the cause which such as you and i revere  nikasti showed his white teeth for a moment in a smile meant to be contemptuous  it is a great riddle this which we toss from one to the other he observed i am the simple valet of two gentlemen living in the hotel you have listened perhaps to fairy tales or dreamed them yourself sir  it is no fairy tale lutchester rejoined that you are prince nikasti the third son of the great marquis ato that you and i met more than once in london when you were living there some years ago that you travelled through our country and drew up so scathing an indictment of our domestic and industrial position that but for their clumsy diplomacy your country would probably have made overtures to germany ever since those days i have wondered about you i have wondered whether you are with your country in her friendship towards england  i have no friends but my countrys friends nikasti declared no enemies save her enemies but today those things of which you have spoken do not concern me i am the japanese valet of mr fischer and mr van teyl  lutchester as though by accident came a step further into the room nikastis eyes never left his face perhaps at that moment each knew the others purpose though their tongues clung to the other things  will you talk to me japan lutchester asked calmly you have listened to germany i am england  if you have anything to say nikasti replied baron yung is at washington  you and i know well lutchester continued that ambassadors are but the figureheads in the worlds history speak to me of the things which concern our nations nikasti tell me of the letter you bear to the emperor you have nothing to lose sit down and talk to me man to man you have heard germany hear england tell me of the promises made to you within the last hour and i will show you how they can never be kept let us talk of your countrys future you and i can tell one another much  a valet knows nothing nikasti murmured  lutchester came a step nearer nikasti in retreating was now almost in a corner of the room  listen lutchester went on for many years i have suspected that you are an enemy of my country that is the reason why when our intelligence department learnt of your mission i chose to come myself to meet you and now we meet nikasti face to face and all that you are willing to do for your country i am willing to do for mine and unless you sit down and talk this matter out with me as man to man you will not leave new york  the arm of the japanese stole with the most perfect naturalness inside his coat and lutchester knew then that the die was cast the line of blue steel flashed out too late the hand which gripped the strangelyshaped little knife was held as though in a vice and lutchesters other arm was suddenly thrown around the neck of his assailant his fingers pressed against his windpipe  drop the knife he ordered  it fell clattering on to the hard floor nikasti however twisted himself almost free took a flying leap sideways and seized his adversarys leg in another moment he came down upon the floor with a crash lutchesters grip upon him a little crueller now was like a band of steel  there are many ways of playing this game it is you who have chosen this one he said its no use nikasti i know as much of your own science as you do youre my man now until i choose to let you free and before i do that i am going to read the letter which you are taking to japan  nikastis eyes were red with fury but every movement was torture lutchester held him easily with one hand felt over him with the other drew the letter from his vest and shaking it free from its envelope held it out and read it when he had finished he replaced it in the envelope and pushed it back into the others breast pocket  now he directed you can get up  nikasti scrambled to his feet there were livid marks under his eyes for a moment he had lost all his vitality he was like a beaten creature  you would never have done this he muttered ten years ago i grow old  so that is the letter which you are taking to your emperor lutchester said you think it worth while you can really see the german fleet steaming past the british isles out into the atlantic and bombarding new york  nikasti made no reply lutchester looked at him for a moment thoughtfully there was a light once more in the beaten mans eyesa queer secretive gleam lutchester stooped down and picked up the knife from the floor  nikasti he enjoined listen to me for your countrys sake the promise contained in that letter is barely worth the paper it is written on so long as the british fleet remains what it is but apart from that i tell you here of my own profound convictionand i will prove it to you before many days are pastgermany does not intend to keep this promise  nikasti made no reply his face was expressionless  germany has but one idea lutchester continued she means to play you and america off against one another i have found out her offer to you all i can say is if you take it seriously you are not the man i think you now i will tell you what i am going to do i am going to find out her offer to america i will bring that to you and you shall see the two side by side then you shall know how much you can rely upon a country whose diplomacy is bred and born of lies who cheats at every move of the game who makes you a deliberate offer here which she never has the least intention of keeping have you anything to say to me nikasti  nikasti raised his eyes for one moment  i have nothing to say he replied i am the valet of mr fischer and mr van teyl these things are not of my concern  lutchester shrugged his shoulders  whatever you may be he concluded and however much you may resent all that has happened i know that you will wait i might go direct to washington but i prefer to come to you if it remains possible before you leave this country we will meet again and when you have heard me you will tear that letter which you are treasuring next your heart into small pieces  lutchester turned and left the room closing the door behind him nikasti crouched in his place without movement the ache in his heart seemed to be shining out of his face he turned slowly towards the little figure of black ivory his head drooped lowerhe was filled with a great shame     chapter xx   fischer raised his eyebrows in mild surprise to find nikasti waiting for him in the sitting room that evening with his overcoat and evening hat he closed the door of the bedroom from which he had issued carefully behind him  you dont need to go on with this business now that we have had our little talk he remonstrated  i cannot leave until the twentieth nikasti replied i think it best that i remain here your cocktail sir  fischer accepted the glass with a goodhumoured little laugh  well he said i suppose you know what you want to do but it seems to me unnecessary say is anything wrong with you you seem shaken somehow  i am quite well nikasti declared gravely i am very well indeed  fischer stared at him searchingly from behind his spectacles  you dont look it he observed if youll take my advice youll get away from here and rest somewhere quietly for a few days why dont you try one of the summer hotels on long island  nikasti shook his head  until i sail he decided i stay here it is better so  you know best of course fischer replied wheres mr van teyl  he has gone out with his sister sirthe young lady in the next suite nikasti announced  fischer sighed for a moment then he finished his cocktail drew on his gloves and turned towards the door  well good night he said perhaps you are wise to stay here remember always what it is that you carry about with you  i shall remember nikasti promised  fischer entered his automobile and drove to a fashionable restaurant in the neighbourhood of fifth avenue arrived here he made his way to a room on the first floor into which he was ushered by one of the head waiters von schwerin was already there talking with a little company of men  ah our friend fischer the latter exclaimed that makes our number complete  a waiter handed around cocktails fischer smiled as he raised his glass to his lips  it is something at least he confided to be back in a country where one can speak freely i raise my arm von schwerin and gentlemento the fatherland  they all drank fervently and with a little guttural murmur von schwerin set down his empty glass he was looking a little glum  in many ways my dear fischer he said one sympathises with that speech of yours but the truth is best and it is to talk truths that we have met this evening we are gaining no ground here i am not sure that we are not losing  there was a moments disturbed and agitated silence  it is bad to hear one little man acknowledged with a sigh but who can doubt it there is a fever which has caught hold of this country which blazes in the towns and smoulders in the country places and that is the fever of moneymaking men are blinded with the passion of it they tell me that even otto schmidt in milwaukee has turned his great factories into ammunition works  von schwerins eyes flashed  let him be careful he muttered that one morning those are not blackened walls upon which he looks we go to dinner now gentlemen and until we are alone afterwards not one word concerning the great things  the partition doors leading into the dining room were thrown back and the little company of men sat down to dine there were fourteen of them and their names were known throughout the world there was a steel millionaire halfadozen wall street magnates a clothing manufacturer whose house in fifth avenue was reputed to have cost two millions there was not one of them who was not a patriotto germany they ate and drank through the courses of an abnormally long dinner with the businesslike thoroughness of their race when at last the coffee and liqueurs had been served the waiters by prearrangement disappeared and with a little flourish von schwerin locked the door once more he raised his glass  to the kaiser and the fatherland he cried in a voice thick with emotion  for a moment a little flash of something almost like spirituality lightened the gathering they were at least men with a purpose and an unselfish purpose  oscar fischer von schwerin said my friends all of you you know how strenuous my labours have been during the last year you know that three times the english ambassador has almost demanded my recall and three times the matter has hung in the balance i have watched events in washington not through my own but through a thousand eyes my fingers are on the pulse of the country so what i say to you needs nothing in the way of substantiation the truth is best notwithstanding all my efforts and the efforts of every one of you the great momentum of public feeling from california to massachusetts has turned slowly towards the cause of our enemies washington is hopelessly against us the huge supplies which leave these shores day by day for england and france will continue fresh plants are being laid down for the manufacture of weapons and ammunition to be used against our country the hand of diplomacy is powerless we can struggle no longer even those who favour our cause are drunk with the joy of the golden harvest they are reaping this country has spoken once and for all and its voice is for our most hated enemy  there were a variety of guttural and sympathetic ejaculations a dozen earnest faces turned towards von schwerin  diplomacy von schwerin continued has failed we come to the next step there have been isolated acts of selfsacrifice splendid in themselves but systemless only the day before yesterday a great factory at detroit was burned to the ground and i can assure you gentlemen i who know that a thousand bales of cloth destined for france lie in a charred heap amongst the ruins that fire was no accident  there was a brief silence fischer nodded approvingly von schwerin filled his glass  this he went on was the individual act of a brave and faithful patriot the time has come for us too to remember that we are at war i have striven for you with the weapons of diplomacy and i have failed i ask you now to face the situation with meto make use of the only means left to us  no one hesitated possibly ruin stared them in the face but not one flinched their heads drew closer together they discussed the ways and means of the new campaign  we must add largely to our numbers von schwerin said and we had better have a fund so far as regards money i take it for granted  there was a little chorus of fierce whispers five million dollars were subscribed by men who were willing if necessary to find fifty  it is enough their leader assured them much of our labours will be amongst those to whom money is no object only remember all of you this we shall be a society without a written word with no roll of membership without documents or institution for complicity in the things which follow will mean ruin you are willing to face that  again that strange passionate instinct of unanimity prevailed to all appearance it was a gathering of commonplace commercialised and bourgeois easyliving men but the touch of the spirit was there fischer leaned a little forward  in two months time he said every factory in america which is earning its blood money shall be in danger there will be a reign of terror each state will operate independently and secretly  our friend fischer von schwerin told them has promised to stay over here for the present to organise this undertaking i alas am bound to remain always a little aloof but the time may come and very soon too when i shall be a free lance on that day i shall throw my lot in with yours to the last drop of my blood and the last hour of my liberty until then trust oscar fischer he has done great deeds already he will show you the way to more  fischer took off his spectacles and wiped them  our first proceeding he said sounds paradoxical it must be that we cease to exist there can be no longer any meetings amongst us who stand in this country for germany gatherings of this sort are finished we meet one or two of us perhaps by accident in the clubs and in the streets in our houses and perhaps in the restaurants but the bond which unites us and which no human power could ever sever because it is of the spirit that bond from tonight is intangible wait all of you for a message the task given to each shall not be too great  mr max h bookam a little blackbearded man who had started life tailoring in a garret and was now a multimillionaire raised his glass  no task shall seem too great he muttered no risk shall make us afraid even the exile shall take up his burden     chapter xxi   mr fischers business later on that night led him into unsavoury parts he left his car at the corner of fourteenth street and after a moments reflection as though to refresh his memory he made his way slowly eastwards he wore an unusually shabby overcoat and a felt hat drawn over his eyes both of which garments he had concealed in the automobile even then however his appearance made him an object of some comment a little gang of toughs first jostled him and then turned and followed in his footsteps a man came out of the shadows and they broke away with an oath  that copll get his head broke some day fischer heard one of them mutter with appropriate adjectives  there were others who looked curiously at him one mans hand he felt running over his pockets as he pushed past him a couple of women came screaming down the street and seized him by the arms he shook himself free and listened without a word to their torrent of abuse the lights here seemed to burn more dimly even the flares from the drinking dens seemed secretive and the shadowy places impenetrable it was before a saloon that at last he paused listened for a moment to the sound of a cracked piano inside and entered the place was packed and fortunately for him a scrap of some interest between two villainouslooking italians in a distant corner was occupying the attention of many of the patrons a man with white staring face was banging at a crazy piano without a movement of his body his whole energies apparently directed towards drowning the tumult of oaths and hideous execrations which came from the two combatants a drunken irishman rolling about on the floor kicked at him savagely as he passed an undersized little creature with the face of an old man but the figure of a boy marked him from a distant corner and crept stealthily towards his side fischer reached the counter at last and stood there for a moment waiting two huge roughlooking negroes in soiled linen clothes were dispensing the drinks as one of them passed fischer struck the counter with his forefinger six or seven times observing a particular rhythm the negro started turned his heavilylidded repulsive eyes upon fischer and nodded slightly he handed out the drink he had in his hand and leaned over the counter  want the boss he demanded  fischer assented the negro lifted the flap of the counter and opened a trapdoor leading apparently into a cellar beneath  step right down he muttered dont let the boys catch on get out of that tim he added thickly to the dwarflike figure whose slender fingers were suddenly nearing fischers neck  the creature seemed to melt away fischer dived and descended a dozen steps or so into another bare looking apartment the door of which was half open there were three men seated at the solitary deal table which was almost the only article of furniture to be seen one sombrely dressed in legal black with a pale face and fiercely inquiring eyes half rose to his feet as the newcomer entered anothers hand went to his hip pocket the man who was sitting between the two howevera great redheaded irishmanrose to his feet and pushed them back to their places  theres no cause for alarm now boys he declared this is a friend of mine i wont make you acquainted because were all better friends strangers down in these parts hop it off you two sit down here mr stranger  the two men stole away the irishman poured out a glassful of neat whisky and passed it to his visitor  clients of mine he explained tim crooks is in politics got your message boss whats the figure  two thousand  the irishman whistled and looked thoughtfully down at the table  isnt it enough fischer asked  enough was the hoarse reply why there isnt one of my toughs that wouldnt go rathunting for a quarter of that if its any one in these parts twelve hours is all i want  it isnt  the irishmans face fell  some swell i suppose fifth avenue way and the swagger parts eh  fischer assented silently his host poured himself out some whisky and drank it as though it were water  you see boss he pointed out its no use sending greenhorns out on a job like that because they only squeak if theyre pinched and pinched theyre sure to be and all my regulars are what we call in sanctuary  you mean they are hiding already  thats some truth was the grim admission the cops aint going to trouble to come after em so long as they keep here but theyd nab em fast enough if they showed their noses beyond the end of fourteenth still id like to oblige you guvnor i dont know who you are and dont want but my boys speak fine of you you know ed swindles  not by name fischer confessed  he did that little job up at detroit the irishman went on dropping his voice a little i tell you hes a genius at handling a bomb is ed blew that old factory into brickends he did hes in the saloon upstairsgot his girl with him theyve been doing a round of the dancing saloons  thats all right but what about this job fischer inquired a little impatiently  the irishman glanced behind him then he dropped his voice a little  look here guvnor he said ive some idea if it pans out youve heard of the heste case  you mean the girl who was murdered  yes well the chap that did it is within a few feet of where were sitting  fischer took off his spectacles and rubbed them in the dim light his face looked more grim and powerful than ever  isnt that a little dangerous he observed the police mean having him  youre dead right the irishman replied theyve got to have him and he knows it theyd keep their hands off any one in these parts if they could but this blokes different he done it too thick and hes got the public squealing now if we could get him out for long enough hes the man for your job come right along boss  he rose heavily to his feet crossed the room and threw open the door of what was little more than a cupboard at the further end the place was in darkness but a human form sprang suddenly upright his white face and glaring eyes were the only visible objects in a shroud of darkness  thats all right kid the irishman said soothingly no cops yet this is a gentleman on business wait till i fix a light  he stepped back and brought a candle from the table at which he had been seated fischer helped him light it and by degrees the interior of the little apartment was illuminated its contents were almost negligiblethere was simply a foul piece of rug in the corner and a broken chair with his back to the wall crouched a slim apparently young man with a perfectly bloodless face and black eyes under which were blue lines his clothes were torn and covered with dust as though he had dragged himself about the floor and one of his hands was bleeding  the gentlemans on business jake his host repeated  give me some whisky the young man mumbled  the irishman shaded his eyes  holy moses why youve finished that bottle he exclaimed  its like water the fugitive replied in a hot whisper i drink and i feel nothing i taste nothingi forget nothing give me something stronger  he tossed off without hesitation the tumbler half full of whisky which his guardian fetched him then he came out  im sick of this he declared ill sit at your table its no use talking to me of jobs he went on i couldnt get out of here i made for the docks but they headed me off they know where i am theyll have me sooner or later  yes theyll have you right enough the irishman assented but if there was any chance in the world this gent could give it to you hes got a job he wants done up amongst the swells in fifth avenue and theres money enough in it to buy anna herself if you want her annas our real toff down here he explained turning to fischer and all the boys are crazy about her  jake shook his head unimpressed he fixed his eyes upon fischer moistened his lips a little and spoke in a sort of croaky whisper  moneys no use to me he said nor women eitherim through with them you know what i done i killed my girl thats what im going to the chair for but if i could get out of this id do your job im kind of hating people i cant get my girls face out of my mind perhaps if i did your job id have another one to think about  pleasant company aint he the irishman grunted hes the real goods  fischer stared at the young man as though fascinated he seemed beyond and outside human comprehension their host was sitting with his hands in his pockets and his feet on another chair the braces hung from his shoulders upon the floor his collarless shirt had fallen a little open his face with its little tuft of red side whiskers and unshaven chin was reminiscent of the forests  if you want this job fixed mr stranger he said i dont know as jake here couldnt take it on itd have to be done like this jakes a real toney chauffeurdrive anything if you had your automobile at a spot i could tell you of one evening just at dusk i might get him that far in a set of chauffeurs clothes once on the box of your auto hed be out of this and could give em the slip for a bit its the only way i can think of to get him near the game  the arrangement would suit me fischer admitted  jake suddenly showed a gleaming set of unexpectedly white teeth his eyes stared more than ever  im game im on to this he cried fiercely you can have all there is coming to me sullivan if i get nabbed but im going to take my risk i hate this hole its a rats den  then get you back to your cupboard jake the irishman enjoined ive got to talk business to the gent  the young man rose to his feet he took the bottle of whisky under his arm his face was still ashen but his tone was steady he gripped fischer by the arm  i will do your job he promised i will do it thoroughly  he slouched across the floor entered his cupboard and disappeared fischer was suddenly aware of the moisture upon his forehead there was something animallike absolutely inhuman about this creature with whom he had made his murderous bargain  i have no money here of course he reminded his companion  dont know as i blame you guvnor the other observed with a grin i saw my toughs lay out a guy only the other day for flashing a smaller wad than youd carry you know the rules and i guess ill ring up the bank tomorrow morning at eleven oclock does that go  youll find the deposit there fischer promised youd better let me know when hes ready to take the job on  the irishman walked to the foot of the steps with his visitor  give joe the double knock on the trapdoor he directed and get out of the saloon as quick as you can theres a dago about there keeps our hands full got anything with you  fischer nodded his hand stole out of his overcoat pocket  better give them one if they look like trouble his host advised theyve plenty of spunk but i can tell you they make tracks for their holes if they hear one of those things bark  they shall hear it fast enough if they try to hustle me fischer observed grimly  youve some pluck the irishman declared as he watched his departing guest ascend the steps sure this is no place for cowards anyway and good night and good luck to you jake will do your job slick if any one could  fischer beat his little tattoo upon the trapdoor crawled through it and underneath the flap in the counter out into the saloon he paused for a moment to look around on his way to the door the fight was apparently over for every one was standing at the counter drinking with a swarthyfaced man whose cheeks were stained with blood from a distant corner came the sound of groans the air seemed heavier than ever with foul tobacco smoke the man at the piano still thrashed out his unmelodious chords some women in a corner were pretending to dance one or two of them looked curiously at fischer but he passed out unchallenged even the air of the slum outside seemed pure and fresh after the heated den he had left he reached the corner of the street in safety and stepped quickly into his car he threw both windows wide open and murmured an order to the chauffeur then he leaned back and closed his eyes for a moment he was a man not overburdened with imagination but it seemed to him just then that he would never be able altogether to forget the face of that ghastly dehumanised creature crouching like some terrified wild animal in his fetid refuge     chapter xxii   mrs theodore hastings was fortyeight years old which her friends said was the reason why her mansion on fifth avenue was furnished and lit with the delicate sombreness of an old italian palace there was about it none of the garishness the almost resplendent brilliancy associated with the abodes of many of our neighbours although her masseuse confidently assured her that she looked twentyeight mrs hastings preferred not to put the matter to the test she received her carefully selected dinner guests in a great library with cedarwood walls furnished with almost victorian sobriety and illuminated by myriads of hidden lights pamela being a relative received the special consideration of an affectionately bestowed embrace  pamela my child wasnt it splendid i heard that you were in new york she exclaimed quite by accident too i think you treat your relatives shamefully  her niece laughed  well anyhow youre the first of them ive seen at all and directly jim told me he was coming to you i made him ring up in case you had room for me  jimmy was a dear mrs hastings declared and of course there couldnt be a time when there wouldnt be room for you even now at the last moment though i havent quite made up my mind where to put you choose dear will you have a western bishop or a rather dull englishman  what is the name of the englishman pamela asked with sudden intuition  lutchester dear quite a nice name but i know nothing about him he brought letters to your uncle rather a queer time for englishmen to be travelling about we thought but still there he is seems to have found some people he knowsand i declare he is coming towards you  i met him in london pamela whispered and i never could get on with bishops  the dinner table was large and arranged with that wonderful simplicity which mrs hastings had adopted as the keynote of her new york parties she had taken in fact simplicity under her wing and made a new thing of it there were more flowers than silver and cut glass than heavy plate there seemed to be an almost ostentatious desire to conceal the fact that mr hastings had robbed the american public of a good many million dollars  of course pamela declared as they took their places and she nodded a greeting to some friends around the table fate is throwing us together in the most unaccountable manner  i accept its vagaries with resignation lutchester replied besides it is quite time we met again you promised to show me new york and i havent seen you for days  i dont even remember the promise pamela laughed but in any case i have changed my mind i am not sure that you are the nice simpleminded person you profess to be i begin to have doubts about you  interest grows with mystery lutchester remarked complacently let us hope that i am promoted in your mind  well i am not at all sure of course i am not an englishman so it is of no particular interest to me but if you really came over here on important affairs i am not sure that i approve of your playing golf the day after your arrival  that perhaps was thoughtless he admitted but one gets so short of exercise on board ship  of course pamela observed tentatively id forgive you even now if youd only be a little more frank with me  i am prepared to be candour itself he assured her  tell me she begged the whole extent of your mission in america  he glanced around  if we were alone he replied i might court indiscretion so far as to tell you  then we will leave the answer to that question until after dinner she said  she talked to her lefthand neighbour for a few moments and lutchester followed suit they turned to one another again however at the first opportunity  i have conceived she told him a great admiration for mr oscar fischer  a very able man lutchester agreed  he is not only that pamela continued but he is a man with large principles and great ideas  principles lutchester murmured  of course you dont like him pamela went on and i dont wonder at it he is thoroughly german isnt he  almost prejudiced im afraid lutchester assented  dont be silly pamela protested why hes german by birth and although you english people are much too pigheaded to see any good in an enemy i think you must admit that the way they all hang together germans i mean all over the worldis perfectly wonderful  there have been a few remarks of the same sort lutchester reminded her about the inhabitants of the british empirecanadians australians new zealanders for instance  as a matter of fact pamela admitted generously i consider that your colonials understand the word patriotism better than the ordinary englishman with them as with the germans it is almost a passionate impulse your hearts may be in the right places but you always give one the impression of finding the whole thing rather a bore  well so it is lutchester insisted who wants to give up a very agreeable profession and enter upon a career of bloodshed abandon all ones habits and lose most of ones friends no we are honest about that at any rate germany may be enjoying this war we arent  what was your profession pamela inquired  diplomacy lutchester confided i intended to become an ambassador  do you think you have the requisite gifts  what are they  secrecy subtlety caution and highlydeveloped intelligence she replied hows that  all those gifts he assured her i possess  she fanned herself for a moment and looked at him  we are not a modest race ourselves she said but i think you can give us a lead by the bye were you playing golf with senator hamblin by accident the other afternoon  you mean the old johnny down at baltusrol he asked coolly i picked him up wandering about by the professionals shed  did you talk politics with him  we gassed a bit about the war lutchester admitted cheerfully  pamela laughed she leaned a little forward the buzz of conversation now was insistent all around them  of you two she whispered i prefer fischer  lutchester considered the matter for some time  well theres no accounting for tastes he said presently i shouldnt have thought him exactly your type  he may not be pamela confessed but at least he has the courage to speak what is in his mind  lutchester smiled  so fischer has taken you into his confidence has he he murmured well now that seems queer to me i should have thought your interests would have lain the other way  as an individual  as an american  i am not wholly convinced of that  come he protested what is the use of a friend from whom you are separated by an unnegotiable space  what unnegotiable space  the atlantic  and why is the atlantic unnegotiable  because of a little affair called the british fleet lutchester pointed out  there is also she reminded him drily a german fleet and they havent met yet  ah i had almost forgotten there was such a thing he murmured where do they keep it  you know you arent nearly so stupid as you pretend to be she said a little impatiently i should like you so much better if you would be frank with me  what about those qualifications for my ambassadorial career he reminded hersecrecy subtlety caution  the master of these she whispered rising to her feet in response to her hostesss signal knows when to abandon them  lutchester changed his place to a vacant chair by james van teyls side  i was going to ask you mr van teyl he inquired whether your japanese servant was altogether a success i think i shall have to get a temporary servant while i am over here  nikasti was entirely fischers affair van teyl replied and i cant say much about him as i have given up my share of the apartments at the plaza the fellows all right i dare say but we hadnt the slightest use for a valet the man on the floors good enough for any one  by the bye lutchester inquired is fischer still in new york  no hes in washington van teyl replied i believe hes expected back tomorrow say can i ask you a question  lutchester almost imperceptibly drew his chair a little closer  of course you can he assented  what i want to know van teyl continued confidentially is how you get that long run on your cleek shots i saw you play the sixteenth hole and it looked to me as though the ball were never going to stop  lutchester smiled  i have made a special study of that shot he confided yes i can tell you how its done but it needs a lot of practice its done in turning over the wrists sharply just at the moment of impact you get everything there is to be got into the stroke that way and you keep the ball low too  gee i must try that van teyl observed making spasmodic movements with his wrists when could we have a day down at baltusrol  it will have to be next week im afraid if you dont mind lutchester replied ive a good many appointments in new york and i may have to go to washington myself by the bye i thought our host lived there  so he does van teyl assented nowadays though it seems to have become the fashion for politicians to own a house up in new york and do some entertaining here theyre after the financial interest i suppose  is your uncle a keen politician  keen as mustard van teyl answered sos my aunt shed give her soul to have the old man nominated for the presidency  any chance of it  not an earthly hell come a mucker though some day trying hed take any outside chance for a clever man hes the vainest thing i know  lutchester smiled enigmatically as he followed the example of the others and rose to his feet  even in america then he observed your great men have their weaknesses     chapter xxiii   fischer exactly one week after his nocturnal visit to fourteenth street hurried out of the train at the pennsylvania station almost tore the newspapers from the news stand glanced through them one by one and threw them back the attendant openmouthed ventured upon a mild protest fischer threw him a dollar bill caught up his handbag and made for the entrance he was the first passenger from the washington limited to reach the street and spring into a taxi  the plaza hotel he ordered get along  they arrived at the plaza in less than ten minutes mr fischer tipped the driver lavishly suffered the hall porter to take his bag returned his greeting mechanically and walked with swift haste to the tape machine he held up the strips with shaking fingers dropped them again hurried to the lift and entered his rooms nikasti was in the sittingroom arranging some flowers fischer did not even stop to reply to his reverential greeting  wheres mr van teyl he demanded  mr van teyl has gone away sir was the calm reply he left here the day before yesterday there is a letter  fischer took no notice he was already gripping the telephone receiver  982 wall he saidan urgent call  he stood waiting his face an epitome of breathless suspense soon a voice answered him  that the office of neville brooks and van teyl he demanded yes put me through to mr van teyl urgent  another few seconds of waiting then once more he bent over the instrument  that you van teyl yes fischer speaking oh never mind about that listen what price are anglofrench no say about what ninetyfive sell me a hundred thousand whats that what of course its a big deal never mind that im good enough arent i therell be no rise thatll wipe out half a million dollars ive got that lying in cash at guggenheimers if you need the money ill bring it you in half an hour get out into the market and sell damn you whats it matter about news right sorry jim see you later  fischer put down the telephone and wiped his forehead notwithstanding the fatigue in his face there was a glint of triumph there he laid his hand upon nikastis shoulder  my friend he said theres big proof coming of what i said to you the other day youll find that letter you carry will mean a different thing now theres news in the air  there has been a great battle perhaps nikasti asked slowly  all that is to be known you will hear before evening fischer replied tell some one to send me some coffee i have come through from washington i am tired  he sank a little abruptly into an easychair took off his spectacles and leaned his head back upon the cushions in the sunlight his face was almost ghastly a queer sense of weakness had suddenly assailed him his mind flitted back through a vista of sleepless nights of strenuous days of passions held in leash excitement ground down  i am tired he said telephone down to the office nikasti for a doctor  nikasti obeyed and his summons was promptly answered the doctor who arrived was pleasantly but ominously grave in the middle of his examination the telephone rang fischer without ceremony moved to the receiver it was van teyl speaking  ive sold your hundred thousand anglofrench he announced its done the whole market in thoughknocked the bottom out of it theyve fallen a point and a half shall i begin to buy back for you youll make a bit  not a share fischer answered fiercely wait  have you any news youre keeping up your sleeve van teyl persisted  if i have its my own affair was the curt reply and i dont tell news over the telephone anyway watch the market and go on selling where you can  i shall do as you order van teyl replied but youre all against the general tone here by the bye you got my letter  i havent opened it yet fischer snapped whats the matter  pamela and i have taken a little flat in fiftyeighth street seems a little abrupt but she didnt want to be alone and she hates hotels we felt sure youd understand  yes i understand fischer said goodby im busy  the doctor completed his examination when he had finished he mentioned his fee  you work too hard and you live in an atmosphere of too great strain the natural consequences are already beginning to show themselves if i give you medicine it will only encourage you to keep on wasting yourself but you can have medicine if you like  send me something to take for the next fortnight fischer replied after that ill take my chance  the doctor wrote a prescription and took his leave fischer leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes his mind travelled back through these latter days of his overstrenuous life in such minutes of relaxation few of which he permitted himself he realised with bitter completeness the catastrophe which had overtaken himhim oscar fischer of all men on earth into his life of grim purposes of lofty and yet narrow ambitions of almost superhuman tenacity had crept the one weakening strain whose presence in other men he had always scoffed at and derived there was a new and enervating glamour over the days a new and hatefully powerful rival for all his thoughts and dreams ten years ago he reflected sadly this might have made a different man of him might have unlocked the gates into another more peaceful and beautiful world visions of which had sometimes vaguely disturbed him in his cold and selfish climb now it could only mean suffering this was the first stroke it was the assertion of humanity which was responsible for his present weakness how far might it not drag him down  there should be a fight at any rate he told himself as an hour or two later he made his way downtown he paid several calls in the vicinity of wall street and finished up in van teyls office that young man greeted him with a certain relief  you know the tone of the markets still against you fischer he warned him once more  fischer threw himself into the clients easychair the furniture in the office seemed less distinct than usual he was conscious of a certain haziness of outline in everything van teyls face even was shrouded in a little mist then he suddenly found himself fighting fiercely fighting for his consciousness fighting against a wave of giddiness a deadly sinking of the heart a strange slackening of all his nerve power the young stockbroker rose hastily to his feet  anything wrong old fellow he asked anxiously  a glass of water fischer begged  he was conscious of drinking it vaguely conscious that he was winning soon the office had regained its ordinary appearance his pulse was beating more regularly he had once more the feeling of livingof living though in a minor key  a touch of liver he murmured what did you say about the markets  you look pretty rotten van teyl remarked sympathetically shall i send out for some brandy  not for me fischer scoffed i dont need it what price are anglofrench  ninetyfour youve only done them in a point after all and thats nominal i daresay i could get ten thousand back at that  let them alone was the calm reply ill sell another fifty thousand at ninetyfour  look here van teyl said swinging round in his chair i like the business and i know you can finance it but are you sure that you realise what you are doing every one believes anglofrench have touched their bottom theyve only to go back to where they weresay five pointsand youd lose half a million  fischer smiled a little wearily  that small sum in arithmetic he remonstrated had already passed through my brain send in your selling order jim and come out to lunch with me ive come straight through from washingtononly got in this morning  van teyl called in his clerk and gave a few orders then he took up his hat and left the office with his client  from washington eh he remarked curiously as they passed into the crowded streets so that accounts  he broke off abruptly his companions warning fingers had tightened upon his arm  quite right van teyl confessed theres gossip enough about now and they seem to have tumbled to it that youre our client the office has been besieged this morning sorry ned im busy he went on to a man who tried to catch his arm see you later fred ill be in after lunch mr borrodaile no nothing fresh that i know of  fischer smiled grimly  got you into a kind of hornets nest eh he observed  its been like this all the morning van teyl told him they believe i know something even the newspaper men are tumbling to it well lunch up at the club maybe well get a little peace there  they stepped into the hall of a great building and took one of the interminable row of lifts a few minutes later they were seated at a side table in a dining room on the top floor of one of the huge modern skyscrapers below them stretched a silent panorama of the city beyond a picturesque view of the river a fresh breeze blew in through the opened window they were above the noise even of the street cars  order me a small bottle of champagne james fischer begged and some steak  van teyl stared at his companion and laughed as he took up the wine list  well thats the first time fischer ive known you to touch a drop of anything before the evening ill have a whisky and soda with you thank god were away from that inquisitive crowd for a few minutes are you going to give me an idea of whats moving  fischer watched the wine being poured into his glass  not until this evening he said i want you to bring your sister and come and dine at the new roofgarden  i dont know whether pamela has any engagement van teyl began a little dubiously  please go and see fischer begged earnestly the telephones are just outside tell your sister that i particularly wish her to accept my invitation tell her that there will be news  van teyl went out to the telephone fischer sipped his champagne and crumbled up his bread his eyes fixed a little dreamily on the grey river he was already conscious of the glow of the wine in his veins the sensation was half pleasurable in a sense distasteful to him he resented this artificial humanity he had the feeling of a man who has stooped to be doped by a quack doctor and he was a little afraid  his young companion returned triumphant  had a little trouble with pamela he observed as he resumed his place at the table she was thinking of the opera with a girl friend she picked up this morning however the idea of news i think clinched it well be at the oriental at eight oclock eh  fischer looked up from the fascinating patchwork below already there was anticipation in his face  i am very glad he said there will certainly be news     chapter xxiv   now indeed i feel that i am in new york pamela declared as she broke off one of the blossoms of the great cluster of deep red roses by her side and gazed downward over her shoulder at the farflung carpet of lights one sees little bits of america in every country of the world but never this  fischer unusually grave and funereallooking in his dinner clothes and black tie followed her gesture with thoughtful eyes everything that was ugly in the stretching arms of the city seemed softened shrouded and bejewelled even the sounds the rattle and roar of the overhead railways the clanging of the electric car bells the shrieking of the sirens upon the river seemed somehow to have lost their harsh note to have become the human cry of the great live city awaking and stretching itself for the night  i agree with you he said you dine at the ritzcarlton and you might be in paris you dine here and one knows that you are in america  yet even here we have become increasingly luxurious pamela remarked looking around the glass and linen upon the tables are quite french those shaded lights are exquisite that little band too was playing at the ritz three years ago i am sure that the maitre dhotel who brought us to our table was once at the cafe de paris  money would draw all those things from europe even to the sahara fischer observed so long as there were plenty of it but millions could not buy our dining table in the clouds  a little effort of the imagination fortunately pamela laughed looking upwards there are stars but no clouds  i guess one of them is going to slip down to the next table before long van teyl observed with a little movement of his head  they all three turned around and looked at the wonderful bank of pink roses within a few feet of them  one of the opera women i daresay the young man continued they are rather fond of this place  pamela leaned forward fischer was watching the streets below only a short distance away was a huge newspaper building flaring with lights the pavements fringing it were thronged with a little stationary crowd a row of motorbicycles was in waiting a night edition of the paper was almost due  mr fischer she asked what about that news  he withdrew his eyes from the street almost unconsciously he straightened himself a little in his place there was pride in his tone behind his spectacles his eyes flashed  i would have told it you before he said but you would not have believed it soonin a very few momentsthe news will be known you will see it break away in waves from that building down there so i will bear with your incredulity the german and british fleets have met and the victory has remained with us  with us pamela repeated  with germany fischer corrected himself hastily  is this true james van teyl almost shouted fischer are you sure of what youre saying why its incredible  it is true was the proud reply the german navy has been a long time proving itself it has done so now today every german citizen is the proudest creature breathing he knew before that his armies were invincible he knows now that his fleet is destined to make his country the mistress of the seas englands day is over her ships were badly handled and foolishly flung into battle she has lost many of her finest units her navy is today a crippled and maimed force the german fleet is out in the north sea waiting for an enemy who has disappeared  it is inconceivable pamela gasped  i do not ask you to believe my word fischer exclaimed look  as though the flood gates had been suddenly opened the stream of patient waiters broke away from the newspaper building below like little fireflies the motorbicycles were tearing down the different thoroughfares boys like ants with their burden of news sheets were running in every direction motortrucks had started on their furious race even the distant echoes of their cries came faintly up fischer called a messenger and sent him for a paper  i do not know what report you will see he said but from whatever source it comes it will confirm my story the news is too great and sweeping to be contradicted or ignored  if its true van teyl muttered youve made a fortune in my office today it looks like it too there was something wrong with anglofrench beside your selling for the last hour this afternoon i couldnt get buyers to listen for a moment  yes i shall have made a great deal of money fischer admitted money which i shall value because it comes magnificently but i hope that this victory may help me to win other things  he looked fixedly at pamela and she moved uneasily in her chair almost unconsciously the man himself seemed somehow associated with his cause to be assuming a larger and more tolerant place in her thoughts perhaps there was some measure of greatness about him after all the strain of waiting for the papers became almost intolerable at last the boy reappeared the great black headlines were stretched out before her she felt the envelopment of fischers triumph the words were there in solid type and the paper itself was one of the most reliable  great naval battle in the north sea  british admiralty admits serious losses  queen mary indefatigable and many fine ships lost  pamela looked up from the sheet  it is too wonderful she whispered with a note of awe in her tone i dont think that any one ever expected this we all believed in the british navy  there is nothing fischer declared that england can do which germany cannot do better  and america best of all pamela said  fischer bowed  that is one comparison which will never now be made he declared for from tonight germany and america will draw nearer together the bubble of british naval omnipotence is pricked  meanwhile van teyl observed putting his paper away we are neglecting our dinner nothing like a good dose of sensationalism for giving us an appetite  fischer was watching his glass being filled with champagne he seized it by the stem his eyes for a moment travelled upwards  i am an american citizen he said with a strange fervour in his tone but for the moment i am called back and so i lift my glass and i drinki alone without invitation to you othersto those brave souls who have made of the north sea a holy battleground  he drained his glass and set it down empty pamela watched him as though fascinated for a single moment she was conscious of a queer sensation of personal pity for some shadowy and absent friend of something almost like a lump in her throat a strange instinct of antagonism towards the man by her side so enveloped in beatific satisfactionthen she frowned when she realised that she had been thinking of lutchester that her first impulse had been one of sympathy for him the moment passed the service of dinner was pressed more insistently upon them james van teyl who had been leaning back in his chair talking to one of the maitres dhotel dismissed him with a little nod and entrusted them with a confidence  say do you know whos coming to the next table he exclaimed sonia  they were all interested  you wont mind fischer asked diffidently  in a restaurant how absurd pamela laughed why im dying to see her i wonder how it is that some of these greatest singers in the world lead such extraordinary lives that people can never know anything of them  society is tolerant enough nowadays her brother observed but sonia wont give them even a decent chance to wink at her eccentricities she crossed you know on the prince dorondas yacht for fear they wouldnt let her land  here she comes pamela whispered  there was a moments spellbound silence two maitres dhotel were hurrying in front a pathway from the lift had been cleared as though for a royal personage sonia in white from head to foot a dream of white lace and chinchilla with a russian crown of pearls in her glossy black hair and a rope of pearls around her neck came like a waxen figure with scarlet lips and flashing eyes towards her table and behind herlutchester pamela felt her fingers gripping the tablecloth her first impulse curiously enough was one of wild fury with herself for that single instants pity her face grew cold and hard she felt herself sitting a little more upright her eyes remained fixed upon the newcomers  lutchesters behaviour was admirable his glance swept their little table without even a shadow of interest he ignored with passive unconcern the mistake of van teyls attempted greeting he looked through fischer as though he had been a ghost he stood by sonias side while she seated herself and listened with courteous pleasure to her excited admiration of the flowers and the wonderful vista then he took his own place in his right hand he was carrying an evening paper with its flaming headlines  that fischer pronounced struggling to keep the joy from his tone is very british and very magnificent                                       pamela had imperfect recollections of the rest of the evening she remembered that she was more than usually gay throughout dinnertime but that she was the first to jump at the idea of a hurried departure and a visit to a cabaret every now and then she caught a glimpse of sonias face saw the challenging light in her brilliant eyes heard little scraps of her conversation the frenchwoman spoke always in her own language with a rather shrill voice which made lutchesters replies sound graver and quieter than usual more than once pamelas eyes rested upon the broad lines of his back he sat all the time like a rock courteous at times obviously amusing but underneath it all she fancied that she saw some signs of the disturbance from which she herself was suffering she rose to her feet at last with a little sigh of relief it was an ordeal through which she had passed  once in the lift her brother and fischer discussed lutchesters indiscretion volubly  i suppose van teyl declared that there isnt a man in new york who wouldnt have jumped at the chance of dining alone with sonia but for an englishman on a night like this he went on glancing at the paper say he must have some nerve  or else fischer remarked a wonderful indifference so far as i have studied the anglosaxon temperament i should be inclined to vote for the indifference that is why i think germany will win the war every man in that country prays for his countrys success not only in words but with his soul i have not found the same spirit in england  the english people pamela interposed have a genius for concealment which amounts to stupidity  i have a theory fischer said that to be phlegmatic after a certain pitch is a sign of low vitality however we shall see certainly if england is to be saved from her present trouble it will not be the lutchesters of the world who will do it nor it seems her navy  they found their way to a large cabaret where pamela listened to an indifferent performance a little wearily the news of what was termed a naval disaster to great britain was flashed upon the screen and generally speaking the audience was stunned fischer behaved throughout the evening with tact and discretion he made few references to the matter and was careful not to indulge in any undue exhilaration once when van teyl had left the box however to speak to some friends he turned earnestly to pamela  will it please you soon he begged to resume our conversation of the other day however you may look at it things have changed have they not an invincible british navy has been one of the fundamental principles of beliefs in american politics now that it is destroyed the outlook is different i could go myself to the proper quarter in washington or von schwerin is here to be my spokesman i have a fancy though to work with you you know why  she moved uneasily in her place  i have no idea she objected what it is that you have to propose besides i am only just a woman who has been entrusted with a few diplomatic errands  you are the niece of senator hastings fischer reminded her and hastings is the man through whom i should like my proposal to go to the president it is an honest offer which i have to make and although it cannot pass through official channels it is official in the highest sense of the word because it comes to me from the one man who is in a position to make himself responsible for it  her brother came back to the box before pamela could reply but as they parted that night she gave fischer her hand  come and see our new quarters she invited i shall be at home any time tomorrow afternoon  it was one of the moments of fischers life he bowed low over her fingers  i accept with great pleasure he murmured     chapter xxv   sonia had the air of one steeped in an almost ecstatic content on her return from the roof garden she had exchanged her wonderful gown for a white silk negligee and her headdress of pearls for a quaint little cap she was stretched upon a sofa drawn before the wideflung french windows of her little sittingroom at the ritzcarlton a salon decorated in pink and white and filled almost to overflowing with the roses which she loved by her side in an easy chair which she had pressed him to draw up to her couch sat lutchester  this she murmured is one of the evenings which i adore i have no work no engagementsjust one friend with whom to talk my fine clothes have done i am myself she added stretching out her arms i have my cigarettes my iced sherbet and the lights and murmur of the city there below to soothe me and you to talk with me my friend what are you thinking of methat i am a little animal who loves comfort too much eh  lutchester smiled  we all love comfort he replied some of us are franker than others about it  she made a little grimace  comfort it is my own word but what a word it is luxury i worshipluxuryand a friend is that perhaps another word too slight eh  he met the provocative gleam of her eyes with a smile of amusement  you are just the same child sonia he remarked neither climate nor country nor the few passing years can change you  it is you who have grown older and sterner she pouted it is you who have lost the gift of living today as though tomorrow were not there was a time was there not john when you did not care to sit always so far away  she laid her handringless overmanicured but delicately white upon his he smoothed it gently  you see sonia he sighed troubles have come that harden the hearts even of the gayest of us  she frowned  you are not going to remind me she began  if i reminded you of anything sonia he interrupted i would remind you that you are a frenchwoman  she stretched out her hand restlessly and took one of the russian cigarettes from a bowl by her side  you are not by any chance going to talk seriously dear john  i am he assured her very seriously  oh la la she laughed you my dear gay companion you who have shaken the bells all your life you are going to talk seriously and tonight when we meet again after so long ah well why should i be surprised she went on with a pout  you have changed when one looks into your face one sees the difference but to me of all people in the world why talk seriously to me i am just sonia the gipsy nightingale i know nothing of serious things  you carry one very serious secret in your heart he told her gravely one little pain which must sometimes stab you you are a frenchwoman and yet  lutchester paused for a moment sonia too seemed suddenly to have awakened into a state of tense and vivid emotion the cigarette burned away between her fingers her great eyes were fixed upon lutchester there was something almost like fear in their questioning depths  finish finish she insisted continue  and yet he went on your very dear friend the friend for whose sake you are here in america is your countrys enemy  she raised herself a little upon the couch  that is not true she declared furiously maurice loves france his heart aches for the misery that has come upon her it is your country only which he hates if france had but possessed the courage to stand by herself to resist when england forced her friendship upon her none of this tragedy would ever have happened maurice has told me so himself france could have peace today peace at her own price  there is no peace which would leave france with a soul save the peace which follows victory lutchester replied sternly  she crushed her cigarette nervously in her fingers threw it away and lit another  i will not talk of these things with you she cried it was not for this that you sought me out eh tell me at once were these the thoughts you had in your mind when you sent your little notewhen you chose to show yourself once more in my life  for the first time of his own accord he drew his chair a little nearer to hers he took her hand she gave him both unresistingly  listen dear sonia he said it is true that i am a changed man i am older than when we met last and there are the other things you remember the chateau dalbert  of course she murmured and the young duc dalberts wonderful house party we all motored there from paris you and i were together you have forgotten that eh  i lay in that orchard for two days he went on grimly with a hole in my side and one leg pretty nearly done for i saw things i can never forget in those days sonia dalbert himself was killed it was in that first mad rush of the chateau there remains but four blackened walls  pauvre enfant she murmured but you are well and strong again now is it not so you will not fight again eh you were never a soldier dear friend  just now he confided i have other work to do it is that other work which has brought me to america  she drew him a little closer to her her eyes questioned him  there is perhaps now she asked a woman in your life  there is he admitted  she made a grimace  but how clumsy to tell me even though i asked she exclaimed what is she like  but no i do not wish to hear of her if she is all the world to you why did you send me that little note why are you here  because we were once dear friends sonia he said because i wish to save you from great trouble  she shrank from him a little fearfully  what do you mean  sonia he continued with a note of sternness in his tone during the last two years you have gone back and forth between new york and paris six times i do not think that you can make that journey again  she was standing now with one hand gripping the edge of the table  john  john  what do you mean she demanded and this time her own voice was hard  i mean he said that when you leave here for paris you will be watched day and night the moment you set foot upon french soil you will be arrested and searched if anything is found upon you such as a message from your friend in washingtonwell you know what it would mean cant you see you foolish child the risk you have been running would you care to be branded as a spyyou a daughter of france  she struck at him her lace sleeves had fallen back and her white arm with its little clenched fist flashed through the twilight aimlessly yet passionately  you dare to call me a spy you john she shrieked but it is horrible  it is the work of a spy he told her gravely to bring a letter from any person in a friendly capital and deliver it to an enemy that is what you have done sonia many times since the beginning of the war so far without detection it is because you are sonia that i have come to save you from doing it again  she groped her way back to the couch she threw herself upon it with her back towards him her head buried in her hands  the letters are only between friends she faltered they have nothing to do with the war  you may have believed that lutchester replied gently but it is not true you have been made the bearer of confidential communications from the austrian embassy here to certain people in paris whom we will not name i have pledged my word sonia that this shall cease  she sprang to her feet all the feline joy of her languorous ease seemed to have departed she was quivering and nervous she stood over her writingtable  a telegraph blank she exclaimed quick i will not see maurice again oh how i have suffered this shall end it see i have written goodby he will understand if he comes i will not see him ring the bell quickly thereit is finished  a pageboy appeared and she handed him the telegram then she turned a little pathetically to lutchester  maurice was foolishvery often foolish she went on unsteadily but he has loved me and a woman loves love so much now i shall be lonely and yet there is a great weight gone from my mind always i wondered about those letters you will be my friend john you will not leave me all alone  he patted her hand  dear sonia he whispered solitude is not the worst thing one has to bear these days try and remember wont you that all the men who might have loved you are fighting for your country one way or another  it is all so sad she faltered and youyou are so stern and changed  it is with me only as it is with the whole world he told her tonight though you have relieved me of one anxiety  her eyes once more were for a moment frightened  there was danger for poor little me  he nodded  it is past he assured her  and it is you who have saved me she murmured ah mr john she added as she walked with him to the door if ever there comes to me a lover not for the days only but pour la vie i hope that he may be an englishman like you whom all the world trusts  he laughed and raised her fingers to his lips  overfaithful you called us once he reminded her  but that was when i was a child she said and in days like these we are children no longer     chapter xxvi   lutchester left sonia and the ritzcarlton a few minutes before midnight to find a great yellow moon overhead which seemed to have risen somewhere at the back of central park the broad thoroughfare up which he turned seemed to have developed a new and unfamiliar beauty the electric lamps shone with a pale and almost unnatural glow the flashing lights of the automobiles passing up and down were almost whimsically unnecessary lutchester walked slowly up fifth avenue in the direction of his hotel  somethingthe beauty of the night perhaps or some faint aftermath of sentimentality born of sonias emotiontempted him during those few moments to relax he threw aside his mask and breathed the freer for it once more he was a human being treading the streets of a real city his feet very much upon the earth his heart full of the simplest things all the scheming of the last few days was forgotten the great issues the fine yet devious way to be steered amidst the rocks which beset him even the depression of the calamitous news from the north sea passed away he was a very simple human being and he was in love it was all so unpractical so illusionary and yet so real events actual happeningshe thrust all thoughts of these away from his mind what she might be thinking of him at the moment he ignored he was content to let his thoughts rest upon her to walk through the moonlit street his brain and heart revelling in that subtle facility of the imagination which brought her so easily to his presence it was such a vividly real pamela too who spoke and walked and moved by his side his memory failed him nowhere followed faithfully the kaleidoscopic changes in her face and tone showed him even that long grateful searching glance when their eyes had met in von teyls sittingroom there had been times when she had shown clearly enough that she was anxious to understand anxious to believe in him he clung to the memory of these pushed into the background that faint impression he had had of her at the roofgarden serene and proud yet with a faint look of something like pain in her startled eyes  a large limousine passed him slowly crawling up fifth avenue lutchester with all his gifts of observation dormant took no notice of its occupant who leaned forward raised the speakingtube to his lips and talked for a moment to his chauffeur the car glided round a side street and came to a standstill against the curb its solitary passenger stepped quietly out and entered a restaurant the chauffeur backed the car a little slipped from his place and followed lutchester  by chance the little throng of people here became thicker for a few moments and then ceased lutchester drew a little sigh of relief as he saw before him almost an empty pavement then just as he was relapsing once more into thought some part of his subconscious instinct suddenly leaped into warning life without any actual perception of what it might mean he felt the thrill of imminent danger connected it with that soft footfall behind him and swung round in time to seize a deadly uplifted hand which seemed to end in a shimmer of dull steel his assailant flung himself upon lutchester with the lithe ferocity of a cat clinging to his body twisting and turning his arm to wrest it free it was a matter of seconds only before his intended victim with a fierce backward twist broke the mans wrist and wrenching himself free from the knees which clung around him flung him forcibly against the railings which bordered the pavement lutchester paused for a moment to recover his breath and looked around a man from the other side of the street was running towards them but no one else seemed to have noticed the struggle which had begun and finished in less than thirty seconds the man who was halfway across the thoroughfare suddenly stopped short he shouted a warning to lutchester who swung around his late assailant who had been lying motionless had raised himself slightly with a revolver clenched in his left hand lutchesters spring on one side saved his life for the bullet passed so close to his cheek that he felt the rush and heat of the air the man in the center of the road was busy shouting an alarm vociferously and other people on both sides of the thoroughfare were running up lutchesters eyes now never left the dark doubledup figure upon the pavement his whole body was tense he was prepared at the slightest movement to spring in upon his wouldbe murderer the mans eyes seemed to be burning in his white face he called out to lutchester hoarsely  dont move or i shall shoot  he looked up and down the street one of the nearest of the hastening figures was a policeman he turned the revolver against his own temple and pulled the trigger  lutchester and a policeman walked slowly back along fifth avenue behind them a little crowd was still gathered around the spot from which the body of the dead man had already been removed in an ambulance  i really remember nothing lutchester told his companion until i heard the footsteps behind me and turning round saw the knife this is simply an impression of minethat he might have descended from the car which passed me and stopped just round the corner of that street  hes a chauffeur right enough the inspector remarked it dont seem to have been a chance job either looks as though he meant doing you in got any enemies  none that i know of lutchester answered cautiously why the cars there still he added as they reached the corner  and no chauffeur the other muttered  the officer searched the car and drew out a license from the flap pocket the commissionaire from the restaurant approached them  say what are you doing with that car he demanded  better fetch the gentleman to whom it belongs the inspector directed  whats up anyway the man persisted  you do as youre told was the sharp reply  the commissionaire disappeared the officer studied the license which he had just opened  whats the name lutchester inquired  the man hesitated for a moment then passed it over  oscar h fischer he said happen to know the name  lutchesters face was immovable he passed the license back again they both turned round mr fischer had issued from the restaurant  whats wrong he asked hastily the commissionaire says you want me mr officer  the inspector produced his pocketbook  just want to ask you a few questions about your chauffeur sir  fischer glanced at the drivers seat of the car as though aware of the mans disappearance for the first time  whats become of the fellow he inquired  shot himself the inspector replied after a deliberate attempt to murder this gentleman  mr fischers composure was admirable there was a touch of gravity mingled with his bewilderment nevertheless he avoided meeting lutchesters eyes  you horrify me he exclaimed why the fellows only been driving for me for a few hours  that so the officer remarked with a grunt get any references with him  as a matter of fact i did not fischer admitted frankly i discharged my chauffeur yesterday at a moments notice and this man happened to call just as i was wanting the car out this afternoon he promised to bring me references tomorrow from mr gould and others i engaged him on that understanding he told me that his name was kay robert kay that is all that i know about him except that he was an excellent driver i am exceedingly sorry mr lutchester he went on turning towards him that this should have happened  so you two know one another eh the officer observed  oh yes we know one another lutchester admitted drily  i shall have to ask you both for your names and addresses the official continued i think i wont ask you any more questions at present seems to me headquarters had better take this on  i shall be quite at your service lutchester promised  the man made a few more notes saluted and took his leave fischer and lutchester remained for a moment upon the pavement  it is a dangerous custom lutchester remarked to take a servant without a reference  it will be a warning to me for the remainder of my life fischer declared  i too have learnt something lutchester concluded as he turned away     chapter xxvii   fischer as he waited for pamela the following afternoon in the sittingroom of her flat on fiftyeighth street felt that although the practical future of his life might be decided in other places it was here that its real climax would be reached pamela herself was to pronounce sentence upon him he was feeling scarcely at his best an examination in the courthouse which he had imagined would last only a few minutes had been protracted throughout the afternoon the district attorney had asked him a great many questions some rather awkward ones and the inquiry itself had been almost grudgingly adjourned for a few hours and here in pamelas sittingroom the first things which caught his eye were the headlines of one of the afternoon papers  western millionaire engages the girl hestes murderer as chauffeur  attempted murder and suicide in fifth avenue last night  fischer pushed the newspaper impatiently away and in the act of doing so the door was opened and pamela entered she came towards him with outstretched hand  i see you are looking at the account of your misdeeds she said as she seated herself behind a tea tray will you tell me why a cautious man like you engages without reference a chauffeur who turns out to be a murderer  fischer frowned irritably  for four hours he complained several lawyers and a most inquisitive police captain have been asking me the same question in a hundred different ways i engaged the man because i needed a chauffeur badly he was to have brought his references this morning i was only trusting him for a matter of a few hours  and during those few hours she observed he seems to have developed a violent antipathy to mr lutchester  i do not understand the affair at all mr fischer declared and if i may say so i am a little weary of it i came here to discuss another matter altogether  she leaned back in her place  what have you come to discuss mr fischer  that depends so much upon you he replied if you give me any encouragement i can put before you a great proposition if your prejudices however remain as i think they always have been on the side of england why then i can do nothing  if i counted for anything pamela said i mean to say if it mattered to any one what my attitude was i would start by admitting that my sympathies are somewhat on the side of the allies on the other hand my sympathies amount to nothing at all compared with my interest in the welfare of the united states i am perfectly selfish in that respect  then you have an open mind to hear what i have to say fischer remarked i am glad of it you encourage me to proceed  that is all very well pamela said stirring her tea but i cannot help asking once more why you come to me at all what have i to do with any proposition you may have to make  just this he explained i have a serious and authentic proposition to make to the american government i cannot make it officially although it comes from the highest of all sourcesfor the most obvious reasons it may seem better worth listening to today perhaps than a week ago so far as you are concerned that is because you believed in british invincibility upon the sea i never did  go on please pamela begged i am still waiting to realise my position in all this  i should like fischer declared my proposition to reach the president through senator hastings and senator hastings is your uncle  i see pamela murmured  my offer itself is a very simple one fischer continued your secret service is so bad that you probably know nothing of what is happening ours on the other hand is still marvellously good and what i am going to tell you is surely the truth japan is accumulating great wealth she is saving her ships and men for one purpose and one purpose only europe could not bribe her highly enough to take a more active part in this war her price was one which could not be paid she demanded a free hand with the united states  this pamela admitted is quite interesting but it is entirely in the realms of conjecture is it not  not wholly fischer insisted at the proper time i should be prepared to bring you evidence that tentative proposals were made by japan to both england and france asking what would be their attitude should she provide them with half a million men and undertake transport if at the conclusion of the war she desired a settlement with the united states the answer from france and england was the samethat they could not countenance an inimical attitude towards the states  you are bound to admit then pamela remarked that england played the game here  the bribe was not big enough fischer replied drily england would sell her soul but not for a mess of pottage to proceed however japan has practically kept out of the war she is enjoying a prosperity never known before and for every million pounds worth of munitions she exports to russia she puts calmly on one side twentyfive per cent to accumulate for her own use at the conclusion of the war she will be in a position she has never occupied before and while the rest of the world is still gasping she will proceed to carry out what has been the dream of her lifethe invasion of your western states  i admit that this is plausible pamela confessed but you are only pointing out a very obvious danger for which i imagine that we are already fairly well prepared  believe me fischer said earnestly you are not it is this fact which makes the whole situation so vital to you later on in our negotiations i will show you proof of your danger meanwhile let me proceed to the offer which i am empowered to make which comes direct from the one person in germany whose word is unshakable  pamela changed her position a little as though to escape from the sunlight which was finding its way underneath the broad blinds her eyes were fixed upon her visitor she listened intently to every word he had to say despite some vague feeling of mistrust which she acknowledged to herself might well have been prejudiced she found the situation interesting even stimulating her few excursions into the world of high politics had never brought her into such a position as this she felt both flattered and interestedattracted too in some nameless way by the mans personality his persistence his daring his wholeheartedness the situation was instinct with interest to her  but why make it to me she murmured  you are to be my delegate he answered take the substance of what i say to you to your uncle try for your countrys sake to interest him in it the offer which i make shall save you a vast amount of sacrifice it shall save your dislocating the industries of the country and sowing the seeds of a disturbing and yet inadequate militarism i offer you in short a german alliance against japan  the value of that offer pamela remarked thoughtfully would depend rather upon the issue of the present war wouldnt it  fischers face darkened his tone was almost irritable  that is already preordained he said firmly you see i will be quite frank with you germany has lost her chance of sweeping and complete victory the result of the war will be a return to the statusquoante yet believe me germany will be strong enough to settle some of the debts she owes and the debt to japan is one of these  still there is the practical question of getting men and ships over from germany to america pamela persisted  it is already solved was the swift reply at the proper time i will show you and prove how it can be done at present not one word can pass my lips it is one of the secrets on which the future of germany depends  and the price pamela asked  that america adopts our view as to the high seas traffic fischer replied this would mean the stopping of all supplies munitions and ammunition from america to england we offer you an alliance we ask only for your real and actual neutrality for the remainder of the war we offer a great and substantial advantage a safeguard for your countrys future in return for what simply that america will pursue the course of honour and integrity to all nations  america pamela declared has never failed in this  fischer shrugged his shoulders  there is more than one point of view he reminded her will you take my message with you to washington tomorrow  yes pamela promised i will do that the rest of course remains with others i do not myself go so far even she added as to declare myself in sympathy with you  and yet he insisted with swift violence it is your sympathy which i desire more than anything in the worldyour sympathy your help your companionship a littlea very little at firstof your love  i am afraid that i am not a very satisfactory person from that point of view pamela confessed i have a great sympathy with every man who is really out for the great things but so far as you are concerned mr fischer or any one else she went on after a moments hesitation i have no personal feeling  that shall come he declared  then please wait a little time before you talk to me again like this she said rising and holding out her hand at present there is no sign of it  there is so much that i could offer you he pleaded gripping the hand which she had given him in farewell so much that i could do for your country believe me i am not talking idly  i do believe that she admitted you are a very clever man mr fischer and i think that you represent all that you claim perhaps if we really do negotiate  but you must he interrupted impatiently you must listen to me for every reasonpolitically for your countrys sake personally because i shall offer you and give you happiness and a position you could never find elsewhere  for a moment her eyes seemed to be looking through him as though some vision of things outside the room were troubling her her finger had already touched the bell and a servant was standing upon the threshold  we shall meet in washington mr fischer concluded with an air of a prophet as he took his leave     chapter xxviii   it was within half an hour of closing time that same afternoon when lutchester walked into james van teyls office the young man greeted him with some surprise  will you do some business for me lutchester asked without any preliminaries  sure  how many anglofrench will you buy for me i can obtain credit by cable tomorrow through any bank for twenty or thirty thousand pounds  you want to buy anglofrench van teyl repeated softly  his visitor nodded  any news  lutchester hesitated and van teyl continued with an apologetic gesture  i beg your pardon thats not my job anyway to ask questions ill buy you twentyfive thousand if you like guess they cant drop much lower  lutchester sat down  thank you he said i will wait  a little ripple of excitement went through the office as van teyl started his negotiations it seemed to lutchester that several telephones and half a dozen perspiring young men were called into his service in the end van teyl made out a note and handed it to him  i could have done better for you yesterday he observed the market is strengthening all the time there are probably some rumours  a boy went by along the pavement outside waving a handful of papers his cry floated in through the open window  reported loss of many more german battleships british claim victory  van teyl grinned  you got here just in time he murmured but i suppose you knew all about this  i have known since three oclock lutchester replied that all the reports of a german victory were false you will find when the truth is known that the german losses were greater than the british  then if thats so van teyl remarked ive got one client wholl lose a hatful which you ought to make coming up town  i should like if i may lutchester said to be permitted to pay my respects to your sister  why thats fine van teyl exclaimed unconvincingly well take the subway up  they left the office and plunged into the indescribable horrors of their journey when they stepped out into the sunlit street in another atmosphere van teyl laid his hand upon his companions arm in friendly fashion  say lutchester he began i dont know that you are going to find pamela exactly all that she might be in the way of amiability and so on i know these things are done on the other side but here its considered trying your friends pretty high to take a lady of sonias reputation where you are likely to meet your friends no offence eh  certainly not lutchester replied i was sorry of course to see you last night on the other hand sonia is an old friend and my dinner with her had an object i think i could explain it to your sister  i dont know that i should try van teyl advised for all her cosmopolitanism pamela has some quaint ideas however i thought id warn you in case shes a bit awkward  pamela however had no idea of being awkward she welcomed lutchester with a very sweet smile and gave him the tips of her fingers  i was wondering whether we should see you again before we went she said we are leaving for washington tomorrow  by the three oclock train i hope he ventured  she raised her eyebrows  why are you going too  i hope so  i should have thought most of the munition works she observed were further north  they are he acknowledged but i have business in washington by the bye will you both come out and dine with me tonight  van teyl glanced at his sister she shook her head  i am so sorry she said but we are engaged perhaps we shall see something of you in washington  i have no doubt you will lutchester replied all the same he added it would give me very great pleasure to entertain you at dinner this evening  why particularly this evening she asked  he looked at her with a queer directness and pamela felt certain very excellent resolutions crumbling she suffered her brother to leave the room without a word  because he explained i think you will find a different atmosphere everywhere there will be news in the evening papers  news she repeated eagerly you know i am always interested in that  the reports of a german naval victory were not only exaggerated lutchester said calmly they were untrue our own official announcement was clumsy and tactless but you will find it amplified and explained tonight  pamela listened with an interest which bordered upon excitement  you are sure she exclaimed  absolutely he replied my notification is official  so you think if we dined with you the atmosphere tonight would be different she observed with a sudden attempt at the recondite  lutchester looked into her eyes without flinching pamela to her annoyance was worsted in the momentary duel  we cannot always choose our atmosphere he reminded her  mademoiselle sonia is perhaps connected with the regulation of the munition supplies from america  mademoiselle sonia lutchester asserted is an old friend of mine apart from that it was my business to talk to her  your business  lutchester assented with perfect gravity  within a day or two he said now if you made a point of it i could explain a great deal  pamela threw herself into a chair almost irritably  you have the cult of being mysterious mr lutchester she declared to be quite frank with you you seem to be the queerest mixture of any man i ever knew  it is the fault of circumstances he regretted if i am sometimes compelled to present myself to you in an unfavourable light those circumstances are passing you will soon begin to value me at my true worth  we had half promised pamela murmured to go out with mr fischer this evening  the more reason for my intervention lutchester observed fischer is not a fit person for you to associate with  she laughed curiously  people who saw you at the roofgarden last night might say that you were scarcely a judge pamela retorted  people who did not know the circumstances might have considered me guilty of an indiscretion lutchester admitted but they would have been entirely wrong on the other hand your friend fischer is a wouldbe murderer a liar and is at the present moment engaged in intrigues which are a most immoral compound of duplicity and cunning  i shall begin to think pamela murmured that you dont like mr fischer  i detest him heartily lutchester confessed  i find him singularly interesting pamela announced sitting up in her chair  i dare say you do lutchester replied women are always bad judges of our sex all the same you are not going to marry him  how do you know he wants to marry me pamela demanded  instinct  and what do you mean by saying that i am not going to marry him  because lutchester announced you are going to marry some one else  pamela rose to her feet there was a little spot of colour in her cheeks  am i indeed she exclaimed and whom pray  that i will tell you at washington lutchester promised  you know his name then  i know him intimately was the cool reply what about our dinner tonight  we are going to dine with mr fischer pamela decided  i really dont think so lutchester objected for one thing mr fischer will probably have to attend the police court again later on  what about  for having hired a famous murderer to try and get rid of me lutchester explained suavely  do you really believe that pamela scoffed why should he want to get rid of you what harm can you do him  i am trying to find out lutchester replied grimly still since you ask the question the pocketbook which is on its way to germany and which i picked up when nikasti was taken ill  oh yes i know about that pamela interrupted that is the one thing that always sets me thinking about you what did you do it for how did you know what it meant to me  divination i imagine lutchester answered or perhaps i was thinking what it might mean to mr fischer  she looked at him and her face was a study in mixed expressions her forehead was a little knitted her eyes almost strained in their desire to read him her lips were petulant  dear me what a puzzle you are she exclaimed all the same i am going to wait for mr fischer it doesnt matter whether one dines or sups i suppose he will get away from the police court sometime or other  but anyway he protested youve heard all that mr fischer has to say now i on the other hand havent shown you my hand yet  heard all that mr fischer has to say she repeated  certainly wasnt he here for several hours with you this afternoon didnt he promise you an alliance with germany against japan if you could persuade certain people at washington to change their tone and attitude towards the export of munitions  this she declared trying to keep a certain agitation from her tone is mere bluff  lutchester was suddenly very serious indeed  listen he said i can prove to you if you will that it is not bluff i can prove to you that i really know something of what i am talking about  there is nothing i should like better she declared  to begin with then lutchester said the pocketbook which nikasti is supposed to have stolen from your room the pocketbook of young sandy graham which mr fischer has sent to germany does not contain the formula of the new explosive or any other formula that amounts to anything  just how do you know that she demanded  to continue lutchester said playing with a little ornament upon the mantelpiece you have an appointmentwithin half an hour i believewith mr paul haskall who is a specialist in explosives having an official position with the american government  she had ceased to struggle any longer with her surprise she looked at him fixedly but remained silent  it is your belief he proceeded that you are going to hand over to him the formula of which we were speaking  it is no belief she replied it is certainty i took it myself from grahams pocket  lutchester nodded  good have you opened it  i have she declared it is without doubt the formula  on the other hand i am here to assure you that it is not lutchester replied  her hand was tearing at the cushion by her side she moistened her lips there was something about lutchester hatefully convincing  what do you mean she demanded is this a trick you wont get it no one but mr haskall will get that formula from me  lutchester smiled  it will only puzzle him when he gets it to tell you the truth the formula is rubbish  i dont believe you she said firmly if you think you are going to interfere with my handing it over to him you are mistaken  i have no wish to do anything of the sort lutchester assured her make a bargain with me mr haskall will be here soon unfasten the little package you are carrying somewhere about your person hand him the envelope and watch his face if he tells you that what you have offered him is a coherent and possible formula for an explosive then you can look upon me for ever afterwards as the poor foolish person you sometimes seem to consider me if on the other hand he tells you that it is rubbish i shall expect you at the ritzcarlton at halfpast eight  there was a ring at the bell she rose to her feet  i accept she declared that is mr haskall and by the bye mr lutchester dont order too elaborate a dinner for i am very much afraid you will have to eat it all yourself now au revoir she added as the door was opened in obedience to her summons and a servant stood prepared to show him out if we dont turn up tonight you will know the reason  i am very hopeful lutchester replied as he turned away     chapter xxix   at fiveandtwenty minutes past eight that evening lutchester who was waiting in the entrance hall of the ritzcarlton became just a little restless at halfpast his absorption in an evening paper over the top of which he looked at every newcomer was almost farcical at fiveandtwenty to nine pamela arrived he advanced down the lounge to meet her her face was inscrutable her smile conventional yet she had come he looked over his shoulder towards the mens coat room  your brother  i sent jim to his club she said i want to have a confidential talk with you mr lutchester  i am very flattered he told her with real earnestness  she vanished for a few moments in the cloakroom and reappeared a radiant vision in deep blue silk her hair was gathered in a coil at the top of her head and surmounted with an ornament of pearls  you are looking at my headdress she remarked as they walked into the room it is the style you admire is it not  he murmured something vague but he knew that he was forgiven they were ushered to their places by a portly maitre dhotel and she approved of his table it was set almost in an alcove and was partially hidden from the other diners  is this seclusion vanity or flattery  as a matter of fact it is rather a popular table he told her we have an excellent view of the room and yet one can talk here without being disturbed  to talk to you is exactly what i wish to do she said as they took their places we commence if you please with a question mr fischer thought that he had that formula and he hasnt i could have sworn that it was in my possessionand it isnt where is it  i took it to the war office before i left england he told her simply they will have the first few tons of the stuff ready next month  you she cried but where did you get it  i happened to be first thats all he explained you see i had the advantage of a little inside information i could have exposed the whole affair if i had thought it wise i preferred however to let matters take their course young graham deserved all he got there and i made sure of being the first to go through his papers im afraid i must confess that i left a bogus formula for you  i had begun to suspect this pamela confessed you dont mind being put into the witness box do you she added as she pushed aside the menu with a little sigh of satisfaction how wonderfully you order an american dinner  i am so glad i have chosen what you like he said and as to being in the witness boxwell i am going to place myself in the confessional and that is very much the same thing isnt it  to begin at the beginning thenabout that destroyer  my mission over here was really important he admitted i couldnt catch the lapland so the admiralty sent me over  and your golf with senator hamblin it wasnt altogether by accident you met him down at baltusrol was it  it was not he confessed i had reason to suspect that certain proposals from berlin were to be put forward to the president either through his or senator hastings mediation there were certain facts in connection with them which i desired to be the first to lay before the authorities  she looked around the room and recognised some of her friends for some reason or other she felt remarkably lighthearted  for a poor vanquished woman she observed turning back to lutchester i feel extraordinarily gay tonight tell me some more  he bowed  mademoiselle sonia he proceeded has been a friend of mine since she sang in the cafes of buda pesth i dined with her however because it had come to my knowledge that she was behaving in a very foolish manner  pamela nodded understandingly  she was the friend of count maurice ziduski wasnt she  she is no longer lutchester replied she sailed for france this morning without seeing him she has remembered that she is a frenchwoman  it was you who reminded her  love so easily makes people forgetful he said and i think that sonia was very fond of maurice ziduski she is a thoughtless passionate woman easily swayed through her affections and she had no idea of the evil she was doing  so that disposes of sonia pamela reflected  sonia was only an interlude lutchester declared she really doesnt come into this affair at all the one person who does come into it whom you and i must speak of is fischer  a most interesting man pamela sighed i really think his wife would have a most exciting life  she would lutchester agreed shed probably be allowed to visit him once every fourteen days in care of a warder  spite pamela exclaimed with a suspicious little quiver at the corner of her lips  lutchester shook his head  fischer is too near the end of his rope for me to feel spiteful he said though i am quite prepared to grant that he may be capable of considerable mischief yet a man who has the sublime effrontery to attempt to come to an agreement with two countries each behind the others back is a little more than machiavellian isnt he  is that true of mr fischer  absolutely lutchester assured her he is over here for the purpose of somehow or other making it known informally in washington that germany would be willing to pledge herself to an alliance with america against japan after the war if america will alter her views as to the export of munitions to the allies  well thats a reasonable proposition isnt it from his point of view pamela remarked it may not be a very agreeable one from yours but it is certainly one which he has a right to make  entirely lutchester agreed but where he goes wrong is that his primary object in coming here was to meet hie chief of the japanese secret service to whom he has made a proposition of precisely similar character  pamela set down her glass  you are not in earnest  absolutely  nikasti  precisely he came all the way from japan to confer with fischer probably if we knew the whole truth those rooms at the plaza hotel and the social partnership of your brother and fischer were arranged for no other reason than to provide a safe personality for nikasti in this country and a safe place for him to talk things over with fischer  mr fischer was paying nearly the whole of the expenses of the plaza suite pamela observed thoughtfully  naturally lutchester replied your brothers name was a good safe name to get behind but to conclude with our friend nikasti he is supposed to leave new york next saturday and to carry to the emperor of japan an autograph letter from a nameless person promising him if japan will cease the export of munitions to russia the aid of germany in her impending campaign against america  an autograph letter did you say pamela almost gasped  an autograph letter lutchester repeated firmly now dont you agree with me that fischers game is just a little too daring  it is preposterous she cried  i have a theory lutchester continued that fischer was never intended to use more than one of these letters it was intended that he should study the situation here approach one side and if unsuccessful try the other fischer however conceived a more magnificent idea he seems to be trying both at the same time it is the sublime egotism of the teutonic mind  it is monstrous pamela exclaimed indignantly  it is almost as monstrous lutchester agreed as his daring to raise his eyes to you although so far as you are concerned i believe that he is as honest as the man knows how to be  and why she asked do you credit him with so much good faith  because lutchester replied if he had not been actuated by personal motives he would never have sought you out as an intermediary there are other sources open to him by means of which he could make equally sure of reaching the presidents ear his idea was to impress you it was foolish but natural  pamela was deep in thought there was an angry spot of colour burning in her cheek  do you mean to tell me mr lutchester she persisted that this afternoon say when with every appearance of earnestness he was begging me to put these propositions before my uncle he had really made precisely similar overtures to japan  i give you my word that this is the truth lutchester assured her solemnly  she looked at him with something almost like wonder in her eyes  but you she exclaimed how do you know this how can you be sure of it  i have seen the autograph letter which nikasti has in his possession he announced  you mean that mr fischer showed it to you she exclaimed incredulously  lutchester hesitated  there are methods he said which those who fight in the dark places for their country are forced sometimes to make use of i have seen the letter i have half convinced those who represent japan in this matter of fischers duplicity with your help i am hoping wholly to do so  pamela leaned for a moment back in her chair  really she declared i am beginning to have the feeling that i am living almost too rapidly let us have a breathing spell i wonder what all these other people are talking about  probably he suggested with a little glance around about themselves we will follow their example will you marry me please miss van teyl  we havent even come to the ice yet she sighed and you pass from high politics to flagrant personalities are you a sensationalist mr lutchester  not in the least he protested i simply asked you an extremely important question quite calmly  it isnt a question that should be asked calmly she objected  i have immense selfcontrol he told her but if youd like me to abandon it  for heavens sake no she interrupted tell me more about mr fischer  you wont forget to answer my little question later on will you he begged to proceed then i spent some little time this afternoon with your chief of the police here and i fancy that the person you speak of is becoming a little too blatant even for a broadminded country like this he belongs to an informal company of wealthy sympathisers with germany who propose to start a campaign of destruction at all the factories manufacturing munitions for the allies they have put asidei believe it is several million dollars for purposes of bribery they dont seem to realise as my friend pointed out to me this afternoon that the days for this sort of thing in new york have passed some of them will be in prison before they know where they are  exactly why did you come to america she asked a little abruptly  to meet nikasti and to look after fischer  well you seem to have done that pretty effectually  also he went on calmly to keep an eye upon you  professionally  you ask me to give away too many secrets he whispered leaning towards her  she made a little grimace  tell me some more about your little adventure in fifth avenue she begged  he smiled grimly  you wouldnt believe me he reminded her but it really was one of fischers little jokes it very nearly came off too as a matter of fact he went on fischer isnt really clever he is too obstinate too convinced in his own mind that things must go the way he wants them to that fate is the servant of his will its a sort of national trait you know very much like the way we english bury our heads in the sand when we hear unpleasant truths the last thing fischer wants is advertisement and yet he goes to some of his fourteenth street friends and unearths a popular desperado to get rid of me the fellow happens most unexpectedly to fail and now fischer has to face a good many awkward questions and a good deal of notoriety no i dont think fischer is really clever  pamela sighed  in that case i suppose i shall have to say no to him she decided after waiting all this time i couldnt bear to be married to a fool  you wont be he assured her cheerfully  more british arrogance she murmured now see whats going to happen to us  a tall elderly man with smooth white hair plastered over his forehead very precisely dressed and with a gait so careful as to be almost mincing was approaching their table pamela held out her hands  my dear uncle she exclaimed and i thought that you and aunt never dined at restaurants  mr hastings stood with his fingers resting lightly upon the table he glanced at lutchester without apparent recognition  you remember mr lutchester pamela murmured  mr hastings manner lacked the true american cordiality but he hastened to extend his hand  of course he declared i was not fortunate enough however to see much of you the other evening mr lutchester we have several mutual friends whom i should be glad to hear about  i shall pay my respects to mrs hastings if i may very shortly lutchester promised  are you with friends here uncle pamela inquired  we are the guests of mr oscar fischer the senator announced  pamela raised her eyebrows  so you know mr fischer uncle  naturally mr hastings replied with some dignity oscar fischer is one of the most important men in the state which i represent he is a man of great wealth and industry and immense influence  pamela made a little grimace her uncle noticed it and frowned  he has just been telling us of his voyage with you pamela perhaps if mr lutchester can spare you he went on with a little bow across the table you will come and take your coffee with us your aunt is leaving for washington probably tomorrow and wishes to arrange for you to travel with her mr lutchester may also perhaps give us the pleasure of his company for a few minutes he added after a slight but obvious pause  thank you pamela answered quickly i am mr lutchesters guest this evening if you are still here i shall love to come and speak to aunt for a moment later on if not i will ring up tomorrow morning  the bland almost episcopal serenity of senator hastings face was somewhat disturbed it was obvious that the situation displeased him  i think pamela he said that you had better come and speak to your aunt before you leave  his bow to lutchester was the bow of a politician to an adversary he made his way back in leisurely fashion to the table from which he had come exchanging a few words with many acquaintances pamela watched him with a twinkle in her eyes  i am becoming so unpopular she murmured i can read in my uncles tone that my aunt and he disapprove of our dining together here and as for mr fischer im afraid hell break off our prospective alliance  lutchester smiled  prospective is the only word to use he observed by the bye are you particularly fond of your uncle  not riotously she admitted he has been kind to me once or twice but hes rather a starchy old person  in that case lutchester decided we wont interfere     chapter xxx   fischer had by no means the appearance of a discomfited man that evening when some time later pamela and lutchester approached the little group of which he seemed somehow to have become the central figure it was a small party but in its way a distinguished one pamelas aunt was a member of an historic american family and a woman of great social position not only in new york but in washington itself of the remaining guests one was a financial magnate of worldwide fame and the other senator joyce a politician of such eminence that his name was freely mentioned as a possible future president mrs hastings greeted pamela and her escort without enthusiasm  my dear child she exclaimed how extraordinary to find you here  is it pamela observed indifferently you know mr lutchester dont you aunt  mrs hastings remembered her late dinner guest but her recognition was icy and barely polite she turned away at once and resumed her conversation with fischer lutchester was not introduced to either of the other members of the party he laid his hand on the back of an empty chair and turned it round for pamela but she stopped him with a word of thanks something had gone from her own naturally pleasant tone she held her hand higher even than her aunts as she turned a little insistently towards her  so sorry aunt she announced but we are going now good night  mrs hastings disapproved  we have seen nothing of you yet pamela she said stiffly you had better stay with us and we will drop you on our way home  pamela shook her head  i am coming with you tomorrow you know she reminded her aunt tonight i am mr lutchesters guest and he will see me home  mrs hastings drew her niece a little closer to her  is this part of your european manners pamela she whispered that you dine alone in a restaurant with an acquaintance let me tell you frankly that i dislike the idea most heartily my chaperonage is always at your service and any girl of your age in america would be delighted to avail herself of it  it is very kind of you aunt pamela replied but in a general way i finished with chaperons long ago  where is jimmy mrs hastings inquired  he was coming with us tonight pamela explained but i asked him particularly to stay away i have seen so little of mr lutchester since he arrived and i want to talk to him  the financial magnate awoke from a comatose inertia and suddenly gripped lutchester by the hand  lutchester he repeated to himself i thought i knew your face stayed with your uncle down at monte carlo once you came there for a week  lutchester acknowledged his recollection of the fact and the two men exchanged a few commonplace remarks mrs hastings took the opportunity to try and induce pamela to converse with fischer  we have all been so interested tonight she said in hearing what mr fischer has to say about the situation on the other side  pamela was primed for combat  has mr fischer been telling you fairy tales she laughed  fairy tales her aunt repeated severely i dont understand  fischers steel grey eyes flashed behind his spectacles  im afraid that miss van teyls prejudices he observed bitterly are very firmly fixed  then she is no true american mrs hastings pronounced didactically  oh i can assure you that i am not prejudiced pamela declared only you see i too have just arrived from the other side and i have been able to use my own eyes and judgment if there is any prejudice in the matter why should it not come from mr fischer he has the very good excuse of his german birth  mr fischer is an american citizen mrs hastings reminded her niece and personally i think that the american of german birth is one of the most loyal and longsuffering persons i know i cannot say as much for the english people who are living over here and as to fairy stories  pamela intervened turning towards fischer with a little laugh  oh he cant even deny those what about the great german victory in the north sea mr fischer do you happen to have seen the latest telegrams  our first reports were perhaps a little too glowing mr fischer acknowledged that under the circumstances is i think only natural but the facts remain that the invincible english and the untried german fleets have met to the advantage of the german  pamela shook her head  i cannot even allow that she objected the advantage if there was any rested on the other side but i just want you to remember what we were told in that first wonderful outpouring of fabricated newsthat the naval supremacy of england was gone for ever that the freedom of the seas was assured that german merchant vessels were steaming home from all directions no mr fischer between ourselves i think that your cause needs a few fairy stories and i look upon you as one of the greatest experts in the world when it comes to concocting them  fischer who had risen to his feet half way through pamelas speech was obviously a little taken aback by her direct attack mrs hastings took no pains to conceal her annoyance  for a young girl of your age pamela she said sternly i consider that you express your opinions far too freely your attitude too is unjustifiable  ah well you see i am a little prejudiced against mr fischer pamela laughed turning towards him he happened to defeat one of my pet schemes  but i am ready to further your dearest one he reminded her dropping his voice and leading her a little on one side what about our alliance  you scarcely need my aid she observed with a shrug of the shoulders  he remonstrated vigorously there was a revived hopefulness in his tone perhaps after all here was the secret of her displeasure with him  you wonder perhaps to see me with your uncle i give you my word that it is a dinner of courtesy only i give you my word that i have not opened my lips on political matters i have been waiting for your answer  i have lost faith in you she told him calmly i am not even certain that you possess the authority you spoke of  if that is all he replied eagerly you shall see it with your own eyes you are staying with your uncle and aunt in washington are you not i shall call upon you immediately i arrive and bring it with me  she nodded  well that remains a challenge then mr fischer and now if you are quite ready she added turning to lutchester goodby everybody  arent your ears burning pamela asked after lutchester had handed her into a taxicab and taken his place by her side i can absolutely feel them talking about us  i seem to be most regrettably unpopular lutchester remarked  even now i am puzzled about that pamela confessed but you see my aunt considers herself the arbitress of what is right or wrong in social matters and she is exceedingly narrowminded in her eyes it is no doubt a greater misdemeanour for me to have dined at the ritzcarlton alone with you than if i had conspired against the government  and this i thought was the land of freedom for your sex  ah but my aunt is rather an exception pamela reminded him the one thing i cannot understand however is that she should have allowed herself to be seen dining with mr oscar fischer at the ritzcarlton i should have thought that would have been almost as heinous to her as my own little slip from grace  is your aunt by way of being interested in politics lutchester inquired  not in a general way pamela replied but she is intensely ambitious and shed give her soul if uncle theodore could get a nomination for the presidency  perhaps she is taking up the germanamerican cause then lutchester suggested it is a possible platform at any rate  i foresee a new party pamela murmured thoughtfully now i come to think of it mr elsworthy the fat old gentleman who knew your uncle is very progerman  he leaned towards her  we have had enough politics he insisted there is the other thing couldnt i have my answer  she let him take her fingers in the cool darkness through which they were rushing her face seemed white her head was a little averted he tried to draw her to him but she was unyielding  please not she begged i like youand im glad i like you she added but i dont feel certain about anything couldnt we be just friends a little longer  it must be as you say but i am horribly in love with you he confessed that may sound rather a bald way of saying so but its the truth pamela dear  his clasp upon her fingers was tightened she turned towards him her expression was serious but delightful  well let me tell you this much at least she confided i have never before in my life been so glad to hear any one say so and here we are at home and theres jimmy on the doorstep what is it jimmy she asked waving her hand  he came down towards her in a state of great excitement  say weve had to open up the office again he exclaimed the telegrams are rolling in now that socalled german naval victory was a fake the britishers came out right on top you know you stand to net at least half a million mr lutchester the worst of it is i have another client whos going to lose it  pamela shook her head at lutchester  the possibility of increased responsibilities he whispered a married man needs something to fall back upon     chapter xxxi   the offices of messrs neville brooks and van teyl were the scene of something like pandemonium van teyl himself bathed in perspiration rushed into his room for the twentieth time he almost flung the newspaper man who was waiting for him through the door  no we dont know a darned thing he declared weve no special information the only reason were up to our neck in anglofrench is because weve two big clients dealing  its just a few personal notes about those clients wed like to handle  oh get out as quick as you can van teyl snapped this isnt a bucket shop or a pool room the names of our clients concerns ourselves only  what do you think anglofrench are going to do mr van teyl  i cant tell was the prompt answer but i can tell whats going to happen if you dont clear out  the newspaper man took a hurried leave van teyl seized the telephone receiver only to put it down with a little shout of relief as the door opened and lutchester entered  thank god he exclaimed why ive been ringing you up for an hour and a half  sorry lutchester replied i was down at the barbers the first time you got through and then i had some cables to send off  look here van teyl continued gripping him by the shoulder is six hundred and forty thousand dollars or thereabouts profit enough for you on your anglofrench  it sounds adequate lutchester confessed laying his hat and cane carefully upon the table and drawing up an easychair how much is mr fischer going to lose  god knows if you allow me to sell at the present moment youll ease the market and hell lose about what you make  and if i decide to hold my anglofrench  youll have to provide us with about a couple of million dollars van teyl replied and i should think you would pretty well break fischer for a time frankly hes an important client and we dont want him broken even temporarily  what do you want me to do then  give us authority to sell van teyl begged cant you hear them yapping about in the office outside theyre round me all the time like a pack of hounds honestly if i dont sell some anglofrench before lunchtime today they look like wrecking the office  lutchester knocked the end of a cigarette thoughtfully against the side of his chair  all right he decided i dont want you to suffer any inconvenience besides i am going to washington this afternoon you can keep on selling as long as the markets steady directly it sags hold off if necessary even buy a few more you understand me dont sell a single block under todays price keep the market at that figure its an easy job because next week anglofrench will go up again  van teyl was moved to a rare flash of admiration  youre a cool hand lutchester he declared considering youre not a business man  fischers the man wholl need to keep cool lutchester remarked lighting his cigarette what about a little lunch  the stockbroker scarcely heard him he had struck a bell and the office seemed suddenly filled with clerks van teyls words were incoherenta string of strange directions punctuated by slang which was so far as lutchester was concerned unintelligible the whole place seemed to wake into a clamour of telephone bells shouts the clanging and opening of the lift gates and the hurried tramp of footsteps in the corridors outside lutchester rose to his feet he was looking very comfortable and matteroffact in his grey tweed suit and soft felt hat  perhaps he observed pleasantly i am out of place here drop me a line and let me know how things are going to the hotel capitol at washington  thats all right van teyl promised ill get you on the longdistance phone i was coming myself with pamela for a few days but this little deal of yours has set things buzzing say whos that  the door opened and fischer paused upon the threshold certainly of all the people concerned the two speculators themselves seemed the least moved by the excitement they were causing fischer was dressed with his usual spickandspan neatness and his appearance betrayed no sign of flurry or excitement he nodded grimly to lutchester  my congratulations he said you seem to have rigged the press here to some purpose  lutchester raised his eyebrows  i dont even know a newspaper man in new york he declared  the newcomer gave vent to a little gesture of derision  then youve some very clever friends youd better make the most of their offices the german version of the naval battle will be confirmed and amplified within twentyfour hours and then your anglofrench will touch mud  if that is your idea lutchester remarked suavely why buy now why not wait till next week come he went on i will have a little flutter with you if you like fischer i will bet you five thousand dollars and van teyl here shall hold the stakes that a week hence today anglofrench stand higher than they do at this moment  fischer hesitated then he turned away  i am not a sportsman mr lutchester he said  lutchester brushed away a little dust from his coat sleeve  no he murmured i agree with you good morning  lutchester walked out into the sunbaked streets and with his absence fischer abandoned his almost unnatural calm he strode up and down the room fuming with rage at every fresh click of the tape machine he snatched at the printed slip eagerly and threw it away with an oath no one took any notice of him van teyl rushed in and out telephones clanged perspiring clerks dashed in with copies of contracts to add to the small pile upon the desk there came a quiet moment presently van teyl wiped the perspiration from his forehead and drank a tumblerful of water  fischer he asked what made you go into this so big you must have known there was always the risk of your wireless report beating it up a little too tall  it wasnt our report at all that i went by fischer confessed gloomily it was the english admiralty announcement that did it can you conceive he went on striking the table with his fist any nation at war with a grain of common sense or an ounce of selfrespect issuing a statement like thatan apology for a defeat which damn it all never happened say the thing was a drawn battle which is about what it really was it didnt suit the germans to fight it to a finish theyd everything to lose and little to gain so in effect they left the britishers there and passed back behind their own minefield so far as regards reports that was victory enough for any one except those muddleheaded civilians at whitehall they deceived the world with that infernal bulletin and incidentally me it was on that statement i gave you my orders not on ours  its a damned unfortunate business van teyl sighed youre only half way out yet and its cost you nearly three hundred thousand  a dull spot of purple colour burned in fischers cheeks his upper lip was drawn in his appearance for a moment was repulsive  it isnt the money i mind he muttered its lutchester  van teyl was discreetly silent fischer seemed to read his thoughts he leaned across the table  a wonderful fellow your friend lutchester he sneered an admirable crichton of finance and diplomacy and lovemaking eh but the end isnt just yet i promise you one thing james van teyl he isnt going to marry your sister  id a damned sight sooner she married him than you van teyl blazed out  fischer was taken aback he had held for so long the upper hand with this young man that for the moment he had forgotten that circumstances were changed between them van teyl rose to his feet the bonds of the last few months had snapped he spoke like a free man  look here fischer he said youve had me practically in your power for the best part of a year but now im through with you im out of your debt no thanks to you and im going to keep out i am working on your business as hard as though you were my own brother and ill go on doing it ill get you out of this mess as well as i can and after that you can take your damned business where you please  so thats it is it fischer scoffed a rich brotherinlaw coming along eh  no dont do that stepping quickly backwards as van teyls fist shot out  then keep my sisters name out of this conversation van teyl insisted if you are wise youll clear out altogether theyre at it again  fischer however glanced at the clock and remained at the next lull he hung down the tape and turned to his companion  say theres no use quarrelling james he declared im going to leave you to it now guess i said a little more than i meant to but i tell you i hate that fellow lutchester i hate him just as though i were the typical german and he were the typical britisher and there was nothing but a sea of hate between us shake hands jim  van teyl obeyed without enthusiasm fischer drew a chair to the table and wrote out a cheque which he passed across  ill drop into the bank and let them know about this he said you can make up accounts and let me hear how the balance stands ill wipe it out by return whatever it is  fischer passed out of the offices a few minutes later followed by many curious eyes and stepped into his automobile a young man who had brushed against him pushed a note into his hand fischer opened it as his car swung slowly through the traffic  guards at all connecticut factories doubled ohagan caught last night in precincts of small arms factory was taken alive disobeying orders be careful  fischer tore the note into small pieces his face was grimmer than ever as he leaned back amongst the cushions there were evil things awaiting him outside wall street     chapter xxxii   lutchester breathed the air of washington and felt almost homesick the stateliness of the city its sedate and quiescent air after the turmoil of new york impressed him profoundly everywhere its diplomatic associations made themselves felt congress was in session and the faces of the men whom he met continually in the hotels and restaurants seemed to him some index of the world power which flung its farreaching arms from beneath the capitol dome  one afternoon a few days after his arrival he called at the hastings house a great colonial mansion within a stones throw of his own headquarters the mention of his name however seemed to chill all the hospitality out of the smiling face of the southern butler who answered his ring miss van teyl was out and from the mans manner it was obvious that miss van teyl would continue to be out for a very long time lutchester retraced his steps to the british embassy where he had spent most of the morning and made his way to the sittingroom of one of the secretaries the honourable philip downing who was eagerly waiting for a cable recalling him to take up a promised commission welcomed him heartily  things are slack here today old fellow lets go out to the country club and have a few sets of tennis or a game of golf whichever you prefer he suggested ive done my little lot till the evening  show on tonight isnt there lutchester inquired  just a reception youre going to put in an appearance  i fancy so have you got your list of guests handy  the young man dived into a drawer and produced a few typewritten sheets  alphabetical list of acceptances with here and there a few personal notes he pointed out with an air of selfsatisfaction i go through this list with the chief while hes changing for dinner  lutchester ran his forefinger down the list  senator theodore and mrs hastings he quoted by the bye they have a niece staying with them  want a card for her the honourable philip inquired with a grin  i should like it sent off this moment lutchester replied  the young man took a square giltedged card from a drawer by his side filled it out at lutchesters dictation rang the bell and dispatched it by special messenger  ive got my little buzzer outside he observed well make tracks for the club if youre ready  the two men played several sets of tennis and afterwards lounged in two wicker chairs underneath a gigantic plane tree in a corner of the lawn the place was crowded and philip downing was an excellent showman  washington he explained has never been so divided into opposite camps and this is almost the only common meeting ground every one has to come here of course the german staff play tennis and the austrians all go in for polo here comes ziduski hes most fearfully popular with the ladies heredoes us a lot of harm they say hes a great sticker for etiquette he used to nod and call me phil now you watch hell bow from his waist as though he had corsets on as a matter of fact hes a good sportsman  count ziduskis bow was stiff enough but his intention was obvious he stopped before the two men exchanged a somewhat stilted greeting with philip downing and turned to lutchester  i believe he said that i have the honour of addressing mr lutchester  lutchester rose to his feet  that is my name he admitted  we have met in rome i think and in paris the count reminded him if i might beg for the favour of a few moments conversation with you  the two men strolled away together the count plunged at once into the middle of things  it is you sir i believe whom i have to thank for the abrupt departure of mademoiselle sonia from new york  quite true lutchester admitted  under different circumstances the count proceeded i might regard such interference in my affairs in a different manner here of course that is impossible i speak to you out of regard for the lady in question you appear in some mysterious manner to have discovered the fact that she was in the habit of bringing entirely unimportant and nonpolitical messages from dear friends in france  mademoiselle sonia lutchester said calmly had for a brief space of time forgotten herself she was engaged in carrying out espionage work on your behalf i believe i may say that she will do so no more  the count was a man of medium height thin with complexion absolutely colourless and deepset tired eyes at this moment however he seemed endowed with the spirit of a new virility the cane which he grasped might have been a dagger his smooth tones nursed a threat  mr lutchester he declared if harm should come to her through your information i swear to god that you shall pay  lutchesters manner was mild and unprovocative  count he replied we make no war upon women sonia has repented and the knowledge which i have of her misdeeds will be shared by no one she has gone back to her country to work for the red cross there so far as i am concerned that is the end  the two men walked a few steps further in unbroken silence then the count raised his hat  mr lutchester he said yours is the reply of an honourable enemy i might have trusted you but sonia is half of my life i offer you my thanks  he strolled away and lutchester rejoined his young friend  the lion and the lamb seem to have parted safely the latter exclaimed now sit by my side and i will show you interesting things those four irreproachable young men over there in tennis flannels are all from the german embassy the two elder ones behind are austrians all those women are the wives of senators who sympathise with germany their husbands look like it dont they today they have an addition to their ranksthe thin elderly man there whose clothes were evidently made in london thats senator hastings he is a personal friend of the president jove what a beautiful girl with mrs hastings  that lutchester told him is the young lady to whom you have just sent a card of invitation for tonight  then heres hoping that she comes philip downing observed finishing his glass of mint julep is she a pal of yours  yes i know her lutchester admitted  lets go and butt in then downing suggested i love breaking up these little gatherings youll see them all stiffen when we come near i hope they havent got hold of hastings though  the two men rose to their feet and crossed the lawn fischer who had suddenly appeared in the background whispered something in mrs hastings ear she swung around to pamela a second too late pamela with a word of excuse to the young man with whom she was talking stepped away from the circle and held out her hand to lutchester  so you have really come to washington she exclaimed  as a rescuer lutchester replied i feel that i have a mission we cannot afford to lose your sympathies may i introduce philip downing  pamela shook hands with the young man and took her place between them  ive been envying you your seat under the tree she said couldnt we go there for a few moments  mrs hastings detached herself and approached them she received philip downings bow cordially and she was almost civil to lutchester  i cant have my niece taken away she protested we are just going in to tea pamela  pamela shook her head  i am going to sit under that tree with mr lutchester and mr downing she declared tea doesnt attract me in the least and that tree does  mrs hastings accepted defeat with a somewhat cynical gracefulness she closed her lorgnette with a little snap  you leave us all desolated my dear pamela she said you remind me of what your poor dear father used to sayalmost any one could live with pamela if she always had her own way  pamela laughed as she strolled across the lawn  arent ones relatives trying she murmured     chapter xxxiii   philip downing very soon justified the profession to which he belonged by strolling off with some excuse about paying his respects to some acquaintances pamela and lutchester immediately dropped the somewhat frivolous tone of their conversation  you know that things are moving with our friend fischer she began  i gathered so lutchester assented  his scheme is growing into shape she went on you know what wonderful people his friends are for organising well they are going to start a society all through the states and nominate for its presidentuncle theodore  will they have any show at all lutchester asked curiously  she shrugged her shoulders  who can tell the germanamericans are very powerful indeed all through the west and then the pacifists will join them you see i believe that although the soul of the country is with the allies england is the most tactless country in the world she is always giving little pinpricks to the government over here either about maritime law or one thing or another then all those articles in the papers about america being too proud to fight the sneering tone of some even of the leading reviews did a lot of harm uncle theodore is going to stand for what they call the true neutrality that is to say no munitions no help for either side  well i dont know anything about american politics lutchester confessed but i shouldnt think hed have an earthly chance  money is immensely powerful she went on reflectively and many of the great money interests of the country are controlled by germanamericans mr fischer has almost thrown me over politically but uncle theodore is crazy about the idea of a german pledge to protect america against japan that is going to be the great argument which he will keep up his sleeve until after the nomination  fischers trump card lutchester observed he hasnt shown you a certain autograph letter yet i suppose  she shook her head  he may have shown it to uncle theodore im afraid he doesnt mean to approach me again he seems to have completely changed his attitude towards me since the night he saw us at the ritzcarlton dining together he was going to show me the letter the first day after his arrival in washington instead of that he has been in the house for hours at a time without making the slightest attempt to see me  faithless fellow lutchester murmured nothing like an englishman after all for absolute fidelity  do you really think so pamela inquired anxiously do you think i should be safe in trusting my heart and future to an englishman  to one particular englishman yes was the firm reply i was rather hoping you might have made up your mind  too many things to think about she laughed how long are you going to stay in washington  a few hours or days or weeksuntil i have finished the work that brought me here  and what exactly is that  you ask me lightly he replied but if you are willing i have decided to take you into my confidence our friend nikasti will be here tomorrow he was to have sailed for japan yesterday but he has postponed his voyage for a few days do you know much about the japanese miss pamela  very little she acknowledged  well i will tell you one thing they are not very good at forgiving there was only one way i could deal with nikasti in new york and it was a brutal way i have seen him twice since he wouldnt look me in the eyes i know what that means he hates me in a sense i dont believe he would allow that to interfere in any way with his mission in another sense it would the allies above all things have need of japan we want japan and america to be friends we dont want germany butting in between the two baron yung is a very clever man but he is even more impenetrable than his countrymen generally are our people here admit that they find it difficult to progress with him very far they believe that secretly he is in sympathy with nikastis reports but you dont know about those i suppose  i dont think i do she admitted  nikasti was sent to england some years ago to report upon us as a country japan at that time was meditating an alliance with one of the great european powers obviously it must be germany or england nikasti travelled all through england studied our social life measured our weaknesses did the same through germany returned to japan and gave his vote in favour of germany i have even seen a copy of his report he laid great stress upon the absolute devotion to sport of our young men and the entire absence of any patriotic sentiment or any means of national defence well as you know for various reasons his counsels were overridden and japan chose the british alliance that was entirely the fault of imperfect german diplomacy at a time like this though i cannot help thinking that some elements of his former distrust still remain in nikastis mind and i have an idea that baron yung is to a certain extent a sympathiser ive got to get at the bottom of this before i leave the states if i need your help will you give it me  if i can she promised  they saw mrs hastings figure on the terrace waving and pamela rose reluctantly to her feet  i dont suppose lutchester continued as they strolled across the lawn that you have very much influence with your uncle or that he would listen very much to anything that you have to say but if he is really in earnest about this thing he is going to play a terribly dangerous game as things are at present he has a very pleasant and responsible position as the supporter and friend of very able men with regard to this new movement he may find the whole ground crumble away beneath his feet fischer is playing the game of a madman it isnt only political defeat that might come to him but disgraceeven dishonour  you frighten me pamela confessed gravely  lutchester sighed  your uncle he went on is one of those thoroughly conceited egotistical men who will probably listen to no one you see i have found out a little about him already but they tell me that her social position means a great deal to your aunt neither her birth nor her friends could save her if fischer drags your uncle to his chariot wheels  do you think perhaps that you underestimate mr fischers position over here she asked thoughtfully  i dont think i do he replied but here is something which you have scarcely appreciated fischer has had the effrontery to link himself up with a little crowd of germans all through the states who are making organised attempts to destroy the factories where ammunitions are being made for the allies that sort of thing you know would bring any one however distantly connected with it to sing sing one moment he added quickly as mrs hastings stepped forward to meet them the reception at the british embassy tonight  the others are going she said my aunt didnt feel she was sufficiently  we sent you a card round especially this afternoon lutchester interrupted youll come  how nice of you of course i will she promised     chapter xxxiv   small affair this downing observed as he piloted lutchester through the stately reception rooms of the embassy you see we are all living a sort of touchy life here nowadays we try to be civil to any of the german or austrian lot when we meet but of course they dont come to our functions and every now and then some of those plaguey neutrals get the needle and they dont come so we never know quite where we are guadopolis has been avoiding us lately and i hear he was seen out at the lakewood country club with count reszka the rumanian minister a few days ago gave the chief quite a little flurry that did  theres an idea over in london lutchester remarked that a good deal of the war is being shaped in washington nowadays  that is the chiefs notion downing assented i know hes pining to talk to you so well go and do the dutiful  lutchester was welcomed as an old friend by both the ambassador and his wife the former drew him to a divan from which he could watch the entrance to the rooms and sat by his side  i am glad they sent you out lutchester he said earnestly if ever a country needed watching by a man with intelligence and experience this one does today  do you happen to know that fellow oscar fischer lutchester asked  i do and i consider him one of the most dangerous people in the states for us the ambassador declared he has a great following huge wealth and although he is not a man of culture he doesnt go about his job in that bullheaded way that most of them do  hes trying things on with japan lutchester observed i think i shall manage to checkmate him there all right but theres another scheme afloat that i dont follow so closely you know senator hastings i suppose  the ambassador nodded  senator theodore hastings he repeated thoughtfully yes hes rather a dark horse he is supposed to be the presidents bosom friend but i hear whispers that hed give his soul for a nomination adopt any cause or fight any ones battle  thats my own idea of him lutchester replied and i think you will find him in the field with a pretty definite platform before long  you think hes mixed up with fischer the ambassador inquired  im sure he is lutchester assented not only that but they have something up their sleeve i think i can guess what it is but im not sure how have things seemed to you here lately  to tell you the truth i havent liked the look of them the ambassador confided theres something afoot and i cant be sure what it is look at the crowd tonight of course all the americans are here but the diplomatic attendance has never been so thin the rumanian minister and his wife the italian the spanish and the swedish representatives are all absent i have just heard too that baron von schwerin is giving a dinnerparty  lutchester looked thoughtfully at the little stream of people the ambassador left him for a few moments to welcome some late comers he returned presently and resumed his seat by lutchesters side  of course he continued lowering his voice all formal communications between us and the enemy embassies have ceased but it has come to be an understood thing to avoid embarrassments to our mutual friends that we do not hold functions on the same day i heard that von schwerin was giving this dinnerparty so i sent round this morning to inquire the reply was that it was entirely a private one one of our youngsters brought us in a list of the guests a short time ago i see hastings is one of them and fischer and rumania and greece will be represented now hastings was to have been here and as a rule the neutrals are very punctilious  i suppose the way that naval affair was represented didnt do us any good lutchester observed  it did us harm without a doubt was the lugubrious admission still fortunately these people over here are clever enough to understand our idiosyncrasies i honestly think wed rather whine about a defeat than glory in a victory  diplomatically too lutchester remarked thoughtfully i should have said that things seemed all right here the president comes in for a great deal of abuse in some countries personally i think he has been wonderful  the ambassador nodded  you and i both know lutchester he said that the last thing we want is to find america dragged into this war such a happening would be nothing more nor less than a catastrophe in itself to say nothing of the internal dissensions here on the other hand as things are now washington is becoming a perfect arena for diplomatic chicanery and i have just an instincti cant define it in any waywhich leads me to believe that some fresh trouble has started within the last twentyfour hours  lady ridlingshawe motioned to her husband with her fan and he rose at once to his feet  i must leave you to look after yourself for a time lutchester he concluded youll find plenty of people here you know dont go until youve seen me again  lutchester wandered off in search of pamela he found her with mrs hastings surrounded by a little crowd of acquaintances pamela waved her fan and they made way for him  mr lutchester i have been looking everywhere for you she exclaimed what a secretive person you are why couldnt you tell me that lady ridlingshawe was your cousin i want you to take me to her please i met her sister out in nice  she laid her fingers upon his arm and they passed out of the little circle  all bluff of course she murmured find the quietest place you can i want to talk to you  they wandered out on to a balcony where some of the younger people were taking ices she leaned over the wooden rail  listen she said i adore this atmosphere and i am perfectly certain there is something going onsomething exciting i mean you know that the baron von schwerin has a dinnerparty  i know that he assented  uncle theodore is going with mr fischer he was invited at the last moment and i understand that his presence was specially requested  lutchester stood for a short time in an absorbed and sombre silence in the deep blue twilight his face seemed to have fallen into sterner lines without a doubt he was disturbed pamela looked at him anxiously  is anything the matter she asked  he shook his head  nothing definite only for the last few hours i have felt that things here are reaching a crisis there is something going on around us something which seems to fill fischer and his friends with confidence something which i dont quite understand and which it is my business to understand that is really what is worrying me  she nodded sympathetically and glanced around for a moment  let me tell you something she whispered this evening my uncle came into my room just before dinner there is a little safe built in the wall for jewellery he begged for the loan of it his library safe he said was out of order i couldnt see what he put in but when he had closed the door he stood looking at it for a moment curiously i made some jesting remark about its being a treasure chest but he answered me seriously you are going to sleep tonight pamela he said within a few yards of a dozen or so of written words which will change the worlds history  lutchester was listening intently there was a prolonged pause  well he asked at last  she glanced at the little yale key which hung from her bracelet  nothing i was just wondering how i should be able to sleep through the night without opening the safe  but surely your uncle didnt give you the key  she shook her head  i dont suppose he knows i have such a thing she replied he has a masterkey himself to all the safes which he used this is one the housekeeper gave me as soon as i arrived  lutchester looked out into the darkness  tell me he inquired is that your housethe next one to this  thats the old hastings house she assented they are all family mansions along here  it looks an easy place to burgle he remarked  she laughed quietly  i should think it would be she admitted there are any quantity of downstair windows we dont have burglaries in washington though certainly not this side of the city  a little bevy of young people had found their way into the gardens lutchester waited until they had passed out of earshot before he spoke again  i have reason to believe he continued that in the course of their negotiations fischer has deposited with your uncle a certain autograph letter of which we have already spoken making definite proposals to america if she will change her attitude on the neutrality question  the written words pamela murmured  lutchesters hand suddenly closed upon her wrist she was surprised to find his fingers so cold yet marvellously tenacious  you are going to lose that key and i am going to find it he said quietly i am sorrybut you must  i am going to do nothing of the sort pamela objected  his fingers remained like a cold vice upon her wrist she made no effort to draw it away  listen he said do you believe that the hastingscumfischer party is going to be the best thing that could happen for america  i certainly do not she admitted  then do as i beg let me take that key from your bracelet you shall have no other responsibility  and what are you going to do with it  you must leave that to me he answered i will tell you as much as i can i stopped nikasti sailing for japan but i made a mortal enemy of him at the same time he has come to washington to consult with his ambassador they are together tonight it is my mission to convince them of germanys duplicity  i see and you think that these written words  give the key to me he begged and ask no questions  she shook her head  i should object most strongly to nocturnal disturbers of my slumbers  it seemed to her that his frame had become tenser his tone harder the grip of his fingers was still upon her wrist  even your objection he said might not relieve you of the possibility of their advent  dont be silly she answered and above all dont try to threaten me if you want my help  she looked steadfastly across at the looming outline of the hastings house  i do want your help he assured her  how long should you require the letter for  one hour he replied  she led him down some steps on to the smooth lawns which encircled the house they passed in and out of some gigantic shrubs until at last they came to a paling she felt along it for a few yards  there is a gate there she told him can you do anything with it  it was fastened by an old lock he lifted it off its hinges and they both passed through  keep behind the shrubs as much as you can she whispered there is a way into the house from the verandah here  they reached at last the shadow of the building she paused  wait here for me she continued i would rather enter the house without being seen if i can but it doesnt really matter i can make some excuse for coming back dont move from where you are  she glided away from him and disappeared lutchester waited standing well back in the shadow of the shrubs from the embassy came all the time the sound of music occasionally even the murmur of voices from the dark house in front of him nothing suddenly he heard what seemed to be the opening of a window and then soft footsteps pamela appeared round the corner of the building a white spectral figure against that background of deep blue darkness she came on tiptoe running down the steps and holding her skirts with both hands  not a soul has seen me she whispered take this quickly  she thrust an envelope into his hands and something hard with it  thats uncle theodores seal she explained he sealed up the envelope when he put it in there now come back quickly to the embassy you must please hurry with what you want to do if i have left when you return you must come back to exactly this place that windowshe pointed upwardswill be wide open you must throw a pine cone or a pebble through it i shall be waiting  i understand he assured her  they retraced their steps once more they drew near to the embassy the night had grown warmer and more windows had been opened they reached the verandah she touched his hand for a moment  well she said i dont know whether i have been wise or not try and be back in less than an hour if you can i am going in alone  she left him and lutchester after a few brief words with the ambassador hurried away to his task in twenty minutes he stood before a tall greystone building a few blocks away was admitted by a japanese butler and conducted after some hesitation into a large room at the back of the house an elderly man dressed for the evening with the lapel of his coat covered with orders was awaiting him  i am a stranger to you baron lutchester began  that does not matter was the grave reply ten minutes ago i had an urgent telephone call from our mutual friend his excellency told me that he was sending a special messenger and begged me to give you a few minutes i have left a conference of some importance and i am here  a few minutes will be enough lutchester promised i am engaged by the english government upon secret service work i came to america following a man named fischer you have heard of him  i have heard of him the ambassador acknowledged  in new york lutchester continued he met one of your countrymen prince nikasti a man i may add lutchester went on for whom i have the highest respect and esteem although quite openly years ago he pronounced himself unfavourably disposed towards my country the object of fischers meeting with prince nikasti was to convey to him certain definite proposals on behalf of the german government they wish for a rapprochement with your country they offer certain terms confirmation of which fischer brought with him in an autograph letter  there was a moments silence not a word came from the man who seemed to have learnt the gift of sitting with absolute immovability even his eyes did not blink he sat and waited  the proposals made to you are plausible and deserving of consideration lutchester proceeded do not think that there exists in my mind or would exist in the mind of any englishman knowing of them any feeling of resentment that these proposals should have been received by you for consideration nothing in this world counts to those who follow the arts of diplomacy save the simple welfare of the people whom he represents it is therefore the duty of every patriot to examine carefully all proposals made to him likely to militate to the advantage of his own people you have a letter offering you certain terms to withdraw from your present alliances here is a letter from the same source in the same handwriting written to america break the seal yourself it was brought to this country by fischer in the same dispatch box as yours to be handed to some responsible person in the american government it was handed to senator theodore hastings it is to form part of his platform on the day when his nomination as president is announced it must be back in his safe within threequarters of an hour break the seal and read it  the japanese held out his hand broke the seal of the envelope and read his face remained immovable when he had finished he looked up at his visitor  i am permitted to take a copy he asked  certainly  he touched a bell spoke down a mouthpiece and with almost necromantic swiftness two young men were in the room a camera was dragged out a little flash of light shot up to the ceiling and the attaches vanished as quickly as they had come the ambassador replaced the document in its envelope handed a stick of sealingwax and a candle to lutchester who leaned over and resealed the envelope  the negative he enquired  will be kept under lock and key the ambassador promised it will pass into the archives of japanese history in future we shall know  once more he touched a bell the door was opened lutchester found himself escorted into the street he was back at the embassy in time to meet a little stream of departing guests lady ridlingshawe patted him on the shoulder with her fan  deserter she exclaimed reproachfully wherever have you been hiding  lutchester made some light reply and passed on he made his way out into the gardens the darkness now was a little more sombre and he had to grope his way to the palings soon he stood before the dark outline of the adjoining house in the window towards which he was making his way a single candle in a silver candlestick was burning he paused underneath and listened then he took a pine cone which he had picked up on his way and threw it through the open window the candle was withdrawn a shadowy form leaned out  im quite alone she assured him softly can you throw it in  he nodded  i think so  his first effort was successful the seal followed wrapped up in his handkerchief a moment or two later he saw pamelas face at the window  good night she whispered quickly please there is still some one about downstairs  the light was extinguished lutchester made his way cautiously back replaced the gate upon its hinges and reached the shelter of the embassy denuded now of guests he found downing in the smokingroom  can i get a whisky and soda lutchester asked in response to the latters vociferous greeting  call it a highball was the prompt reply and you can have as many as you like have you earned it he added a little curiously  i almost believe that i have lutchester assented     chapter xxxv   mr oscar fischer and his friend senator theodore hastings stood side by side a week later in the bar of one of the most fashionable of new york hotels they were passing away the few minutes before pamela and her aunt would be ready to join them in the dining room above  very little news i fancy hastings remarked glancing at the tape which was passing through his companions fingers  nothingof any importance fischer replied nothing  the older man glanced searchingly at his companion the change in whose tone was ominous fischer was standing with the tape in his hand his eyes glued upon a certain paragraph the senator took out his eyeglasses and looked over his friends shoulder  whats this he demanded eh  fischer was fighting a great battle and fighting it well  something wrong apparently with frank roughton he observed an old college friend of mine they made him governor ofonly last year  hastings read the item thoughtfully  governor roughton this morning tendered his resignation as governor of the state of we understand that it was at once accepted numerous arrests have taken place with reference to the great explosion at the bembridge powder factory  looks rather fishy that hastings observed thoughtfully  im sorry for roughton fischer declared he was a perfectly straight man and i am sure he has done his best  great friend of yours the other asked curiously  we were intimately acquainted was the brief answer  the two men finished their cocktails in silence on their way upstairs the senator took his companions arm  fischer he said youll forgive me if i put a certain matter to you plainly  naturally  within the last few days hastings proceeded there have been seven explosions or fires at various factories throughout the states it is a somewhat significant circumstance he added after a slight pause that every one of these misfortunes has occurred at a factory where munitions of some sort for the allies have been in process of manufacture shrewd men have naturally come to the conclusion that there is some organisation at work  i should doubt it fischer replied you must remember that there is always a great risk of disasters in factories where explosives are being handled it is a new thing to many of the manufacturers here and it is obvious that they are not making use of all the necessary precautions  i see hastings observed reflectively so that is how you would explain this epidemic of disasters eh  certainly  at the same time fischer to set my mind entirely at rest hastings continued i should like your assurance that you have nothing whatever to do with any organisation should there be such a thing including in its object the destruction of american property  i will do more than answer your question in the direct negative was the firm reply i will assure you that no such organisation exists  i am relieved to hear it hastings confessed this resignation of roughton however seems a strange thing most of these fires have occurred in his state ah there is senator joyce waiting for us and pamela and mrs hastings  mr hastings as a host was in his element his manners and tact which his enemies declared were far too perfect were both admirably displayed in the smaller ways of life he guided the conversation into light yet opportune subjects and he utterly ignored the fact that senator joyce one of the great politicians of the day whose support of his nomination was already more than half promised seemed distrait and a little cold it was pamela who quite inadvertently steered the conversation into a dangerous channel  what has governor roughton been doing mr fischer she asked  there was a moments silence pamelas question had fallen something like a bombshell amongst the little party it was their guest who replied  the matter is occupying the attention of the country very largely at the moment miss van teyl he said it is perhaps unfortunate that governor roughton seems to have allowed his sympathies to be so clearly known  he is a german by birth is he not pamela inquired  most decidedly not fischer asserted i was at harvard with him  all the same pamela murmured under her breath i think that he was born at stuttgart  he is an american citizen senator joyce observed and has reached a high position here we of the administration may be wrong he continued but we believe and we think that we have a right to believe that when any man of conscience and ideals takes the oath he is free from all previous prejudices he is an american citizen nothing more and nothing less  of course that is magnificent pamela declared but it isnt common sense is it and you havent answered my original question yet  i am not in a position to do so miss van teyl joyce replied the trouble probably is that governor roughton has been considered incompetent as so many of these disasters have taken place unhindered in his state  there was a rumour pamela persisted that he was under arrest  quite untrue i am sure fischer muttered  there was a general diversion of the conversation but the sense of uneasiness remained pamela and mrs hastings at the conclusion of the little banquet acting upon a hint from their host made their way to one of the small drawingrooms for their coffee left alone the three men drew their chairs closer together joyces fine face seemed somehow to have become a little harder and more unsympathetic he sipped the water which was his only beverage and pushed away the cigars in which he generally indulged  mr hastings he pronounced i have given the subject of supporting your nomination my deepest consideration i was at one time i must confess favourably disposed towards the idea i have changed my mind i have decided to give my support to the present administration  fischers face was dark with anger he even allowed an expletive to escape from his lips hastings however remained master of himself  i will not conceal from you mr joyce he confessed that i am exceedingly disappointed you have fully considered everything i presumeour pledge for instance to nominate you as my successor  i have considered everything joyce replied the drawback in my mind to be frank with you is that i doubt whether you would receive sufficient support throughout the country it is my idea he went on although i may be wrong of course that the support of the germanamericans who you must allow me to maintain are an exceedingly unneutral part of america will place you in an unpopular position should you succeed in getting yourself elected which i very much doubt you will be an unpopular president i would rather wait my time  you have changed your views fischer muttered  to be perfectly frank with you i have joyce acknowledged these outrages throughout the states are to my mind blatant and criminal directly or indirectly the germanamerican public is responsible for themindirectly by inflammatory speeches reckless journalism and pointblank laudation of illegal acts directlywell here i can speak only from my own suspicions so i will remain silent but my mind is made up a man in this country as you know he added need make only one mistake and his political future is blasted i am not inclined to risk making that one mistake  hastings sighed he was making a brave effort to conceal a great disappointment  one cannot argue with you mr joyce he regretted you have come to a certain conclusion and words are not likely to alter it there is no one i would so dearly have loved to number amongst my supporters but i see that it is a privilege for which i may not hope we will if you are ready fischer join the ladies  they rose from the table a few minutes later  fischer who had been eagerly watching his opportunity drew senator joyce on one side for a moment as they passed down the crowded corridor  mr joyce he said i have heard your decision tonight with deeper regret than i can express yet more than ever it has brought home one truth to me our position towards you was a wrong one we offered you a reversion when we should have offered you the thing itself  senator joyce swung around  say mr fischer what are you getting at he asked bluntly  i mean that it is hastings and i who should have been your supporters and you who should have been our candidate fischer suggested boldly what about it it isnt too late  nothing doing sir was the firm reply theodore hastings may not be exactly my type of man but i am not out to see him cornered like that and besides to tell you the honest truth mr fischer he added pausing at the door when i stand for the presidency i want to do so not on the nomination of you or your friends or any underground schemers i want the support of the real american citizen i want to be free from all outside ties and obligations i want to stand for america and america only i not only want to be president you see but i want to be the chosen president of the right sort of people i am going to ask you to excuse me to the ladies and our host mr fischer he concluded holding out his hand i had a note asking me to visit the attorney general which i only received on my way here i have an idea that it is about this roughton business  fischer returned to the others alone hastings was clearly disturbed at his guests departure his friend and supporter however affected to treat it lightly  joyce is like all these lawyers he declared he is simply waiting to see which way the wind blows i have come across them many times they like to wait till parties are evenly balanced till their support makes all the difference and clinch their bargain then  i should have said pamela remarked that mr joyce was a man above that sort of thing  every man has his price and his weak spot her uncle observed didactically joyces price is the presidency his weak spot is popular adulation i agree with fischer he will probably join us later  mr hastings was summoned to the telephone a moment or two later mrs hastings sat down to write a note and pamela moved her place over to fischers side his face brightened at her spontaneous movement she shook her head however at the little compliment with which he welcomed her  this afternoon she said softly i met mr lutchester  is he back in new york fischer asked frowning  pamela nodded  he told me something which i feel inclined to tell you she continued glancing into her companions haggard face with a gleam of sympathy in her eyes youll probably see it in the newspapers tomorrow morning governor roughtons resignation was compulsory he is under arrest  for negligence  for participation was the grave reply mr lutchester has been down tothe city where these things took place he only got back late this afternoon  lutchester again fischer muttered  you see its rather in his line pamela reminded him he is over here to superintend the production of munitions from the factories which are working for the british government  he is over here as a sort of general mischiefmaker fischer exclaimed fiercely do i understand that he has been down in  pamela nodded  he went down with one of the heads of the new york police  she turned away but fischer caught at her wrist  you know more than this he cried hoarsely  the agony in the mans face and tone touched her after all he was fighting for the great things there was nothing mean about fischer nothing selfish about his lying and his crimes  i have told you all that i can she whispered but if you hurried you could catch the new york tonightand i think i should advise you to go     chapter xxxvi   fischer on leaving his unsuccessful dinner party drove direct to the residence of mr max h bookam in fifth avenue the butler who admitted him looked a little blank at his inquiry  mr bookam was expected home yesterday sir he announced he has not arrived however  has there been any telegram from himany news as to the cause of his nonreturn fischer persisted  i believe that mr kaye his secretary has some information sir the man admitted perhaps you would like to see him  fischer did not hesitate and was conducted at once to the study in which mr bookam was wont to indulge in various nefarious stock exchange adventures the room was occupied on this occasion by a dejectedlooking young man with pasty face and gold spectacles the apartment as fischer was quick to notice showed signs of a strange disorder  wheres mr bookam he asked quickly  the young man walked to the door shook it to be sure that it was closed and came back again his tone was ominous almost dramatic  in the state prison at sir he announced  what for fischer demanded breathing a little thickly  i have no certain information the secretary replied with a noncommittal air all i know is that i had a longdistance telephone to burn certain documents but before i could do so the room and the house were searched by new york detectives whose warrant it was useless to resist  but whats the charge against mr bookam  its something to do with the disasters in the young man confided the governor of the state who is mr bookams cousin is in the same trouble better sit down a moment sir youre looking white  mr fischer threw himself into an easychair he felt like a man who has built a mighty piece of machinery has set it swinging through space and watches now its imminent collapse watches some tiny but ghastly flaw pregnant with disaster growing wider and wider before his eyes  what papers did the police take away with them he asked  there wasnt very much for them the secretary replied there was a list of the names of the proposed organisation which owing to your very wise intervention was never formed there was a list of factories throughout the united states in which munitions are being made with a black mark against those holding the most important contracts and there was a letter from governor roughton  mr bookam hasnt drawn any cheques lately for large amounts fischer inquired eagerly  there are three in his private chequebook sir the counterfoils of which are not filled in was the somewhat dreary admission  fischer groaned as he received the news  have you any idea about those cheques he demanded  i am afraid the other acknowledged that mr bookam was not very discreet i reminded him of your advicethat the money should be passed through sullivanbut he didnt seem to think it worth while  look here let me know the worst at once fischer insisted do you believe that any one of those cheques was made payable to any of the men who are under arrest  i am afraid the secretary declared sadly that the proceeds of one were found on the person of ed swindles intact  fischer sat for a moment with his head buried in his hands that any man could have been such a fool an organisation would have been a thousand times safer max bookam was only a very worthy and industrious clothing manufacturer with an intense love for the fatherland and a great veneration for all her institutions what he had done he had done wholeheartedly but foolishly he was a man who should never have been trusted for a moment in the game after all the pawns count  fischer took his leave and reached his hotel a little before midnight already he had begun to look over his shoulder in the street he found his rooms empty with a sense of relief marred by one little disappointment nikasti was to have been there to bid him farewell nikasti on his way back to japan he ascertained from the office of the hotel that there had been no telephone message or caller then he turned to his correspondence some presentiment already clutching at his strained nerves there was a letter in a large envelope near the bottom of the pile addressed to him in nikastis fine handwriting he tore open the envelope and slow horror seized him as he realised its contents a long photograph unrolled itself before his eyes the first few words brought confusion and horror to his sense his brain reeled this was defeat indeed it was a photograph of that other autograph letter the one which he had given to nikasti to carry to japan lay gross sacrilegeabout him in small pieces there was no other line no message nothing but this damning proof of his duplicity  a kind of mental torture seized him he fought like a caged man for some way out every sort of explanation occurred to him only to be rejected every sort of subterfuge only to be cast aside with a kind of ghastly contempt he felt suddenly stripped bare his tongue could serve him no more he snatched at the telephone receiver and rang up the number for which he searched eagerly through the book  is that the office of the american steamship company he asked  yes  what time will the new york sail  in threequarters of an hour whos speaking  mr oscar fischer keep anything you have for me  he threw down the receiver for fear of a refusal packed a few things feverishly in a dressing bag dashed the rest of his correspondence into his pocket and with the bag in one hand and an overcoat over the other arm he hastened out into the street he was obliged at first to board a street car afterwards he found a taxicab and drove under the great wooden shed as the last siren was blowing he hurried up the gangway a grim remorseful figure a sense of defeat gnawing at his heart a bitter haunting fear still with him even when with a shriek of the tugs the great steamer swung into the river he was leaving forever the work to which he had given so much of his life leaving it a fugitive and dishonoured the blaze of lights the screaming of the great ferryboats all the triumphant brazen noises of the mighty city sounded like a requiem to him as in the darkest part of the promenade deck he leaned over the railing and nursed his agony the supreme agony of an ambitious manfailure     chapter xxxvii   what has become mrs theodore hastings asked her niece one afternoon about a month later of your delightful friend mr lutchester  pamela laid down her book and looked across at her aunt with wideopen eyes  why i thought you didnt like him aunt  i cannot remember saying so my dear mrs hastings replied i had nothing against the man himself it was simply his attitude with regard to some of your uncles plans of which we disapproved  pamela nodded they were seated on the piazza of the hastings country house at manchester  i see and uncles plans she went on reflectively have become a little changed havent they  mrs hastings coughed  there is no doubt she admitted that your uncle theodore was inveigled into supporting to a certain extent a party whose leaders have shown themselves utterly irresponsible the moment these horrible things began to come out however your uncle finally cut himself loose from them  very wise of him pamela murmured  who could have believed mrs hastings demanded that men like oscar fischer max bookam and a dozen other wellknown and prominent millionaires would have stooped to encourage the destruction of american property and lives simply through blind devotion to the country of their birth i could understand she went on both your uncle and i perfectly understood that their sympathies were german rather than english but we shared a common belief that notwithstanding this they were americans first and foremost it was in this belief that your uncle was led into temporary association with them  bad luck pamela sighed i am afraid it hasnt done uncle theodore any good  mrs hastings went on with her knitting for a moment  my child she said it has probably imperilled if it has not completely ruined one of the great hopes which your uncle and i have sometimes entertained we are both of us however quite philosophical about it even at this moment i am convinced that if these men had acted with discretion and been content to wield political influence rather than to have resorted to such fanatical means they would have represented a great power at the next election as things are i admit that their cause is lost for the time i believe that your uncle is contemplating an early visit to england he is of the opinion that perhaps he has misunderstood the allied point of view and he is going to study matters at first hand  pamela nodded  i think he is very wise aunt she declared i quite expect that he will come back a warm advocate of the allies no one would have a ghost of a chance who went to the country here on the other ticket  i believe that that is your uncles point of view mrs hastings assented why dont you ask mr lutchester down for a couple of days  if you mean it i certainly will pamela agreed  quite incidentally her aunt continued i heard the nicest possible things about him in washington lady ridlingshawe told me that the lutchesters are one of the oldest families in england he is a cousin of the duke of worcester and is extraordinarily well connected in other directions i must say he has a most distinguished appearance a wellbred englishman is so different from these foreigners  pamela laid down her book and drew her writing block towards her  ill write and invite him down at once she suggested  your uncle will be delighted mrs hastings purred  lutchester received his invitation in new york and arrived in manchester three days later pamela met him at the station with a couple of boatmen by her side  if you wouldnt mind sailing home she proposed the house is practically on an island and the tide is just right these men will take your luggage  they walked down to the little dock together  pamela talked all the time but lutchester was curiously tonguetied  youll find uncle theodore and aunt too most amusing she confided it is perfectly obvious that there is nothing uncle regrets so much as his temporary linking up with fischer and his friends in fact he is going to europe almost at oncei am convinced for no other reason than to give him an excuse upon his return for blossoming out as a fervent supporter of the allies  are you going too lutchester inquired shall i well i am not really sure she declared as they reached the little wooden dock i suppose i shall especially if i can find something to do i may even turn nurse  you will be able to find plenty to do he assured her if nothing else turns up you can help me  they stepped on to the yacht pamela a radiant vision in white with white flannel skirt white jersey and tamoshanter took the helm and was busy for a few moments getting clear afterwards she leaned back amongst the cushions with lutchester by her side  in the agitation of missing that buoy he reminded her you forgot to answer my last suggestion  is there any way in which i could help you she asked  you can help me in the greatest of all ways he replied promptly you can give me just that help which only the woman who cares can give to the man who cares for her and if that isnt exciting enough he went on after a moments pause well i dare say i can find you some work in the censors department  isnt censoring a little dull she murmured  then you choose  her hand slipped into his a little breeze filled their sails at that moment the wonderful blue water of the bay sparkled with a million gleams of sunshine lutchester drew a great breath of content  thats aunt on the landingstage watching us through her glasses pamela pointed out making a feeble attempt to withdraw her hand  it will save us the trouble he observed resisting her effort of explanations  lutchester found his host and hostess unexpectedly friendly they even accepted with cheerful philosophy the news that lutchesters work in america was almost finished for the time and that pamela was to accompany him to europe almost immediately after dinner when the two men were left at the table hastings became almost confidential  so far as regards the sympathies of this country mr lutchester he said the final die has been cast within the last few weeks there has always been he proceeded a certain irritation existing between even the anglosaxon americans and your country we have fancied so often that you have adopted little airs of superiority towards us and that your methods of stating your intentions have not always taken account of our own little weaknesses then america you know loves a good fight and the germans are a wonderful military people they were fighting like giants whilst you in england were still slacking but it is germany herself or rather her sons and friends who have destroyed her chances for her fischer for instance he went on fingering his wineglass i have always looked upon oscar fischer as a brilliant and farseeing man he was one of those who set themselves deliberately to win america for the germans a more idiotic bungle than he has made of things i could scarcely conceive he has reproduced the diplomatic methods which have made germany unpopular throughout the world he has tried bullying cajolery and falsehood and last of all he has plunged into crime no germanamerican will henceforth ever have weight in the counsels of this country i do not mind confessing mr hastings continued as he himself filled his guests glass and then his own that i myself was at one time powerfully attracted towards the teuton cause they are a nation wonderful in science wonderful in warfare with strong and admirable national characteristics yet they are going to lose this war through sheer lack of tact for the want of that kindliness that generosity of temperament which exists and makes friends in nations as in individuals the world for germany you know and hell for her enemies but i am keeping you  lutchester drank his wine and rose to his feet  pamela is sitting on the rocks there mr hastings observed i think that she wants to sail you over to misery island we get some unearthly meal there at ten oclock and come back by moonlight it is a sort of torture which we always inflict upon our guests my wife and i will follow in the launch  to misery island lutchester repeated  his host smiled as he led the way to the piazza steps pamela had already stepped into the boat and with the help of a boatman was adjusting the sail she waved her hand gaily and pointed to the level stretch of placid water still faintly brilliant in the dying sunlight  you think that we shall reach misery island before the tide turns she called out  lutchester stepped lightly into the boat and took the place to which she pointed  i am content he said to take my chance   the end
