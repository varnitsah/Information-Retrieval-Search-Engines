retribution    60 chiefly matrimonial    61 relenting    62 final     chapter 1 dombey and son   dombey sat in the corner of the darkened room in the great armchair by the bedside and son lay tucked up warm in a little basket bedstead carefully disposed on a low settee immediately in front of the fire and close to it as if his constitution were analogous to that of a muffin and it was essential to toast him brown while he was very new  dombey was about eightandforty years of age son about eightandforty minutes dombey was rather bald rather red and though a handsome wellmade man too stern and pompous in appearance to be prepossessing son was very bald and very red and though of course an undeniably fine infant somewhat crushed and spotty in his general effect as yet on the brow of dombey time and his brother care had set some marks as on a tree that was to come down in good timeremorseless twins they are for striding through their human forests notching as they gowhile the countenance of son was crossed with a thousand little creases which the same deceitful time would take delight in smoothing out and wearing away with the flat part of his scythe as a preparation of the surface for his deeper operations  dombey exulting in the longlookedfor event jingled and jingled the heavy gold watchchain that depended from below his trim blue coat whereof the buttons sparkled phosphorescently in the feeble rays of the distant fire son with his little fists curled up and clenched seemed in his feeble way to be squaring at existence for having come upon him so unexpectedly  the house will once again mrs dombey said mr dombey be not only in name but in fact dombey and son and he added in a tone of luxurious satisfaction with his eyes halfclosed as if he were reading the name in a device of flowers and inhaling their fragrance at the same time dombey and son  the words had such a softening influence that he appended a term of endearment to mrs dombeys name though not without some hesitation as being a man but little used to that form of address and said mrs dombey mymy dear  a transient flush of faint surprise overspread the sick ladys face as she raised her eyes towards him  he will be christened paul mymrs dombeyof course  she feebly echoed of course or rather expressed it by the motion of her lips and closed her eyes again  his fathers name mrs dombey and his grandfathers i wish his grandfather were alive this day there is some inconvenience in the necessity of writing junior said mr dombey making a fictitious autograph on his knee but it is merely of a private and personal complexion it doesnt enter into the correspondence of the house its signature remains the same and again he said dombey and son in exactly the same tone as before  those three words conveyed the one idea of mr dombeys life the earth was made for dombey and son to trade in and the sun and moon were made to give them light rivers and seas were formed to float their ships rainbows gave them promise of fair weather winds blew for or against their enterprises stars and planets circled in their orbits to preserve inviolate a system of which they were the centre common abbreviations took new meanings in his eyes and had sole reference to them a d had no concern with anno domini but stood for anno dombeiand son  he had risen as his father had before him in the course of life and death from son to dombey and for nearly twenty years had been the sole representative of the firm of those years he had been married tenmarried as some said to a lady with no heart to give him whose happiness was in the past and who was content to bind her broken spirit to the dutiful and meek endurance of the present such idle talk was little likely to reach the ears of mr dombey whom it nearly concerned and probably no one in the world would have received it with such utter incredulity as he if it had reached him dombey and son had often dealt in hides but never in hearts they left that fancy ware to boys and girls and boardingschools and books mr dombey would have reasoned that a matrimonial alliance with himself must in the nature of things be gratifying and honourable to any woman of common sense that the hope of giving birth to a new partner in such a house could not fail to awaken a glorious and stirring ambition in the breast of the least ambitious of her sex that mrs dombey had entered on that social contract of matrimony almost necessarily part of a genteel and wealthy station even without reference to the perpetuation of family firms with her eyes fully open to these advantages that mrs dombey had had daily practical knowledge of his position in society that mrs dombey had always sat at the head of his table and done the honours of his house in a remarkably ladylike and becoming manner that mrs dombey must have been happy that she couldnt help it  or at all events with one drawback yes that he would have allowed with only one but that one certainly involving much with the drawback of hope deferred that hope deferred which as the scripture very correctly tells us mr dombey would have added in a patronising way for his highest distinct idea even of scripture if examined would have been found to be that as forming part of a general whole of which dombey and son formed another part it was therefore to be commended and upheld maketh the heart sick they had been married ten years and until this present day on which mr dombey sat jingling and jingling his heavy gold watchchain in the great armchair by the side of the bed had had no issueto speak of none worth mentioning there had been a girl some six years before and the child who had stolen into the chamber unobserved was now crouching timidly in a corner whence she could see her mothers face but what was a girl to dombey and son in the capital of the houses name and dignity such a child was merely a piece of base coin that couldnt be investeda bad boynothing more  mr dombeys cup of satisfaction was so full at this moment however that he felt he could afford a drop or two of its contents even to sprinkle on the dust in the bypath of his little daughter  so he said florence you may go and look at your pretty brother if you like i daresay dont touch him  the child glanced keenly at the blue coat and stiff white cravat which with a pair of creaking boots and a very loud ticking watch embodied her idea of a father but her eyes returned to her mothers face immediately and she neither moved nor answered  her insensibility is as proof against a brother as against every thing else said mr dombey to himself he seemed so confirmed in a previous opinion by the discovery as to be quite glad of it  next moment the lady had opened her eyes and seen the child and the child had run towards her and standing on tiptoe the better to hide her face in her embrace had clung about her with a desperate affection very much at variance with her years  oh lord bless me said mr dombey rising testily a very illadvised and feverish proceeding this i am sure please to ring there for miss florences nurse really the person should be more care  wait ihad better ask doctor peps if hell have the goodness to step upstairs again perhaps ill go down ill go down i neednt beg you he added pausing for a moment at the settee before the fire to take particular care of this young gentleman mrs   blockitt sir suggested the nurse a simpering piece of faded gentility who did not presume to state her name as a fact but merely offered it as a mild suggestion  of this young gentleman mrs blockitt  no sir indeed i remember when miss florence was born  ay ay ay said mr dombey bending over the basket bedstead and slightly bending his brows at the same time miss florence was all very well but this is another matter this young gentleman has to accomplish a destiny a destiny little fellow as he thus apostrophised the infant he raised one of his hands to his lips and kissed it then seeming to fear that the action involved some compromise of his dignity went awkwardly enough away  doctor parker peps one of the court physicians and a man of immense reputation for assisting at the increase of great families was walking up and down the drawingroom with his hands behind him to the unspeakable admiration of the family surgeon who had regularly puffed the case for the last six weeks among all his patients friends and acquaintances as one to which he was in hourly expectation day and night of being summoned in conjunction with doctor parker pep  well sir said doctor parker peps in a round deep sonorous voice muffled for the occasion like the knocker do you find that your dear lady is at all roused by your visit  stimulated as it were said the family practitioner faintly bowing at the same time to the doctor as much as to say excuse my putting in a word but this is a valuable connexion  mr dombey was quite discomfited by the question he had thought so little of the patient that he was not in a condition to answer it he said that it would be a satisfaction to him if doctor parker peps would walk upstairs again  good we must not disguise from you sir said doctor parker peps that there is a want of power in her grace the duchessi beg your pardon i confound names i should say in your amiable lady that there is a certain degree of languor and a general absence of elasticity which we would rathernot  see interposed the family practitioner with another inclination of the head  quite so said doctor parker peps which we would rather not see it would appear that the system of lady cankabyexcuse me i should say of mrs dombey i confuse the names of cases  so very numerous murmured the family practitionercant be expected im surequite wonderful if otherwisedoctor parker pepss westend practice  thank you said the doctor quite so it would appear i was observing that the system of our patient has sustained a shock from which it can only hope to rally by a great and strong  and vigorous murmured the family practitioner  quite so assented the doctorand vigorous effort mr pilkins here who from his position of medical adviser in this familyno one better qualified to fill that position i am sure  oh murmured the family practitioner praise from sir hubert stanley  you are good enough returned doctor parker peps to say so mr pilkins who from his position is best acquainted with the patients constitution in its normal state an acquaintance very valuable to us in forming our opinions in these occasions is of opinion with me that nature must be called upon to make a vigorous effort in this instance and that if our interesting friend the countess of dombeyi beg your pardon mrs dombeyshould not be  able said the family practitioner  to make said doctor parker peps  that effort said the family practitioner  successfully said they both together  then added doctor parker peps alone and very gravely a crisis might arise which we should both sincerely deplore  with that they stood for a few seconds looking at the ground then on the motionmade in dumb showof doctor parker peps they went upstairs the family practitioner opening the room door for that distinguished professional and following him out with most obsequious politeness  to record of mr dombey that he was not in his way affected by this intelligence would be to do him an injustice he was not a man of whom it could properly be said that he was ever startled or shocked but he certainly had a sense within him that if his wife should sicken and decay he would be very sorry and that he would find a something gone from among his plate and furniture and other household possessions which was well worth the having and could not be lost without sincere regret though it would be a cool businesslike gentlemanly selfpossessed regret no doubt  his meditations on the subject were soon interrupted first by the rustling of garments on the staircase and then by the sudden whisking into the room of a lady rather past the middle age than otherwise but dressed in a very juvenile manner particularly as to the tightness of her bodice who running up to him with a kind of screw in her face and carriage expressive of suppressed emotion flung her arms around his neck and said in a choking voice  my dear paul hes quite a dombey  well well returned her brotherfor mr dombey was her brotheri think he is like the family dont agitate yourself louisa  its very foolish of me said louisa sitting down and taking out her pockethandkerchief but heshes such a perfect dombey  mr dombey coughed  its so extraordinary said louisa smiling through her tears which indeed were not overpowering as to be perfectly ridiculous so completely our family i never saw anything like it in my life  but what is this about fanny herself said mr dombey how is fanny  my dear paul returned louisa its nothing whatever take my word its nothing whatever there is exhaustion certainly but nothing like what i underwent myself either with george or frederick an effort is necessary thats all if dear fanny were a dombeybut i daresay shell make it i have no doubt shell make it knowing it to be required of her as a duty of course shell make it my dear paul its very weak and silly of me i know to be so trembly and shaky from head to foot but i am so very queer that i must ask you for a glass of wine and a morsel of that cake  mr dombey promptly supplied her with these refreshments from a tray on the table  i shall not drink my love to you paul said louisa i shall drink to the little dombey good gracious meits the most astonishing thing i ever knew in all my days hes such a perfect dombey  quenching this expression of opinion in a short hysterical laugh which terminated in tears louisa cast up her eyes and emptied her glass  i know its very weak and silly of me she repeated to be so trembly and shaky from head to foot and to allow my feelings so completely to get the better of me but i cannot help it i thought i should have fallen out of the staircase window as i came down from seeing dear fanny and that tiddy ickle sing these last words originated in a sudden vivid reminiscence of the baby  they were succeeded by a gentle tap at the door  mrs chick said a very bland female voice outside how are you now my dear friend  my dear paul said louisa in a low voice as she rose from her seat its miss tox the kindest creature i never could have got here without her miss tox my brother mr dombey paul my dear my very particular friend miss tox  the lady thus specially presented was a long lean figure wearing such a faded air that she seemed not to have been made in what linendrapers call fast colours originally and to have by little and little washed out but for this she might have been described as the very pink of general propitiation and politeness from a long habit of listening admiringly to everything that was said in her presence and looking at the speakers as if she were mentally engaged in taking off impressions of their images upon her soul never to part with the same but with life her head had quite settled on one side her hands had contracted a spasmodic habit of raising themselves of their own accord as in involuntary admiration her eyes were liable to a similar affection she had the softest voice that ever was heard and her nose stupendously aquiline had a little knob in the very centre or keystone of the bridge whence it tended downwards towards her face as in an invincible determination never to turn up at anything  miss toxs dress though perfectly genteel and good had a certain character of angularity and scantiness she was accustomed to wear odd weedy little flowers in her bonnets and caps strange grasses were sometimes perceived in her hair and it was observed by the curious of all her collars frills tuckers wristbands and other gossamer articlesindeed of everything she wore which had two ends to it intended to unitethat the two ends were never on good terms and wouldnt quite meet without a struggle she had furry articles for winter wear as tippets boas and muffs which stood up on end in rampant manner and were not at all sleek she was much given to the carrying about of small bags with snaps to them that went off like little pistols when they were shut up and when fulldressed she wore round her neck the barrenest of lockets representing a fishy old eye with no approach to speculation in it these and other appearances of a similar nature had served to propagate the opinion that miss tox was a lady of what is called a limited independence which she turned to the best account possibly her mincing gait encouraged the belief and suggested that her clipping a step of ordinary compass into two or three originated in her habit of making the most of everything  i am sure said miss tox with a prodigious curtsey that to have the honour of being presented to mr dombey is a distinction which i have long sought but very little expected at the present moment my dear mrs chickmay i say louisa  mrs chick took miss toxs hand in hers rested the foot of her wineglass upon it repressed a tear and said in a low voice god bless you  my dear louisa then said miss tox my sweet friend how are you now  better mrs chick returned take some wine you have been almost as anxious as i have been and must want it i am sure  mr dombey of course officiated and also refilled his sisters glass which she looking another way and unconscious of his intention held straight and steady the while and then regarded with great astonishment saying my dear paul what have you been doing  miss tox paul pursued mrs chick still retaining her hand knowing how much i have been interested in the anticipation of the event of today and how trembly and shaky i have been from head to foot in expectation of it has been working at a little gift for fanny which i promised to present miss tox is ingenuity itself  my dear louisa said miss tox dont say so  it is only a pincushion for the toilette table paul resumed his sister one of those trifles which are insignificant to your sex in general as its very natural they should bewe have no business to expect they should be otherwisebut to which we attach some interest  miss tox is very good said mr dombey  and i do say and will say and must say pursued his sister pressing the foot of the wineglass on miss toxs hand at each of the three clauses that miss tox has very prettily adapted the sentiment to the occasion i call welcome little dombey poetry myself  is that the device inquired her brother  that is the device returned louisa  but do me the justice to remember my dear louisa said miss toxin a tone of low and earnest entreaty that nothing but thei have some difficulty in expressing myselfthe dubiousness of the result would have induced me to take so great a liberty welcome master dombey would have been much more congenial to my feelings as i am sure you know but the uncertainty attendant on angelic strangers will i hope excuse what must otherwise appear an unwarrantable familiarity miss tox made a graceful bend as she spoke in favour of mr dombey which that gentleman graciously acknowledged even the sort of recognition of dombey and son conveyed in the foregoing conversation was so palatable to him that his sister mrs chickthough he affected to consider her a weak goodnatured personhad perhaps more influence over him than anybody else  my dear paul that lady broke out afresh after silently contemplating his features for a few moments i dont know whether to laugh or cry when i look at you i declare you do so remind me of that dear baby upstairs  well said mrs chick with a sweet smile after this i forgive fanny everything  it was a declaration in a christian spirit and mrs chick felt that it did her good not that she had anything particular to forgive in her sisterinlaw nor indeed anything at all except her having married her brotherin itself a species of audacityand her having in the course of events given birth to a girl instead of a boy which as mrs chick had frequently observed was not quite what she had expected of her and was not a pleasant return for all the attention and distinction she had met with  mr dombey being hastily summoned out of the room at this moment the two ladies were left alone together miss tox immediately became spasmodic  i knew you would admire my brother i told you so beforehand my dear said louisa miss toxs hands and eyes expressed how much and as to his property my dear  ah said miss tox with deep feeling immense  but his deportment my dear louisa said miss tox his presence his dignity no portrait that i have ever seen of anyone has been half so replete with those qualities something so stately you know so uncompromising so very wide across the chest so upright a pecuniary duke of york my love and nothing short of it said miss tox thats what i should designate him  why my dear paul exclaimed his sister as he returned you look quite pale theres nothing the matter  i am sorry to say louisa that they tell me that fanny  now my dear paul returned his sister rising dont believe it do not allow yourself to receive a turn unnecessarily remember of what importance you are to society and do not allow yourself to be worried by what is so very inconsiderately told you by people who ought to know better really im surprised at them  i hope i know louisa said mr dombey stiffly how to bear myself before the world  nobody better my dear paul nobody half so well they would be ignorant and base indeed who doubted it  ignorant and base indeed echoed miss tox softly  but pursued louisa if you have any reliance on my experience paul you may rest assured that there is nothing wanting but an effort on fannys part and that effort she continued taking off her bonnet and adjusting her cap and gloves in a businesslike manner she must be encouraged and really if necessary urged to make now my dear paul come upstairs with me  mr dombey who besides being generally influenced by his sister for the reason already mentioned had really faith in her as an experienced and bustling matron acquiesced and followed her at once to the sick chamber  the lady lay upon her bed as he had left her clasping her little daughter to her breast the child clung close about her with the same intensity as before and never raised her head or moved her soft cheek from her mothers face or looked on those who stood around or spoke or moved or shed a tear  restless without the little girl the doctor whispered mr dombey we found it best to have her in again  can nothing be done asked mr dombey  the doctor shook his head we can do no more  the windows stood open and the twilight was gathering without  the scent of the restoratives that had been tried was pungent in the room but had no fragrance in the dull and languid air the lady breathed  there was such a solemn stillness round the bed and the two medical attendants seemed to look on the impassive form with so much compassion and so little hope that mrs chick was for the moment diverted from her purpose but presently summoning courage and what she called presence of mind she sat down by the bedside and said in the low precise tone of one who endeavours to awaken a sleeper  fanny fanny  there was no sound in answer but the loud ticking of mr dombeys watch and doctor parker pepss watch which seemed in the silence to be running a race  fanny my dear said mrs chick with assumed lightness heres mr dombey come to see you wont you speak to him they want to lay your little boythe baby fanny you know you have hardly seen him yet i thinkin bed but they cant till you rouse yourself a little dont you think its time you roused yourself a little eh  she bent her ear to the bed and listened at the same time looking round at the bystanders and holding up her finger  eh she repeated what was it you said fanny i didnt hear you  no word or sound in answer mr dombeys watch and dr parker pepss watch seemed to be racing faster  now really fanny my dear said the sisterinlaw altering her position and speaking less confidently and more earnestly in spite of herself i shall have to be quite cross with you if you dont rouse yourself its necessary for you to make an effort and perhaps a very great and painful effort which you are not disposed to make but this is a world of effort you know fanny and we must never yield when so much depends upon us come try i must really scold you if you dont  the race in the ensuing pause was fierce and furious the watches seemed to jostle and to trip each other up  fanny said louisa glancing round with a gathering alarm only look at me only open your eyes to show me that you hear and understand me will you good heaven gentlemen what is to be done  the two medical attendants exchanged a look across the bed and the physician stooping down whispered in the childs ear not having understood the purport of his whisper the little creature turned her perfectly colourless face and deep dark eyes towards him but without loosening her hold in the least  the whisper was repeated  mama said the child  the little voice familiar and dearly loved awakened some show of consciousness even at that ebb for a moment the closed eye lids trembled and the nostril quivered and the faintest shadow of a smile was seen  mama cried the child sobbing aloud oh dear mama oh dear mama  the doctor gently brushed the scattered ringlets of the child aside from the face and mouth of the mother alas how calm they lay there how little breath there was to stir them  thus clinging fast to that slight spar within her arms the mother drifted out upon the dark and unknown sea that rolls round all the world    chapter 2 in which timely provision is made for an emergency that will sometimes arise in the bestregulated families   i shall never cease to congratulate myself said mrs chick on having said when i little thought what was in store for usreally as if i was inspired by somethingthat i forgave poor dear fanny everything whatever happens that must always be a comfort to me  mrs chick made this impressive observation in the drawingroom after having descended thither from the inspection of the mantuamakers upstairs who were busy on the family mourning she delivered it for the behoof of mr chick who was a stout bald gentleman with a very large face and his hands continually in his pockets and who had a tendency in his nature to whistle and hum tunes which sensible of the indecorum of such sounds in a house of grief he was at some pains to repress at present  dont you overexert yourself loo said mr chick or youll be laid up with spasms i see right tol loor rul bless my soul i forgot were here one day and gone the next  mrs chick contented herself with a glance of reproof and then proceeded with the thread of her discourse  i am sure she said i hope this heartrending occurrence will be a warning to all of us to accustom ourselves to rouse ourselves and to make efforts in time where theyre required of us theres a moral in everything if we would only avail ourselves of it it will be our own faults if we lose sight of this one  mr chick invaded the grave silence which ensued on this remark with the singularly inappropriate air of a cobbler there was and checking himself in some confusion observed that it was undoubtedly our own faults if we didnt improve such melancholy occasions as the present  which might be better improved i should think mr c retorted his helpmate after a short pause than by the introduction either of the college hornpipe or the equally unmeaning and unfeeling remark of rumpteiddity bowwowwowwhich mr chick had indeed indulged in under his breath and which mrs chick repeated in a tone of withering scorn  merely habit my dear pleaded mr chick  nonsense habit returned his wife if youre a rational being dont make such ridiculous excuses habit if i was to get a habit as you call it of walking on the ceiling like the flies i should hear enough of it i daresay  it appeared so probable that such a habit might be attended with some degree of notoriety that mr chick didnt venture to dispute the position  bowwowwow repeated mrs chick with an emphasis of blighting contempt on the last syllable more like a professional singer with the hydrophobia than a man in your station of life  hows the baby loo asked mr chick to change the subject  what baby do you mean answered mrs chick  the poor bereaved little baby said mr chick i dont know of any other my dear  you dont know of any otherretorted mrs chick more shame for you i was going to say  mr chick looked astonished  i am sure the morning i have had with that diningroom downstairs one mass of babies no one in their senses would believe  one mass of babies repeated mr chick staring with an alarmed expression about him  it would have occurred to most men said mrs chick that poor dear fanny being no morethose words of mine will always be a balm and comfort to me here she dried her eyes it becomes necessary to provide a nurse  oh ah said mr chick toorrusuch is life i mean i hope you are suited my dear  indeed i am not said mrs chick nor likely to be so far as i can see and in the meantime the poor child seems likely to be starved to death paul is so very particularnaturally so of course having set his whole heart on this one boyand there are so many objections to everybody that offers that i dont see myself the least chance of an arrangement meanwhile of course the child is  going to the devil said mr chick thoughtfully to be sure  admonished however that he had committed himself by the indignation expressed in mrs chicks countenance at the idea of a dombey going there and thinking to atone for his misconduct by a bright suggestion he added  couldnt something temporary be done with a teapot  if he had meant to bring the subject prematurely to a close he could not have done it more effectually after looking at him for some moments in silent resignation mrs chick said she trusted he hadnt said it in aggravation because that would do very little honour to his heart she trusted he hadnt said it seriously because that would do very little honour to his head as in any case he couldnt however sanguine his disposition hope to offer a remark that would be a greater outrage on human nature in general we would beg to leave the discussion at that point  mrs chick then walked majestically to the window and peeped through the blind attracted by the sound of wheels mr chick finding that his destiny was for the time against him said no more and walked off but it was not always thus with mr chick he was often in the ascendant himself and at those times punished louisa roundly in their matrimonial bickerings they were upon the whole a wellmatched fairlybalanced giveandtake couple it would have been generally speaking very difficult to have betted on the winner often when mr chick seemed beaten he would suddenly make a start turn the tables clatter them about the ears of mrs chick and carry all before him being liable himself to similar unlooked for checks from mrs chick their little contests usually possessed a character of uncertainty that was very animating  miss tox had arrived on the wheels just now alluded to and came running into the room in a breathless condition my dear louisasaid miss tox is the vacancy still unsupplied  you good soul yes said mrs chick  then my dear louisa returned miss tox i hope and believebut in one moment my dear ill introduce the party  running downstairs again as fast as she had run up miss tox got the party out of the hackneycoach and soon returned with it under convoy  it then appeared that she had used the word not in its legal or business acceptation when it merely expresses an individual but as a noun of multitude or signifying many for miss tox escorted a plump rosycheeked wholesome applefaced young woman with an infant in her arms a younger woman not so plump but applefaced also who led a plump and applefaced child in each hand another plump and also applefaced boy who walked by himself and finally a plump and applefaced man who carried in his arms another plump and applefaced boy whom he stood down on the floor and admonished in a husky whisper to kitch hold of his brother johnny  my dear louisa said miss tox knowing your great anxiety and wishing to relieve it i posted off myself to the queen charlottes royal married females which you had forgot and put the question was there anybody there that they thought would suit no they said there was not when they gave me that answer i do assure you my dear i was almost driven to despair on your account but it did so happen that one of the royal married females hearing the inquiry reminded the matron of another who had gone to her own home and who she said would in all likelihood be most satisfactory the moment i heard this and had it corroborated by the matronexcellent references and unimpeachable characteri got the address my dear and posted off again  like the dear good tox you are said louisa  not at all returned miss tox dont say so arriving at the house the cleanest place my dear you might eat your dinner off the floor i found the whole family sitting at table and feeling that no account of them could be half so comfortable to you and mr dombey as the sight of them all together i brought them all away this gentleman said miss tox pointing out the applefaced man is the father will you have the goodness to come a little forward sir  the applefaced man having sheepishly complied with this request stood chuckling and grinning in a front row  this is his wife of course said miss tox singling out the young woman with the baby how do you do polly  im pretty well i thank you maam said polly  by way of bringing her out dexterously miss tox had made the inquiry as in condescension to an old acquaintance whom she hadnt seen for a fortnight or so  im glad to hear it said miss tox the other young woman is her unmarried sister who lives with them and would take care of her children her names jemima how do you do jemima  im pretty well i thank you maam returned jemima  im very glad indeed to hear it said miss tox i hope youll keep so five children youngest six weeks the fine little boy with the blister on his nose is the eldest the blister i believe said miss tox looking round upon the family is not constitutional but accidental  the applefaced man was understood to growl flat iron  i beg your pardon sir said miss tox did you  flat iron he repeated  oh yes said miss tox yes quite true i forgot the little creature in his mothers absence smelt a warm flat iron youre quite right sir you were going to have the goodness to inform me when we arrived at the door that you were by trade a  stoker said the man  a choker said miss tox quite aghast  stoker said the man steam ingine  ohh yes returned miss tox looking thoughtfully at him and seeming still to have but a very imperfect understanding of his meaning  and how do you like it sir  which mum said the man  that replied miss tox your trade  oh pretty well mum the ashes sometimes gets in here touching his chest and makes a man speak gruff as at the present time but it is ashes mum not crustiness  miss tox seemed to be so little enlightened by this reply as to find a difficulty in pursuing the subject but mrs chick relieved her by entering into a close private examination of polly her children her marriage certificate testimonials and so forth polly coming out unscathed from this ordeal mrs chick withdrew with her report to her brothers room and as an emphatic comment on it and corroboration of it carried the two rosiest little toodles with her toodle being the family name of the applefaced family  mr dombey had remained in his own apartment since the death of his wife absorbed in visions of the youth education and destination of his baby son something lay at the bottom of his cool heart colder and heavier than its ordinary load but it was more a sense of the childs loss than his own awakening within him an almost angry sorrow that the life and progress on which he built such hopes should be endangered in the outset by so mean a want that dombey and son should be tottering for a nurse was a sore humiliation and yet in his pride and jealousy he viewed with so much bitterness the thought of being dependent for the very first step towards the accomplishment of his souls desire on a hired servingwoman who would be to the child for the time all that even his alliance could have made his own wife that in every new rejection of a candidate he felt a secret pleasure the time had now come however when he could no longer be divided between these two sets of feelings the less so as there seemed to be no flaw in the title of polly toodle after his sister had set it forth with many commendations on the indefatigable friendship of miss tox  these children look healthy said mr dombey but my god to think of their some day claiming a sort of relationship to paul  but what relationship is there louisa began  is there echoed mr dombey who had not intended his sister to participate in the thought he had unconsciously expressed is there did you say louisa  can there be i mean  why none said mr dombey sternly the whole world knows that i presume grief has not made me idiotic louisa take them away louisa let me see this woman and her husband  mrs chick bore off the tender pair of toodles and presently returned with that tougher couple whose presence her brother had commanded  my good woman said mr dombey turning round in his easy chair as one piece and not as a man with limbs and joints i understand you are poor and wish to earn money by nursing the little boy my son who has been so prematurely deprived of what can never be replaced i have no objection to your adding to the comforts of your family by that means so far as i can tell you seem to be a deserving object but i must impose one or two conditions on you before you enter my house in that capacity while you are here i must stipulate that you are always known assay as richardsan ordinary name and convenient have you any objection to be known as richards you had better consult your husband  well said mr dombey after a pretty long pause what does your husband say to your being called richards  as the husband did nothing but chuckle and grin and continually draw his right hand across his mouth moistening the palm mrs toodle after nudging him twice or thrice in vain dropped a curtsey and replied that perhaps if she was to be called out of her name it would be considered in the wages  oh of course said mr dombey i desire to make it a question of wages altogether now richards if you nurse my bereaved child i wish you to remember this always you will receive a liberal stipend in return for the discharge of certain duties in the performance of which i wish you to see as little of your family as possible when those duties cease to be required and rendered and the stipend ceases to be paid there is an end of all relations between us do you understand me  mrs toodle seemed doubtful about it and as to toodle himself he had evidently no doubt whatever that he was all abroad  you have children of your own said mr dombey it is not at all in this bargain that you need become attached to my child or that my child need become attached to you i dont expect or desire anything of the kind quite the reverse when you go away from here you will have concluded what is a mere matter of bargain and sale hiring and letting and will stay away the child will cease to remember you and you will cease if you please to remember the child  mrs toodle with a little more colour in her cheeks than she had had before said she hoped she knew her place  i hope you do richards said mr dombey i have no doubt you know it very well indeed it is so plain and obvious that it could hardly be otherwise louisa my dear arrange with richards about money and let her have it when and how she pleases mr whatsyour name a word with you if you please  thus arrested on the threshold as he was following his wife out of the room toodle returned and confronted mr dombey alone he was a strong loose roundshouldered shuffling shaggy fellow on whom his clothes sat negligently with a good deal of hair and whisker deepened in its natural tint perhaps by smoke and coaldust hard knotty hands and a square forehead as coarse in grain as the bark of an oak a thorough contrast in all respects to mr dombey who was one of those closeshaved closecut moneyed gentlemen who are glossy and crisp like new banknotes and who seem to be artificially braced and tightened as by the stimulating action of golden showerbaths  you have a son i believe said mr dombey  four on em sir four hims and a her all alive  why its as much as you can afford to keep them said mr dombey  i couldnt hardly afford but one thing in the world less sir  what is that  to lose em sir  can you read asked mr dombey  why not partickler sir  write  with chalk sir  with anything  i could make shift to chalk a little bit i think if i was put to it said toodle after some reflection  and yet said mr dombey you are two or three and thirty i suppose  thereabouts i suppose sir answered toodle after more reflection  then why dont you learn asked mr dombey  so im a going to sir one of my little boys is a going to learn me when hes old enough and been to school himself  well said mr dombey after looking at him attentively and with no great favour as he stood gazing round the room principally round the ceiling and still drawing his hand across and across his mouth you heard what i said to your wife just now  polly heerd it said toodle jerking his hat over his shoulder in the direction of the door with an air of perfect confidence in his better half its all right  but i ask you if you heard it you did i suppose and understood it pursued mr dombey  i heerd it said toodle but i dont know as i understood it rightly sir account of being no scholar and the words beingask your pardonrayther high but polly heerd it its all right  as you appear to leave everything to her said mr dombey frustrated in his intention of impressing his views still more distinctly on the husband as the stronger character i suppose it is of no use my saying anything to you  not a bit said toodle polly heerd it shes awake sir  i wont detain you any longer then returned mr dombey disappointed where have you worked all your life  mostly underground sir till i got married i come to the level then im a going on one of these here railroads when they comes into full play  as he added in one of his hoarse whispers we means to bring up little biler to that line mr dombey inquired haughtily who little biler was  the eldest on em sir said toodle with a smile it aint a common name sermuchser that when he was took to church the genlmn said it wamt a chrisen one and he couldnt give it but we always calls him biler just the same for we dont mean no harm not we  do you mean to say man inquired mr dombey looking at him with marked displeasure that you have called a child after a boiler  no no sir returned toodle with a tender consideration for his mistake i should hope not no sir arter a biler sir the steamingine was amost as good as a godfather to him and so we called him biler dont you see  as the last straw breaks the laden camels back this piece of information crushed the sinking spirits of mr dombey he motioned his childs fosterfather to the door who departed by no means unwillingly and then turning the key paced up and down the room in solitary wretchedness  it would be harsh and perhaps not altogether true to say of him that he felt these rubs and gratings against his pride more keenly than he had felt his wifes death but certainly they impressed that event upon him with new force and communicated to it added weight and bitterness it was a rude shock to his sense of property in his child that these peoplethe mere dust of the earth as he thought themshould be necessary to him and it was natural that in proportion as he felt disturbed by it he should deplore the occurrence which had made them so for all his starched impenetrable dignity and composure he wiped blinding tears from his eyes as he paced up and down his room and often said with an emotion of which he would not for the world have had a witness poor little fellow  it may have been characteristic of mr dombeys pride that he pitied himself through the child not poor me not poor widower confiding by constraint in the wife of an ignorant hind who has been working mostly underground all his life and yet at whose door death had never knocked and at whose poor table four sons daily sitbut poor little fellow  those words being on his lips it occurred to himand it is an instance of the strong attraction with which his hopes and fears and all his thoughts were tending to one centrethat a great temptation was being placed in this womans way her infant was a boy too now would it be possible for her to change them  though he was soon satisfied that he had dismissed the idea as romantic and unlikelythough possible there was no denyinghe could not help pursuing it so far as to entertain within himself a picture of what his condition would be if he should discover such an imposture when he was grown old whether a man so situated would be able to pluck away the result of so many years of usage confidence and belief from the impostor and endow a stranger with it  but it was idle speculating thus it couldnt happen in a moment afterwards he determined that it could but that such women were constantly observed and had no opportunity given them for the accomplishment of such a design even when they were so wicked as to entertain it in another moment he was remembering how few such cases seemed to have ever happened in another moment he was wondering whether they ever happened and were not found out  as his unusual emotion subsided these misgivings gradually melted away though so much of their shadow remained behind that he was constant in his resolution to look closely after richards himself without appearing to do so being now in an easier frame of mind he regarded the womans station as rather an advantageous circumstance than otherwise by placing in itself a broad distance between her and the child and rendering their separation easy and natural thence he passed to the contemplation of the future glories of dombey and son and dismissed the memory of his wife for the time being with a tributary sigh or two  meanwhile terms were ratified and agreed upon between mrs chick and richards with the assistance of miss tox and richards being with much ceremony invested with the dombey baby as if it were an order resigned her own with many tears and kisses to jemima glasses of wine were then produced to sustain the drooping spirits of the family and miss tox busying herself in dispensing tastes to the younger branches bred them up to their fathers business with such surprising expedition that she made chokers of four of them in a quarter of a minute  youll take a glass yourself sir wont you said miss tox as toodle appeared  thankee mum said toodle since you are suppressing  and youre very glad to leave your dear good wife in such a comfortable home aint you sirsaid miss tox nodding and winking at him stealthily  no mum said toodle heres wishing of her back agin  polly cried more than ever at this so mrs chick who had her matronly apprehensions that this indulgence in grief might be prejudicial to the little dombey acid indeed she whispered miss tox hastened to the rescue  your little child will thrive charmingly with your sister jemima richards said mrs chick and you have only to make an effortthis is a world of effort you know richardsto be very happy indeed you have been already measured for your mourning havent you richards  yees maam sobbed polly  and itll fit beautifully i know said mrs chick for the same young person has made me many dresses the very best materials too  lor youll be so smart said miss tox that your husband wont know you will you sir  i should know her said toodle gruffly anyhows and anywheres  toodle was evidently not to be bought over  as to living richards you know pursued mrs chick why the very best of everything will be at your disposal you will order your little dinner every day and anything you take a fancy to im sure will be as readily provided as if you were a lady  yes to be sure said miss tox keeping up the ball with great sympathy and as to porterquite unlimited will it not louisa  oh certainly returned mrs chick in the same tone with a little abstinence you know my dear in point of vegetables  and pickles perhaps suggested miss tox  with such exceptions said louisa shell consult her choice entirely and be under no restraint at all my love  and then of course you know said miss tox however fond she is of her own dear little childand im sure louisa you dont blame her for being fond of it  oh no cried mrs chick benignantly  still resumed miss tox she naturally must be interested in her young charge and must consider it a privilege to see a little cherub connected with the superior classes gradually unfolding itself from day to day at one common fountainis it not so louisa  most undoubtedly said mrs chick you see my love shes already quite contented and comfortable and means to say goodbye to her sister jemima and her little pets and her good honest husband with a light heart and a smile dont she my dear  oh yes cried miss tox to be sure she does  notwithstanding which however poor polly embraced them all round in great distress and coming to her spouse at last could not make up her mind to part from him until he gently disengaged himself at the close of the following allegorical piece of consolation  polly old ooman whatever you do my darling hold up your head and fight low thats the only rule as i know on thatll carry anyone through life you always have held up your head and fought low polly do it now or bricks is no longer so god bless you polly me and jmima will do your duty by you and with relating to yourn hold up your head and fight low polly and you cant go wrong  fortified by this golden secret folly finally ran away to avoid any more particular leavetaking between herself and the children but the stratagem hardly succeeded as well as it deserved for the smallest boy but one divining her intent immediately began swarming upstairs after herif that word of doubtful etymology be admissibleon his arms and legs while the eldest known in the family by the name of biler in remembrance of the steam engine beat a demoniacal tattoo with his boots expressive of grief in which he was joined by the rest of the family  a quantity of oranges and halfpence thrust indiscriminately on each young toodle checked the first violence of their regret and the family were speedily transported to their own home by means of the hackneycoach kept in waiting for that purpose the children under the guardianship of jemima blocked up the window and dropped out oranges and halfpence all the way along mr toodle himself preferred to ride behind among the spikes as being the mode of conveyance to which he was best accustomed    chapter 3 in which mr dombey as a man and a father is seen at the head of the homedepartment   the funeral of the deceased lady having been performed to the entire satisfaction of the undertaker as well as of the neighbourhood at large which is generally disposed to be captious on such a point and is prone to take offence at any omissions or shortcomings in the ceremonies the various members of mr dombeys household subsided into their several places in the domestic system that small world like the great one out of doors had the capacity of easily forgetting its dead and when the cook had said she was a quiettempered lady and the housekeeper had said it was the common lot and the butler had said whod have thought it and the housemaid had said she couldnt hardly believe it and the footman had said it seemed exactly like a dream they had quite worn the subject out and began to think their mourning was wearing rusty too  on richards who was established upstairs in a state of honourable captivity the dawn of her new life seemed to break cold and grey mr dombeys house was a large one on the shady side of a tall dark dreadfully genteel street in the region between portland place and bryanstone square it was a corner house with great wide areas containing cellars frowned upon by barred windows and leered at by crookedeyed doors leading to dustbins it was a house of dismal state with a circular back to it containing a whole suite of drawingrooms looking upon a gravelled yard where two gaunt trees with blackened trunks and branches rattled rather than rustled their leaves were so smokeddried the summer sun was never on the street but in the morning about breakfasttime when it came with the watercarts and the old clothes men and the people with geraniums and the umbrellamender and the man who trilled the little bell of the dutch clock as he went along it was soon gone again to return no more that day and the bands of music and the straggling punchs shows going after it left it a prey to the most dismal of organs and white mice with now and then a porcupine to vary the entertainments until the butlers whose families were dining out began to stand at the housedoors in the twilight and the lamplighter made his nightly failure in attempting to brighten up the street with gas  it was as blank a house inside as outside when the funeral was over mr dombey ordered the furniture to be covered upperhaps to preserve it for the son with whom his plans were all associatedand the rooms to be ungarnished saving such as he retained for himself on the ground floor accordingly mysterious shapes were made of tables and chairs heaped together in the middle of rooms and covered over with great windingsheets bellhandles windowblinds and lookingglasses being papered up in journals daily and weekly obtruded fragmentary accounts of deaths and dreadful murders every chandelier or lustre muffled in holland looked like a monstrous tear depending from the ceilings eye odours as from vaults and damp places came out of the chimneys the dead and buried lady was awful in a pictureframe of ghastly bandages every gust of wind that rose brought eddying round the corner from the neighbouring mews some fragments of the straw that had been strewn before the house when she was ill mildewed remains of which were still cleaving to the neighbourhood and these being always drawn by some invisible attraction to the threshold of the dirty house to let immediately opposite addressed a dismal eloquence to mr dombeys windows  the apartments which mr dombey reserved for his own inhabiting were attainable from the hall and consisted of a sittingroom a library which was in fact a dressingroom so that the smell of hotpressed paper vellum morocco and russia leather contended in it with the smell of divers pairs of boots and a kind of conservatory or little glass breakfastroom beyond commanding a prospect of the trees before mentioned and generally speaking of a few prowling cats these three rooms opened upon one another in the morning when mr dombey was at his breakfast in one or other of the two firstmentioned of them as well as in the afternoon when he came home to dinner a bell was rung for richards to repair to this glass chamber and there walk to and fro with her young charge from the glimpses she caught of mr dombey at these times sitting in the dark distance looking out towards the infant from among the dark heavy furniturethe house had been inhabited for years by his father and in many of its appointments was oldfashioned and grimshe began to entertain ideas of him in his solitary state as if he were a lone prisoner in a cell or a strange apparition that was not to be accosted or understood mr dombey came to be in the course of a few days invested in his own person to her simple thinking with all the mystery and gloom of his house as she walked up and down the glass room or sat hushing the baby therewhich she very often did for hours together when the dusk was closing in tooshe would sometimes try to pierce the gloom beyond and make out how he was looking and what he was doing sensible that she was plainly to be seen by him however she never dared to pry in that direction but very furtively and for a moment at a time consequently she made out nothing and mr dombey in his den remained a very shade  little paul dombeys fostermother had led this life herself and had carried little paul through it for some weeks and had returned upstairs one day from a melancholy saunter through the dreary rooms of state she never went out without mrs chick who called on fine mornings usually accompanied by miss tox to take her and baby for an airingor in other words to march them gravely up and down the pavement like a walking funeral when as she was sitting in her own room the door was slowly and quietly opened and a darkeyed little girl looked in  its miss florence come home from her aunts no doubt thought richards who had never seen the child before hope i see you well miss  is that my brother asked the child pointing to the baby  yes my pretty answered richards come and kiss him  but the child instead of advancing looked her earnestly in the face and said  what have you done with my mama  lord bless the little creeter cried richards what a sad question i done nothing miss  what have they done with my mama inquired the child with exactly the same look and manner  i never saw such a melting thing in all my life said richards who naturally substituted for this child one of her own inquiring for herself in like circumstances come nearer here my dear miss dont be afraid of me  i am not afraid of you said the child drawing nearer but i want to know what they have done with my mama  her heart swelled so as she stood before the woman looking into her eyes that she was fain to press her little hand upon her breast and hold it there yet there was a purpose in the child that prevented both her slender figure and her searching gaze from faltering  my darling said richards you wear that pretty black frock in remembrance of your mama  i can remember my mama returned the child with tears springing to her eyes in any frock  but people put on black to remember people when theyre gone  where gone asked the child  come and sit down by me said richards and ill tell you a story  with a quick perception that it was intended to relate to what she had asked little florence laid aside the bonnet she had held in her hand until now and sat down on a stool at the nurses feet looking up into her face  once upon a time said richards there was a ladya very good lady and her little daughter dearly loved her  a very good lady and her little daughter dearly loved her repeated the child  who when god thought it right that it should be so was taken ill and died  the child shuddered  died never to be seen again by anyone on earth and was buried in the ground where the trees grow  the cold ground said the child shuddering again no the warm ground returned polly seizing her advantage where the ugly little seeds turn into beautiful flowers and into grass and corn and i dont know what all besides where good people turn into bright angels and fly away to heaven  the child who had dropped her head raised it again and sat looking at her intently  so let me see said polly not a little flurried between this earnest scrutiny her desire to comfort the child her sudden success and her very slight confidence in her own powers so when this lady died wherever they took her or wherever they put her she went to god and she prayed to him this lady did said polly affecting herself beyond measure being heartily in earnest to teach her little daughter to be sure of that in her heart and to know that she was happy there and loved her still and to hope and tryoh all her lifeto meet her there one day never never never to part any more  it was my mama exclaimed the child springing up and clasping her round the neck  and the childs heart said polly drawing her to her breast the little daughters heart was so full of the truth of this that even when she heard it from a strange nurse that couldnt tell it right but was a poor mother herself and that was all she found a comfort in itdidnt feel so lonelysobbed and cried upon her bosomtook kindly to the baby lying in her lapandthere there there said polly smoothing the childs curls and dropping tears upon them there poor dear  oh well miss floy and wont your pa be angry neither cried a quick voice at the door proceeding from a short brown womanly girl of fourteen with a little snub nose and black eyes like jet beads when it was tickerlerly given out that you wasnt to go and worrit the wet nurse  she dont worry me was the surprised rejoinder of polly i am very fond of children  oh but begging your pardon mrs richards that dont matter you know returned the blackeyed girl who was so desperately sharp and biting that she seemed to make ones eyes water i may be very fond of pennywinkles mrs richards but it dont follow that im to have em for tea well it dont matter said polly oh thankee mrs richards dont it returned the sharp girl remembering however if youll be so good that miss floys under my charge and master pauls under yourn  but still we neednt quarrel said polly  oh no mrs richards rejoined spitfire not at all i dont wish it we neednt stand upon that footing miss floy being a permanency master paul a temporary spitfire made use of none but comma pauses shooting out whatever she had to say in one sentence and in one breath if possible  miss florence has just come home hasnt she asked polly  yes mrs richards just come and here miss floy before youve been in the house a quarter of an hour you go a smearing your wet face against the expensive mourning that mrs richards is a wearing for your ma with this remonstrance young spitfire whose real name was susan nipper detached the child from her new friend by a wrenchas if she were a tooth but she seemed to do it more in the excessively sharp exercise of her official functions than with any deliberate unkindness  shell be quite happy now she has come home again said polly nodding to her with an encouraging smile upon her wholesome face and will be so pleased to see her dear papa tonight  lork mrs richards cried miss nipper taking up her words with a jerk dont see her dear papa indeed i should like to see her do it  wont she then asked polly  lork mrs richards no her pas a deal too wrapped up in somebody else and before there was a somebody else to be wrapped up in she never was a favourite girls are thrown away in this house mrs richards i assure you  the child looked quickly from one nurse to the other as if she understood and felt what was said  you surprise me cried folly hasnt mr dombey seen her since  no interrupted susan nipper not once since and he hadnt hardly set his eyes upon her before that for months and months and i dont think hed have known her for his own child if he had met her in the streets or would know her for his own child if he was to meet her in the streets tomorrow mrs richards as to me said spitfire with a giggle i doubt if hes aweer of my existence  pretty dear said richards meaning not miss nipper but the little florence  oh theres a tartar within a hundred miles of where were now in conversation i can tell you mrs richards present company always excepted too said susan nipper wish you good morning mrs richards now miss floy you come along with me and dont go hanging back like a naughty wicked child that judgments is no example to dont  in spite of being thus adjured and in spite also of some hauling on the part of susan nipper tending towards the dislocation of her right shoulder little florence broke away and kissed her new friend affectionately  oh dear after it was given out so tickerlerly that mrs richards wasnt to be made free with exclaimed susan very well miss floy  god bless the sweet thing said richards goodbye dear  goodbye returned the child god bless you i shall come to see you again soon and youll come to see me susan will let us wont you susan  spitfire seemed to be in the main a goodnatured little body although a disciple of that school of trainers of the young idea which holds that childhood like money must be shaken and rattled and jostled about a good deal to keep it bright for being thus appealed to with some endearing gestures and caresses she folded her small arms and shook her head and conveyed a relenting expression into her verywideopen black eyes  it aint right of you to ask it miss floy for you know i cant refuse you but mrs richards and me will see what can be done if mrs richards likes i may wish you see to take a voyage to chaney mrs richards but i maynt know how to leave the london docks  richards assented to the proposition  this house aint so exactly ringing with merrymaking said miss nipper that one need be lonelier than one must be your toxes and your chickses may draw out my two front double teeth mrs richards but thats no reason why i need offer em the whole set  this proposition was also assented to by richards as an obvious one  so im able im suresaid susan nipper to live friendly mrs richards while master paul continues a permanency if the means can be planned out without going openly against orders but goodness gracious miss floy you havent got your things off yet you naughty child you havent come along  with these words susan nipper in a transport of coercion made a charge at her young ward and swept her out of the room  the child in her grief and neglect was so gentle so quiet and uncomplaining was possessed of so much affection that no one seemed to care to have and so much sorrowful intelligence that no one seemed to mind or think about the wounding of that pollys heart was sore when she was left alone again in the simple passage that had taken place between herself and the motherless little girl her own motherly heart had been touched no less than the childs and she felt as the child did that there was something of confidence and interest between them from that moment  notwithstanding mr toodles great reliance on polly she was perhaps in point of artificial accomplishments very little his superior she had been goodhumouredly working and drudging for her life all her life and was a sober steadygoing person with matteroffact ideas about the butcher and baker and the division of pence into farthings but she was a good plain sample of a nature that is ever in the mass better truer higher nobler quicker to feel and much more constant to retain all tenderness and pity selfdenial and devotion than the nature of men and perhaps unlearned as she was she could have brought a dawning knowledge home to mr dombey at that early day which would not then have struck him in the end like lightning  but this is from the purpose polly only thought at that time of improving on her successful propitiation of miss nipper and devising some means of having little florence aide her lawfully and without rebellion an opening happened to present itself that very night  she had been rung down into the glass room as usual and had walked about and about it a long time with the baby in her arms when to her great surprise and dismay mr dombeywhom she had seen at first leaning on his elbow at the table and afterwards walking up and down the middle room drawing each time a little nearer she thought to the open folding doorscame out suddenly and stopped before her  good evening richards  just the same austere stiff gentleman as he had appeared to her on that first day such a hardlooking gentleman that she involuntarily dropped her eyes and her curtsey at the same time  how is master paul richards  quite thriving sir and well  he looks so said mr dombey glancing with great interest at the tiny face she uncovered for his observation and yet affecting to be half careless of it they give you everything you want i hope  oh yes thank you sir  she suddenly appended such an obvious hesitation to this reply however that mr dombey who had turned away stopped and turned round again inquiringly  if you please sir the child is very much disposed to take notice of things said richards with another curtsey andupstairs is a little dull for him perhaps sir  i begged them to take you out for airings constantly said mr dombey very well you shall go out oftener youre quite right to mention it  i beg your pardon sir faltered polly but we go out quite plenty sir thank you  what would you have then asked mr dombey  indeed sir i dont exactly know said polly unless  yes  i believe nothing is so good for making children lively and cheerful sir as seeing other children playing about em observed polly taking courage  i think i mentioned to you richards when you came here said mr dombey with a frown that i wished you to see as little of your family as possible  oh dear yes sir i wasnt so much as thinking of that  i am glad of it said mr dombey hastily you can continue your walk if you please  with that he disappeared into his inner room and polly had the satisfaction of feeling that he had thoroughly misunderstood her object and that she had fallen into disgrace without the least advancement of her purpose  next night she found him walking about the conservatory when she came down as she stopped at the door checked by this unusual sight and uncertain whether to advance or retreat he called her in his mind was too much set on dombey and son it soon appeared to admit of his having forgotten her suggestion  if you really think that sort of society is good for the child he said sharply as if there had been no interval since she proposed it wheres miss florence  nothing could be better than miss florence sir said polly eagerly but i understood from her maid that they were not to  mr dombey rang the bell and walked till it was answered  tell them always to let miss florence be with richards when she chooses and go out with her and so forth tell them to let the children be together when richards wishes it  the iron was now hot and richards striking on it boldlyit was a good cause and she bold in it though instinctively afraid of mr dombeyrequested that miss florence might be sent down then and there to make friends with her little brother  she feigned to be dandling the child as the servant retired on this errand but she thought that she saw mr dombeys colour changed that the expression of his face quite altered that he turned hurriedly as if to gainsay what he had said or she had said or both and was only deterred by very shame  and she was right the last time he had seen his slighted child there had been that in the sad embrace between her and her dying mother which was at once a revelation and a reproach to him let him be absorbed as he would in the son on whom he built such high hopes he could not forget that closing scene he could not forget that he had had no part in it that at the bottom of its clear depths of tenderness and truth lay those two figures clasped in each others arms while he stood on the bank above them looking down a mere spectatornot a sharer with themquite shut out  unable to exclude these things from his remembrance or to keep his mind free from such imperfect shapes of the meaning with which they were fraught as were able to make themselves visible to him through the mist of his pride his previous feeling of indifference towards little florence changed into an uneasiness of an extraordinary kind young as she was and possessing in any eyes but his and perhaps in his too even more than the usual amount of childish simplicity and confidence he almost felt as if she watched and distrusted him as if she held the clue to something secret in his breast of the nature of which he was hardly informed himself as if she had an innate knowledge of one jarring and discordant string within him and her very breath could sound it  his feeling about the child had been negative from her birth he had never conceived an aversion to her it had not been worth his while or in his humour she had never been a positively disagreeable object to him but now he was ill at ease about her she troubled his peace he would have preferred to put her idea aside altogether if he had known how perhapswho shall decide on such mysterieshe was afraid that he might come to hate her  when little florence timidly presented herself mr dombey stopped in his pacing up and down and looked towards her had he looked with greater interest and with a fathers eye he might have read in her keen glance the impulses and fears that made her waver the passionate desire to run clinging to him crying as she hid her face in his embrace oh father try to love me theres no one else the dread of a repulse the fear of being too bold and of offending him the pitiable need in which she stood of some assurance and encouragement and how her overcharged young heart was wandering to find some natural restingplace for its sorrow and affection  but he saw nothing of this he saw her pause irresolutely at the door and look towards him and he saw no more  come in he said come in what is the child afraid of  she came in and after glancing round her for a moment with an uncertain air stood pressing her small hands hard together close within the door  come here florence said her father coldly do you know who i am  yes papa  have you nothing to say to me  the tears that stood in her eyes as she raised them quickly to his face were frozen by the expression it wore she looked down again and put out her trembling hand  mr dombey took it loosely in his own and stood looking down upon her for a moment as if he knew as little as the child what to say or do  there be a good girl he said patting her on the head and regarding her as it were by stealth with a disturbed and doubtful look go to richards go  his little daughter hesitated for another instant as though she would have clung about him still or had some lingering hope that he might raise her in his arms and kiss her she looked up in his face once more he thought how like her expression was then to what it had been when she looked round at the doctorthat nightand instinctively dropped her hand and turned away  it was not difficult to perceive that florence was at a great disadvantage in her fathers presence it was not only a constraint upon the childs mind but even upon the natural grace and freedom of her actions as she sported and played about her baby brother that night her manner was seldom so winning and so pretty as it naturally was and sometimes when in his pacing to and fro he came near her she had perhaps for the moment forgotten him it changed upon the instant and became forced and embarrassed  still polly persevered with all the better heart for seeing this and judging of mr dombey by herself had great confidence in the mute appeal of poor little florences mourning dress its hard indeed thought polly if he takes only to one little motherless child when he has another and that a girl before his eyes  so polly kept her before his eyes as long as she could and managed so well with little paul as to make it very plain that he was all the livelier for his sisters company when it was time to withdraw upstairs again she would have sent florence into the inner room to say goodnight to her father but the child was timid and drew back and when she urged her again said spreading her hands before her eyes as if to shut out her own unworthiness oh no no he dont want me he dont want me  the little altercation between them had attracted the notice of mr dombey who inquired from the table where he was sitting at his wine what the matter was  miss florence was afraid of interrupting sir if she came in to say goodnight said richards  it doesnt matter returned mr dombey you can let her come and go without regarding me  the child shrunk as she listenedand was gone before her humble friend looked round again  however polly triumphed not a little in the success of her wellintentioned scheme and in the address with which she had brought it to bear whereof she made a full disclosure to spitfire when she was once more safely entrenched upstairs miss nipper received that proof of her confidence as well as the prospect of their free association for the future rather coldly and was anything but enthusiastic in her demonstrations of joy  i thought you would have been pleased said polly  oh yes mrs richards im very well pleased thank you returned susan who had suddenly become so very upright that she seemed to have put an additional bone in her stays  you dont show it said polly  oh being only a permanency i couldnt be expected to show it like a temporary said susan nipper temporaries carries it all before em here i find but though theres a excellent partywall between this house and the next i maynt exactly like to go to it mrs richards notwithstanding    chapter 4 in which some more first appearances are made on the stage of these adventures   though the offices of dombey and son were within the liberties of the city of london and within hearing of bow bells when their clashing voices were not drowned by the uproar in the streets yet were there hints of adventurous and romantic story to be observed in some of the adjacent objects gog and magog held their state within ten minutes walk the royal exchange was close at hand the bank of england with its vaults of gold and silver down among the dead men underground was their magnificent neighbour just round the corner stood the rich east india house teeming with suggestions of precious stuffs and stones tigers elephants howdahs hookahs umbrellas palm trees palanquins and gorgeous princes of a brown complexion sitting on carpets with their slippers very much turned up at the toes anywhere in the immediate vicinity there might be seen pictures of ships speeding away full sail to all parts of the world outfitting warehouses ready to pack off anybody anywhere fully equipped in half an hour and little timber midshipmen in obsolete naval uniforms eternally employed outside the shop doors of nautical instrumentmakers in taking observations of the hackney carriages  sole master and proprietor of one of these effigiesof that which might be called familiarly the woodenestof that which thrust itself out above the pavement right leg foremost with a suavity the least endurable and had the shoe buckles and flapped waistcoat the least reconcileable to human reason and bore at its right eye the most offensively disproportionate piece of machinerysole master and proprietor of that midshipman and proud of him too an elderly gentleman in a welsh wig had paid houserent taxes rates and dues for more years than many a fullgrown midshipman of flesh and blood has numbered in his life and midshipmen who have attained a pretty green old age have not been wanting in the english navy  the stockintrade of this old gentleman comprised chronometers barometers telescopes compasses charts maps sextants quadrants and specimens of every kind of instrument used in the working of a ships course or the keeping of a ships reckoning or the prosecuting of a ships discoveries objects in brass and glass were in his drawers and on his shelves which none but the initiated could have found the top of or guessed the use of or having once examined could have ever got back again into their mahogany nests without assistance everything was jammed into the tightest cases fitted into the narrowest corners fenced up behind the most impertinent cushions and screwed into the acutest angles to prevent its philosophical composure from being disturbed by the rolling of the sea such extraordinary precautions were taken in every instance to save room and keep the thing compact and so much practical navigation was fitted and cushioned and screwed into every box whether the box was a mere slab as some were or something between a cocked hat and a starfish as others were and those quite mild and modest boxes as compared with others that the shop itself partaking of the general infection seemed almost to become a snug seagoing shipshape concern wanting only good searoom in the event of an unexpected launch to work its way securely to any desert island in the world  many minor incidents in the household life of the ships  instrumentmaker who was proud of his little midshipman assisted and bore out this fancy his acquaintance lying chiefly among shipchandlers and so forth he had always plenty of the veritable ships biscuit on his table it was familiar with dried meats and tongues possessing an extraordinary flavour of rope yarn pickles were produced upon it in great wholesale jars with dealer in all kinds of ships provisions on the label spirits were set forth in case bottles with no throats old prints of ships with alphabetical references to their various mysteries hung in frames upon the walls the tartar frigate under weigh was on the plates outlandish shells seaweeds and mosses decorated the chimneypiece the little wainscotted back parlour was lighted by a skylight like a cabin  here he lived too in skipperlike state all alone with his nephew walter a boy of fourteen who looked quite enough like a midshipman to carry out the prevailing idea but there it ended for solomon gills himself more generally called old sol was far from having a maritime appearance to say nothing of his welsh wig which was as plain and stubborn a welsh wig as ever was worn and in which he looked like anything but a rover he was a slow quietspoken thoughtful old fellow with eyes as red as if they had been small suns looking at you through a fog and a newlyawakened manner such as he might have acquired by having stared for three or four days successively through every optical instrument in his shop and suddenly came back to the world again to find it green the only change ever known in his outward man was from a complete suit of coffeecolour cut very square and ornamented with glaring buttons to the same suit of coffeecolour minus the inexpressibles which were then of a pale nankeen he wore a very precise shirtfrill and carried a pair of firstrate spectacles on his forehead and a tremendous chronometer in his fob rather than doubt which precious possession he would have believed in a conspiracy against it on part of all the clocks and watches in the city and even of the very sun itself such as he was such he had been in the shop and parlour behind the little midshipman for years upon years going regularly aloft to bed every night in a howling garret remote from the lodgers where when gentlemen of england who lived below at ease had little or no idea of the state of the weather it often blew great guns  it is halfpast five oclock and an autumn afternoon when the reader and solomon gills become acquainted solomon gills is in the act of seeing what time it is by the unimpeachable chronometer the usual daily clearance has been making in the city for an hour or more and the human tide is still rolling westward the streets have thinned as mr gills says very much it threatens to be wet tonight all the weatherglasses in the shop are in low spirits and the rain already shines upon the cocked hat of the wooden midshipman  wheres walter i wonder said solomon gills after he had carefully put up the chronometer again heres dinner been ready half an hour and no walter  turning round upon his stool behind the counter mr gills looked out among the instruments in the window to see if his nephew might be crossing the road no he was not among the bobbing umbrellas and he certainly was not the newspaper boy in the oilskin cap who was slowly working his way along the piece of brass outside writing his name over mr gillss name with his forefinger  if i didnt know he was too fond of me to make a run of it and go and enter himself aboard ship against my wishes i should begin to be fidgetty said mr gills tapping two or three weatherglasses with his knuckles i really should all in the downs eh lots of moisture well its wanted  i believe said mr gills blowing the dust off the glass top of a compasscase that you dont point more direct and due to the back parlour than the boys inclination does after all and the parlour couldnt bear straighter either due north not the twentieth part of a point either way  halloa uncle sol  halloa my boy cried the instrumentmaker turning briskly round what you are here are you  a cheerful looking merry boy fresh with running home in the rain fairfaced brighteyed and curlyhaired  well uncle how have you got on without me all day is dinner ready im so hungry  as to getting on said solomon goodnaturedly it would be odd if i couldnt get on without a young dog like you a great deal better than with you as to dinner being ready its been ready this half hour and waiting for you as to being hungry i am  come along then uncle cried the boy hurrah for the admiral  confound the admiral returned solomon gills you mean the lord mayor  no i dont cried the boy hurrah for the admiral hurrah for the admiral forward  at this word of command the welsh wig and its wearer were borne without resistance into the back parlour as at the head of a boarding party of five hundred men and uncle sol and his nephew were speedily engaged on a fried sole with a prospect of steak to follow  the lord mayor wally said solomon for ever no more admirals the lord mayors your admiral  oh is he though said the boy shaking his head why the sword bearers better than him he draws his sword sometimes  and a pretty figure he cuts with it for his pains returned the uncle listen to me wally listen to me look on the mantelshelf  why who has cocked my silver mug up there on a nail exclaimed the boy  i have said his uncle no more mugs now we must begin to drink out of glasses today walter we are men of business we belong to the city we started in life this morning  well uncle said the boy ill drink out of anything you like so long as i can drink to you heres to you uncle sol and hurrah for the  lord mayor interrupted the old man  for the lord mayor sheriffs common council and livery said the boy long life to em  the uncle nodded his head with great satisfaction and now he said lets hear something about the firm  oh theres not much to be told about the firm uncle said the boy plying his knife and fork its a precious dark set of offices and in the room where i sit theres a high fender and an iron safe and some cards about ships that are going to sail and an almanack and some desks and stools and an inkbottle and some books and some boxes and a lot of cobwebs and in one of em just over my head a shrivelledup bluebottle that looks as if it had hung there ever so long  nothing else said the uncle  no nothing else except an old birdcage i wonder how that ever came there and a coalscuttle  no bankers books or cheque books or bills or such tokens of wealth rolling in from day to day said old sol looking wistfully at his nephew out of the fog that always seemed to hang about him and laying an unctuous emphasis upon the words  oh yes plenty of that i suppose returned his nephew carelessly but all that sort of things in mr carkers room or mr morfins or mr dombeys  has mr dombey been there today inquired the uncle  oh yes in and out all day  he didnt take any notice of you i suppose  yes he did he walked up to my seati wish he wasnt so solemn and stiff uncleand said oh you are the son of mr gills the ships instrumentmaker nephew sir i said i said nephew boy said he but i could take my oath he said son uncle  youre mistaken i daresay its no matter  no its no matter but he neednt have been so sharp i thought there was no harm in it though he did say son then he told me that you had spoken to him about me and that he had found me employment in the house accordingly and that i was expected to be attentive and punctual and then he went away i thought he didnt seem to like me much  you mean i suppose observed the instrumentmaker that you didnt seem to like him much  well uncle returned the boy laughing perhaps so i never thought of that  solomon looked a little graver as he finished his dinner and glanced from time to time at the boys bright face when dinner was done and the cloth was cleared away the entertainment had been brought from a neighbouring eatinghouse he lighted a candle and went down below into a little cellar while his nephew standing on the mouldy staircase dutifully held the light after a moments groping here and there he presently returned with a very ancientlooking bottle covered with dust and dirt  why uncle sol said the boy what are you about thats the wonderful madeiratheres only one more bottle  uncle sol nodded his head implying that he knew very well what he was about and having drawn the cork in solemn silence filled two glasses and set the bottle and a third clean glass on the table  you shall drink the other bottle wally he said when you come to good fortune when you are a thriving respected happy man when the start in life you have made today shall have brought you as i pray heaven it mayto a smooth part of the course you have to run my child my love to you  some of the fog that hung about old sol seemed to have got into his throat for he spoke huskily his hand shook too as he clinked his glass against his nephews but having once got the wine to his lips he tossed it off like a man and smacked them afterwards  dear uncle said the boy affecting to make light of it while the tears stood in his eyes for the honour you have done me et cetera et cetera i shall now beg to propose mr solomon gills with three times three and one cheer more hurrah and youll return thanks uncle when we drink the last bottle together wont you  they clinked their glasses again and walter who was hoarding his wine took a sip of it and held the glass up to his eye with as critical an air as he could possibly assume  his uncle sat looking at him for some time in silence when their eyes at last met he began at once to pursue the theme that had occupied his thoughts aloud as if he had been speaking all the time  you see walter he said in truth this business is merely a habit with me i am so accustomed to the habit that i could hardly live if i relinquished it but theres nothing doing nothing doing when that uniform was worn pointing out towards the little midshipman then indeed fortunes were to be made and were made but competition competitionnew invention new inventionalteration alterationthe worlds gone past me i hardly know where i am myself much less where my customers are  never mind em uncle  since you came home from weekly boardingschool at peckham for instanceand thats ten days said solomon i dont remember more than one person that has come into the shop  two uncle dont you recollect there was the man who came to ask for change for a sovereign  thats the one said solomon  why uncle dont you call the woman anybody who came to ask the way to mileend turnpike  oh its true said solomon i forgot her two persons  to be sure they didnt buy anything cried the boy  no they didnt buy anything said solomon quietly  nor want anything cried the boy  no if they had theyd gone to another shop said solomon in the same tone  but there were two of em uncle cried the boy as if that were a great triumph you said only one  well wally resumed the old man after a short pause not being like the savages who came on robinson crusoes island we cant live on a man who asks for change for a sovereign and a woman who inquires the way to mileend turnpike as i said just now the world has gone past me i dont blame it but i no longer understand it tradesmen are not the same as they used to be apprentices are not the same business is not the same business commodities are not the same seveneighths of my stock is oldfashioned i am an oldfashioned man in an oldfashioned shop in a street that is not the same as i remember it i have fallen behind the time and am too old to catch it again even the noise it makes a long way ahead confuses me  walter was going to speak but his uncle held up his hand  therefore wallytherefore it is that i am anxious you should be early in the busy world and on the worlds track i am only the ghost of this businessits substance vanished long ago and when i die its ghost will be laid as it is clearly no inheritance for you then i have thought it best to use for your advantage almost the only fragment of the old connexion that stands by me through long habit some people suppose me to be wealthy i wish for your sake they were right but whatever i leave behind me or whatever i can give you you in such a house as dombeys are in the road to use well and make the most of be diligent try to like it my dear boy work for a steady independence and be happy  ill do everything i can uncle to deserve your affection indeed i will said the boy earnestly  i know it said solomon i am sure of it and he applied himself to a second glass of the old madeira with increased relish as to the sea he pursued thats well enough in fiction wally but it wont do in fact it wont do at all its natural enough that you should think about it associating it with all these familiar things but it wont do it wont do  solomon gills rubbed his hands with an air of stealthy enjoyment as he talked of the sea though and looked on the seafaring objects about him with inexpressible complacency  think of this wine for instance said old sol which has been to the east indies and back im not able to say how often and has been once round the world think of the pitchdark nights the roaring winds and rolling seas  the thunder lightning rain hail storm of all kinds said the boy  to be sure said solomonthat this wine has passed through think what a straining and creaking of timbers and masts what a whistling and howling of the gale through ropes and rigging  what a clambering aloft of men vying with each other who shall lie out first upon the yards to furl the icy sails while the ship rolls and pitches like mad cried his nephew  exactly so said solomon has gone on over the old cask that held this wine why when the charming sally went down in the  in the baltic sea in the dead of night fiveandtwenty minutes past twelve when the captains watch stopped in his pocket he lying dead against the mainmaston the fourteenth of february seventeen fortynine cried walter with great animation  ay to be sure cried old sol quite right then there were five hundred casks of such wine aboard and all hands except the first mate first lieutenant two seamen and a lady in a leaky boat going to work to stave the casks got drunk and died drunk singing rule britannia when she settled and went down and ending with one awful scream in chorus  but when the george the second drove ashore uncle on the coast of cornwall in a dismal gale two hours before daybreak on the fourth of march seventyone she had near two hundred horses aboard and the horses breaking loose down below early in the gale and tearing to and fro and trampling each other to death made such noises and set up such human cries that the crew believing the ship to be full of devils some of the best men losing heart and head went overboard in despair and only two were left alive at last to tell the tale  and when said old sol when the polyphemus  private west india trader burden three hundred and fifty tons captain john brown of deptford owners wiggs and co cried walter  the same said sol when she took fire four days sail with a fair wind out of jamaica harbour in the night  there were two brothers on board interposed his nephew speaking very fast and loud and there not being room for both of them in the only boat that wasnt swamped neither of them would consent to go until the elder took the younger by the waist and flung him in and then the younger rising in the boat cried out dear edward think of your promised wife at home im only a boy no one waits at home for me leap down into my place and flung himself in the sea  the kindling eye and heightened colour of the boy who had risen from his seat in the earnestness of what he said and felt seemed to remind old sol of something he had forgotten or that his encircling mist had hitherto shut out instead of proceeding with any more anecdotes as he had evidently intended but a moment before he gave a short dry cough and said well suppose we change the subject  the truth was that the simpleminded uncle in his secret attraction towards the marvellous and adventurousof which he was in some sort a distant relation by his tradehad greatly encouraged the same attraction in the nephew and that everything that had ever been put before the boy to deter him from a life of adventure had had the usual unaccountable effect of sharpening his taste for it this is invariable it would seem as if there never was a book written or a story told expressly with the object of keeping boys on shore which did not lure and charm them to the ocean as a matter of course  but an addition to the little party now made its appearance in the shape of a gentleman in a wide suit of blue with a hook instead of a hand attached to his right wrist very bushy black eyebrows and a thick stick in his left hand covered all over like his nose with knobs he wore a loose black silk handkerchief round his neck and such a very large coarse shirt collar that it looked like a small sail he was evidently the person for whom the spare wineglass was intended and evidently knew it for having taken off his rough outer coat and hung up on a particular peg behind the door such a hard glazed hat as a sympathetic persons head might ache at the sight of and which left a red rim round his own forehead as if he had been wearing a tight basin he brought a chair to where the clean glass was and sat himself down behind it he was usually addressed as captain this visitor and had been a pilot or a skipper or a privateersman or all three perhaps and was a very saltlooking man indeed  his face remarkable for a brown solidity brightened as he shook hands with uncle and nephew but he seemed to be of a laconic disposition and merely said  how goes it  all well said mr gills pushing the bottle towards him  he took it up and having surveyed and smelt it said with extraordinary expression  the  the returned the instrumentmaker  upon that he whistled as he filled his glass and seemed to think they were making holiday indeed  walr he said arranging his hair which was thin with his hook and then pointing it at the instrumentmaker look at him love honour and obey overhaul your catechism till you find that passage and when found turn the leaf down success my boy  he was so perfectly satisfied both with his quotation and his reference to it that he could not help repeating the words again in a low voice and saying he had forgotten em these forty year  but i never wanted two or three words in my life that i didnt know where to lay my hand upon em gills he observed it comes of not wasting language as some do  the reflection perhaps reminded him that he had better like young norvals father ncrease his store at any rate he became silent and remained so until old sol went out into the shop to light it up when he turned to walter and said without any introductory remark  i suppose he could make a clock if he tried  i shouldnt wonder captain cuttle returned the boy  and it would go said captain cuttle making a species of serpent in the air with his hook lord how that clock would go  for a moment or two he seemed quite lost in contemplating the pace of this ideal timepiece and sat looking at the boy as if his face were the dial  but hes chockful of science he observed waving his hook towards the stockintrade lookye here heres a collection of em earth air or water its all one only say where youll have it up in a balloon there you are down in a bell there you are dye want to put the north star in a pair of scales and weigh it hell do it for you  it may be gathered from these remarks that captain cuttles reverence for the stock of instruments was profound and that his philosophy knew little or no distinction between trading in it and inventing it  ah he said with a sigh its a fine thing to understand em and yet its a fine thing not to understand em i hardly know which is best its so comfortable to sit here and feel that you might be weighed measured magnified electrified polarized played the very devil with and never know how  nothing short of the wonderful madeira combined with the occasion which rendered it desirable to improve and expand walters mind could have ever loosened his tongue to the extent of giving utterance to this prodigious oration he seemed quite amazed himself at the manner in which it opened up to view the sources of the taciturn delight he had had in eating sunday dinners in that parlour for ten years becoming a sadder and a wiser man he mused and held his peace  come cried the subject of this admiration returning before you have your glass of grog ned we must finish the bottle  stand by said ned filling his glass give the boy some more  no more thanke uncle  yes yes said sol a little more well finish the bottle to the house nedwalters house why it may be his house one of these days in part who knows sir richard whittington married his masters daughter  turn again whittington lord mayor of london and when you are old you will never depart from it interposed the captain walr overhaul the book my lad  and although mr dombey hasnt a daughter sol began  yes yes he has uncle said the boy reddening and laughing  has he cried the old man indeed i think he has too  oh i know he has said the boy some of em were talking about it in the office today and they do say uncle and captain cuttle lowering his voice that hes taken a dislike to her and that shes left unnoticed among the servants and that his minds so set all the while upon having his son in the house that although hes only a baby now he is going to have balances struck oftener than formerly and the books kept closer than they used to be and has even been seen when he thought he wasnt walking in the docks looking at his ships and property and all that as if he was exulting like over what he and his son will possess together thats what they say of course i dont know  he knows all about her already you see said the instrumentmaker  nonsense uncle cried the boy still reddening and laughing boylike how can i help hearing what they tell me  the sons a little in our way at present im afraid ned said the old man humouring the joke  very much said the captain  nevertheless well drink him pursued sol so heres to dombey and son  oh very well uncle said the boy merrily since you have introduced the mention of her and have connected me with her and have said that i know all about her i shall make bold to amend the toast so heres to dombeyand sonand daughter    chapter 5 pauls progress and christening   little paul suffering no contamination from the blood of the toodles grew stouter and stronger every day every day too he was more and more ardently cherished by miss tox whose devotion was so far appreciated by mr dombey that he began to regard her as a woman of great natural good sense whose feelings did her credit and deserved encouragement he was so lavish of this condescension that he not only bowed to her in a particular manner on several occasions but even entrusted such stately recognitions of her to his sister as pray tell your friend louisa that she is very good or mention to miss tox louisa that i am obliged to herspecialities which made a deep impression on the lady thus distinguished  whether miss tox conceived that having been selected by the fates to welcome the little dombey before he was born in kirby beard and kirbys best mixed pins it therefore naturally devolved upon her to greet him with all other forms of welcome in all other early stages of his existenceor whether her overflowing goodness induced her to volunteer into the domestic militia as a substitute in some sort for his deceased mamaor whether she was conscious of any other motivesare questions which in this stage of the firms history herself only could have solved nor have they much bearing on the fact of which there is no doubt that miss toxs constancy and zeal were a heavy discouragement to richards who lost flesh hourly under her patronage and was in some danger of being superintended to death  miss tox was often in the habit of assuring mrs chick that nothing could exceed her interest in all connected with the development of that sweet child and an observer of miss toxs proceedings might have inferred so much without declaratory confirmation she would preside over the innocent repasts of the young heir with ineffable satisfaction almost with an air of joint proprietorship with richards in the entertainment at the little ceremonies of the bath and toilette she assisted with enthusiasm the administration of infantine doses of physic awakened all the active sympathy of her character and being on one occasion secreted in a cupboard whither she had fled in modesty when mr dombey was introduced into the nursery by his sister to behold his son in the course of preparation for bed taking a short walk uphill over richardss gown in a short and airy linen jacket miss tox was so transported beyond the ignorant present as to be unable to refrain from crying out is he not beautiful mr dombey is he not a cupid sir and then almost sinking behind the closet door with confusion and blushes  louisa said mr dombey one day to his sister i really think i must present your friend with some little token on the occasion of pauls christening she has exerted herself so warmly in the childs behalf from the first and seems to understand her position so thoroughly a very rare merit in this world i am sorry to say that it would really be agreeable to me to notice her  let it be no detraction from the merits of miss tox to hint that in mr dombeys eyes as in some others that occasionally see the light they only achieved that mighty piece of knowledge the understanding of their own position who showed a fitting reverence for his it was not so much their merit that they knew themselves as that they knew him and bowed low before him  my dear paul returned his sister you do miss tox but justice as a man of your penetration was sure i knew to do i believe if there are three words in the english language for which she has a respect amounting almost to veneration those words are dombey and son  well said mr dombey i believe it it does miss tox credit  and as to anything in the shape of a token my dear paul pursued his sister all i can say is that anything you give miss tox will be hoarded and prized i am sure like a relic but there is a way my dear paul of showing your sense of miss toxs friendliness in a still more flattering and acceptable manner if you should be so inclined  how is that asked mr dombey  godfathers of course continued mrs chick are important in point of connexion and influence  i dont know why they should be to my son said mr dombey coldly  very true my dear paul retorted mrs chick with an extraordinary show of animation to cover the suddenness of her conversion and spoken like yourself i might have expected nothing else from you i might have known that such would have been your opinion perhaps here mrs chick faltered again as not quite comfortably feeling her way perhaps that is a reason why you might have the less objection to allowing miss tox to be godmother to the dear thing if it were only as deputy and proxy for someone else that it would be received as a great honour and distinction paul i need not say  louisa said mr dombey after a short pause it is not to be supposed  certainly not cried mrs chick hastening to anticipate a refusal i never thought it was  mr dombey looked at her impatiently  dont flurry me my dear paul said his sister for that destroys me i am far from strong i have not been quite myself since poor dear fanny departed  mr dombey glanced at the pockethandkerchief which his sister applied to her eyes and resumed  it is not be supposed i say and i say murmured mrs chick that i never thought it was  good heaven louisa said mr dombey  no my dear paul she remonstrated with tearful dignity i must really be allowed to speak i am not so clever or so reasoning or so eloquent or so anything as you are i know that very well so much the worse for me but if they were the last words i had to utterand last words should be very solemn to you and me paul after poor dear fannyi would still say i never thought it was and what is more added mrs chick with increased dignity as if she had withheld her crushing argument until now i never did think it was mr dombey walked to the window and back again  it is not to be supposed louisa he said mrs chick had nailed her colours to the mast and repeated i know it isnt but he took no notice of it but that there are many persons who supposing that i recognised any claim at all in such a case have a claim upon me superior to miss toxs but i do not i recognise no such thing paul and myself will be able when the time comes to hold our ownthe house in other words will be able to hold its own and maintain its own and hand down its own of itself and without any such commonplace aids the kind of foreign help which people usually seek for their children i can afford to despise being above it i hope so that pauls infancy and childhood pass away well and i see him becoming qualified without waste of time for the career on which he is destined to enter i am satisfied he will make what powerful friends he pleases in afterlife when he is actively maintainingand extending if that is possiblethe dignity and credit of the firm until then i am enough for him perhaps and all in all i have no wish that people should step in between us i would much rather show my sense of the obliging conduct of a deserving person like your friend therefore let it be so and your husband and myself will do well enough for the other sponsors i daresay  in the course of these remarks delivered with great majesty and grandeur mr dombey had truly revealed the secret feelings of his breast an indescribable distrust of anybody stepping in between himself and his son a haughty dread of having any rival or partner in the boys respect and deference a sharp misgiving recently acquired that he was not infallible in his power of bending and binding human wills as sharp a jealousy of any second check or cross these were at that time the master keys of his soul in all his life he had never made a friend his cold and distant nature had neither sought one nor found one and now when that nature concentrated its whole force so strongly on a partial scheme of parental interest and ambition it seemed as if its icy current instead of being released by this influence and running clear and free had thawed for but an instant to admit its burden and then frozen with it into one unyielding block  elevated thus to the godmothership of little paul in virtue of her insignificance miss tox was from that hour chosen and appointed to office and mr dombey further signified his pleasure that the ceremony already long delayed should take place without further postponement his sister who had been far from anticipating so signal a success withdrew as soon as she could to communicate it to her best of friends and mr dombey was left alone in his library he had already laid his hand upon the bellrope to convey his usual summons to richards when his eye fell upon a writingdesk belonging to his deceased wife which had been taken among other things from a cabinet in her chamber it was not the first time that his eye had lighted on it he carried the key in his pocket and he brought it to his table and opened it nowhaving previously locked the room doorwith a wellaccustomed hand  from beneath a leaf of torn and cancelled scraps of paper he took one letter that remained entire involuntarily holding his breath as he opened this document and bating in the stealthy action something of his arrogant demeanour he sat down resting his head upon one hand and read it through  he read it slowly and attentively and with a nice particularity to every syllable otherwise than as his great deliberation seemed unnatural and perhaps the result of an effort equally great he allowed no sign of emotion to escape him when he had read it through he folded and refolded it slowly several times and tore it carefully into fragments checking his hand in the act of throwing these away he put them in his pocket as if unwilling to trust them even to the chances of being reunited and deciphered and instead of ringing as usual for little paul he sat solitary all the evening in his cheerless room  there was anything but solitude in the nursery for there mrs chick and miss tox were enjoying a social evening so much to the disgust of miss susan nipper that that young lady embraced every opportunity of making wry faces behind the door her feelings were so much excited on the occasion that she found it indispensable to afford them this relief even without having the comfort of any audience or sympathy whatever as the knighterrants of old relieved their minds by carving their mistresss names in deserts and wildernesses and other savage places where there was no probability of there ever being anybody to read them so did miss susan nipper curl her snub nose into drawers and wardrobes put away winks of disparagement in cupboards shed derisive squints into stone pitchers and contradict and call names out in the passage  the two interlopers however blissfully unconscious of the young ladys sentiments saw little paul safe through all the stages of undressing airy exercise supper and bed and then sat down to tea before the fire the two children now lay through the good offices of polly in one room and it was not until the ladies were established at their teatable that happening to look towards the little beds they thought of florence  how sound she sleeps said miss tox  why you know my dear she takes a great deal of exercise in the course of the day returned mrs chick playing about little paul so much  she is a curious child said miss tox  my dear retorted mrs chick in a low voice her mama all over  in deed said miss tox ah dear me  a tone of most extraordinary compassion miss tox said it in though she had no distinct idea why except that it was expected of her  florence will never never never be a dombeysaid mrs chick not if she lives to be a thousand years old  miss tox elevated her eyebrows and was again full of commiseration  i quite fret and worry myself about her said mrs chick with a sigh of modest merit i really dont see what is to become of her when she grows older or what position she is to take she dont gain on her papa in the least how can one expect she should when she is so very unlike a dombey  miss tox looked as if she saw no way out of such a cogent argument as that at all  and the child you see said mrs chick in deep confidence has poor dear fannys nature shell never make an effort in afterlife ill venture to say never shell never wind and twine herself about her papas heart like  like the ivy suggested miss tox  like the ivy mrs chick assented never shell never glide and nestle into the bosom of her papas affections likethe  startled fawn suggested miss tox  like the startled fawn said mrs chick never poor fanny yet how i loved her  you must not distress yourself my dear said miss tox in a soothing voice now really you have too much feeling  we have all our faults said mrs chick weeping and shaking her head i daresay we have i never was blind to hers i never said i was far from it yet how i loved her  what a satisfaction it was to mrs chicka commonplace piece of folly enough compared with whom her sisterinlaw had been a very angel of womanly intelligence and gentlenessto patronise and be tender to the memory of that lady in exact pursuance of her conduct to her in her lifetime and to thoroughly believe herself and take herself in and make herself uncommonly comfortable on the strength of her toleration what a mighty pleasant virtue toleration should be when we are right to be so very pleasant when we are wrong and quite unable to demonstrate how we come to be invested with the privilege of exercising it  mrs chick was yet drying her eyes and shaking her head when richards made bold to caution her that miss florence was awake and sitting in her bed she had risen as the nurse said and the lashes of her eyes were wet with tears but no one saw them glistening save polly no one else leant over her and whispered soothing words to her or was near enough to hear the flutter of her beating heart  oh dear nurse said the child looking earnestly up in her face let me lie by my brother  why my pet said richards  oh i think he loves me cried the child wildly let me lie by him pray do  mrs chick interposed with some motherly words about going to sleep like a dear but florence repeated her supplication with a frightened look and in a voice broken by sobs and tears  ill not wake him she said covering her face and hanging down her head ill only touch him with my hand and go to sleep oh pray pray let me lie by my brother tonight for i believe hes fond of me  richards took her without a word and carrying her to the little bed in which the infant was sleeping laid her down by his side she crept as near him as she could without disturbing his rest and stretching out one arm so that it timidly embraced his neck and hiding her face on the other over which her damp and scattered hair fell loose lay motionless  poor little thing said miss tox she has been dreaming i daresay  dreaming perhaps of loving tones for ever silent of loving eyes for ever closed of loving arms again wound round her and relaxing in that dream within the dam which no tongue can relate seeking perhapsin dreamssome natural comfort for a heart deeply and sorely wounded though so young a childs and finding it perhaps in dreams if not in waking cold substantial truth this trivial incident had so interrupted the current of conversation that it was difficult of resumption and mrs chick moreover had been so affected by the contemplation of her own tolerant nature that she was not in spirits the two friends accordingly soon made an end of their tea and a servant was despatched to fetch a hackney cabriolet for miss tox miss tox had great experience in hackney cabs and her starting in one was generally a work of time as she was systematic in the preparatory arrangements  have the goodness if you please towlinson said miss tox first of all to carry out a pen and ink and take his number legibly  yes miss said towlinson  then if you please towlinson said miss tox have the goodness to turn the cushion which said miss tox apart to mrs chick is generally damp my dear  yes miss said towlinson  ill trouble you also if you please towlinson said miss tox with this card and this shilling hes to drive to the card and is to understand that he will not on any account have more than the shilling  no miss said towlinson  andim sorry to give you so much trouble towlinson said miss tox looking at him pensively  not at all miss said towlinson  mention to the man then if you please towlinson said miss tox that the ladys uncle is a magistrate and that if he gives her any of his impertinence he will be punished terribly you can pretend to say that if you please towlinson in a friendly way and because you know it was done to another man who died  certainly miss said towlinson  and now goodnight to my sweet sweet sweet godson said miss tox with a soft shower of kisses at each repetition of the adjective and louisa my dear friend promise me to take a little something warm before you go to bed and not to distress yourself  it was with extreme difficulty that nipper the blackeyed who looked on steadfastly contained herself at this crisis and until the subsequent departure of mrs chick but the nursery being at length free of visitors she made herself some recompense for her late restraint  you might keep me in a straitwaistcoat for six weeks said nipper and when i got it off id only be more aggravated who ever heard the like of them two griffins mrs richards  and then to talk of having been dreaming poor dear said polly  oh you beauties cried susan nipper affecting to salute the door by which the ladies had departed never be a dombey wont she its to be hoped she wont we dont want any more such ones enough  dont wake the children susan dear said polly  im very much beholden to you mrs richards said susan who was not by any means discriminating in her wrath and really feel it as a honour to receive your commands being a black slave and a mulotter mrs richards if theres any other orders you can give me pray mention em  nonsense orders said polly  oh bless your heart mrs richards cried susan temporaries always orders permanencies here didnt you know that why wherever was you born mrs richards but wherever you was born mrs richards pursued spitfire shaking her head resolutely and whenever and however which is best known to yourself you may bear in mind please that its one thing to give orders and quite another thing to take em a person may tell a person to dive off a bridge head foremost into fiveandforty feet of water mrs richards but a person may be very far from diving  there now said polly youre angry because youre a good little thing and fond of miss florence and yet you turn round on me because theres nobody else  its very easy for some to keep their tempers and be softspoken mrs richards returned susan slightly mollified when their childs made as much of as a prince and is petted and patted till it wishes its friends further but when a sweet young pretty innocent that never ought to have a cross word spoken to or of it is rundown the case is very different indeed my goodness gracious me miss floy you naughty sinful child if you dont shut your eyes this minute ill call in them hobgoblins that lives in the cockloft to come and eat you up alive  here miss nipper made a horrible lowing supposed to issue from a conscientious goblin of the bull species impatient to discharge the severe duty of his position having further composed her young charge by covering her head with the bedclothes and making three or four angry dabs at the pillow she folded her arms and screwed up her mouth and sat looking at the fire for the rest of the evening  though little paul was said in nursery phrase to take a deal of notice for his age he took as little notice of all this as of the preparations for his christening on the next day but one which nevertheless went on about him as to his personal apparel and that of his sister and the two nurses with great activity neither did he on the arrival of the appointed morning show any sense of its importance being on the contrary unusually inclined to sleep and unusually inclined to take it ill in his attendants that they dressed him to go out  it happened to be an irongrey autumnal day with a shrewd east wind blowinga day in keeping with the proceedings mr dombey represented in himself the wind the shade and the autumn of the christening he stood in his library to receive the company as hard and cold as the weather and when he looked out through the glass room at the trees in the little garden their brown and yellow leaves came fluttering down as if he blighted them  ugh they were black cold rooms and seemed to be in mourning like the inmates of the house the books precisely matched as to size and drawn up in line like soldiers looked in their cold hard slippery uniforms as if they had but one idea among them and that was a freezer the bookcase glazed and locked repudiated all familiarities mr pitt in bronze on the top with no trace of his celestial origin about him guarded the unattainable treasure like an enchanted moor a dusty urn at each high corner dug up from an ancient tomb preached desolation and decay as from two pulpits and the chimneyglass reflecting mr dombey and his portrait at one blow seemed fraught with melancholy meditations  the stiff and stark fireirons appeared to claim a nearer relationship than anything else there to mr dombey with his buttoned coat his white cravat his heavy gold watchchain and his creaking boots  but this was before the arrival of mr and mrs chick his lawful relatives who soon presented themselves  my dear paul mrs chick murmured as she embraced him the beginning i hope of many joyful days  thank you louisa said mr dombey grimly how do you do mr john  how do you do sir said chick  he gave mr dombey his hand as if he feared it might electrify him mr dombey tool it as if it were a fish or seaweed or some such clammy substance and immediately returned it to him with exalted politeness  perhaps louisa said mr dombey slightly turning his head in his cravat as if it were a socket you would have preferred a fire  oh my dear paul no said mrs chick who had much ado to keep her teeth from chattering not for me  mr john said mr dombey you are not sensible of any chill  mr john who had already got both his hands in his pockets over the wrists and was on the very threshold of that same canine chorus which had given mrs chick so much offence on a former occasion protested that he was perfectly comfortable  he added in a low voice with my tiddle tol toor rulwhen he was providentially stopped by towlinson who announced  miss tox  and enter that fair enslaver with a blue nose and indescribably frosty face referable to her being very thinly clad in a maze of fluttering odds and ends to do honour to the ceremony  how do you do miss tox said mr dombey  miss tox in the midst of her spreading gauzes went down altogether like an operaglass shuttingup she curtseyed so low in acknowledgment of mr dombeys advancing a step or two to meet her  i can never forget this occasion sir said miss tox softly tis impossible my dear louisa i can hardly believe the evidence of my senses  if miss tox could believe the evidence of one of her senses it was a very cold day that was quite clear she took an early opportunity of promoting the circulation in the tip of her nose by secretly chafing it with her pocket handkerchief lest by its very low temperature it should disagreeably astonish the baby when she came to kiss it  the baby soon appeared carried in great glory by richards while florence in custody of that active young constable susan nipper brought up the rear though the whole nursery party were dressed by this time in lighter mourning than at first there was enough in the appearance of the bereaved children to make the day no brighter the baby tooit might have been miss toxs nosebegan to cry thereby as it happened preventing mr chick from the awkward fulfilment of a very honest purpose he had which was to make much of florence for this gentleman insensible to the superior claims of a perfect dombey perhaps on account of having the honour to be united to a dombey himself and being familiar with excellence really liked her and showed that he liked her and was about to show it in his own way now when paul cried and his helpmate stopped him short  now florence child said her aunt briskly what are you doing love show yourself to him engage his attention my dear  the atmosphere became or might have become colder and colder when mr dombey stood frigidly watching his little daughter who clapping her hands and standing on tiptoe before the throne of his son and heir lured him to bend down from his high estate and look at her some honest act of richardss may have aided the effect but he did look down and held his peace as his sister hid behind her nurse he followed her with his eyes and when she peeped out with a merry cry to him he sprang up and crowed lustilylaughing outright when she ran in upon him and seeming to fondle her curls with his tiny hands while she smothered him with kisses  was mr dombey pleased to see this he testified no pleasure by the relaxation of a nerve but outward tokens of any kind of feeling were unusual with him if any sunbeam stole into the room to light the children at their play it never reached his face he looked on so fixedly and coldly that the warm light vanished even from the laughing eyes of little florence when at last they happened to meet his  it was a dull grey autumn day indeed and in a minutes pause and silence that took place the leaves fell sorrowfully  mr john said mr dombey referring to his watch and assuming his hat and gloves take my sister if you please my arm today is miss toxs you had better go first with master paul richards be very careful  in mr dombeys carriage dombey and son miss tox mrs chick richards and florence in a little carriage following it susan nipper and the owner mr chick susan looking out of window without intermission as a relief from the embarrassment of confronting the large face of that gentleman and thinking whenever anything rattled that he was putting up in paper an appropriate pecuniary compliment for herself  once upon the road to church mr dombey clapped his hands for the amusement of his son at which instance of parental enthusiasm miss tox was enchanted but exclusive of this incident the chief difference between the christening party and a party in a mourning coach consisted in the colours of the carriage and horses  arrived at the church steps they were received by a portentous beadle mr dombey dismounting first to help the ladies out and standing near him at the church door looked like another beadle a beadle less gorgeous but more dreadful the beadle of private life the beadle of our business and our bosoms  miss toxs hand trembled as she slipped it through mr dombeys arm and felt herself escorted up the steps preceded by a cocked hat and a babylonian collar it seemed for a moment like that other solemn institution wilt thou have this man lucretia yes i will  please to bring the child in quick out of the air there whispered the beadle holding open the inner door of the church  little paul might have asked with hamlet into my grave so chill and earthy was the place the tall shrouded pulpit and reading desk the dreary perspective of empty pews stretching away under the galleries and empty benches mounting to the roof and lost in the shadow of the great grim organ the dusty matting and cold stone slabs the grisly free seats in the aisles and the damp corner by the bellrope where the black trestles used for funerals were stowed away along with some shovels and baskets and a coil or two of deadlylooking rope the strange unusual uncomfortable smell and the cadaverous light were all in unison it was a cold and dismal scene  theres a wedding just on sir said the beadle but itll be over directly if youll walk into the westry here  before he turned again to lead the way he gave mr dombey a bow and a half smile of recognition importing that he the beadle remembered to have had the pleasure of attending on him when he buried his wife and hoped he had enjoyed himself since  the very wedding looked dismal as they passed in front of the altar the bride was too old and the bridegroom too young and a superannuated beau with one eye and an eyeglass stuck in its blank companion was giving away the lady while the friends were shivering in the vestry the fire was smoking and an overaged and overworked and underpaid attorneys clerk making a search was running his forefinger down the parchment pages of an immense register one of a long series of similar volumes gorged with burials over the fireplace was a groundplan of the vaults underneath the church and mr chick skimming the literary portion of it aloud by way of enlivening the company read the reference to mrs dombeys tomb in full before he could stop himself  after another cold interval a wheezy little pewopener afflicted with an asthma appropriate to the churchyard if not to the church summoned them to the fonta rigid marble basin which seemed to have been playing a churchyard game at cup and ball with its matter of fact pedestal and to have been just that moment caught on the top of it here they waited some little time while the marriage party enrolled themselves and meanwhile the wheezy little pewopenerpartly in consequence of her infirmity and partly that the marriage party might not forget herwent about the building coughing like a grampus  presently the clerk the only cheerfullooking object there and he was an undertaker came up with a jug of warm water and said something as he poured it into the font about taking the chill off which millions of gallons boiling hot could not have done for the occasion then the clergyman an amiable and mildlooking young curate but obviously afraid of the baby appeared like the principal character in a ghoststory a tall figure all in white at sight of whom paul rent the air with his cries and never left off again till he was taken out black in the face  even when that event had happened to the great relief of everybody he was heard under the portico during the rest of the ceremony now fainter now louder now hushed now bursting forth again with an irrepressible sense of his wrongs this so distracted the attention of the two ladies that mrs chick was constantly deploying into the centre aisle to send out messages by the pewopener while miss tox kept her prayerbook open at the gunpowder plot and occasionally read responses from that service  during the whole of these proceedings mr dombey remained as impassive and gentlemanly as ever and perhaps assisted in making it so cold that the young curate smoked at the mouth as he read the only time that he unbent his visage in the least was when the clergyman in delivering very unaffectedly and simply the closing exhortation relative to the future examination of the child by the sponsors happened to rest his eye on mr chick and then mr dombey might have been seen to express by a majestic look that he would like to catch him at it  it might have been well for mr dombey if he had thought of his own dignity a little less and had thought of the great origin and purpose of the ceremony in which he took so formal and so stiff a part a little more his arrogance contrasted strangely with its history  when it was all over he again gave his arm to miss tox and conducted her to the vestry where he informed the clergyman how much pleasure it would have given him to have solicited the honour of his company at dinner but for the unfortunate state of his household affairs the register signed and the fees paid and the pewopener whose cough was very bad again remembered and the beadle gratified and the sexton who was accidentally on the doorsteps looking with great interest at the weather not forgotten they got into the carriage again and drove home in the same bleak fellowship  there they found mr pitt turning up his nose at a cold collation set forth in a cold pomp of glass and silver and looking more like a dead dinner lying in state than a social refreshment on their arrival miss tox produced a mug for her godson and mr chick a knife and fork and spoon in a case mr dombey also produced a bracelet for miss tox and on the receipt of this token miss tox was tenderly affected  mr john said mr dombey will you take the bottom of the table if you please what have you got there mr john  i have got a cold fillet of veal here sir replied mr chick rubbing his numbed hands hard together what have you got there sir  this returned mr dombey is some cold preparation of calfs head i think i see cold fowlshampattiessaladlobster miss tox will do me the honour of taking some wine champagne to miss tox  there was a toothache in everything the wine was so bitter cold that it forced a little scream from miss tox which she had great difficulty in turning into a hem the veal had come from such an airy pantry that the first taste of it had struck a sensation as of cold lead to mr chicks extremities mr dombey alone remained unmoved he might have been hung up for sale at a russian fair as a specimen of a frozen gentleman  the prevailing influence was too much even for his sister she made no effort at flattery or small talk and directed all her efforts to looking as warm as she could  well sir said mr chick making a desperate plunge after a long silence and filling a glass of sherry i shall drink this if youll allow me sir to little paul  bless him murmured miss tox taking a sip of wine  dear little dombey murmured mrs chick  mr john said mr dombey with severe gravity my son would feel and express himself obliged to you i have no doubt if he could appreciate the favour you have done him he will prove in time to come i trust equal to any responsibility that the obliging disposition of his relations and friends in private or the onerous nature of our position in public may impose upon him  the tone in which this was said admitting of nothing more mr chick relapsed into low spirits and silence not so miss tox who having listened to mr dombey with even a more emphatic attention than usual and with a more expressive tendency of her head to one side now leant across the table and said to mrs chick softly  louisa  my dear said mrs chick  onerous nature of our position in public mayi have forgotten the exact term  expose him to said mrs chick  pardon me my dear returned miss tox i think not it was more rounded and flowing obliging disposition of relations and friends in private or onerous nature of position in publicmayimpose upon him  impose upon him to be sure said mrs chick  miss tox struck her delicate hands together lightly in triumph and added casting up her eyes eloquence indeed  mr dombey in the meanwhile had issued orders for the attendance of richards who now entered curtseying but without the baby paul being asleep after the fatigues of the morning mr dombey having delivered a glass of wine to this vassal addressed her in the following words miss tox previously settling her head on one side and making other little arrangements for engraving them on her heart  during the six months or so richards which have seen you an inmate of this house you have done your duty desiring to connect some little service to you with this occasion i considered how i could best effect that object and i also advised with my sister mrs  chick interposed the gentleman of that name  oh hush if you please said miss tox  i was about to say to you richards resumed mr dombey with an appalling glance at mr john that i was further assisted in my decision by the recollection of a conversation i held with your husband in this room on the occasion of your being hired when he disclosed to me the melancholy fact that your family himself at the head were sunk and steeped in ignorance  richards quailed under the magnificence of the reproof  i am far from being friendly pursued mr dombey to what is called by persons of levelling sentiments general education but it is necessary that the inferior classes should continue to be taught to know their position and to conduct themselves properly so far i approve of schools having the power of nominating a child on the foundation of an ancient establishment called from a worshipful company the charitable grinders where not only is a wholesome education bestowed upon the scholars but where a dress and badge is likewise provided for them i have first communicating through mrs chick with your family nominated your eldest son to an existing vacancy and he has this day i am informed assumed the habit the number of her son i believe said mr dombey turning to his sister and speaking of the child as if he were a hackneycoach is one hundred and fortyseven louisa you can tell her  one hundred and fortyseven said mrs chick the dress richards is a nice warm blue baize tailed coat and cap turned up with orange coloured binding red worsted stockings and very strong leather smallclothes one might wear the articles ones self said mrs chick with enthusiasm and be grateful  there richards said miss tox now indeed you may be proud the charitable grinders  i am sure i am very much obliged sir returned richards faintly and take it very kind that you should remember my little ones at the same time a vision of biler as a charitable grinder with his very small legs encased in the serviceable clothing described by mrs chick swam before richardss eyes and made them water  i am very glad to see you have so much feeling richards said miss tox  it makes one almost hope it really does said mrs chick who prided herself on taking trustful views of human nature that there may yet be some faint spark of gratitude and right feeling in the world  richards deferred to these compliments by curtseying and murmuring her thanks but finding it quite impossible to recover her spirits from the disorder into which they had been thrown by the image of her son in his precocious nether garments she gradually approached the door and was heartily relieved to escape by it  such temporary indications of a partial thaw that had appeared with her vanished with her and the frost set in again as cold and hard as ever mr chick was twice heard to hum a tune at the bottom of the table but on both occasions it was a fragment of the dead march in saul the party seemed to get colder and colder and to be gradually resolving itself into a congealed and solid state like the collation round which it was assembled at length mrs chick looked at miss tox and miss tox returned the look and they both rose and said it was really time to go mr dombey receiving this announcement with perfect equanimity they took leave of that gentleman and presently departed under the protection of mr chick who when they had turned their backs upon the house and left its master in his usual solitary state put his hands in his pockets threw himself back in the carriage and whistled with a hey ho chevy all through conveying into his face as he did so an expression of such gloomy and terrible defiance that mrs chick dared not protest or in any way molest him  richards though she had little paul on her lap could not forget her own firstborn she felt it was ungrateful but the influence of the day fell even on the charitable grinders and she could hardly help regarding his pewter badge number one hundred and fortyseven as somehow a part of its formality and sternness she spoke too in the nursery of his blessed legs and was again troubled by his spectre in uniform  i dont know what i wouldnt give said polly to see the poor little dear before he gets used to em  why then i tell you what mrs richards retorted nipper who had been admitted to her confidence see him and make your mind easy  mr dombey wouldnt like it said polly  oh wouldnt he mrs richards retorted nipper hed like it very much i think when he was asked  you wouldnt ask him i suppose at all said polly  no mrs richards quite contrairy returned susan and them two inspectors tox and chick not intending to be on duty tomorrow as i heard em say me and mid floy will go along with you tomorrow morning and welcome mrs richards if you like for we may as well walk there as up and down a street and better too  polly rejected the idea pretty stoutly at first but by little and little she began to entertain it as she entertained more and more distinctly the forbidden pictures of her children and her own home at length arguing that there could be no great harm in calling for a moment at the door she yielded to the nipper proposition  the matter being settled thus little paul began to cry most piteously as if he had a foreboding that no good would come of it  whats the matter with the child asked susan  hes cold i think said polly walking with him to and fro and hushing him  it was a bleak autumnal afternoon indeed and as she walked and hushed and glancing through the dreary windows pressed the little fellow closer to her breast the withered leaves came showering down    chapter 6 pauls second deprivation   polly was beset by so many misgivings in the morning that but for the incessant promptings of her blackeyed companion she would have abandoned all thoughts of the expedition and formally petitioned for leave to see number one hundred and fortyseven under the awful shadow of mr dombeys roof but susan who was personally disposed in favour of the excursion and who like tony lumpkin if she could bear the disappointments of other people with tolerable fortitude could not abide to disappoint herself threw so many ingenious doubts in the way of this second thought and stimulated the original intention with so many ingenious arguments that almost as soon as mr dombeys stately back was turned and that gentleman was pursuing his daily road towards the city his unconscious son was on his way to staggss gardens  this euphonious locality was situated in a suburb known by the inhabitants of staggss gardens by the name of camberling town a designation which the strangers map of london as printed with a view to pleasant and commodious reference on pocket handkerchiefs condenses with some show of reason into camden town hither the two nurses bent their steps accompanied by their charges richards carrying paul of course and susan leading little florence by the hand and giving her such jerks and pokes from time to time as she considered it wholesome to administer  the first shock of a great earthquake had just at that period rent the whole neighbourhood to its centre traces of its course were visible on every side houses were knocked down streets broken through and stopped deep pits and trenches dug in the ground enormous heaps of earth and clay thrown up buildings that were undermined and shaking propped by great beams of wood here a chaos of carts overthrown and jumbled together lay topsyturvy at the bottom of a steep unnatural hill there confused treasures of iron soaked and rusted in something that had accidentally become a pond everywhere were bridges that led nowhere thoroughfares that were wholly impassable babel towers of chimneys wanting half their height temporary wooden houses and enclosures in the most unlikely situations carcases of ragged tenements and fragments of unfinished walls and arches and piles of scaffolding and wildernesses of bricks and giant forms of cranes and tripods straddling above nothing there were a hundred thousand shapes and substances of incompleteness wildly mingled out of their places upside down burrowing in the earth aspiring in the air mouldering in the water and unintelligible as any dream hot springs and fiery eruptions the usual attendants upon earthquakes lent their contributions of confusion to the scene boiling water hissed and heaved within dilapidated walls whence also the glare and roar of flames came issuing forth and mounds of ashes blocked up rights of way and wholly changed the law and custom of the neighbourhood  in short the yet unfinished and unopened railroad was in progress and from the very core of all this dire disorder trailed smoothly away upon its mighty course of civilisation and improvement  but as yet the neighbourhood was shy to own the railroad one or two bold speculators had projected streets and one had built a little but had stopped among the mud and ashes to consider farther of it a brannew tavern redolent of fresh mortar and size and fronting nothing at all had taken for its sign the railway arms but that might be rash enterpriseand then it hoped to sell drink to the workmen so the excavators house of call had sprung up from a beershop and the oldestablished ham and beef shop had become the railway eating house with a roast leg of pork daily through interested motives of a similar immediate and popular description lodginghouse keepers were favourable in like manner and for the like reasons were not to be trusted the general belief was very slow there were frowzy fields and cowhouses and dunghills and dustheaps and ditches and gardens and summerhouses and carpetbeating grounds at the very door of the railway little tumuli of oyster shells in the oyster season and of lobster shells in the lobster season and of broken crockery and faded cabbage leaves in all seasons encroached upon its high places posts and rails and old cautions to trespassers and backs of mean houses and patches of wretched vegetation stared it out of countenance nothing was the better for it or thought of being so if the miserable waste ground lying near it could have laughed it would have laughed it to scorn like many of the miserable neighbours  staggss gardens was uncommonly incredulous it was a little row of houses with little squalid patches of ground before them fenced off with old doors barrel staves scraps of tarpaulin and dead bushes with bottomless tin kettles and exhausted iron fenders thrust into the gaps here the staggss gardeners trained scarlet beans kept fowls and rabbits erected rotten summerhouses one was an old boat dried clothes and smoked pipes some were of opinion that staggss gardens derived its name from a deceased capitalist one mr staggs who had built it for his delectation others who had a natural taste for the country held that it dated from those rural times when the antlered herd under the familiar denomination of staggses had resorted to its shady precincts be this as it may staggss gardens was regarded by its population as a sacred grove not to be withered by railroads and so confident were they generally of its long outliving any such ridiculous inventions that the master chimneysweeper at the corner who was understood to take the lead in the local politics of the gardens had publicly declared that on the occasion of the railroad opening if ever it did open two of his boys should ascend the flues of his dwelling with instructions to hail the failure with derisive cheers from the chimneypots  to this unhallowed spot the very name of which had hitherto been carefully concealed from mr dombey by his sister was little paul now borne by fate and richards  thats my house susan said polly pointing it out  is it indeed mrs richards said susan condescendingly  and theres my sister jemima at the door i do declare cried polly with my own sweet precious baby in her arms  the sight added such an extensive pair of wings to pollys impatience that she set off down the gardens at a run and bouncing on jemima changed babies with her in a twinkling to the unutterable astonishment of that young damsel on whom the heir of the dombeys seemed to have fallen from the clouds  why polly cried jemima you what a turn you have given me whod have thought it come along in polly how well you do look to be sure the children will go half wild to see you polly that they will  that they did if one might judge from the noise they made and the way in which they dashed at polly and dragged her to a low chair in the chimney corner where her own honest apple face became immediately the centre of a bunch of smaller pippins all laying their rosy cheeks close to it and all evidently the growth of the same tree as to polly she was full as noisy and vehement as the children and it was not until she was quite out of breath and her hair was hanging all about her flushed face and her new christening attire was very much dishevelled that any pause took place in the confusion even then the smallest toodle but one remained in her lap holding on tight with both arms round her neck while the smallest toodle but two mounted on the back of the chair and made desperate efforts with one leg in the air to kiss her round the corner  look theres a pretty little lady come to see you said polly and see how quiet she is what a beautiful little lady aint she  this reference to florence who had been standing by the door not unobservant of what passed directed the attention of the younger branches towards her and had likewise the happy effect of leading to the formal recognition of miss nipper who was not quite free from a misgiving that she had been already slighted  oh do come in and sit down a minute susan please said polly this is my sister jemima this is jemima i dont know what i should ever do with myself if it wasnt for susan nipper i shouldnt be here now but for her  oh do sit down miss nipper if you please quoth jemima  susan took the extreme corner of a chair with a stately and ceremonious aspect  i never was so glad to see anybody in all my life now really i never was miss nipper said jemima  susan relaxing took a little more of the chair and smiled graciously  do untie your bonnetstrings and make yourself at home miss nipper please entreated jemima i am afraid its a poorer place than youre used to but youll make allowances im sure  the blackeyed was so softened by this deferential behaviour that she caught up little miss toodle who was running past and took her to banbury cross immediately  but wheres my pretty boy said polly my poor fellow i came all this way to see him in his new clothes  ah what a pity cried jemima hell break his heart when he hears his mother has been here hes at school polly  gone already  yes he went for the first time yesterday for fear he should lose any learning but its halfholiday polly if you could only stop till he comes homeyou and miss nipper leastways said jemima mindful in good time of the dignity of the blackeyed  and how does he look jemima bless him faltered polly  well really he dont look so bad as youd suppose returned jemima  ah said polly with emotion i knew his legs must be too short  his legs is short returned jemima especially behind but theyll get longer polly every day  it was a slow prospective kind of consolation but the cheerfulness and good nature with which it was administered gave it a value it did not intrinsically possess after a moments silence polly asked in a more sprightly manner  and wheres father jemima dearfor by that patriarchal appellation mr toodle was generally known in the family  there again said jemima what a pity father took his dinner with him this morning and isnt coming home till night but hes always talking of you polly and telling the children about you and is the peaceablest patientest besttemperedest soul in the world as he always was and will be  thankee jemima cried the simple polly delighted by the speech and disappointed by the absence  oh you neednt thank me polly said her sister giving her a sounding kiss upon the cheek and then dancing little paul cheerfully i say the same of you sometimes and think it too  in spite of the double disappointment it was impossible to regard in the light of a failure a visit which was greeted with such a reception so the sisters talked hopefully about family matters and about biler and about all his brothers and sisters while the blackeyed having performed several journeys to banbury cross and back took sharp note of the furniture the dutch clock the cupboard the castle on the mantelpiece with red and green windows in it susceptible of illumination by a candleend within and the pair of small black velvet kittens each with a ladys reticule in its mouth regarded by the staggss gardeners as prodigies of imitative art the conversation soon becoming general lest the blackeyed should go off at score and turn sarcastic that young lady related to jemima a summary of everything she knew concerning mr dombey his prospects family pursuits and character also an exact inventory of her personal wardrobe and some account of her principal relations and friends having relieved her mind of these disclosures she partook of shrimps and porter and evinced a disposition to swear eternal friendship  little florence herself was not behindhand in improving the occasion for being conducted forth by the young toodles to inspect some toadstools and other curiosities of the gardens she entered with them heart and soul on the formation of a temporary breakwater across a small green pool that had collected in a corner she was still busily engaged in that labour when sought and found by susan who such was her sense of duty even under the humanizing influence of shrimps delivered a moral address to her punctuated with thumps on her degenerate nature while washing her face and hands and predicted that she would bring the grey hairs of her family in general with sorrow to the grave after some delay occasioned by a pretty long confidential interview above stairs on pecuniary subjects between polly and jemima an interchange of babies was again effectedfor polly had all this time retained her own child and jemima little pauland the visitors took leave  but first the young toodles victims of a pious fraud were deluded into repairing in a body to a chandlers shop in the neighbourhood for the ostensible purpose of spending a penny and when the coast was quite clear polly fled jemima calling after her that if they could only go round towards the city road on their way back they would be sure to meet little biler coming from school  do you think that we might make time to go a little round in that direction susan inquired polly when they halted to take breath  why not mrs richards returned susan  its getting on towards our dinner time you know said polly  but lunch had rendered her companion more than indifferent to this grave consideration so she allowed no weight to it and they resolved to go a little round  now it happened that poor bilers life had been since yesterday morning rendered weary by the costume of the charitable grinders the youth of the streets could not endure it no young vagabond could be brought to bear its contemplation for a moment without throwing himself upon the unoffending wearer and doing him a mischief his social existence had been more like that of an early christian than an innocent child of the nineteenth century he had been stoned in the streets he had been overthrown into gutters bespattered with mud violently flattened against posts entire strangers to his person had lifted his yellow cap off his head and cast it to the winds his legs had not only undergone verbal criticisms and revilings but had been handled and pinched that very morning he had received a perfectly unsolicited black eye on his way to the grinders establishment and had been punished for it by the master a superannuated old grinder of savage disposition who had been appointed schoolmaster because he didnt know anything and wasnt fit for anything and for whose cruel cane all chubby little boys had a perfect fascination  thus it fell out that biler on his way home sought unfrequented paths and slunk along by narrow passages and back streets to avoid his tormentors being compelled to emerge into the main road his ill fortune brought him at last where a small party of boys headed by a ferocious young butcher were lying in wait for any means of pleasurable excitement that might happen these finding a charitable grinder in the midst of themunaccountably delivered over as it were into their handsset up a general yell and rushed upon him  but it so fell out likewise that at the same time polly looking hopelessly along the road before her after a good hours walk had said it was no use going any further when suddenly she saw this sight she no sooner saw it than uttering a hasty exclamation and giving master dombey to the blackeyed she started to the rescue of her unhappy little son  surprises like misfortunes rarely come alone the astonished susan nipper and her two young charges were rescued by the bystanders from under the very wheels of a passing carriage before they knew what had happened and at that moment it was market day a thundering alarm of mad bull was raised  with a wild confusion before her of people running up and down and shouting and wheels running over them and boys fighting and mad bulls coming up and the nurse in the midst of all these dangers being torn to pieces florence screamed and ran she ran till she was exhausted urging susan to do the same and then stopping and wringing her hands as she remembered they had left the other nurse behind found with a sensation of terror not to be described that she was quite alone  susan susan cried florence clapping her hands in the very ecstasy of her alarm oh where are they where are they  where are they said an old woman coming hobbling across as fast as she could from the opposite side of the way why did you run away from em  i was frightened answered florence i didnt know what i did i thought they were with me where are they  the old woman took her by the wrist and said ill show you  she was a very ugly old woman with red rims round her eyes and a mouth that mumbled and chattered of itself when she was not speaking she was miserably dressed and carried some skins over her arm she seemed to have followed florence some little way at all events for she had lost her breath and this made her uglier still as she stood trying to regain it working her shrivelled yellow face and throat into all sorts of contortions  florence was afraid of her and looked hesitating up the street of which she had almost reached the bottom it was a solitary placemore a back road than a streetand there was no one in it but herself and the old woman  you neednt be frightened now said the old woman still holding her tight come along with me  ii dont know you whats your name asked florence  mrs brown said the old woman good mrs brown  are they near here asked florence beginning to be led away  susan aint far off said good mrs brown and the others are close to her  is anybody hurt cried florence  not a bit of it said good mrs brown  the child shed tears of delight on hearing this and accompanied the old woman willingly though she could not help glancing at her face as they went alongparticularly at that industrious mouthand wondering whether bad mrs brown if there were such a person was at all like her  they had not gone far but had gone by some very uncomfortable places such as brickfields and tileyards when the old woman turned down a dirty lane where the mud lay in deep black ruts in the middle of the road she stopped before a shabby little house as closely shut up as a house that was full of cracks and crevices could be opening the door with a key she took out of her bonnet she pushed the child before her into a back room where there was a great heap of rags of different colours lying on the floor a heap of bones and a heap of sifted dust or cinders but there was no furniture at all and the walls and ceiling were quite black  the child became so terrified the she was stricken speechless and looked as though about to swoon  now dont be a young mule said good mrs brown reviving her with a shake im not a going to hurt you sit upon the rags  florence obeyed her holding out her folded hands in mute supplication  im not a going to keep you even above an hour said mrs brown dye understand what i say  the child answered with great difficulty yes  then said good mrs brown taking her own seat on the bones dont vex me if you dont i tell you i wont hurt you but if you do ill kill you i could have you killed at any timeeven if you was in your own bed at home now lets know who you are and what you are and all about it  the old womans threats and promises the dread of giving her offence and the habit unusual to a child but almost natural to florence now of being quiet and repressing what she felt and feared and hoped enabled her to do this bidding and to tell her little history or what she knew of it mrs brown listened attentively until she had finished  so your names dombey eh said mrs brown  i want that pretty frock miss dombey said good mrs brown and that little bonnet and a petticoat or two and anything else you can spare come take em off  florence obeyed as fast as her trembling hands would allow keeping all the while a frightened eye on mrs brown when she had divested herself of all the articles of apparel mentioned by that lady mrs b examined them at leisure and seemed tolerably well satisfied with their quality and value  humph she said running her eyes over the childs slight figure i dont see anything elseexcept the shoes i must have the shoes miss dombey  poor little florence took them off with equal alacrity only too glad to have any more means of conciliation about her the old woman then produced some wretched substitutes from the bottom of the heap of rags which she turned up for that purpose together with a girls cloak quite worn out and very old and the crushed remains of a bonnet that had probably been picked up from some ditch or dunghill in this dainty raiment she instructed florence to dress herself and as such preparation seemed a prelude to her release the child complied with increased readiness if possible  in hurriedly putting on the bonnet if that may be called a bonnet which was more like a pad to carry loads on she caught it in her hair which grew luxuriantly and could not immediately disentangle it good mrs brown whipped out a large pair of scissors and fell into an unaccountable state of excitement  why couldnt you let me be said mrs brown when i was contented you little fool  i beg your pardon i dont know what i have done panted florence i couldnt help it  couldnt help it cried mrs brown how do you expect i can help it why lord said the old woman ruffling her curls with a furious pleasure anybody but me would have had em off first of all florence was so relieved to find that it was only her hair and not her head which mrs brown coveted that she offered no resistance or entreaty and merely raised her mild eyes towards the face of that good soul  if i hadnt once had a gal of my ownbeyond seas nowthat was proud of her hair said mrs brown id have had every lock of it shes far away shes far away oho oho  mrs browns was not a melodious cry but accompanied with a wild tossing up of her lean arms it was full of passionate grief and thrilled to the heart of florence whom it frightened more than ever it had its part perhaps in saving her curls for mrs brown after hovering about her with the scissors for some moments like a new kind of butterfly bade her hide them under the bonnet and let no trace of them escape to tempt her having accomplished this victory over herself mrs brown resumed her seat on the bones and smoked a very short black pipe mowing and mumbling all the time as if she were eating the stem  when the pipe was smoked out she gave the child a rabbitskin to carry that she might appear the more like her ordinary companion and told her that she was now going to lead her to a public street whence she could inquire her way to her friends but she cautioned her with threats of summary and deadly vengeance in case of disobedience not to talk to strangers nor to repair to her own home which may have been too near for mrs browns convenience but to her fathers office in the city also to wait at the street corner where she would be left until the clock struck three these directions mrs brown enforced with assurances that there would be potent eyes and ears in her employment cognizant of all she did and these directions florence promised faithfully and earnestly to observe  at length mrs brown issuing forth conducted her changed and ragged little friend through a labyrinth of narrow streets and lanes and alleys which emerged after a long time upon a stable yard with a gateway at the end whence the roar of a great thoroughfare made itself audible pointing out this gateway and informing florence that when the clocks struck three she was to go to the left mrs brown after making a parting grasp at her hair which seemed involuntary and quite beyond her own control told her she knew what to do and bade her go and do it remembering that she was watched  with a lighter heart but still sore afraid florence felt herself released and tripped off to the corner when she reached it she looked back and saw the head of good mrs brown peeping out of the low wooden passage where she had issued her parting injunctions likewise the fist of good mrs brown shaking towards her but though she often looked back afterwardsevery minute at least in her nervous recollection of the old womanshe could not see her again  florence remained there looking at the bustle in the street and more and more bewildered by it and in the meanwhile the clocks appeared to have made up their minds never to strike three any more at last the steeples rang out three oclock there was one close by so she couldnt be mistaken andafter often looking over her shoulder and often going a little way and as often coming back again lest the allpowerful spies of mrs brown should take offenceshe hurried off as fast as she could in her slipshod shoes holding the rabbitskin tight in her hand  all she knew of her fathers offices was that they belonged to dombey and son and that that was a great power belonging to the city so she could only ask the way to dombey and sons in the city and as she generally made inquiry of childrenbeing afraid to ask grown peopleshe got very little satisfaction indeed but by dint of asking her way to the city after a while and dropping the rest of her inquiry for the present she really did advance by slow degrees towards the heart of that great region which is governed by the terrible lord mayor  tired of walking repulsed and pushed about stunned by the noise and confusion anxious for her brother and the nurses terrified by what she had undergone and the prospect of encountering her angry father in such an altered state perplexed and frightened alike by what had passed and what was passing and what was yet before her florence went upon her weary way with tearful eyes and once or twice could not help stopping to ease her bursting heart by crying bitterly but few people noticed her at those times in the garb she wore or if they did believed that she was tutored to excite compassion and passed on florence too called to her aid all the firmness and selfreliance of a character that her sad experience had prematurely formed and tried and keeping the end she had in view steadily before her steadily pursued it  it was full two hours later in the afternoon than when she had started on this strange adventure when escaping from the clash and clangour of a narrow street full of carts and waggons she peeped into a kind of wharf or landingplace upon the riverside where there were a great many packages casks and boxes strewn about a large pair of wooden scales and a little wooden house on wheels outside of which looking at the neighbouring masts and boats a stout man stood whistling with his pen behind his ear and his hands in his pockets as if his days work were nearly done  now then said this man happening to turn round we havent got anything for you little girl be off  if you please is this the city asked the trembling daughter of the dombeys  ah its the city you know that well enough i daresay be off we havent got anything for you  i dont want anything thank you was the timid answer except to know the way to dombey and sons  the man who had been strolling carelessly towards her seemed surprised by this reply and looking attentively in her face rejoined  why what can you want with dombey and sons  to know the way there if you please  the man looked at her yet more curiously and rubbed the back of his head so hard in his wonderment that he knocked his own hat off  joe he called to another mana laboureras he picked it up and put it on again  joe it is said joe  wheres that young spark of dombeys whos been watching the shipment of them goods  just gone by tother gate said joe  call him back a minute  joe ran up an archway bawling as he went and very soon returned with a blithelooking boy  youre dombeys jockey aint you said the first man  im in dombeys house mr clark returned the boy  lookye here then said mr clark  obedient to the indication of mr clarks hand the boy approached towards florence wondering as well he might what he had to do with her but she who had heard what passed and who besides the relief of so suddenly considering herself safe at her journeys end felt reassured beyond all measure by his lively youthful face and manner ran eagerly up to him leaving one of the slipshod shoes upon the ground and caught his hand in both of hers  i am lost if you please said florence  lost cried the boy  yes i was lost this morning a long way from hereand i have had my clothes taken away sinceand i am not dressed in my own nowand my name is florence dombey my little brothers only sisterand oh dear dear take care of me if you please sobbed florence giving full vent to the childish feelings she had so long suppressed and bursting into tears at the same time her miserable bonnet falling off her hair came tumbling down about her face moving to speechless admiration and commiseration young walter nephew of solomon gills ships instrumentmaker in general  mr clark stood rapt in amazement observing under his breath i never saw such a start on this wharf before walter picked up the shoe and put it on the little foot as the prince in the story might have fitted cinderellas slipper on he hung the rabbitskin over his left arm gave the right to florence and felt not to say like richard whittingtonthat is a tame comparisonbut like saint george of england with the dragon lying dead before him  dont cry miss dombey said walter in a transport of enthusiasm  what a wonderful thing for me that i am here you are as safe now as if you were guarded by a whole boats crew of picked men from a manofwar oh dont cry  i wont cry any more said florence i am only crying for joy  crying for joy thought walter and im the cause of it come along miss dombey theres the other shoe off now take mine miss dombey  no no no said florence checking him in the act of impetuously pulling off his own these do better these do very well  why to be sure said walter glancing at her foot mine are a mile too large what am i thinking about you never could walk in mine come along miss dombey let me see the villain who will dare molest you now  so walter looking immensely fierce led off florence looking very happy and they went arminarm along the streets perfectly indifferent to any astonishment that their appearance might or did excite by the way  it was growing dark and foggy and beginning to rain too but they cared nothing for this being both wholly absorbed in the late adventures of florence which she related with the innocent good faith and confidence of her years while walter listened as if far from the mud and grease of thames street they were rambling alone among the broad leaves and tall trees of some desert island in the tropicsas he very likely fancied for the time they were  have we far to go asked florence at last lilting up her eyes to her companions face  ah bythebye said walter stopping let me see where are we oh i know but the offices are shut up now miss dombey theres nobody there mr dombey has gone home long ago i suppose we must go home too or stay suppose i take you to my uncles where i liveits very near hereand go to your house in a coach to tell them you are safe and bring you back some clothes wont that be best  i think so answered florence dont you what do you think  as they stood deliberating in the street a man passed them who glanced quickly at walter as he went by as if he recognised him but seeming to correct that first impression he passed on without stopping  why i think its mr carker said walter carker in our house not carker our manager miss dombeythe other carker the juniorhalloa mr carker  is that walter gay said the other stopping and returning i couldnt believe it with such a strange companion  as he stood near a lamp listening with surprise to walters hurried explanation he presented a remarkable contrast to the two youthful figures arminarm before him he was not old but his hair was white his body was bent or bowed as if by the weight of some great trouble and there were deep lines in his worn and melancholy face the fire of his eyes the expression of his features the very voice in which he spoke were all subdued and quenched as if the spirit within him lay in ashes he was respectably though very plainly dressed in black but his clothes moulded to the general character of his figure seemed to shrink and abase themselves upon him and to join in the sorrowful solicitation which the whole man from head to foot expressed to be left unnoticed and alone in his humility  and yet his interest in youth and hopefulness was not extinguished with the other embers of his soul for he watched the boys earnest countenance as he spoke with unusual sympathy though with an inexplicable show of trouble and compassion which escaped into his looks however hard he strove to hold it prisoner when walter in conclusion put to him the question he had put to florence he still stood glancing at him with the same expression as if he had read some fate upon his face mournfully at variance with its present brightness  what do you advise mr carker said walter smiling you always give me good advice you know when you do speak to me thats not often though  i think your own idea is the best he answered looking from florence to walter and back again  mr carker said walter brightening with a generous thought come heres a chance for you go you to mr dombeys and be the messenger of good news it may do you some good sir ill remain at home you shall go  i returned the other  yes why not mr carker said the boy  he merely shook him by the hand in answer he seemed in a manner ashamed and afraid even to do that and bidding him goodnight and advising him to make haste turned away  come miss dombey said walter looking after him as they turned away also well go to my uncles as quick as we can did you ever hear mr dombey speak of mr carker the junior miss florence  no returned the child mildly i dont often hear papa speak  ah true more shame for him thought walter after a minutes pause during which he had been looking down upon the gentle patient little face moving on at his side he said the strangest man mr carker the junior is miss florence that ever you heard of if you could understand what an extraordinary interest he takes in me and yet how he shuns me and avoids me and what a low place he holds in our office and how he is never advanced and never complains though year after year he sees young men passed over his head and though his brother younger than he is is our head manager you would be as much puzzled about him as i am  as florence could hardly be expected to understand much about it walter bestirred himself with his accustomed boyish animation and restlessness to change the subject and one of the unfortunate shoes coming off again opportunely proposed to carry florence to his uncles in his arms florence though very tired laughingly declined the proposal lest he should let her fall and as they were already near the wooden midshipman and as walter went on to cite various precedents from shipwrecks and other moving accidents where younger boys than he had triumphantly rescued and carried off older girls than florence they were still in full conversation about it when they arrived at the instrumentmakers door  holloa uncle sol cried walter bursting into the shop and speaking incoherently and out of breath from that time forth for the rest of the evening heres a wonderful adventure heres mr dombeys daughter lost in the streets and robbed of her clothes by an old witch of a womanfound by mebrought home to our parlour to restlook here  good heaven said uncle sol starting back against his favourite compasscase it cant be well i  no nor anybody else said walter anticipating the rest nobody would nobody could you know here just help me lift the little sofa near the fire will you uncle soltake care of the platescut some dinner for her will you unclethrow those shoes under the grate miss florenceput your feet on the fender to dryhow damp they areheres an adventure uncle ehgod bless my soul how hot i am  solomon gills was quite as hot by sympathy and in excessive bewilderment he patted florences head pressed her to eat pressed her to drink rubbed the soles of her feet with his pockethandkerchief heated at the fire followed his locomotive nephew with his eyes and ears and had no clear perception of anything except that he was being constantly knocked against and tumbled over by that excited young gentleman as he darted about the room attempting to accomplish twenty things at once and doing nothing at all  here wait a minute uncle he continued catching up a candle till i run upstairs and get another jacket on and then ill be off i say uncle isnt this an adventure  my dear boy said solomon who with his spectacles on his forehead and the great chronometer in his pocket was incessantly oscillating between florence on the sofa and his nephew in all parts of the parlour its the most extraordinary  no but do uncle pleasedo miss florencedinner you know uncle  yes yes yes cried solomon cutting instantly into a leg of mutton as if he were catering for a giant ill take care of her wally i understand pretty dear famished of course you go and get ready lord bless me sir richard whittington thrice lord mayor of london  walter was not very long in mounting to his lofty garret and descending from it but in the meantime florence overcome by fatigue had sunk into a doze before the fire the short interval of quiet though only a few minutes in duration enabled solomon gills so far to collect his wits as to make some little arrangements for her comfort and to darken the room and to screen her from the blaze thus when the boy returned she was sleeping peacefully  thats capital he whispered giving solomon such a hug that it squeezed a new expression into his face now im off ill just take a crust of bread with me for im very hungryand dont wake her uncle sol  no no said solomon pretty child  pretty indeed cried walter i never saw such a face uncle sol now im off  thats right said solomon greatly relieved  i say uncle sol cried walter putting his face in at the door  here he is again said solomon  how does she look now  quite happy said solomon  thats famous now im off  i hope you are said solomon to himself  i say uncle sol cried walter reappearing at the door  here he is again said solomon  we met mr carker the junior in the street queerer than ever he bade me goodbye but came behind us heretheres an odd thingfor when we reached the shop door i looked round and saw him going quietly away like a servant who had seen me home or a faithful dog how does she look now uncle  pretty much the same as before wally replied uncle sol  thats right now i am off  and this time he really was and solomon gills with no appetite for dinner sat on the opposite side of the fire watching florence in her slumber building a great many airy castles of the most fantastic architecture and looking in the dim shade and in the close vicinity of all the instruments like a magician disguised in a welsh wig and a suit of coffee colour who held the child in an enchanted sleep  in the meantime walter proceeded towards mr dombeys house at a pace seldom achieved by a hack horse from the stand and yet with his head out of window every two or three minutes in impatient remonstrance with the driver arriving at his journeys end he leaped out and breathlessly announcing his errand to the servant followed him straight into the library we there was a great confusion of tongues and where mr dombey his sister and miss tox richards and nipper were all congregated together  oh i beg your pardon sir said walter rushing up to him but im happy to say its all right sir miss dombeys found  the boy with his open face and flowing hair and sparkling eyes panting with pleasure and excitement was wonderfully opposed to mr dombey as he sat confronting him in his library chair  i told you louisa that she would certainly be found said mr dombey looking slightly over his shoulder at that lady who wept in company with miss tox let the servants know that no further steps are necessary this boy who brings the information is young gay from the office how was my daughter found sir i know how she was lost here he looked majestically at richards but how was she found who found her  why i believe i found miss dombey sir said walter modestly at least i dont know that i can claim the merit of having exactly found her sir but i was the fortunate instrument of  what do you mean sir interrupted mr dombey regarding the boys evident pride and pleasure in his share of the transaction with an instinctive dislike by not having exactly found my daughter and by being a fortunate instrument be plain and coherent if you please  it was quite out of walters power to be coherent but he rendered himself as explanatory as he could in his breathless state and stated why he had come alone  you hear this girl said mr dombey sternly to the blackeyed take what is necessary and return immediately with this young man to fetch miss florence home gay you will be rewarded tomorrow  oh thank you sir said walter you are very kind im sure i was not thinking of any reward sir  you are a boy said mr dombey suddenly and almost fiercely and what you think of or affect to think of is of little consequence you have done well sir dont undo it louisa please to give the lad some wine  mr dombeys glance followed walter gay with sharp disfavour as he left the room under the pilotage of mrs chick and it may be that his minds eye followed him with no greater relish as he rode back to his uncles with miss susan nipper  there they found that florence much refreshed by sleep had dined and greatly improved the acquaintance of solomon gills with whom she was on terms of perfect confidence and ease the blackeyed who had cried so much that she might now be called the redeyed and who was very silent and depressed caught her in her arms without a word of contradiction or reproach and made a very hysterical meeting of it then converting the parlour for the nonce into a private tiring room she dressed her with great care in proper clothes and presently led her forth as like a dombey as her natural disqualifications admitted of her being made  goodnight said florence running up to solomon you have been very good to me  old sol was quite delighted and kissed her like her grandfather  goodnight walter goodbye said florence  goodbye said walter giving both his hands  ill never forget you pursued florence no indeed i never will goodbye walter in the innocence of her grateful heart the child lifted up her face to his walter bending down his own raised it again all red and burning and looked at uncle sol quite sheepishly  wheres walter goodnight walter goodbye walter shake hands once more walter this was still florences cry after she was shut up with her little maid in the coach and when the coach at length moved off walter on the doorstep gaily turned the waving of her handkerchief while the wooden midshipman behind him seemed like himself intent upon that coach alone excluding all the other passing coaches from his observation  in good time mr dombeys mansion was gained again and again there was a noise of tongues in the library again too the coach was ordered to waitfor mrs richards one of susans fellowservants ominously whispered as she passed with florence  the entrance of the lost child made a slight sensation but not much mr dombey who had never found her kissed her once upon the forehead and cautioned her not to run away again or wander anywhere with treacherous attendants mrs chick stopped in her lamentations on the corruption of human nature even when beckoned to the paths of virtue by a charitable grinder and received her with a welcome something short of the reception due to none but perfect dombeys miss tox regulated her feelings by the models before her richards the culprit richards alone poured out her heart in broken words of welcome and bowed herself over the little wandering head as if she really loved it  ah richards said mrs chick with a sigh it would have been much more satisfactory to those who wish to think well of their fellow creatures and much more becoming in you if you had shown some proper feeling in time for the little child that is now going to be prematurely deprived of its natural nourishment  cut off said miss tox in a plaintive whisper from one common fountain  if it was ungrateful case said mrs chick solemnly and i had your reflections richards i should feel as if the charitable grinders dress would blight my child and the education choke him  for the matter of thatbut mrs chick didnt know ithe had been pretty well blighted by the dress already and as to the education even its retributive effect might be produced in time for it was a storm of sobs and blows  louisa said mr dombey it is not necessary to prolong these observations the woman is discharged and paid you leave this house richards for taking my sonmy son said mr dombey emphatically repeating these two words into haunts and into society which are not to be thought of without a shudder as to the accident which befel miss florence this morning i regard that as in one great sense a happy and fortunate circumstance inasmuch as but for that occurrence i never could have knownand from your own lips tooof what you had been guilty i think louisa the other nurse the young person here miss nipper sobbed aloud being so much younger and necessarily influenced by pauls nurse may remain have the goodness to direct that this womans coach is paid tomr dombey stopped and wincedto staggss gardens  polly moved towards the door with florence holding to her dress and crying to her in the most pathetic manner not to go away it was a dagger in the haughty fathers heart an arrow in his brain to see how the flesh and blood he could not disown clung to this obscure stranger and he sitting by not that he cared to whom his daughter turned or from whom turned away the swift sharp agony struck through him as he thought of what his son might do  his son cried lustily that night at all events sooth to say poor paul had better reason for his tears than sons of that age often have for he had lost his second motherhis first so far as he knewby a stroke as sudden as that natural affliction which had darkened the beginning of his life at the same blow his sister too who cried herself to sleep so mournfully had lost as good and true a friend but that is quite beside the question let us waste no words about it    chapter 7 a birdseye glimpse of miss toxs dwellingplace also of the state of miss toxs affections   miss tox inhabited a dark little house that had been squeezed at some remote period of english history into a fashionable neighbourhood at the west end of the town where it stood in the shade like a poor relation of the great street round the corner coldly looked down upon by mighty mansions it was not exactly in a court and it was not exactly in a yard but it was in the dullest of nothoroughfares rendered anxious and haggard by distant double knocks the name of this retirement where grass grew between the chinks in the stone pavement was princesss place and in princesss place was princesss chapel with a tinkling bell where sometimes as many as fiveandtwenty people attended service on a sunday the princesss arms was also there and much resorted to by splendid footmen a sedan chair was kept inside the railing before the princesss arms but it had never come out within the memory of man and on fine mornings the top of every rail there were eightandforty as miss tox had often counted was decorated with a pewterpot  there was another private house besides miss toxs in princesss place not to mention an immense pair of gates with an immense pair of lionheaded knockers on them which were never opened by any chance and were supposed to constitute a disused entrance to somebodys stables indeed there was a smack of stabling in the air of princesss place and miss toxs bedroom which was at the back commanded a vista of mews where hostlers at whatever sort of work engaged were continually accompanying themselves with effervescent noises and where the most domestic and confidential garments of coachmen and their wives and families usually hung like macbeths banners on the outward walls  at this other private house in princesss place tenanted by a retired butler who had married a housekeeper apartments were let furnished to a single gentleman to wit a woodenfeatured bluefaced major with his eyes starting out of his head in whom miss tox recognised as she herself expressed it something so truly military and between whom and herself an occasional interchange of newspapers and pamphlets and such platonic dalliance was effected through the medium of a dark servant of the majors who miss tox was quite content to classify as a native without connecting him with any geographical idea whatever  perhaps there never was a smaller entry and staircase than the entry and staircase of miss toxs house perhaps taken altogether from top to bottom it was the most inconvenient little house in england and the crookedest but then miss tox said what a situation there was very little daylight to be got there in the winter no sun at the best of times air was out of the question and traffic was walled out still miss tox said think of the situation so said the bluefaced major whose eyes were starting out of his head who gloried in princesss place and who delighted to turn the conversation at his club whenever he could to something connected with some of the great people in the great street round the corner that he might have the satisfaction of saying they were his neighbours  in short with miss tox and the bluefaced major it was enough for princesss placeas with a very small fragment of society it is enough for many a little hangeron of another sortto be well connected and to have genteel blood in its veins it might be poor mean shabby stupid dull no matter the great street round the corner trailed off into princesss place and that which of high holborn would have become a choleric word spoken of princesss place became flat blasphemy  the dingy tenement inhabited by miss tox was her own having been devised and bequeathed to her by the deceased owner of the fishy eye in the locket of whom a miniature portrait with a powdered head and a pigtail balanced the kettleholder on opposite sides of the parlour fireplace the greater part of the furniture was of the powderedhead and pigtail period comprising a platewarmer always languishing and sprawling its four attenuated bow legs in somebodys way and an obsolete harpsichord illuminated round the makers name with a painted garland of sweet peas in any part of the house visitors were usually cognizant of a prevailing mustiness and in warm weather miss tox had been seen apparently writing in sundry chinks and crevices of the wainscoat with the the wrong end of a pen dipped in spirits of turpentine  although major bagstock had arrived at what is called in polite literature the grand meridian of life and was proceeding on his journey downhill with hardly any throat and a very rigid pair of jawbones and longflapped elephantine ears and his eyes and complexion in the state of artificial excitement already mentioned he was mightily proud of awakening an interest in miss tox and tickled his vanity with the fiction that she was a splendid woman who had her eye on him this he had several times hinted at the club in connexion with little jocularities of which old joe bagstock old joey bagstock old j bagstock old josh bagstock or so forth was the perpetual theme it being as it were the majors stronghold and donjonkeep of light humour to be on the most familiar terms with his own name  joey b sirthe major would say with a flourish of his walkingstick is worth a dozen of you if you had a few more of the bagstock breed among you sir youd be none the worse for it old joe sir neednt look far for a wile even now if he was on the lookout but hes hardhearted sir is joehes tough sir tough and devilish sly after such a declaration wheezing sounds would be heard and the majors blue would deepen into purple while his eyes strained and started convulsively  notwithstanding his very liberal laudation of himself however the major was selfish it may be doubted whether there ever was a more entirely selfish person at heart or at stomach is perhaps a better expression seeing that he was more decidedly endowed with that latter organ than with the former he had no idea of being overlooked or slighted by anybody least of all had he the remotest comprehension of being overlooked and slighted by miss tox  and yet miss tox as it appeared forgot himgradually forgot him she began to forget him soon after her discovery of the toodle family she continued to forget him up to the time of the christening she went on forgetting him with compound interest after that something or somebody had superseded him as a source of interest  good morning maam said the major meeting miss tox in princesss place some weeks after the changes chronicled in the last chapter  good morning sir said miss tox very coldly  joe bagstock maam observed the major with his usual gallantry has not had the happiness of bowing to you at your window for a considerable period joe has been hardly used maam his sun has been behind a cloud  miss tox inclined her head but very coldly indeed  joes luminary has been out of town maam perhaps inquired the major  i out of town oh no i have not been out of town said miss tox i have been much engaged lately my time is nearly all devoted to some very intimate friends i am afraid i have none to spare even now good morning sir  as miss tox with her most fascinating step and carriage disappeared from princesss place the major stood looking after her with a bluer face than ever muttering and growling some not at all complimentary remarks  why damme sir said the major rolling his lobster eyes round and round princesss place and apostrophizing its fragrant air six months ago the woman loved the ground josh bagstock walked on whats the meaning of it  the major decided after some consideration that it meant mantraps that it meant plotting and snaring that miss tox was digging pitfalls but you wont catch joe maam said the major hes tough maam tough is jb tough and devilish sly over which reflection he chuckled for the rest of the day  but still when that day and many other days were gone and past it seemed that miss tox took no heed whatever of the major and thought nothing at all about him she had been wont once upon a time to look out at one of her little dark windows by accident and blushingly return the majors greeting but now she never gave the major a chance and cared nothing at all whether he looked over the way or not other changes had come to pass too the major standing in the shade of his own apartment could make out that an air of greater smartness had recently come over miss toxs house that a new cage with gilded wires had been provided for the ancient little canary bird that divers ornaments cut out of coloured cardboards and paper seemed to decorate the chimneypiece and tables that a plant or two had suddenly sprung up in the windows that miss tox occasionally practised on the harpsichord whose garland of sweet peas was always displayed ostentatiously crowned with the copenhagen and bird waltzes in a music book of miss toxs own copying  over and above all this miss tox had long been dressed with uncommon care and elegance in slight mourning but this helped the major out of his difficulty and be determined within himself that she had come into a small legacy and grown proud  it was on the very next day after he had eased his mind by arriving at this decision that the major sitting at his breakfast saw an apparition so tremendous and wonderful in miss toxs little drawingroom that he remained for some time rooted to his chair then rushing into the next room returned with a doublebarrelled operaglass through which he surveyed it intently for some minutes  its a baby sir said the major shutting up the glass again for fifty thousand pounds  the major couldnt forget it he could do nothing but whistle and stare to that extent that his eyes compared with what they now became had been in former times quite cavernous and sunken day after day two three four times a week this baby reappeared the major continued to stare and whistle to all other intents and purposes he was alone in princesss place miss tox had ceased to mind what he did he might have been black as well as blue and it would have been of no consequence to her  the perseverance with which she walked out of princesss place to fetch this baby and its nurse and walked back with them and walked home with them again and continually mounted guard over them and the perseverance with which she nursed it herself and fed it and played with it and froze its young blood with airs upon the harpsichord was extraordinary at about this same period too she was seized with a passion for looking at a certain bracelet also with a passion for looking at the moon of which she would take long observations from her chamber window but whatever she looked at sun moon stars or bracelet she looked no more at the major and the major whistled and stared and wondered and dodged about his room and could make nothing of it  youll quite win my brother pauls heart and thats the truth my dear said mrs chick one day  miss tox turned pale  he grows more like paul every day said mrs chick  miss tox returned no other reply than by taking the little paul in her arms and making his cockade perfectly flat and limp with her caresses  his mother my dear said miss tox whose acquaintance i was to have made through you does he at all resemble her  not at all returned louisa  she wasshe was pretty i believe faltered miss tox  why poor dear fanny was interesting said mrs chick after some judicial consideration certainly interesting she had not that air of commanding superiority which one would somehow expect almost as a matter of course to find in my brothers wife nor had she that strength and vigour of mind which such a man requires  miss tox heaved a deep sigh  but she was pleasing said mrs chick extremely so and she meantoh dear how well poor fanny meant  you angel cried miss tox to little paul you picture of your own papa  if the major could have known how many hopes and ventures what a multitude of plans and speculations rested on that baby head and could have seen them hovering in all their heterogeneous confusion and disorder round the puckered cap of the unconscious little paul he might have stared indeed then would he have recognised among the crowd some few ambitious motes and beams belonging to miss tox then would he perhaps have understood the nature of that ladys faltering investment in the dombey firm  if the child himself could have awakened in the night and seen gathered about his cradlecurtains faint reflections of the dreams that other people had of him they might have scared him with good reason but he slumbered on alike unconscious of the kind intentions of miss tox the wonder of the major the early sorrows of his sister and the stern visions of his father and innocent that any spot of earth contained a dombey or a son    chapter 8 pauls further progress growth and character   beneath the watching and attentive eyes of timeso far another majorpauls slumbers gradually changed more and more light broke in upon them distincter and distincter dreams disturbed them an accumulating crowd of objects and impressions swarmed about his rest and so he passed from babyhood to childhood and became a talking walking wondering dombey  on the downfall and banishment of richards the nursery may be said to have been put into commission as a public department is sometimes when no individual atlas can be found to support it the commissioners were of course mrs chick and miss tox who devoted themselves to their duties with such astonishing ardour that major bagstock had every day some new reminder of his being forsaken while mr chick bereft of domestic supervision cast himself upon the gay world dined at clubs and coffeehouses smelt of smoke on three different occasions went to the play by himself and in short loosened as mrs chick once told him every social bond and moral obligation  yet in spite of his early promise all this vigilance and care could not make little paul a thriving boy naturally delicate perhaps he pined and wasted after the dismissal of his nurse and for a long time seemed but to wait his opportunity of gliding through their hands and seeking his lost mother this dangerous ground in his steeplechase towards manhood passed he still found it very rough riding and was grievously beset by all the obstacles in his course every tooth was a breakneck fence and every pimple in the measles a stone wall to him he was down in every fit of the hoopingcough and rolled upon and crushed by a whole field of small diseases that came trooping on each others heels to prevent his getting up again some bird of prey got into his throat instead of the thrush and the very chickens turning ferociousif they have anything to do with that infant malady to which they lend their nameworried him like tigercats  the chill of pauls christening had struck home perhaps to some sensitive part of his nature which could not recover itself in the cold shade of his father but he was an unfortunate child from that day mrs wickam often said she never see a dear so put upon  mrs wickam was a waiters wifewhich would seem equivalent to being any other mans widowwhose application for an engagement in mr dombeys service had been favourably considered on account of the apparent impossibility of her having any followers or anyone to follow and who from within a day or two of pauls sharp weaning had been engaged as his nurse mrs wickam was a meek woman of a fair complexion with her eyebrows always elevated and her head always drooping who was always ready to pity herself or to be pitied or to pity anybody else and who had a surprising natural gift of viewing all subjects in an utterly forlorn and pitiable light and bringing dreadful precedents to bear upon them and deriving the greatest consolation from the exercise of that talent  it is hardly necessary to observe that no touch of this quality ever reached the magnificent knowledge of mr dombey it would have been remarkable indeed if any had when no one in the housenot even mrs chick or miss toxdared ever whisper to him that there had on any one occasion been the least reason for uneasiness in reference to little paul he had settled within himself that the child must necessarily pass through a certain routine of minor maladies and that the sooner he did so the better if he could have bought him off or provided a substitute as in the case of an unlucky drawing for the militia he would have been glad to do so on liberal terms but as this was not feasible he merely wondered in his haughtymanner now and then what nature meant by it and comforted himself with the reflection that there was another milestone passed upon the road and that the great end of the journey lay so much the nearer for the feeling uppermost in his mind now and constantly intensifying and increasing in it as paul grew older was impatience impatience for the time to come when his visions of their united consequence and grandeur would be triumphantly realized  some philosophers tell us that selfishness is at the root of our best loves and affections mr dombeys young child was from the beginning so distinctly important to him as a part of his own greatness or which is the same thing of the greatness of dombey and son that there is no doubt his parental affection might have been easily traced like many a goodly superstructure of fair fame to a very low foundation but he loved his son with all the love he had if there were a warm place in his frosty heart his son occupied it if its very hard surface could receive the impression of any image the image of that son was there though not so much as an infant or as a boy but as a grown manthe son of the firm therefore he was impatient to advance into the future and to hurry over the intervening passages of his history therefore he had little or no anxiety about them in spite of his love feeling as if the boy had a charmed life and must become the man with whom he held such constant communication in his thoughts and for whom he planned and projected as for an existing reality every day  thus paul grew to be nearly five years old he was a pretty little fellow though there was something wan and wistful in his small face that gave occasion to many significant shakes of mrs wickams head and many longdrawn inspirations of mrs wickams breath his temper gave abundant promise of being imperious in afterlife and he had as hopeful an apprehension of his own importance and the rightful subservience of all other things and persons to it as heart could desire he was childish and sportive enough at times and not of a sullen disposition but he had a strange oldfashioned thoughtful way at other times of sitting brooding in his miniature armchair when he looked and talked like one of those terrible little beings in the fairy tales who at a hundred and fifty or two hundred years of age fantastically represent the children for whom they have been substituted he would frequently be stricken with this precocious mood upstairs in the nursery and would sometimes lapse into it suddenly exclaiming that he was tired even while playing with florence or driving miss tox in single harness but at no time did he fall into it so surely as when his little chair being carried down into his fathers room he sat there with him after dinner by the fire they were the strangest pair at such a time that ever firelight shone upon mr dombey so erect and solemn gazing at the blare his little image with an old old face peering into the red perspective with the fixed and rapt attention of a sage mr dombey entertaining complicated worldly schemes and plans the little image entertaining heaven knows what wild fancies halfformed thoughts and wandering speculations mr dombey stiff with starch and arrogance the little image by inheritance and in unconscious imitation the two so very much alike and yet so monstrously contrasted  on one of these occasions when they had both been perfectly quiet for a long time and mr dombey only knew that the child was awake by occasionally glancing at his eye where the bright fire was sparkling like a jewel little paul broke silence thus  papa whats money  the abrupt question had such immediate reference to the subject of mr dombeys thoughts that mr dombey was quite disconcerted  what is money paul he answered money  yes said the child laying his hands upon the elbows of his little chair and turning the old face up towards mr dombeys what is money  mr dombey was in a difficulty he would have liked to give him some explanation involving the terms circulatingmedium currency depreciation of currency paper bullion rates of exchange value of precious metals in the market and so forth but looking down at the little chair and seeing what a long way down it was he answered gold and silver and copper guineas shillings halfpence you know what they are  oh yes i know what they are said paul i dont mean that papa i mean whats money after all  heaven and earth how old his face was as he turned it up again towards his fathers  what is money after all said mr dombey backing his chair a little that he might the better gaze in sheer amazement at the presumptuous atom that propounded such an inquiry  i mean papa what can it do returned paul folding his arms they were hardly long enough to fold and looking at the fire and up at him and at the fire and up at him again  mr dombey drew his chair back to its former place and patted him on the head youll know better byandby my man he said money paul can do anything he took hold of the little hand and beat it softly against one of his own as he said so  but paul got his hand free as soon as he could and rubbing it gently to and fro on the elbow of his chair as if his wit were in the palm and he were sharpening itand looking at the fire again as though the fire had been his adviser and prompterrepeated after a short pause  anything papa  yes anythingalmost said mr dombey  anything means everything dont it papa asked his son not observing or possibly not understanding the qualification  it includes it yes said mr dombey  why didnt money save me my mama returned the child it isnt cruel is it  cruel said mr dombey settling his neckcloth and seeming to resent the idea no a good thing cant be cruel  if its a good thing and can do anything said the little fellow thoughtfully as he looked back at the fire i wonder why it didnt save me my mama  he didnt ask the question of his father this time perhaps he had seen with a childs quickness that it had already made his father uncomfortable but he repeated the thought aloud as if it were quite an old one to him and had troubled him very much and sat with his chin resting on his hand still cogitating and looking for an explanation in the fire  mr dombey having recovered from his surprise not to say his alarm for it was the very first occasion on which the child had ever broached the subject of his mother to him though he had had him sitting by his side in this same manner evening after evening expounded to him how that money though a very potent spirit never to be disparaged on any account whatever could not keep people alive whose time was come to die and how that we must all die unfortunately even in the city though we were never so rich but how that money caused us to be honoured feared respected courted and admired and made us powerful and glorious in the eyes of all men and how that it could very often even keep off death for a long time together how for example it had secured to his mama the services of mr pilkins by which be paul had often profited himself likewise of the great doctor parker peps whom he had never known and how it could do all that could be done this with more to the same purpose mr dombey instilled into the mind of his son who listened attentively and seemed to understand the greater part of what was said to him  it cant make me strong and quite well either papa can it asked paul after a short silence rubbing his tiny hands  why you are strong and quite well returned mr dombey are you not  oh the age of the face that was turned up again with an expression half of melancholy half of slyness on it  you are as strong and well as such little people usually are eh said mr dombey  florence is older than i am but im not as strong and well as florence i know returned the child and i believe that when florence was as little as me she could play a great deal longer at a time without tiring herself i am so tired sometimes said little paul warming his hands and looking in between the bars of the grate as if some ghostly puppetshow were performing there and my bones ache so wickam says its my bones that i dont know what to do  ay but thats at night said mr dombey drawing his own chair closer to his sons and laying his hand gently on his back little people should be tired at night for then they sleep well  oh its not at night papa returned the child its in the day and i lie down in florences lap and she sings to me at night i dream about such curious things  and he went on warming his hands again and thinking about them like an old man or a young goblin  mr dombey was so astonished and so uncomfortable and so perfectly at a loss how to pursue the conversation that he could only sit looking at his son by the light of the fire with his hand resting on his back as if it were detained there by some magnetic attraction once he advanced his other hand and turned the contemplative face towards his own for a moment but it sought the fire again as soon as he released it and remained addressed towards the flickering blaze until the nurse appeared to summon him to bed  i want florence to come for me said paul  wont you come with your poor nurse wickam master paul inquired that attendant with great pathos  no i wont replied paul composing himself in his armchair again like the master of the house  invoking a blessing upon his innocence mrs wickam withdrew and presently florence appeared in her stead the child immediately started up with sudden readiness and animation and raised towards his father in bidding him goodnight a countenance so much brighter so much younger and so much more childlike altogether that mr dombey while he felt greatly reassured by the change was quite amazed at it  after they had left the room together he thought he heard a soft voice singing and remembering that paul had said his sister sung to him he had the curiosity to open the door and listen and look after them she was toiling up the great wide vacant staircase with him in her arms his head was lying on her shoulder one of his arms thrown negligently round her neck so they went toiling up she singing all the way and paul sometimes crooning out a feeble accompaniment mr dombey looked after them until they reached the top of the staircasenot without halting to rest by the wayand passed out of his sight and then he still stood gazing upwards until the dull rays of the moon glimmering in a melancholy manner through the dim skylight sent him back to his room  mrs chick and miss tox were convoked in council at dinner next day and when the cloth was removed mr dombey opened the proceedings by requiring to be informed without any gloss or reservation whether there was anything the matter with paul and what mr pilkins said about him  for the child is hardly said mr dombey as stout as i could wish  my dear paul returned mrs chick with your usual happy discrimination which i am weak enough to envy you every time i am in your company and so i think is miss tox  oh my dear said miss tox softly how could it be otherwise presumptuous as it is to aspire to such a level still if the bird of night maybut ill not trouble mr dombey with the sentiment it merely relates to the bulbul  mr dombey bent his head in stately recognition of the bulbuls as an oldestablished body  with your usual happy discrimination my dear paul resumed mrs chick you have hit the point at once our darling is altogether as stout as we could wish the fact is that his mind is too much for him his soul is a great deal too large for his frame i am sure the way in which that dear child talkssaid mrs chick shaking her head no one would believe his expressions lucretia only yesterday upon the subject of funerals  i am afraid said mr dombey interrupting her testily that some of those persons upstairs suggest improper subjects to the child he was speaking to me last night about hisabout his bones said mr dombey laying an irritated stress upon the word what on earth has anybody to do with thewith thebones of my son he is not a living skeleton i suppose  very far from it said mrs chick with unspeakable expression  i hope so returned her brother funerals again who talks to the child of funerals we are not undertakers or mutes or gravediggers i believe  very far from it interposed mrs chick with the same profound expression as before  then who puts such things into his head said mr dombey really i was quite dismayed and shocked last night who puts such things into his head louisa  my dear paul said mrs chick after a moments silence it is of no use inquiring i do not think i will tell you candidly that wickam is a person of very cheerful spirit or what one would call a  a daughter of momus miss tox softly suggested  exactly so said mrs chick but she is exceedingly attentive and useful and not at all presumptuous indeed i never saw a more biddable woman i would say that for her if i was put upon my trial before a court of justice  well you are not put upon your trial before a court of justice at present louisa returned mr dombey chafing and therefore it dont matter  my dear paul said mrs chick in a warning voice i must be spoken to kindly or there is an end of me at the same time a premonitory redness developed itself in mrs chicks eyelids which was an invariable sign of rain unless the weather changed directly  i was inquiring louisa observed mr dombey in an altered voice and after a decent interval about pauls health and actual state  if the dear child said mrs chick in the tone of one who was summing up what had been previously quite agreed upon instead of saying it all for the first time is a little weakened by that last attack and is not in quite such vigorous health as we could wish and if he has some temporary weakness in his system and does occasionally seem about to lose for the moment the use of his  mrs chick was afraid to say limbs after mr dombeys recent objection to bones and therefore waited for a suggestion from miss tox who true to her office hazarded members  members repeated mr dombey  i think the medical gentleman mentioned legs this morning my dear louisa did he not said miss tox  why of course he did my love retorted mrs chick mildly reproachful how can you ask me you heard him i say if our dear paul should lose for the moment the use of his legs these are casualties common to many children at his time of life and not to be prevented by any care or caution the sooner you understand that paul and admit that the better if you have any doubt as to the amount of care and caution and affection and selfsacrifice that has been bestowed upon little paul i should wish to refer the question to your medical attendant or to any of your dependants in this house call towlinson said mrs chick i believe he has no prejudice in our favour quite the contrary i should wish to hear what accusation towlinson can make  surely you must know louisa observed mr dombey that i dont question your natural devotion to and regard for the future head of my house  i am glad to hear it paul said mrs chick but really you are very odd and sometimes talk very strangely though without meaning it i know if your dear boys soul is too much for his body paul you should remember whose fault that iswho he takes after i meanand make the best of it hes as like his papa as he can be people have noticed it in the streets the very beadle i am informed observed it so long ago as at his christening hes a very respectable man with children of his own he ought to know  mr pilkins saw paul this morning i believe said mr dombey  yes he did returned his sister miss tox and myself were present miss tox and myself are always present we make a point of it mr pilkins has seen him for some days past and a very clever man i believe him to be he says it is nothing to speak of which i can confirm if that is any consolation but he recommended today seaair very wisely paul i feel convinced  seaair repeated mr dombey looking at his sister  there is nothing to be made uneasy by in thatsaid mrs chick my george and frederick were both ordered seaair when they were about his age and i have been ordered it myself a great many times i quite agree with you paul that perhaps topics may be incautiously mentioned upstairs before him which it would be as well for his little mind not to expatiate upon but i really dont see how that is to be helped in the case of a child of his quickness if he were a common child there would be nothing in it i must say i think with miss tox that a short absence from this house the air of brighton and the bodily and mental training of so judicious a person as mrs pipchin for instance  who is mrs pipchin louisa asked mr dombey aghast at this familiar introduction of a name he had never heard before  mrs pipchin my dear paul returned his sister is an elderly ladymiss tox knows her whole historywho has for some time devoted all the energies of her mind with the greatest success to the study and treatment of infancy and who has been extremely well connected her husband broke his heart inhow did you say her husband broke his heart my dear i forget the precise circumstances  in pumping water out of the peruvian mines replied miss tox  not being a pumper himself of course said mrs chick glancing at her brother and it really did seem necessary to offer the explanation for miss tox had spoken of him as if he had died at the handle but having invested money in the speculation which failed i believe that mrs pipchins management of children is quite astonishing i have heard it commended in private circles ever since i wasdear mehow high mrs chicks eye wandered about the bookcase near the bust of mr pitt which was about ten feet from the ground  perhaps i should say of mrs pipchin my dear sir observed miss tox with an ingenuous blush having been so pointedly referred to that the encomium which has been passed upon her by your sweet sister is well merited many ladies and gentleman now grown up to be interesting members of society have been indebted to her care the humble individual who addresses you was once under her charge i believe juvenile nobility itself is no stranger to her establishment  do i understand that this respectable matron keeps an establishment miss tox the mr dombey condescendingly  why i really dont know rejoined that lady whether i am justified in calling it so it is not a preparatory school by any means should i express my meaning said miss tox with peculiar sweetnessif i designated it an infantine boardinghouse of a very select description  on an exceedingly limited and particular scale suggested mrs chick with a glance at her brother  oh exclusion itself said miss tox  there was something in this mrs pipchins husband having broken his heart of the peruvian mines was good it had a rich sound besides mr dombey was in a state almost amounting to consternation at the idea of paul remaining where he was one hour after his removal had been recommended by the medical practitioner it was a stoppage and delay upon the road the child must traverse slowly at the best before the goal was reached their recommendation of mrs pipchin had great weight with him for he knew that they were jealous of any interference with their charge and he never for a moment took it into account that they might be solicitous to divide a responsibility of which he had as shown just now his own established views broke his heart of the peruvian mines mused mr dombey well a very respectable way of doing it  supposing we should decide on tomorrows inquiries to send paul down to brighton to this lady who would go with him inquired mr dombey after some reflection  i dont think you could send the child anywhere at present without florence my dear paul returned his sister hesitating its quite an infatuation with him hes very young you know and has his fancies  mr dombey turned his head away and going slowly to the bookcase and unlocking it brought back a book to read  anybody else louisa he said without looking up and turning over the leaves  wickam of course wickam would be quite sufficient i should say returned his sister paul being in such hands as mrs pipchins you could hardly send anybody who would be a further check upon her you would go down yourself once a week at least of course  of course said mr dombey and sat looking at one page for an hour afterwards without reading one word  this celebrated mrs pipchin was a marvellous illfavoured illconditioned old lady of a stooping figure with a mottled face like bad marble a hook nose and a hard grey eye that looked as if it might have been hammered at on an anvil without sustaining any injury forty years at least had elapsed since the peruvian mines had been the death of mr pipchin but his relict still wore black bombazeen of such a lustreless deep dead sombre shade that gas itself couldnt light her up after dark and her presence was a quencher to any number of candles she was generally spoken of as a great manager of children and the secret of her management was to give them everything that they didnt like and nothing that they didwhich was found to sweeten their dispositions very much she was such a bitter old lady that one was tempted to believe there had been some mistake in the application of the peruvian machinery and that all her waters of gladness and milk of human kindness had been pumped out dry instead of the mines  the castle of this ogress and childqueller was in a steep bystreet at brighton where the soil was more than usually chalky flinty and sterile and the houses were more than usually brittle and thin where the small frontgardens had the unaccountable property of producing nothing but marigolds whatever was sown in them and where snails were constantly discovered holding on to the street doors and other public places they were not expected to ornament with the tenacity of cuppingglasses in the winter time the air couldnt be got out of the castle and in the summer time it couldnt be got in there was such a continual reverberation of wind in it that it sounded like a great shell which the inhabitants were obliged to hold to their ears night and day whether they liked it or no it was not naturally a freshsmelling house and in the window of the front parlour which was never opened mrs pipchin kept a collection of plants in pots which imparted an earthy flavour of their own to the establishment however choice examples of their kind too these plants were of a kind peculiarly adapted to the embowerment of mrs pipchin there were halfadozen specimens of the cactus writhing round bits of lath like hairy serpents another specimen shooting out broad claws like a green lobster several creeping vegetables possessed of sticky and adhesive leaves and one uncomfortable flowerpot hanging to the ceiling which appeared to have boiled over and tickling people underneath with its long green ends reminded them of spidersin which mrs pipchins dwelling was uncommonly prolific though perhaps it challenged competition still more proudly in the season in point of earwigs  mrs pipchins scale of charges being high however to all who could afford to pay and mrs pipchin very seldom sweetening the equable acidity of her nature in favour of anybody she was held to be an old lady of remarkable firmness who was quite scientific in her knowledge of the childish character on this reputation and on the broken heart of mr pipchin she had contrived taking one year with another to eke out a tolerable sufficient living since her husbands demise within three days after mrs chicks first allusion to her this excellent old lady had the satisfaction of anticipating a handsome addition to her current receipts from the pocket of mr dombey and of receiving florence and her little brother paul as inmates of the castle  mrs chick and miss tox who had brought them down on the previous night which they all passed at an hotel had just driven away from the door on their journey home again and mrs pipchin with her back to the fire stood reviewing the newcomers like an old soldier mrs pipchins middleaged niece her goodnatured and devoted slave but possessing a gaunt and ironbound aspect and much afflicted with boils on her nose was divesting master bitherstone of the clean collar he had worn on parade miss pankey the only other little boarder at present had that moment been walked off to the castle dungeon an empty apartment at the back devoted to correctional purposes for having sniffed thrice in the presence of visitors  well sir said mrs pipchin to paul how do you think you shall like me  i dont think i shall like you at all replied paul i want to go away this isnt my house  no its mine retorted mrs pipchin  its a very nasty one said paul  theres a worse place in it than this though said mrs pipchin where we shut up our bad boys  has he ever been in it asked paul pointing out master bitherstone  mrs pipchin nodded assent and paul had enough to do for the rest of that day in surveying master bitherstone from head to foot and watching all the workings of his countenance with the interest attaching to a boy of mysterious and terrible experiences  at one oclock there was a dinner chiefly of the farinaceous and vegetable kind when miss pankey a mild little blueeyed morsel of a child who was shampood every morning and seemed in danger of being rubbed away altogether was led in from captivity by the ogress herself and instructed that nobody who sniffed before visitors ever went to heaven when this great truth had been thoroughly impressed upon her she was regaled with rice and subsequently repeated the form of grace established in the castle in which there was a special clause thanking mrs pipchin for a good dinner mrs pipchins niece berinthia took cold pork mrs pipchin whose constitution required warm nourishment made a special repast of muttonchops which were brought in hot and hot between two plates and smelt very nice  as it rained after dinner and they couldnt go out walking on the beach and mrs pipchins constitution required rest after chops they went away with berry otherwise berinthia to the dungeon an empty room looking out upon a chalk wall and a waterbutt and made ghastly by a ragged fireplace without any stove in it enlivened by company however this was the best place after all for berry played with them there and seemed to enjoy a game at romps as much as they did until mrs pipchin knocking angrily at the wall like the cock lane ghost revived they left off and berry told them stories in a whisper until twilight  for tea there was plenty of milk and water and bread and butter with a little black teapot for mrs pipchin and berry and buttered toast unlimited for mrs pipchin which was brought in hot and hot like the chops though mrs pipchin got very greasy outside over this dish it didnt seem to lubricate her internally at all for she was as fierce as ever and the hard grey eye knew no softening  after tea berry brought out a little workbox with the royal pavilion on the lid and fell to working busily while mrs pipchin having put on her spectacles and opened a great volume bound in green baize began to nod and whenever mrs pipchin caught herself falling forward into the fire and woke up she filliped master bitherstone on the nose for nodding too  at last it was the childrens bedtime and after prayers they went to bed as little miss pankey was afraid of sleeping alone in the dark mrs pipchin always made a point of driving her upstairs herself like a sheep and it was cheerful to hear miss pankey moaning long afterwards in the least eligible chamber and mrs pipchin now and then going in to shake her at about halfpast nine oclock the odour of a warm sweetbread mrs pipchins constitution wouldnt go to sleep without sweetbread diversified the prevailing fragrance of the house which mrs wickam said was a smell of building and slumber fell upon the castle shortly after  the breakfast next morning was like the tea over night except that mrs pipchin took her roll instead of toast and seemed a little more irate when it was over master bitherstone read aloud to the rest a pedigree from genesis judiciously selected by mrs pipchin getting over the names with the ease and clearness of a person tumbling up the treadmill that done miss pankey was borne away to be shampood and master bitherstone to have something else done to him with salt water from which he always returned very blue and dejected paul and florence went out in the meantime on the beach with wickamwho was constantly in tearsand at about noon mrs pipchin presided over some early readings it being a part of mrs pipchins system not to encourage a childs mind to develop and expand itself like a young flower but to open it by force like an oyster the moral of these lessons was usually of a violent and stunning character the heroa naughty boyseldom in the mildest catastrophe being finished off anything less than a lion or a bear  such was life at mrs pipchins on saturday mr dombey came down and florence and paul would go to his hotel and have tea they passed the whole of sunday with him and generally rode out before dinner and on these occasions mr dombey seemed to grow like falstaffs assailants and instead of being one man in buckram to become a dozen sunday evening was the most melancholy evening in the week for mrs pipchin always made a point of being particularly cross on sunday nights miss pankey was generally brought back from an aunts at rottingdean in deep distress and master bitherstone whose relatives were all in india and who was required to sit between the services in an erect position with his head against the parlour wall neither moving hand nor foot suffered so acutely in his young spirits that he once asked florence on a sunday night if she could give him any idea of the way back to bengal  but it was generally said that mrs pipchin was a woman of system with children and no doubt she was certainly the wild ones went home tame enough after sojourning for a few months beneath her hospitable roof it was generally said too that it was highly creditable of mrs pipchin to have devoted herself to this way of life and to have made such a sacrifice of her feelings and such a resolute stand against her troubles when mr pipchin broke his heart in the peruvian mines  at this exemplary old lady paul would sit staring in his little armchair by the fire for any length of time he never seemed to know what weariness was when he was looking fixedly at mrs pipchin he was not fond of her he was not afraid of her but in those old old moods of his she seemed to have a grotesque attraction for him there he would sit looking at her and warming his hands and looking at her until he sometimes quite confounded mrs pipchin ogress as she was once she asked him when they were alone what he was thinking about  you said paul without the least reserve  and what are you thinking about me asked mrs pipchin  im thinking how old you must be said paul  you mustnt say such things as that young gentleman returned the dame thatll never do  why not asked paul  because its not polite said mrs pipchin snappishly  not polite said paul  no  its not polite said paul innocently to eat all the mutton chops and toast wickam says  wickam retorted mrs pipchin colouring is a wicked impudent boldfaced hussy  whats that inquired paul  never you mind sir retorted mrs pipchin remember the story of the little boy that was gored to death by a mad bull for asking questions  if the bull was mad said paul how did he know that the boy had asked questions nobody can go and whisper secrets to a mad bull i dont believe that story  you dont believe it sir repeated mrs pipchin amazed  no said paul  not if it should happen to have been a tame bull you little infidel said mrs pipchin  as paul had not considered the subject in that light and had founded his conclusions on the alleged lunacy of the bull he allowed himself to be put down for the present but he sat turning it over in his mind with such an obvious intention of fixing mrs pipchin presently that even that hardy old lady deemed it prudent to retreat until he should have forgotten the subject  from that time mrs pipchin appeared to have something of the same odd kind of attraction towards paul as paul had towards her she would make him move his chair to her side of the fire instead of sitting opposite and there he would remain in a nook between mrs pipchin and the fender with all the light of his little face absorbed into the black bombazeen drapery studying every line and wrinkle of her countenance and peering at the hard grey eye until mrs pipchin was sometimes fain to shut it on pretence of dozing mrs pipchin had an old black cat who generally lay coiled upon the centre foot of the fender purring egotistically and winking at the fire until the contracted pupils of his eyes were like two notes of admiration the good old lady might have beennot to record it disrespectfullya witch and paul and the cat her two familiars as they all sat by the fire together it would have been quite in keeping with the appearance of the party if they had all sprung up the chimney in a high wind one night and never been heard of any more  this however never came to pass the cat and paul and mrs pipchin were constantly to be found in their usual places after dark and paul eschewing the companionship of master bitherstone went on studying mrs pipchin and the cat and the fire night after night as if they were a book of necromancy in three volumes  mrs wickam put her own construction on pauls eccentricities and being confirmed in her low spirits by a perplexed view of chimneys from the room where she was accustomed to sit and by the noise of the wind and by the general dulness gashliness was mrs wickams strong expression of her present life deduced the most dismal reflections from the foregoing premises it was a part of mrs pipchins policy to prevent her own young hussythat was mrs pipchins generic name for female servantfrom communicating with mrs wickam to which end she devoted much of her time to concealing herself behind doors and springing out on that devoted maiden whenever she made an approach towards mrs wickams apartment but berry was free to hold what converse she could in that quarter consistently with the discharge of the multifarious duties at which she toiled incessantly from morning to night and to berry mrs wickam unburdened her mind  what a pretty fellow he is when hes asleep said berry stopping to look at paul in bed one night when she took up mrs wickams supper  ah sighed mrs wickam he need be  why hes not ugly when hes awake observed berry  no maam oh no no more was my uncles betsey jane said mrs wickam  berry looked as if she would like to trace the connexion of ideas between paul dombey and mrs wickams uncles betsey jane  my uncles wife mrs wickam went on to say died just like his mama my uncles child took on just as master paul do  took on you dont think he grieves for his mama sure argued berry sitting down on the side of the bed he cant remember anything about her you know mrs wickam its not possible  no maam said mrs wickam no more did my uncles child but my uncles child said very strange things sometimes and looked very strange and went on very strange and was very strange altogether my uncles child made peoples blood run cold some times she did  how asked berry  i wouldnt have sat up all night alone with betsey jane said mrs wickam not if youd have put wickam into business next morning for himself i couldnt have done it miss berry  miss berry naturally asked why not but mrs wickam agreeably to the usage of some ladies in her condition pursued her own branch of the subject without any compunction  betsey jane said mrs wickam was as sweet a child as i could wish to see i couldnt wish to see a sweeter everything that a child could have in the way of illnesses betsey jane had come through the cramps was as common to her said mrs wickam as biles is to yourself miss berry miss berry involuntarily wrinkled her nose  but betsey jane said mrs wickam lowering her voice and looking round the room and towards paul in bed had been minded in her cradle by her departed mother i couldnt say how nor i couldnt say when nor i couldnt say whether the dear child knew it or not but betsey jane had been watched by her mother miss berry and mrs wickam with a very white face and with watery eyes and with a tremulous voice again looked fearfully round the room and towards paul in bed  nonsense cried miss berrysomewhat resentful of the idea  you may say nonsense i aint offended miss i hope you may be able to think in your own conscience that it is nonsense youll find your spirits all the better for it in thisyoull excuse my being so freein this buryingground of a place which is wearing of me down master pauls a little restless in his sleep pat his back if you please  of course you think said berry gently doing what she was asked that he has been nursed by his mother too  betsey jane returned mrs wickam in her most solemn tones was put upon as that child has been put upon and changed as that child has changed i have seen her sit often and often think think thinking like him i have seen her look often and often old old old like him i have heard her many a time talk just like him i consider that child and betsey jane on the same footing entirely miss berry  is your uncles child alive asked berry  yes miss she is alive returned mrs wickam with an air of triumph for it was evident miss berry expected the reverse and is married to a silverchaser oh yes miss she is alive said mrs wickam laying strong stress on her nominative case  it being clear that somebody was dead mrs pipchins niece inquired who it was  i wouldnt wish to make you uneasy returned mrs wickam pursuing her supper dont ask me  this was the surest way of being asked again miss berry repeated her question therefore and after some resistance and reluctance mrs wickam laid down her knife and again glancing round the room and at paul in bed replied  she took fancies to people whimsical fancies some of them others affections that one might expect to seeonly stronger than common they all died  this was so very unexpected and awful to mrs pipchins niece that she sat upright on the hard edge of the bedstead breathing short and surveying her informant with looks of undisguised alarm  mrs wickam shook her left forefinger stealthily towards the bed where florence lay then turned it upside down and made several emphatic points at the floor immediately below which was the parlour in which mrs pipchin habitually consumed the toast  remember my words miss berry said mrs wickam and be thankful that master paul is not too fond of you i am that hes not too fond of me i assure you though there isnt much to live foryoull excuse my being so freein this jail of a house  miss berrys emotion might have led to her patting paul too hard on the back or might have produced a cessation of that soothing monotony but he turned in his bed just now and presently awaking sat up in it with his hair hot and wet from the effects of some childish dream and asked for florence  she was out of her own bed at the first sound of his voice and bending over his pillow immediately sang him to sleep again mrs wickam shaking her head and letting fall several tears pointed out the little group to berry and turned her eyes up to the ceiling  hes asleep now my dear said mrs wickam after a pause youd better go to bed again dont you feel cold  no nurse said florence laughing not at all  ah sighed mrs wickam and she shook her head again expressing to the watchful berry we shall be cold enough some of us by and by  berry took the frugal suppertray with which mrs wickam had by this time done and bade her goodnight  goodnight miss returned wickam softly goodnight your aunt is an old lady miss berry and its what you must have looked for often  this consolatory farewell mrs wickam accompanied with a look of heartfelt anguish and being left alone with the two children again and becoming conscious that the wind was blowing mournfully she indulged in melancholythat cheapest and most accessible of luxuriesuntil she was overpowered by slumber  although the niece of mrs pipchin did not expect to find that exemplary dragon prostrate on the hearthrug when she went downstairs she was relieved to find her unusually fractious and severe and with every present appearance of intending to live a long time to be a comfort to all who knew her nor had she any symptoms of declining in the course of the ensuing week when the constitutional viands still continued to disappear in regular succession notwithstanding that paul studied her as attentively as ever and occupied his usual seat between the black skirts and the fender with unwavering constancy  but as paul himself was no stronger at the expiration of that time than he had been on his first arrival though he looked much healthier in the face a little carriage was got for him in which he could lie at his ease with an alphabet and other elementary works of reference and be wheeled down to the seaside consistent in his odd tastes the child set aside a ruddyfaced lad who was proposed as the drawer of this carriage and selected instead his grandfathera weazen old crabfaced man in a suit of battered oilskin who had got tough and stringy from long pickling in salt water and who smelt like a weedy seabeach when the tide is out  with this notable attendant to pull him along and florence always walking by his side and the despondent wickam bringing up the rear he went down to the margin of the ocean every day and there he would sit or lie in his carriage for hours together never so distressed as by the company of childrenflorence alone excepted always  go away if you please he would say to any child who came to bear him company thank you but i dont want you  some small voice near his ear would ask him how he was perhaps  i am very well i thank you he would answer but you had better go and play if you please  then he would turn his head and watch the child away and say to florence we dont want any others do we kiss me floy  he had even a dislike at such times to the company of wickam and was well pleased when she strolled away as she generally did to pick up shells and acquaintances his favourite spot was quite a lonely one far away from most loungers and with florence sitting by his side at work or reading to him or talking to him and the wind blowing on his face and the water coming up among the wheels of his bed he wanted nothing more  floy he said one day wheres india where that boys friends live  oh its a long long distance off said florence raising her eyes from her work  weeks off asked paul  yes dear many weeks journey night and day  if you were in india floy said paul after being silent for a minute i shouldwhat is it that mama did i forget  loved me answered florence  no no dont i love you now floy what is itdied in you were in india i should die floy  she hurriedly put her work aside and laid her head down on his pillow caressing him and so would she she said if he were there he would be better soon  oh i am a great deal better now he answered i dont mean that i mean that i should die of being so sorry and so lonely floy  another time in the same place he fell asleep and slept quietly for a long time awaking suddenly he listened started up and sat listening  florence asked him what he thought he heard  i want to know what it says he answered looking steadily in her face the sea floy what is it that it keeps on saying  she told him that it was only the noise of the rolling waves  yes yes he said but i know that they are always saying something always the same thing what place is over there he rose up looking eagerly at the horizon  she told him that there was another country opposite but he said he didnt mean that he meant further awayfarther away  very often afterwards in the midst of their talk he would break off to try to understand what it was that the waves were always saying and would rise up in his couch to look towards that invisible region far away    chapter 9 in which the wooden midshipman gets into trouble   that spice of romance and love of the marvellous of which there was a pretty strong infusion in the nature of young walter gay and which the guardianship of his uncle old solomon gills had not very much weakened by the waters of stern practical experience was the occasion of his attaching an uncommon and delightful interest to the adventure of florence with good mrs brown he pampered and cherished it in his memory especially that part of it with which he had been associated until it became the spoiled child of his fancy and took its own way and did what it liked with it  the recollection of those incidents and his own share in them may have been made the more captivating perhaps by the weekly dreamings of old sol and captain cuttle on sundays hardly a sunday passed without mysterious references being made by one or other of those worthy chums to richard whittington and the latter gentleman had even gone so far as to purchase a ballad of considerable antiquity that had long fluttered among many others chiefly expressive of maritime sentiments on a dead wall in the commercial road which poetical performance set forth the courtship and nuptials of a promising young coalwhipper with a certain lovely peg the accomplished daughter of the master and partowner of a newcastle collier in this stirring legend captain cuttle descried a profound metaphysical bearing on the case of walter and florence and it excited him so much that on very festive occasions as birthdays and a few other nondominical holidays he would roar through the whole song in the little back parlour making an amazing shake on the word peeeg with which every verse concluded in compliment to the heroine of the piece  but a frank freespirited openhearted boy is not much given to analysing the nature of his own feelings however strong their hold upon him and walter would have found it difficult to decide this point he had a great affection for the wharf where he had encountered florence and for the streets albeit not enchanting in themselves by which they had come home the shoes that had so often tumbled off by the way he preserved in his own room and sitting in the little back parlour of an evening he had drawn a whole gallery of fancy portraits of good mrs brown it may be that he became a little smarter in his dress after that memorable occasion and he certainly liked in his leisure time to walk towards that quarter of the town where mr dombeys house was situated on the vague chance of passing little florence in the street but the sentiment of all this was as boyish and innocent as could be florence was very pretty and it is pleasant to admire a pretty face florence was defenceless and weak and it was a proud thought that he had been able to render her any protection and assistance florence was the most grateful little creature in the world and it was delightful to see her bright gratitude beaming in her face florence was neglected and coldly looked upon and his breast was full of youthful interest for the slighted child in her dull stately home  thus it came about that perhaps some halfadozen times in the course of the year walter pulled off his hat to florence in the street and florence would stop to shake hands mrs wickam who with a characteristic alteration of his name invariably spoke of him as young graves was so well used to this knowing the story of their acquaintance that she took no heed of it at all miss nipper on the other hand rather looked out for these occasions her sensitive young heart being secretly propitiated by walters good looks and inclining to the belief that its sentiments were responded to  in this way walter so far from forgetting or losing sight of his acquaintance with florence only remembered it better and better as to its adventurous beginning and all those little circumstances which gave it a distinctive character and relish he took them into account more as a pleasant story very agreeable to his imagination and not to be dismissed from it than as a part of any matter of fact with which he was concerned they set off florence very much to his fancy but not himself sometimes he thought and then he walked very fast what a grand thing it would have been for him to have been going to sea on the day after that first meeting and to have gone and to have done wonders there and to have stopped away a long time and to have come back an admiral of all the colours of the dolphin or at least a postcaptain with epaulettes of insupportable brightness and have married florence then a beautiful young woman in spite of mr dombeys teeth cravat and watchchain and borne her away to the blue shores of somewhere or other triumphantly but these flights of fancy seldom burnished the brass plate of dombey and sons offices into a tablet of golden hope or shed a brilliant lustre on their dirty skylights and when the captain and uncle sol talked about richard whittington and masters daughters walter felt that he understood his true position at dombey and sons much better than they did  so it was that he went on doing what he had to do from day to day in a cheerful painstaking merry spirit and saw through the sanguine complexion of uncle sol and captain cuttle and yet entertained a thousand indistinct and visionary fancies of his own to which theirs were workaday probabilities such was his condition at the pipchin period when he looked a little older than of yore but not much and was the same lightfooted lighthearted lightheaded lad as when he charged into the parlour at the head of uncle sol and the imaginary boarders and lighted him to bring up the madeira  uncle sol said walter i dont think youre well you havent eaten any breakfast i shall bring a doctor to you if you go on like this  he cant give me what i want my boy said uncle sol at least he is in good practice if he canand then he wouldnt  what is it uncle customers  ay returned solomon with a sigh customers would do  confound it uncle said walter putting down his breakfast cup with a clatter and striking his hand on the table when i see the people going up and down the street in shoals all day and passing and repassing the shop every minute by scores i feel half tempted to rush out collar somebody bring him in and make him buy fifty pounds worth of instruments for ready money what are you looking in at the door for continued walter apostrophizing an old gentleman with a powdered head inaudibly to him of course who was staring at a ships telescope with all his might and main thats no use i could do that come in and buy it  the old gentleman however having satiated his curiosity walked calmly away  there he goes said walter thats the way with em all but unclei say uncle solfor the old man was meditating and had not responded to his first appeal dont be cast down dont be out of spirits uncle when orders do come theyll come in such a crowd you wont be able to execute em  i shall be past executing em whenever they come my boy returned solomon gills theyll never come to this shop again till i am out of t  i say uncle you musnt really you know urged walter dont  old sol endeavoured to assume a cheery look and smiled across the little table at him as pleasantly as he could  theres nothing more than usual the matter is there uncle said walter leaning his elbows on the tea tray and bending over to speak the more confidentially and kindly be open with me uncle if there is and tell me all about it  no no no returned old sol more than usual no no what should there be the matter more than usual  walter answered with an incredulous shake of his head thats what i want to know he said and you ask me ill tell you what uncle when i see you like this i am quite sorry that i live with you  old sol opened his eyes involuntarily  yes though nobody ever was happier than i am and always have been with you i am quite sorry that i live with you when i see you with anything in your mind  i am a little dull at such times i know observed solomon meekly rubbing his hands  what i mean uncle sol pursued walter bending over a little more to pat him on the shoulder is that then i feel you ought to have sitting here and pouring out the tea instead of me a nice little dumpling of a wife you knowa comfortable capital cosy old lady who was just a match for you and knew how to manage you and keep you in good heart here am i as loving a nephew as ever was i am sure i ought to be but i am only a nephew and i cant be such a companion to you when youre low and out of sorts as she would have made herself years ago though im sure id give any money if i could cheer you up and so i say when i see you with anything on your mind that i feel quite sorry you havent got somebody better about you than a blundering young roughandtough boy like me who has got the will to console you uncle but hasnt got the wayhasnt got the way repeated walter reaching over further yet to shake his uncle by the hand  wally my dear boy said solomon if the cosy little old lady had taken her place in this parlour five and forty years ago i never could have been fonder of her than i am of you  i know that uncle sol returned walter lord bless you i know that but you wouldnt have had the whole weight of any uncomfortable secrets if she had been with you because she would have known how to relieve you of em and i dont  yes yes you do returned the instrumentmaker  well then whats the matter uncle sol said walter coaxingly come whats the matter  solomon gills persisted that there was nothing the matter and maintained it so resolutely that his nephew had no resource but to make a very indifferent imitation of believing him  all i can say is uncle sol that if there is  but there isnt said solomon  very well said walter then ive no more to say and thats lucky for my times up for going to business i shall look in byandby when im out to see how you get on uncle and mind uncle ill never believe you again and never tell you anything more about mr carker the junior if i find out that you have been deceiving me  solomon gills laughingly defied him to find out anything of the kind and walter revolving in his thoughts all sorts of impracticable ways of making fortunes and placing the wooden midshipman in a position of independence betook himself to the offices of dombey and son with a heavier countenance than he usually carried there  there lived in those days round the cornerin bishopsgate street withoutone brogley sworn broker and appraiser who kept a shop where every description of secondhand furniture was exhibited in the most uncomfortable aspect and under circumstances and in combinations the most completely foreign to its purpose dozens of chairs hooked on to washingstands which with difficulty poised themselves on the shoulders of sideboards which in their turn stood upon the wrong side of diningtables gymnastic with their legs upward on the tops of other diningtables were among its most reasonable arrangements a banquet array of dishcovers wineglasses and decanters was generally to be seen spread forth upon the bosom of a fourpost bedstead for the entertainment of such genial company as halfadozen pokers and a hall lamp a set of window curtains with no windows belonging to them would be seen gracefully draping a barricade of chests of drawers loaded with little jars from chemists shops while a homeless hearthrug severed from its natural companion the fireside braved the shrewd east wind in its adversity and trembled in melancholy accord with the shrill complainings of a cabinet piano wasting away a string a day and faintly resounding to the noises of the street in its jangling and distracted brain of motionless clocks that never stirred a finger and seemed as incapable of being successfully wound up as the pecuniary affairs of their former owners there was always great choice in mr brogleys shop and various lookingglasses accidentally placed at compound interest of reflection and refraction presented to the eye an eternal perspective of bankruptcy and ruin  mr brogley himself was a moisteyed pinkcomplexioned crisphaired man of a bulky figure and an easy temperfor that class of caius marius who sits upon the ruins of other peoples carthages can keep up his spirits well enough he had looked in at solomons shop sometimes to ask a question about articles in solomons way of business and walter knew him sufficiently to give him good day when they met in the street but as that was the extent of the brokers acquaintance with solomon gills also walter was not a little surprised when he came back in the course of the forenoon agreeably to his promise to find mr brogley sitting in the back parlour with his hands in his pockets and his hat hanging up behind the door  well uncle sol said walter the old man was sitting ruefully on the opposite side of the table with his spectacles over his eyes for a wonder instead of on his forehead how are you now  solomon shook his head and waved one hand towards the broker as introducing him  is there anything the matter asked walter with a catching in his breath  no no theres nothing the matter said mr brogley dont let it put you out of the way walter looked from the broker to his uncle in mute amazement the fact is said mr brogley theres a little payment on a bond debtthree hundred and seventy odd overdue and im in possession  in possession cried walter looking round at the shop  ah said mr brogley in confidential assent and nodding his head as if he would urge the advisability of their all being comfortable together its an execution thats what it is dont let it put you out of the way i come myself because of keeping it quiet and sociable you know me its quite private  uncle sol faltered walter  wally my boy returned his uncle its the first time such a calamity never happened to me before im an old man to begin pushing up his spectacles again for they were useless any longer to conceal his emotion he covered his face with his hand and sobbed aloud and his tears fell down upon his coffeecoloured waistcoat  uncle sol pray oh dont exclaimed walter who really felt a thrill of terror in seeing the old man weep for gods sake dont do that mr brogley what shall i do  i should recommend you looking up a friend or so said mr brogley and talking it over  to be sure cried walter catching at anything certainly thankee captain cuttles the man uncle wait till i run to captain cuttle keep your eye upon my uncle will you mr brogley and make him as comfortable as you can while i am gone dont despair uncle sol try and keep a good heart theres a dear fellow  saying this with great fervour and disregarding the old mans broken remonstrances walter dashed out of the shop again as hard as he could go and having hurried round to the office to excuse himself on the plea of his uncles sudden illness set off full speed for captain cuttles residence  everything seemed altered as he ran along the streets there were the usual entanglement and noise of carts drays omnibuses waggons and foot passengers but the misfortune that had fallen on the wooden midshipman made it strange and new houses and shops were different from what they used to be and bore mr brogleys warrant on their fronts in large characters the broker seemed to have got hold of the very churches for their spires rose into the sky with an unwonted air even the sky itself was changed and had an execution in it plainly  captain cuttle lived on the brink of a little canal near the india docks where there was a swivel bridge which opened now and then to let some wandering monster of a ship come roaming up the street like a stranded leviathan the gradual change from land to water on the approach to captain cuttles lodgings was curious it began with the erection of flagstaffs as appurtenances to publichouses then came slopsellers shops with guernsey shirts souwester hats and canvas pantaloons at once the tightest and the loosest of their order hanging up outside these were succeeded by anchor and chaincable forges where sledgehammers were dinging upon iron all day long then came rows of houses with little vanesurmounted masts uprearing themselves from among the scarlet beans then ditches then pollard willows then more ditches then unaccountable patches of dirty water hardly to be descried for the ships that covered them then the air was perfumed with chips and all other trades were swallowed up in mast oar and blockmaking and boatbuilding then the ground grew marshy and unsettled then there was nothing to be smelt but rum and sugar then captain cuttles lodgingsat once a first floor and a top storey in brig placewere close before you  the captain was one of those timberlooking men suits of oak as well as hearts whom it is almost impossible for the liveliest imagination to separate from any part of their dress however insignificant accordingly when walter knocked at the door and the captain instantly poked his head out of one of his little front windows and hailed him with the hard glared hat already on it and the shirtcollar like a sail and the wide suit of blue all standing as usual walter was as fully persuaded that he was always in that state as if the captain had been a bird and those had been his feathers  walr my ladsaid captain cuttle stand by and knock again hard its washing day  walter in his impatience gave a prodigious thump with the knocker  hard it is said captain cuttle and immediately drew in his head as if he expected a squall  nor was he mistaken for a widow lady with her sleeves rolled up to her shoulders and her arms frothy with soapsuds and smoking with hot water replied to the summons with startling rapidity before she looked at walter she looked at the knocker and then measuring him with her eyes from head to foot said she wondered he had left any of it  captain cuttles at home i know said walter with a conciliatory smile  is he replied the widow lady indeed  he has just been speaking to me said walter in breathless explanation  has he replied the widow lady then praps youll give him mrs macstingers respects and say that the next time he lowers himself and his lodgings by talking out of the winder shell thank him to come down and open the door too mrs macstinger spoke loud and listened for any observations that might be offered from the first floor  ill mention it said walter if youll have the goodness to let me in maam  for he was repelled by a wooden fortification extending across the doorway and put there to prevent the little macstingers in their moments of recreation from tumbling down the steps  a boy that can knock my door down said mrs macstinger contemptuously can get over that i should hope but walter taking this as a permission to enter and getting over it mrs macstinger immediately demanded whether an englishwomans house was her castle or not and whether she was to be broke in upon by raff on these subjects her thirst for information was still very importunate when walter having made his way up the little staircase through an artificial fog occasioned by the washing which covered the banisters with a clammy perspiration entered captain cuttles room and found that gentleman in ambush behind the door  never owed her a penny walr said captain cuttle in a low voice and with visible marks of trepidation on his countenance done her a world of good turns and the children too vixen at times though whew  i should go away captain cuttle said walter  dursnt do it walr returned the captain shed find me out wherever i went sit down hows gills  the captain was dining in his hat off cold loin of mutton porter and some smoking hot potatoes which he had cooked himself and took out of a little saucepan before the fire as he wanted them he unscrewed his hook at dinnertime and screwed a knife into its wooden socket instead with which he had already begun to peel one of these potatoes for walter his rooms were very small and strongly impregnated with tobaccosmoke but snug enough everything being stowed away as if there were an earthquake regularly every halfhour  hows gills inquired the captain  walter who had by this time recovered his breath and lost his spiritsor such temporary spirits as his rapid journey had given himlooked at his questioner for a moment said oh captain cuttle and burst into tears  no words can describe the captains consternation at this sight mrs macstinger faded into nothing before it he dropped the potato and the forkand would have dropped the knife too if he couldand sat gazing at the boy as if he expected to hear next moment that a gulf had opened in the city which had swallowed up his old friend coffeecoloured suit buttons chronometer spectacles and all  but when walter told him what was really the matter captain cuttle after a moments reflection started up into full activity he emptied out of a little tin canister on the top shelf of the cupboard his whole stock of ready money amounting to thirteen pounds and halfacrown which he transferred to one of the pockets of his square blue coat further enriched that repository with the contents of his plate chest consisting of two withered atomies of teaspoons and an obsolete pair of knockkneed sugartongs pulled up his immense doublecased silver watch from the depths in which it reposed to assure himself that that valuable was sound and whole reattached the hook to his right wrist and seizing the stick covered over with knobs bade walter come along  remembering however in the midst of his virtuous excitement that mrs macstinger might be lying in wait below captain cuttle hesitated at last not without glancing at the window as if he had some thoughts of escaping by that unusual means of egress rather than encounter his terrible enemy he decided however in favour of stratagem  walr said the captain with a timid wink go afore my lad sing out goodbye captain cuttle when youre in the passage and shut the door then wait at the corner of the street till you see me  these directions were not issued without a previous knowledge of the enemys tactics for when walter got downstairs mrs macstinger glided out of the little back kitchen like an avenging spirit but not gliding out upon the captain as she had expected she merely made a further allusion to the knocker and glided in again  some five minutes elapsed before captain cuttle could summon courage to attempt his escape for walter waited so long at the street corner looking back at the house before there were any symptoms of the hard glazed hat at length the captain burst out of the door with the suddenness of an explosion and coming towards him at a great pace and never once looking over his shoulder pretended as soon as they were well out of the street to whistle a tune  uncle much hove down walr inquired the captain as they were walking along  i am afraid so if you had seen him this morning you would never have forgotten it  walk fast walr my lad returned the captain mending his pace and walk the same all the days of your life overhaul the catechism for that advice and keep it  the captain was too busy with his own thoughts of solomon gills mingled perhaps with some reflections on his late escape from mrs macstinger to offer any further quotations on the way for walters moral improvement they interchanged no other word until they arrived at old sols door where the unfortunate wooden midshipman with his instrument at his eye seemed to be surveying the whole horizon in search of some friend to help him out of his difficulty  gills said the captain hurrying into the back parlour and taking him by the hand quite tenderly lay your head well to the wind and well fight through it all youve got to do said the captain with the solemnity of a man who was delivering himself of one of the most precious practical tenets ever discovered by human wisdom is to lay your head well to the wind and well fight through it  old sol returned the pressure of his hand and thanked him  captain cuttle then with a gravity suitable to the nature of the occasion put down upon the table the two teaspoons and the sugartongs the silver watch and the ready money and asked mr brogley the broker what the damage was  come what do you make of it said captain cuttle  why lord help you returned the broker you dont suppose that propertys of any use do you  why not inquired the captain  why the amounts three hundred and seventy odd replied the broker  never mind returned the captain though he was evidently dismayed by the figures alls fish that comes to your net i suppose  certainly said mr brogley but sprats aint whales you know  the philosophy of this observation seemed to strike the captain he ruminated for a minute eyeing the broker meanwhile as a deep genius and then called the instrumentmaker aside  gills said captain cuttle whats the bearings of this business whos the creditor  hush returned the old man come away dont speak before wally its a matter of security for wallys fatheran old bond ive paid a good deal of it ned but the times are so bad with me that i cant do more just now ive foreseen it but i couldnt help it not a word before wally for all the world  youve got some money havent you whispered the captain  yes yesoh yesive got some returned old sol first putting his hands into his empty pockets and then squeezing his welsh wig between them as if he thought he might wring some gold out of it but ithe little i have got isnt convertible ned it cant be got at i have been trying to do something with it for wally and im old fashioned and behind the time its here and there andand in short its as good as nowhere said the old man looking in bewilderment about him  he had so much the air of a halfwitted person who had been hiding his money in a variety of places and had forgotten where that the captain followed his eyes not without a faint hope that he might remember some few hundred pounds concealed up the chimney or down in the cellar but solomon gills knew better than that  im behind the time altogether my dear ned said sol in resigned despair a long way its no use my lagging on so far behind it the stock had better be soldits worth more than this debtand i had better go and die somewhere on the balance i havent any energy left i dont understand things this had better be the end of it let em sell the stock and take him down said the old man pointing feebly to the wooden midshipman and let us both be broken up together  and what dye mean to do with walrsaid the captain there there sit ye down gills sit ye down and let me think o this if i warnt a man on a small annuity that was large enough till today i hadnt need to think of it but you only lay your head well to the wind said the captain again administering that unanswerable piece of consolation and youre all right  old sol thanked him from his heart and went and laid it against the back parlour fireplace instead  captain cuttle walked up and down the shop for some time cogitating profoundly and bringing his bushy black eyebrows to bear so heavily on his nose like clouds setting on a mountain that walter was afraid to offer any interruption to the current of his reflections mr brogley who was averse to being any constraint upon the party and who had an ingenious cast of mind went softly whistling among the stock rattling weatherglasses shaking compasses as if they were physic catching up keys with loadstones looking through telescopes endeavouring to make himself acquainted with the use of the globes setting parallel rulers astride on to his nose and amusing himself with other philosophical transactions  walr said the captain at last ive got it  have you captain cuttle cried walter with great animation  come this way my lad said the captain the stocks the security im another your governors the man to advance money  mr dombey faltered walter  the captain nodded gravely look at him he said look at gills if they was to sell off these things now hed die of it you know he would we mustnt leave a stone unturnedand theres a stone for you  a stonemr dombey faltered walter  you run round to the office first of all and see if hes there said captain cuttle clapping him on the back quick  walter felt he must not dispute the commanda glance at his uncle would have determined him if he had felt otherwiseand disappeared to execute it he soon returned out of breath to say that mr dombey was not there it was saturday and he had gone to brighton  i tell you what walr said the captain who seemed to have prepared himself for this contingency in his absence well go to brighton ill back you my boy ill back you walr well go to brighton by the afternoons coach  if the application must be made to mr dombey at all which was awful to think of walter felt that he would rather prefer it alone and unassisted than backed by the personal influence of captain cuttle to which he hardly thought mr dombey would attach much weight but as the captain appeared to be of quite another opinion and was bent upon it and as his friendship was too zealous and serious to be trifled with by one so much younger than himself he forbore to hint the least objection cuttle therefore taking a hurried leave of solomon gills and returning the ready money the teaspoons the sugartongs and the silver watch to his pocketwith a view as walter thought with horror to making a gorgeous impression on mr dombeybore him off to the coachoffice without a minutes delay and repeatedly assured him on the road that he would stick by him to the last    chapter 10 containing the sequel of the midshipmans disaster   major bagstock after long and frequent observation of paul across princesss place through his doublebarrelled operaglass and after receiving many minute reports daily weekly and monthly on that subject from the native who kept himself in constant communication with miss toxs maid for that purpose came to the conclusion that dombey sir was a man to be known and that j b was the boy to make his acquaintance  miss tox however maintaining her reserved behaviour and frigidly declining to understand the major whenever he called which he often did on any little fishing excursion connected with this project the major in spite of his constitutional toughness and slyness was fain to leave the accomplishment of his desire in some measure to chance which as he was used to observe with chuckles at his club has been fifty to one in favour of joey b sir ever since his elder brother died of yellow jack in the west indies  it was some time coming to his aid in the present instance but it befriended him at last when the dark servant with full particulars reported miss tox absent on brighton service the major was suddenly touched with affectionate reminiscences of his friend bill bitherstone of bengal who had written to ask him if he ever went that way to bestow a call upon his only son but when the same dark servant reported paul at mrs pipchins and the major referring to the letter favoured by master bitherstone on his arrival in englandto which he had never had the least idea of paying any attentionsaw the opening that presented itself he was made so rabid by the gout with which he happened to be then laid up that he threw a footstool at the dark servant in return for his intelligence and swore he would be the death of the rascal before he had done with him which the dark servant was more than half disposed to believe  at length the major being released from his fit went one saturday growling down to brighton with the native behind him apostrophizing miss tox all the way and gloating over the prospect of carrying by storm the distinguished friend to whom she attached so much mystery and for whom she had deserted him  would you maam would you said the major straining with vindictiveness and swelling every already swollen vein in his head would you give joey b the goby maam not yet maam not yet damme not yet sir joe is awake maam bagstock is alive sir j b knows a move or two maam josh has his weathereye open sir youll find him tough maam tough sir tough is joseph tough and devilish sly  and very tough indeed master bitherstone found him when he took that young gentleman out for a walk but the major with his complexion like a stilton cheese and his eyes like a prawns went roving about perfectly indifferent to master bitherstones amusement and dragging master bitherstone along while he looked about him high and low for mr dombey and his children  in good time the major previously instructed by mrs pipchin spied out paul and florence and bore down upon them there being a stately gentleman mr dombey doubtless in their company charging with master bitherstone into the very heart of the little squadron it fell out of course that master bitherstone spoke to his fellowsufferers upon that the major stopped to notice and admire them remembered with amazement that he had seen and spoken to them at his friend miss toxs in princesss place opined that paul was a devilish fine fellow and his own little friend inquired if he remembered joey b the major and finally with a sudden recollection of the conventionalities of life turned and apologised to mr dombey  but my little friend here sir said the major makes a boy of me again an old soldier sirmajor bagstock at your serviceis not ashamed to confess it here the major lifted his hat damme sir cried the major with sudden warmth i envy you then he recollected himself and added excuse my freedom  mr dombey begged he wouldnt mention it  an old campaigner sir said the major a smokedried sunburnt usedup invalided old dog of a major sir was not afraid of being condemned for his whim by a man like mr dombey i have the honour of addressing mr dombey i believe  i am the present unworthy representative of that name major returned mr dombey  by g sir said the major its a great name its a name sir said the major firmly as if he defied mr dombey to contradict him and would feel it his painful duty to bully him if he did that is known and honoured in the british possessions abroad it is a name sir that a man is proud to recognise there is nothing adulatory in joseph bagstock sir his royal highness the duke of york observed on more than one occasion there is no adulation in joey he is a plain old soldier is joe he is tough to a fault is joseph but its a great name sir by the lord its a great name said the major solemnly  you are good enough to rate it higher than it deserves perhaps major returned mr dombey  no sir said the major in a severe tone no mr dombey let us understand each other that is not the bagstock vein sir you dont know joseph b he is a blunt old blade is josh no flattery in him sir nothing like it  mr dombey inclined his head and said he believed him to be in earnest and that his high opinion was gratifying  my little friend here sir croaked the major looking as amiably as he could on paul will certify for joseph bagstock that he is a thoroughgoing downright plainspoken old trump sir and nothing more that boy sir said the major in a lower tone will live in history that boy sir is not a common production take care of him mr dombey  mr dombey seemed to intimate that he would endeavour to do so  here is a boy here sir pursued the major confidentially and giving him a thrust with his cane son of bitherstone of bengal bill bitherstone formerly of ours that boys father and myself sir were sworn friends wherever you went sir you heard of nothing but bill bitherstone and joe bagstock am i blind to that boys defects by no means hes a fool sir  mr dombey glanced at the libelled master bitherstone of whom he knew at least as much as the major did and said in quite a complacent manner really  that is what he is sir said the major hes a fool joe bagstock never minces matters the son of my old friend bill bitherstone of bengal is a born fool sir here the major laughed till he was almost black my little friend is destined for a public school i presume mr dombey said the major when he had recovered  i am not quite decided returned mr dombey i think not he is delicate  if hes delicate sir said the major you are right none but the tough fellows could live through it sir at sandhurst we put each other to the torture there sir we roasted the new fellows at a slow fire and hung em out of a three pair of stairs window with their heads downwards joseph bagstock sir was held out of the window by the heels of his boots for thirteen minutes by the college clock  the major might have appealed to his countenance in corroboration of this story it certainly looked as if he had hung out a little too long  but it made us what we were sir said the major settling his shirt frill we were iron sir and it forged us are you remaining here mr dombey  i generally come down once a week major returned that gentleman i stay at the bedford  i shall have the honour of calling at the bedford sir if youll permit me said the major joey b sir is not in general a calling man but mr dombeys is not a common name i am much indebted to my little friend sir for the honour of this introduction  mr dombey made a very gracious reply and major bagstock having patted paul on the head and said of florence that her eyes would play the devil with the youngsters before longand the oldsters too sir if you come to that added the major chuckling very muchstirred up master bitherstone with his walkingstick and departed with that young gentleman at a kind of halftrot rolling his head and coughing with great dignity as he staggered away with his legs very wide asunder  in fulfilment of his promise the major afterwards called on mr dombey and mr dombey having referred to the army list afterwards called on the major then the major called at mr dombeys house in town and came down again in the same coach as mr dombey in short mr dombey and the major got on uncommonly well together and uncommonly fast and mr dombey observed of the major to his sister that besides being quite a military man he was really something more as he had a very admirable idea of the importance of things unconnected with his own profession  at length mr dombey bringing down miss tox and mrs chick to see the children and finding the major again at brighton invited him to dinner at the bedford and complimented miss tox highly beforehand on her neighbour and acquaintance  my dearest louisa said miss tox to mrs chick when they were alone together on the morning of the appointed day if i should seem at all reserved to major bagstock or under any constraint with him promise me not to notice it  my dear lucretia returned mrs chick what mystery is involved in this remarkable request i must insist upon knowing  since you are resolved to extort a confession from me louisa said miss tox instantly i have no alternative but to confide to you that the major has been particular  particular repeated mrs chick  the major has long been very particular indeed my love in his attentions said miss tox occasionally they have been so very marked that my position has been one of no common difficulty  is he in good circumstances inquired mrs chick  i have every reason to believe my dearindeed i may say i know returned miss tox that he is wealthy he is truly military and full of anecdote i have been informed that his valour when he was in active service knew no bounds i am told that he did all sorts of things in the peninsula with every description of firearm and in the east and west indies my love i really couldnt undertake to say what he did not do  very creditable to him indeed said mrs chick extremely so and you have given him no encouragement my dear  if i were to say louisa replied miss tox with every demonstration of making an effort that rent her soul that i never encouraged major bagstock slightly i should not do justice to the friendship which exists between you and me it is perhaps hardly in the nature of woman to receive such attentions as the major once lavished upon myself without betraying some sense of obligation but that is pastlong past between the major and me there is now a yawning chasm and i will not feign to give encouragement louisa where i cannot give my heart my affections said miss toxbut louisa this is madness and departed from the room  all this mrs chick communicated to her brother before dinner and it by no means indisposed mr dombey to receive the major with unwonted cordiality the major for his part was in a state of plethoric satisfaction that knew no bounds and he coughed and choked and chuckled and gasped and swelled until the waiters seemed positively afraid of him  your family monopolises joes light sir said the major when he had saluted miss tox joe lives in darkness princesss place is changed into kamschatka in the winter time there is no ray of sun sir for joey b now  miss tox is good enough to take a great deal of interest in paul major returned mr dombey on behalf of that blushing virgin  damme sir said the major im jealous of my little friend im pining away sir the bagstock breed is degenerating in the forsaken person of old joe and the major becoming bluer and bluer and puffing his cheeks further and further over the stiff ridge of his tight cravat stared at miss tox until his eyes seemed as if he were at that moment being overdone before the slow fire at the military college  notwithstanding the palpitation of the heart which these allusions occasioned her they were anything but disagreeable to miss tox as they enabled her to be extremely interesting and to manifest an occasional incoherence and distraction which she was not at all unwilling to display the major gave her abundant opportunities of exhibiting this emotion being profuse in his complaints at dinner of her desertion of him and princesss place and as he appeared to derive great enjoyment from making them they all got on very well  none the worse on account of the major taking charge of the whole conversation and showing as great an appetite in that respect as in regard of the various dainties on the table among which he may be almost said to have wallowed greatly to the aggravation of his inflammatory tendencies mr dombeys habitual silence and reserve yielding readily to this usurpation the major felt that he was coming out and shining and in the flow of spirits thus engendered rang such an infinite number of new changes on his own name that he quite astonished himself in a word they were all very well pleased the major was considered to possess an inexhaustible fund of conversation and when he took a late farewell after a long rubber mr dombey again complimented the blushing miss tox on her neighbour and acquaintance  but all the way home to his own hotel the major incessantly said to himself and of himself sly sirsly sirdevilish sly and when he got there sat down in a chair and fell into a silent fit of laughter with which he was sometimes seized and which was always particularly awful it held him so long on this occasion that the dark servant who stood watching him at a distance but dared not for his life approach twice or thrice gave him over for lost his whole form but especially his face and head dilated beyond all former experience and presented to the dark mans view nothing but a heaving mass of indigo at length he burst into a violent paroxysm of coughing and when that was a little better burst into such ejaculations as the following  would you maam would you mrs dombey eh maam i think not maam not while joe b can put a spoke in your wheel maam j bs even with you now maam he isnt altogether bowled out yet sir isnt bagstock shes deep sir deep but josh is deeper wide awake is old joebroad awake and staring sir there was no doubt of this last assertion being true and to a very fearful extent as it continued to be during the greater part of that night which the major chiefly passed in similar exclamations diversified with fits of coughing and choking that startled the whole house  it was on the day after this occasion being sunday when as mr dombey mrs chick and miss tox were sitting at breakfast still eulogising the major florence came running in her face suffused with a bright colour and her eyes sparkling joyfully and cried  papa papa heres walter and he wont come in  who cried mr dombey what does she mean what is this  walter papa said florence timidly sensible of having approached the presence with too much familiarity who found me when i was lost  does she mean young gay louisa inquired mr dombey knitting his brows really this childs manners have become very boisterous she cannot mean young gay i think see what it is will you  mrs chick hurried into the passage and returned with the information that it was young gay accompanied by a very strangelooking person and that young gay said he would not take the liberty of coming in hearing mr dombey was at breakfast but would wait until mr dombey should signify that he might approach  tell the boy to come in now said mr dombey now gay what is the matter who sent you down here was there nobody else to come  i beg your pardon sir returned walter i have not been sent i have been so bold as to come on my own account which i hope youll pardon when i mention the cause  but mr dombey without attending to what he said was looking impatiently on either side of him as if he were a pillar in his way at some object behind  whats that said mr dombey who is that i think you have made some mistake in the door sir  oh im very sorry to intrude with anyone sir cried walter hastily but this isthis is captain cuttle sir  walr my lad observed the captain in a deep voice stand by  at the same time the captain coming a little further in brought out his wide suit of blue his conspicuous shirtcollar and his knobby nose in full relief and stood bowing to mr dombey and waving his hook politely to the ladies with the hard glazed hat in his one hand and a red equator round his head which it had newly imprinted there  mr dombey regarded this phenomenon with amazement and indignation and seemed by his looks to appeal to mrs chick and miss tox against it little paul who had come in after florence backed towards miss tox as the captain waved his book and stood on the defensive  now gay said mr dombey what have you got to say to me  again the captain observed as a general opening of the conversation that could not fail to propitiate all parties walr standby  i am afraid sir began walter trembling and looking down at the ground that i take a very great liberty in comingindeed i am sure i do i should hardly have had the courage to ask to see you sir even after coming down i am afraid if i had not overtaken miss dombey and  well said mr dombey following his eyes as he glanced at the attentive florence and frowning unconsciously as she encouraged him with a smile go on if you please  ay ay observed the captain considering it incumbent on him as a point of good breeding to support mr dombey well said go on walr  captain cuttle ought to have been withered by the look which mr dombey bestowed upon him in acknowledgment of his patronage but quite innocent of this he closed one eye in reply and gave mr dombey to understand by certain significant motions of his hook that walter was a little bashful at first and might be expected to come out shortly  it is entirely a private and personal matter that has brought me here sir continued walter faltering and captain cuttle  here interposed the captain as an assurance that he was at hand and might be relied upon  who is a very old friend of my poor uncles and a most excellent man sir pursued walter raising his eyes with a look of entreaty in the captains behalf was so good as to offer to come with me which i could hardly refuse  no no no observed the captain complacently of course not no call for refusing go on walr  and therefore sir said walter venturing to meet mr dombeys eye and proceeding with better courage in the very desperation of the case now that there was no avoiding it therefore i have come with him sir to say that my poor old uncle is in very great affliction and distress that through the gradual loss of his business and not being able to make a payment the apprehension of which has weighed very heavily upon his mind months and months as indeed i know sir he has an execution in his house and is in danger of losing all he has and breaking his heart and that if you would in your kindness and in your old knowledge of him as a respectable man do anything to help him out of his difficulty sir we never could thank you enough for it  walters eyes filled with tears as he spoke and so did those of florence her father saw them glistening though he appeared to look at walter only  it is a very large sum sir said walter more than three hundred pounds my uncle is quite beaten down by his misfortune it lies so heavy on him and is quite unable to do anything for his own relief he doesnt even know yet that i have come to speak to you you would wish me to say sir added walter after a moments hesitation exactly what it is i want i really dont know sir there is my uncles stock on which i believe i may say confidently there are no other demands and there is captain cuttle who would wish to be security too ii hardly like to mention said walter such earnings as mine but if you would allow themaccumulatepaymentadvanceunclefrugal honourable old man walter trailed off through these broken sentences into silence and stood with downcast head before his employer  considering this a favourable moment for the display of the valuables captain cuttle advanced to the table and clearing a space among the breakfastcups at mr dombeys elbow produced the silver watch the ready money the teaspoons and the sugartongs and piling them up into a heap that they might look as precious as possible delivered himself of these words  half a loafs better than no bread and the same remark holds good with crumbs theres a few annuity of one hundred pound premium also ready to be made over if there is a man chock full of science in the world its old sol gills if there is a lad of promiseone flowing added the captain in one of his happy quotations with milk and honeyits his nevy  the captain then withdrew to his former place where he stood arranging his scattered locks with the air of a man who had given the finishing touch to a difficult performance  when walter ceased to speak mr dombeys eyes were attracted to little paul who seeing his sister hanging down her head and silently weeping in her commiseration for the distress she had heard described went over to her and tried to comfort her looking at walter and his father as he did so with a very expressive face after the momentary distraction of captain cuttles address which he regarded with lofty indifference mr dombey again turned his eyes upon his son and sat steadily regarding the child for some moments in silence  what was this debt contracted for asked mr dombey at length who is the creditor  he dont know replied the captain putting his hand on walters shoulder i do it came of helping a man thats dead now and thats cost my friend gills many a hundred pound already more particulars in private if agreeable  people who have enough to do to hold their own way said mr dombey unobservant of the captains mysterious signs behind walter and still looking at his son had better be content with their own obligations and difficulties and not increase them by engaging for other men it is an act of dishonesty and presumption too said mr dombey sternly great presumption for the wealthy could do no more paul come here  the child obeyed and mr dombey took him on his knee  if you had money now said mr dombey look at me  paul whose eyes had wandered to his sister and to walter looked his father in the face  if you had money now said mr dombey as much money as young gay has talked about what would you do  give it to his old uncle returned paul  lend it to his old uncle eh retorted mr dombey well when you are old enough you know you will share my money and we shall use it together  dombey and son interrupted paul who had been tutored early in the phrase  dombey and son repeated his father would you like to begin to be dombey and son now and lend this money to young gays uncle  oh if you please papa said paul and so would florence  girls said mr dombey have nothing to do with dombey and son would you like it  yes papa yes  then you shall do it returned his father and you see paul he added dropping his voice how powerful money is and how anxious people are to get it young gay comes all this way to beg for money and you who are so grand and great having got it are going to let him have it as a great favour and obligation  paul turned up the old face for a moment in which there was a sharp understanding of the reference conveyed in these words but it was a young and childish face immediately afterwards when he slipped down from his fathers knee and ran to tell florence not to cry any more for he was going to let young gay have the money  mr dombey then turned to a sidetable and wrote a note and sealed it during the interval paul and florence whispered to walter and captain cuttle beamed on the three with such aspiring and ineffably presumptuous thoughts as mr dombey never could have believed in the note being finished mr dombey turned round to his former place and held it out to walter  give that he said the first thing tomorrow morning to mr carker he will immediately take care that one of my people releases your uncle from his present position by paying the amount at issue and that such arrangements are made for its repayment as may be consistent with your uncles circumstances you will consider that this is done for you by master paul  walter in the emotion of holding in his hand the means of releasing his good uncle from his trouble would have endeavoured to express something of his gratitude and joy but mr dombey stopped him short  you will consider that it is done he repeated by master paul i have explained that to him and he understands it i wish no more to be said  as he motioned towards the door walter could only bow his head and retire miss tox seeing that the captain appeared about to do the same interposed  my dear sir she said addressing mr dombey at whose munificence both she and mrs chick were shedding tears copiously i think you have overlooked something pardon me mr dombey i think in the nobility of your character and its exalted scope you have omitted a matter of detail  indeed miss tox said mr dombey  the gentleman with theinstrument pursued miss tox glancing at captain cuttle has left upon the table at your elbow  good heaven said mr dombey sweeping the captains property from him as if it were so much crumb indeed take these things away i am obliged to you miss tox it is like your usual discretion have the goodness to take these things away sir  captain cuttle felt he had no alternative but to comply but he was so much struck by the magnanimity of mr dombey in refusing treasures lying heaped up to his hand that when he had deposited the teaspoons and sugartongs in one pocket and the ready money in another and had lowered the great watch down slowly into its proper vault he could not refrain from seizing that gentlemans right hand in his own solitary left and while he held it open with his powerful fingers bringing the hook down upon its palm in a transport of admiration at this touch of warm feeling and cold iron mr dombey shivered all over  captain cuttle then kissed his hook to the ladies several times with great elegance and gallantry and having taken a particular leave of paul and florence accompanied walter out of the room florence was running after them in the earnestness of her heart to send some message to old sol when mr dombey called her back and bade her stay where she was  will you never be a dombey my dear child said mrs chick with pathetic reproachfulness  dear aunt said florence dont be angry with me i am so thankful to papa  she would have run and thrown her arms about his neck if she had dared but as she did not dare she glanced with thankful eyes towards him as he sat musing sometimes bestowing an uneasy glance on her but for the most part watching paul who walked about the room with the newblown dignity of having let young gay have the money  and young gaywalterwhat of him  he was overjoyed to purge the old mans hearth from bailiffs and brokers and to hurry back to his uncle with the good tidings he was overjoyed to have it all arranged and settled next day before noon and to sit down at evening in the little back parlour with old sol and captain cuttle and to see the instrumentmaker already reviving and hopeful for the future and feeling that the wooden midshipman was his own again but without the least impeachment of his gratitude to mr dombey it must be confessed that walter was humbled and cast down it is when our budding hopes are nipped beyond recovery by some rough wind that we are the most disposed to picture to ourselves what flowers they might have borne if they had flourished and now when walter found himself cut off from that great dombey height by the depth of a new and terrible tumble and felt that all his old wild fancies had been scattered to the winds in the fall he began to suspect that they might have led him on to harmless visions of aspiring to florence in the remote distance of time  the captain viewed the subject in quite a different light he appeared to entertain a belief that the interview at which he had assisted was so very satisfactory and encouraging as to be only a step or two removed from a regular betrothal of florence to walter and that the late transaction had immensely forwarded if not thoroughly established the whittingtonian hopes stimulated by this conviction and by the improvement in the spirits of his old friend and by his own consequent gaiety he even attempted in favouring them with the ballad of lovely peg for the third time in one evening to make an extemporaneous substitution of the name florence but finding this difficult on account of the word peg invariably rhyming to leg in which personal beauty the original was described as having excelled all competitors he hit upon the happy thought of changing it to fleeeg which he accordingly did with an archness almost supernatural and a voice quite vociferous notwithstanding that the time was close at band when he must seek the abode of the dreadful mrs macstinger  that same evening the major was diffuse at his club on the subject of his friend dombey in the city damme sir said the major hes a prince is my friend dombey in the city i tell you what sir if you had a few more men among you like old joe bagstock and my friend dombey in the city sir youd do    chapter 11 pauls introduction to a new scene   mrs pipchins constitution was made of such hard metal in spite of its liability to the fleshly weaknesses of standing in need of repose after chops and of requiring to be coaxed to sleep by the soporific agency of sweetbreads that it utterly set at naught the predictions of mrs wickam and showed no symptoms of decline yet as pauls rapt interest in the old lady continued unbated mrs wickam would not budge an inch from the position she had taken up fortifying and entrenching herself on the strong ground of her uncles betsey jane she advised miss berry as a friend to prepare herself for the worst and forewarned her that her aunt might at any time be expected to go off suddenly like a powdermill  i hope miss berry mrs wickam would observe that youll come into whatever little property there may be to leave you deserve it i am sure for yours is a trying life though there dont seem much worth coming intoyoull excuse my being so openin this dismal den  poor berry took it all in good part and drudged and slaved away as usual perfectly convinced that mrs pipchin was one of the most meritorious persons in the world and making every day innumerable sacrifices of herself upon the altar of that noble old woman but all these immolations of berry were somehow carried to the credit of mrs pipchin by mrs pipchins friends and admirers and were made to harmonise with and carry out that melancholy fact of the deceased mr pipchin having broken his heart in the peruvian mines  for example there was an honest grocer and general dealer in the retail line of business between whom and mrs pipchin there was a small memorandum book with a greasy red cover perpetually in question and concerning which divers secret councils and conferences were continually being held between the parties to that register on the mat in the passage and with closed doors in the parlour nor were there wanting dark hints from master bitherstone whose temper had been made revengeful by the solar heats of india acting on his blood of balances unsettled and of a failure on one occasion within his memory in the supply of moist sugar at teatime this grocer being a bachelor and not a man who looked upon the surface for beauty had once made honourable offers for the hand of berry which mrs pipchin had with contumely and scorn rejected everybody said how laudable this was in mrs pipchin relict of a man who had died of the peruvian mines and what a staunch high independent spirit the old lady had but nobody said anything about poor berry who cried for six weeks being soundly rated by her good aunt all the time and lapsed into a state of hopeless spinsterhood  berrys very fond of you aint she paul once asked mrs pipchin when they were sitting by the fire with the cat  yes said mrs pipchin  why asked paul  why returned the disconcerted old lady how can you ask such things sir why are you fond of your sister florence  because shes very good said paul theres nobody like florence  well retorted mrs pipchin shortly and theres nobody like me i suppose  aint there really though asked paul leaning forward in his chair and looking at her very hard  no said the old lady  i am glad of that observed paul rubbing his hands thoughtfully thats a very good thing  mrs pipchin didnt dare to ask him why lest she should receive some perfectly annihilating answer but as a compensation to her wounded feelings she harassed master bitherstone to that extent until bedtime that he began that very night to make arrangements for an overland return to india by secreting from his supper a quarter of a round of bread and a fragment of moist dutch cheese as the beginning of a stock of provision to support him on the voyage  mrs pipchin had kept watch and ward over little paul and his sister for nearly twelve months they had been home twice but only for a few days and had been constant in their weekly visits to mr dombey at the hotel by little and little paul had grown stronger and had become able to dispense with his carriage though he still looked thin and delicate and still remained the same old quiet dreamy child that he had been when first consigned to mrs pipchins care one saturday afternoon at dusk great consternation was occasioned in the castle by the unlookedfor announcement of mr dombey as a visitor to mrs pipchin the population of the parlour was immediately swept upstairs as on the wings of a whirlwind and after much slamming of bedroom doors and trampling overhead and some knocking about of master bitherstone by mrs pipchin as a relief to the perturbation of her spirits the black bombazeen garments of the worthy old lady darkened the audiencechamber where mr dombey was contemplating the vacant armchair of his son and heir  mrs pipchin said mr dombey how do you do  thank you sir said mrs pipchin i am pretty well considering  mrs pipchin always used that form of words it meant considering her virtues sacrifices and so forth  i cant expect sir to be very well said mrs pipchin taking a chair and fetching her breath but such health as i have i am grateful for  mr dombey inclined his head with the satisfied air of a patron who felt that this was the sort of thing for which he paid so much a quarter after a moments silence he went on to say  mrs pipchin i have taken the liberty of calling to consult you in reference to my son i have had it in my mind to do so for some time past but have deferred it from time to time in order that his health might be thoroughly reestablished you have no misgivings on that subject mrs pipchin  brighton has proved very beneficial sir returned mrs pipchin very beneficial indeed  i purpose said mr dombey his remaining at brighton  mrs pipchin rubbed her hands and bent her grey eyes on the fire  but pursued mr dombey stretching out his forefinger but possibly that he should now make a change and lead a different kind of life here in short mrs pipchin that is the object of my visit my son is getting on mrs pipchin really he is getting on  there was something melancholy in the triumphant air with which mr dombey said this it showed how long pauls childish life had been to him and how his hopes were set upon a later stage of his existence pity may appear a strange word to connect with anyone so haughty and so cold and yet he seemed a worthy subject for it at that moment  six years old said mr dombey settling his neckclothperhaps to hide an irrepressible smile that rather seemed to strike upon the surface of his face and glance away as finding no restingplace than to play there for an instant dear me six will be changed to sixteen before we have time to look about us  ten years croaked the unsympathetic pipchin with a frosty glistening of her hard grey eye and a dreary shaking of her bent head is a long time  it depends on circumstances returned mr dombey at all events mrs pipchin my son is six years old and there is no doubt i fear that in his studies he is behind many children of his ageor his youth said mr dombey quickly answering what he mistrusted was a shrewd twinkle of the frosty eye his youth is a more appropriate expression now mrs pipchin instead of being behind his peers my son ought to be before them far before them there is an eminence ready for him to mount upon there is nothing of chance or doubt in the course before my son his way in life was clear and prepared and marked out before he existed the education of such a young gentleman must not be delayed it must not be left imperfect it must be very steadily and seriously undertaken mrs pipchin  well sir said mrs pipchin i can say nothing to the contrary  i was quite sure mrs pipchin returned mr dombey approvingly that a person of your good sense could not and would not  there is a great deal of nonsenseand worsetalked about young people not being pressed too hard at first and being tempted on and all the rest of it sir said mrs pipchin impatiently rubbing her hooked nose it never was thought of in my time and it has no business to be thought of now my opinion is keep em at it  my good madam returned mr dombey you have not acquired your reputation undeservedly and i beg you to believe mrs pipchin that i am more than satisfied with your excellent system of management and shall have the greatest pleasure in commending it whenever my poor commendation mr dombeys loftiness when he affected to disparage his own importance passed all boundscan be of any service i have been thinking of doctor blimbers mrs pipchin  my neighbour sir said mrs pipchin i believe the doctors is an excellent establishment ive heard that its very strictly conducted and there is nothing but learning going on from morning to night  and its very expensive added mr dombey  and its very expensive sir returned mrs pipchin catching at the fact as if in omitting that she had omitted one of its leading merits  i have had some communication with the doctor mrs pipchin said mr dombey hitching his chair anxiously a little nearer to the fire and he does not consider paul at all too young for his purpose he mentioned several instances of boys in greek at about the same age if i have any little uneasiness in my own mind mrs pipchin on the subject of this change it is not on that head my son not having known a mother has gradually concentrated muchtoo muchof his childish affection on his sister whether their separation mr dombey said no more but sat silent  hoitytoity exclaimed mrs pipchin shaking out her black bombazeen skirts and plucking up all the ogress within her if she dont like it mr dombey she must be taught to lump it the good lady apologised immediately afterwards for using so common a figure of speech but said and truly that that was the way she reasoned with em  mr dombey waited until mrs pipchin had done bridling and shaking her head and frowning down a legion of bitherstones and pankeys and then said quietly but correctively he my good madam he  mrs pipchins system would have applied very much the same mode of cure to any uneasiness on the part of paul too but as the hard grey eye was sharp enough to see that the recipe however mr dombey might admit its efficacy in the case of the daughter was not a sovereign remedy for the son she argued the point and contended that change and new society and the different form of life he would lead at doctor blimbers and the studies he would have to master would very soon prove sufficient alienations as this chimed in with mr dombeys own hope and belief it gave that gentleman a still higher opinion of mrs pipchins understanding and as mrs pipchin at the same time bewailed the loss of her dear little friend which was not an overwhelming shock to her as she had long expected it and had not looked in the beginning for his remaining with her longer than three months he formed an equally good opinion of mrs pipchins disinterestedness it was plain that he had given the subject anxious consideration for he had formed a plan which he announced to the ogress of sending paul to the doctors as a weekly boarder for the first half year during which time florence would remain at the castle that she might receive her brother there on saturdays this would wean him by degrees mr dombey said possibly with a recollection of his not having been weaned by degrees on a former occasion  mr dombey finished the interview by expressing his hope that mrs pipchin would still remain in office as general superintendent and overseer of his son pending his studies at brighton and having kissed paul and shaken hands with florence and beheld master bitherstone in his collar of state and made miss pankey cry by patting her on the head in which region she was uncommonly tender on account of a habit mrs pipchin had of sounding it with her knuckles like a cask he withdrew to his hotel and dinner resolved that paul now that he was getting so old and well should begin a vigorous course of education forthwith to qualify him for the position in which he was to shine and that doctor blimber should take him in hand immediately  whenever a young gentleman was taken in hand by doctor blimber he might consider himself sure of a pretty tight squeeze the doctor only undertook the charge of ten young gentlemen but he had always ready a supply of learning for a hundred on the lowest estimate and it was at once the business and delight of his life to gorge the unhappy ten with it  in fact doctor blimbers establishment was a great hothouse in which there was a forcing apparatus incessantly at work all the boys blew before their time mental greenpeas were produced at christmas and intellectual asparagus all the year round mathematical gooseberries very sour ones too were common at untimely seasons and from mere sprouts of bushes under doctor blimbers cultivation every description of greek and latin vegetable was got off the driest twigs of boys under the frostiest circumstances nature was of no consequence at all no matter what a young gentleman was intended to bear doctor blimber made him bear to pattern somehow or other  this was all very pleasant and ingenious but the system of forcing was attended with its usual disadvantages there was not the right taste about the premature productions and they didnt keep well moreover one young gentleman with a swollen nose and an excessively large head the oldest of the ten who had gone through everything suddenly left off blowing one day and remained in the establishment a mere stalk and people did say that the doctor had rather overdone it with young toots and that when he began to have whiskers he left off having brains  there young toots was at any rate possessed of the gruffest of voices and the shrillest of minds sticking ornamental pins into his shirt and keeping a ring in his waistcoat pocket to put on his little finger by stealth when the pupils went out walking constantly falling in love by sight with nurserymaids who had no idea of his existence and looking at the gaslighted world over the little iron bars in the lefthand corner window of the front three pairs of stairs after bedtime like a greatly overgrown cherub who had sat up aloft much too long  the doctor was a portly gentleman in a suit of black with strings at his knees and stockings below them he had a bald head highly polished a deep voice and a chin so very double that it was a wonder how he ever managed to shave into the creases he had likewise a pair of little eyes that were always half shut up and a mouth that was always half expanded into a grin as if he had that moment posed a boy and were waiting to convict him from his own lips insomuch that when the doctor put his right hand into the breast of his coat and with his other hand behind him and a scarcely perceptible wag of his head made the commonest observation to a nervous stranger it was like a sentiment from the sphynx and settled his business  the doctors was a mighty fine house fronting the sea not a joyful style of house within but quite the contrary sadcoloured curtains whose proportions were spare and lean hid themselves despondently behind the windows the tables and chairs were put away in rows like figures in a sum fires were so rarely lighted in the rooms of ceremony that they felt like wells and a visitor represented the bucket the diningroom seemed the last place in the world where any eating or drinking was likely to occur there was no sound through all the house but the ticking of a great clock in the hall which made itself audible in the very garrets and sometimes a dull cooing of young gentlemen at their lessons like the murmurings of an assemblage of melancholy pigeons  miss blimber too although a slim and graceful maid did no soft violence to the gravity of the house there was no light nonsense about miss blimber she kept her hair short and crisp and wore spectacles she was dry and sandy with working in the graves of deceased languages none of your live languages for miss blimber they must be deadstone deadand then miss blimber dug them up like a ghoul  mrs blimber her mama was not learned herself but she pretended to be and that did quite as well she said at evening parties that if she could have known cicero she thought she could have died contented it was the steady joy of her life to see the doctors young gentlemen go out walking unlike all other young gentlemen in the largest possible shirtcollars and the stiffest possible cravats it was so classical she said  as to mr feeder ba doctor blimbers assistant he was a kind of human barrelorgan with a little list of tunes at which he was continually working over and over again without any variation he might have been fitted up with a change of barrels perhaps in early life if his destiny had been favourable but it had not been and he had only one with which in a monotonous round it was his occupation to bewilder the young ideas of doctor blimbers young gentlemen the young gentlemen were prematurely full of carking anxieties they knew no rest from the pursuit of stonyhearted verbs savage nounsubstantives inflexible syntactic passages and ghosts of exercises that appeared to them in their dreams under the forcing system a young gentleman usually took leave of his spirits in three weeks he had all the cares of the world on his head in three months he conceived bitter sentiments against his parents or guardians in four he was an old misanthrope in five envied curtius that blessed refuge in the earth in six and at the end of the first twelvemonth had arrived at the conclusion from which he never afterwards departed that all the fancies of the poets and lessons of the sages were a mere collection of words and grammar and had no other meaning in the world  but he went on blow blow blowing in the doctors hothouse all the time and the doctors glory and reputation were great when he took his wintry growth home to his relations and friends  upon the doctors doorsteps one day paul stood with a fluttering heart and with his small right hand in his fathers his other hand was locked in that of florence how tight the tiny pressure of that one and how loose and cold the other  mrs pipchin hovered behind the victim with her sable plumage and her hooked beak like a bird of illomen she was out of breathfor mr dombey full of great thoughts had walked fastand she croaked hoarsely as she waited for the opening of the door  now paul said mr dombey exultingly this is the way indeed to be dombey and son and have money you are almost a man already  almost returned the child  even his childish agitation could not master the sly and quaint yet touching look with which he accompanied the reply  it brought a vague expression of dissatisfaction into mr dombeys face but the door being opened it was quickly gone  doctor blimber is at home i believe said mr dombey  the man said yes and as they passed in looked at paul as if he were a little mouse and the house were a trap he was a weakeyed young man with the first faint streaks or early dawn of a grin on his countenance it was mere imbecility but mrs pipchin took it into her head that it was impudence and made a snap at him directly  how dare you laugh behind the gentlemans back said mrs pipchin and what do you take me for  i aint a laughing at nobody and im sure i dont take you for nothing maam returned the young man in consternation  a pack of idle dogs said mrs pipchin only fit to be turnspits go and tell your master that mr dombeys here or itll be worse for you  the weakeyed young man went very meekly to discharge himself of this commission and soon came back to invite them to the doctors study  youre laughing again sir said mrs pipchin when it came to her turn bringing up the rear to pass him in the hall  i aint returned the young man grievously oppressed i never see such a thing as this  what is the matter mrs pipchin said mr dombey looking round softly pray  mrs pipchin in her deference merely muttered at the young man as she passed on and said oh he was a precious fellowleaving the young man who was all meekness and incapacity affected even to tears by the incident but mrs pipchin had a way of falling foul of all meek people and her friends said who could wonder at it after the peruvian mines  the doctor was sitting in his portentous study with a globe at each knee books all round him homer over the door and minerva on the mantelshelf and how do you do sir he said to mr dombey and how is my little friend grave as an organ was the doctors speech and when he ceased the great clock in the hall seemed to paul at least to take him up and to go on saying how is my lit tle friend how is my lit tle friend over and over and over again  the little friend being something too small to be seen at all from where the doctor sat over the books on his table the doctor made several futile attempts to get a view of him round the legs which mr dombey perceiving relieved the doctor from his embarrassment by taking paul up in his arms and sitting him on another little table over against the doctor in the middle of the room  ha said the doctor leaning back in his chair with his hand in his breast now i see my little friend how do you do my little friend  the clock in the hall wouldnt subscribe to this alteration in the form of words but continued to repeat how is my lit tle friend how is my lit tle friend  very well i thank you sir returned paul answering the clock quite as much as the doctor  ha said doctor blimber shall we make a man of him  do you hear paul added mr dombey paul being silent  shall we make a man of him repeated the doctor  i had rather be a child replied paul  indeed said the doctor why  the child sat on the table looking at him with a curious expression of suppressed emotion in his face and beating one hand proudly on his knee as if he had the rising tears beneath it and crushed them but his other hand strayed a little way the while a little fartherfarther from him yetuntil it lighted on the neck of florence this is why it seemed to say and then the steady look was broken up and gone the working lip was loosened and the tears came streaming forth  mrs pipchin said his father in a querulous manner i am really very sorry to see this  come away from him do miss dombey quoth the matron  never mind said the doctor blandly nodding his head to keep mrs pipchin back never mind we shall substitute new cares and new impressions mr dombey very shortly you would still wish my little friend to acquire  everything if you please doctor returned mr dombey firmly  yes said the doctor who with his halfshut eyes and his usual smile seemed to survey paul with the sort of interest that might attach to some choice little animal he was going to stuff yes exactly ha we shall impart a great variety of information to our little friend and bring him quickly forward i daresay i daresay quite a virgin soil i believe you said mr dombey  except some ordinary preparation at home and from this lady replied mr dombey introducing mrs pipchin who instantly communicated a rigidity to her whole muscular system and snorted defiance beforehand in case the doctor should disparage her except so far paul has as yet applied himself to no studies at all  doctor blimber inclined his head in gentle tolerance of such insignificant poaching as mrs pipchins and said he was glad to hear it it was much more satisfactory he observed rubbing his hands to begin at the foundation and again he leered at paul as if he would have liked to tackle him with the greek alphabet on the spot  that circumstance indeed doctor blimber pursued mr dombey glancing at his little son and the interview i have already had the pleasure of holding with you renders any further explanation and consequently any further intrusion on your valuable time so unnecessary that  now miss dombey said the acid pipchin  permit me said the doctor one moment allow me to present mrs blimber and my daughter who will be associated with the domestic life of our young pilgrim to parnassus mrs blimber for the lady who had perhaps been in waiting opportunely entered followed by her daughter that fair sexton in spectacles mr dombey my daughter cornelia mr dombey mr dombey my love pursued the doctor turning to his wife is so confiding as todo you see our little friend  mrs blimber in an excess of politeness of which mr dombey was the object apparently did not for she was backing against the little friend and very much endangering his position on the table but on this hint she turned to admire his classical and intellectual lineaments and turning again to mr dombey said with a sigh that she envied his dear son  like a bee sir said mrs blimber with uplifted eyes about to plunge into a garden of the choicest flowers and sip the sweets for the first time virgil horace ovid terence plautus cicero what a world of honey have we here it may appear remarkable mr dombey in one who is a wifethe wife of such a husband  hush hush said doctor blimber fie for shame  mr dombey will forgive the partiality of a wife said mrs blimber with an engaging smile  mr dombey answered not at all applying those words it is to be presumed to the partiality and not to the forgiveness  and it may seem remarkable in one who is a mother also resumed mrs blimber  and such a mother observed mr dombey bowing with some confused idea of being complimentary to cornelia  but really pursued mrs blimber i think if i could have known cicero and been his friend and talked with him in his retirement at tusculum beautiful tusculum i could have died contented  a learned enthusiasm is so very contagious that mr dombey half believed this was exactly his case and even mrs pipchin who was not as we have seen of an accommodating disposition generally gave utterance to a little sound between a groan and a sigh as if she would have said that nobody but cicero could have proved a lasting consolation under that failure of the peruvian mines but that he indeed would have been a very davylamp of refuge  cornelia looked at mr dombey through her spectacles as if she would have liked to crack a few quotations with him from the authority in question but this design if she entertained it was frustrated by a knock at the roomdoor  who is that said the doctor oh come in toots come in mr dombey sir toots bowed quite a coincidence said doctor blimber here we have the beginning and the end alpha and omega our head boy mr dombey  the doctor might have called him their head and shoulders boy for he was at least that much taller than any of the rest he blushed very much at finding himself among strangers and chuckled aloud  an addition to our little portico toots said the doctor mr dombeys son  young toots blushed again and finding from a solemn silence which prevailed that he was expected to say something said to paul how are you in a voice so deep and a manner so sheepish that if a lamb had roared it couldnt have been more surprising  ask mr feeder if you please toots said the doctor to prepare a few introductory volumes for mr dombeys son and to allot him a convenient seat for study my dear i believe mr dombey has not seen the dormitories  if mr dombey will walk upstairs said mrs blimber i shall be more than proud to show him the dominions of the drowsy god  with that mrs blimber who was a lady of great suavity and a wiry figure and who wore a cap composed of skyblue materials pied upstairs with mr dombey and cornelia mrs pipchin following and looking out sharp for her enemy the footman  while they were gone paul sat upon the table holding florence by the hand and glancing timidly from the doctor round and round the room while the doctor leaning back in his chair with his hand in his breast as usual held a book from him at arms length and read there was something very awful in this manner of reading it was such a determined unimpassioned inflexible coldblooded way of going to work it left the doctors countenance exposed to view and when the doctor smiled suspiciously at his author or knit his brows or shook his head and made wry faces at him as much as to say dont tell me sir i know better it was terrific  toots too had no business to be outside the door ostentatiously examining the wheels in his watch and counting his halfcrowns but that didnt last long for doctor blimber happening to change the position of his tight plump legs as if he were going to get up toots swiftly vanished and appeared no more  mr dombey and his conductress were soon heard coming downstairs again talking all the way and presently they reentered the doctors study  i hope mr dombey said the doctor laying down his book that the arrangements meet your approval  they are excellent sir said mr dombey  very fair indeed said mrs pipchin in a low voice never disposed to give too much encouragement  mrs pipchin said mr dombey wheeling round will with your permission doctor and mrs blimber visit paul now and then  whenever mrs pipchin pleases observed the doctor  always happy to see her said mrs blimber  i think said mr dombey i have given all the trouble i need and may take my leave paul my child he went close to him as he sat upon the table goodbye  goodbye papa  the limp and careless little hand that mr dombey took in his was singularly out of keeping with the wistful face but he had no part in its sorrowful expression it was not addressed to him no no to florenceall to florence  if mr dombey in his insolence of wealth had ever made an enemy hard to appease and cruelly vindictive in his hate even such an enemy might have received the pang that wrung his proud heart then as compensation for his injury  he bent down over his boy and kissed him if his sight were dimmed as he did so by something that for a moment blurred the little face and made it indistinct to him his mental vision may have been for that short time the clearer perhaps  i shall see you soon paul you are free on saturdays and sundays you know  yes papa returned paul looking at his sister on saturdays and sundays  and youll try and learn a great deal here and be a clever man said mr dombey wont you  ill try returned the child wearily  and youll soon be grown up now said mr dombey  oh very soon replied the child once more the old old look passed rapidly across his features like a strange light it fell on mrs pipchin and extinguished itself in her black dress that excellent ogress stepped forward to take leave and to bear off florence which she had long been thirsting to do the move on her part roused mr dombey whose eyes were fixed on paul after patting him on the head and pressing his small hand again he took leave of doctor blimber mrs blimber and miss blimber with his usual polite frigidity and walked out of the study  despite his entreaty that they would not think of stirring doctor blimber mrs blimber and miss blimber all pressed forward to attend him to the hall and thus mrs pipchin got into a state of entanglement with miss blimber and the doctor and was crowded out of the study before she could clutch florence to which happy accident paul stood afterwards indebted for the dear remembrance that florence ran back to throw her arms round his neck and that hers was the last face in the doorway turned towards him with a smile of encouragement the brighter for the tears through which it beamed  it made his childish bosom heave and swell when it was gone and sent the globes the books blind homer and minerva swimming round the room but they stopped all of a sudden and then he heard the loud clock in the hall still gravely inquiring how is my lit tle friend how is my lit tle friend as it had done before  he sat with folded hands upon his pedestal silently listening but he might have answered weary weary very lonely very sad and there with an aching void in his young heart and all outside so cold and bare and strange paul sat as if he had taken life unfurnished and the upholsterer were never coming    chapter 12 pauls education   after the lapse of some minutes which appeared an immense time to little paul dombey on the table doctor blimber came back the doctors walk was stately and calculated to impress the juvenile mind with solemn feelings it was a sort of march but when the doctor put out his right foot he gravely turned upon his axis with a semicircular sweep towards the left and when he put out his left foot he turned in the same manner towards the right so that he seemed at every stride he took to look about him as though he were saying can anybody have the goodness to indicate any subject in any direction on which i am uninformed i rather think not  mrs blimber and miss blimber came back in the doctors company and the doctor lifting his new pupil off the table delivered him over to miss blimber  cornelia said the doctor dombey will be your charge at first bring him on cornelia bring him on  miss blimber received her young ward from the doctors hands and paul feeling that the spectacles were surveying him cast down his eyes  how old are you dombey said miss blimber  six answered paul wondering as he stole a glance at the young lady why her hair didnt grow long like florences and why she was like a boy  how much do you know of your latin grammar dombey said miss blimber  none of it answered paul feeling that the answer was a shock to miss blimbers sensibility he looked up at the three faces that were looking down at him and said  i havent been well i have been a weak child i couldnt learn a latin grammar when i was out every day with old glubb i wish youd tell old glubb to come and see me if you please  what a dreadfully low name said mrs blimber unclassical to a degree who is the monster child  what monster inquired paul  glubb said mrs blimber with a great disrelish  hes no more a monster than you are returned paul  what cried the doctor in a terrible voice ay ay ay aha whats that  paul was dreadfully frightened but still he made a stand for the absent glubb though he did it trembling  hes a very nice old man maam he said he used to draw my couch he knows all about the deep sea and the fish that are in it and the great monsters that come and lie on rocks in the sun and dive into the water again when theyre startled blowing and splashing so that they can be heard for miles there are some creatures said paul warming with his subject i dont know how many yards long and i forget their names but florence knows that pretend to be in distress and when a man goes near them out of compassion they open their great jaws and attack him but all he has got to do said paul boldly tendering this information to the very doctor himself is to keep on turning as he runs away and then as they turn slowly because they are so long and cant bend hes sure to beat them and though old glubb dont know why the sea should make me think of my mama thats dead or what it is that it is always sayingalways saying he knows a great deal about it and i wish the child concluded with a sudden falling of his countenance and failing in his animation as he looked like one forlorn upon the three strange faces that youd let old glubb come here to see me for i know him very well and he knows me  ha said the doctor shaking his head this is bad but study will do much  mrs blimber opined with something like a shiver that he was an unaccountable child and allowing for the difference of visage looked at him pretty much as mrs pipchin had been used to do  take him round the house cornelia said the doctor and familiarise him with his new sphere go with that young lady dombey  dombey obeyed giving his hand to the abstruse cornelia and looking at her sideways with timid curiosity as they went away together for her spectacles by reason of the glistening of the glasses made her so mysterious that he didnt know where she was looking and was not indeed quite sure that she had any eyes at all behind them  cornelia took him first to the schoolroom which was situated at the back of the hall and was approached through two baize doors which deadened and muffled the young gentlemens voices here there were eight young gentlemen in various stages of mental prostration all very hard at work and very grave indeed toots as an old hand had a desk to himself in one corner and a magnificent man of immense age he looked in pauls young eyes behind it  mr feeder ba who sat at another little desk had his virgil stop on and was slowly grinding that tune to four young gentlemen of the remaining four two who grasped their foreheads convulsively were engaged in solving mathematical problems one with his face like a dirty window from much crying was endeavouring to flounder through a hopeless number of lines before dinner and one sat looking at his task in stony stupefaction and despairwhich it seemed had been his condition ever since breakfast time  the appearance of a new boy did not create the sensation that might have been expected mr feeder ba who was in the habit of shaving his head for coolness and had nothing but little bristles on it gave him a bony hand and told him he was glad to see himwhich paul would have been very glad to have told him if he could have done so with the least sincerity then paul instructed by cornelia shook hands with the four young gentlemen at mr feeders desk then with the two young gentlemen at work on the problems who were very feverish then with the young gentleman at work against time who was very inky and lastly with the young gentleman in a state of stupefaction who was flabby and quite cold  paul having been already introduced to toots that pupil merely chuckled and breathed hard as his custom was and pursued the occupation in which he was engaged it was not a severe one for on account of his having gone through so much in more senses than one and also of his having as before hinted left off blowing in his prime toots now had licence to pursue his own course of study which was chiefly to write long letters to himself from persons of distinction adds p toots esquire brighton sussex and to preserve them in his desk with great care  these ceremonies passed cornelia led paul upstairs to the top of the house which was rather a slow journey on account of paul being obliged to land both feet on every stair before he mounted another but they reached their journeys end at last and there in a front room looking over the wild sea cornelia showed him a nice little bed with white hangings close to the window on which there was already beautifully written on a card in round textdown strokes very thick and up strokes very finedombey while two other little bedsteads in the same room were announced through like means as respectively appertaining unto briggs and tozer  just as they got downstairs again into the hall paul saw the weakeyed young man who had given that mortal offence to mrs pipchin suddenly seize a very large drumstick and fly at a gong that was hanging up as if he had gone mad or wanted vengeance instead of receiving warning however or being instantly taken into custody the young man left off unchecked after having made a dreadful noise then cornelia blimber said to dombey that dinner would be ready in a quarter of an hour and perhaps he had better go into the schoolroom among his friends  so dombey deferentially passing the great clock which was still as anxious as ever to know how he found himself opened the schoolroom door a very little way and strayed in like a lost boy shutting it after him with some difficulty his friends were all dispersed about the room except the stony friend who remained immoveable mr feeder was stretching himself in his grey gown as if regardless of expense he were resolved to pull the sleeves off  heigh ho hum cried mr feeder shaking himself like a carthorse oh dear me dear me yaaaah  paul was quite alarmed by mr feeders yawning it was done on such a great scale and he was so terribly in earnest all the boys too toots excepted seemed knocked up and were getting ready for dinnersome newly tying their neckcloths which were very stiff indeed and others washing their hands or brushing their hair in an adjoining antechamberas if they didnt think they should enjoy it at all  young toots who was ready beforehand and had therefore nothing to do and had leisure to bestow upon paul said with heavy good nature  sit down dombey  thank you sir said paul  his endeavouring to hoist himself on to a very high windowseat and his slipping down again appeared to prepare tootss mind for the reception of a discovery  youre a very small chap said mr toots  yes sir im small returned paul thank you sir  for toots had lifted him into the seat and done it kindly too  whos your tailor inquired toots after looking at him for some moments  its a woman that has made my clothes as yet said paul my sisters dressmaker  my tailors burgess and co said toots fashnable but very dear  paul had wit enough to shake his head as if he would have said it was easy to see that and indeed he thought so  your fathers regularly rich aint he inquired mr toots  yes sir said paul hes dombey and son  and which demanded toots  and son sir replied paul  mr toots made one or two attempts in a low voice to fix the firm in his mind but not quite succeeding said he would get paul to mention the name again tomorrow morning as it was rather important and indeed he purposed nothing less than writing himself a private and confidential letter from dombey and son immediately  by this time the other pupils always excepting the stony boy gathered round they were polite but pale and spoke low and they were so depressed in their spirits that in comparison with the general tone of that company master bitherstone was a perfect miller or complete jest book and yet he had a sense of injury upon him too had bitherstone  you sleep in my room dont you asked a solemn young gentleman whose shirtcollar curled up the lobes of his ears  master briggs inquired paul  tozer said the young gentleman  paul answered yes and tozer pointing out the stony pupil said that was briggs paul had already felt certain that it must be either briggs or tozer though he didnt know why  is yours a strong constitution inquired tozer  paul said he thought not tozer replied that he thought not also judging from pauls looks and that it was a pity for it need be he then asked paul if he were going to begin with cornelia and on paul saying yes all the young gentlemen briggs excepted gave a low groan  it was drowned in the tintinnabulation of the gong which sounding again with great fury there was a general move towards the diningroom still excepting briggs the stony boy who remained where he was and as he was and on its way to whom paul presently encountered a round of bread genteelly served on a plate and napkin and with a silver fork lying crosswise on the top of it  doctor blimber was already in his place in the diningroom at the top of the table with miss blimber and mrs blimber on either side of him mr feeder in a black coat was at the bottom pauls chair was next to miss blimber but it being found when he sat in it that his eyebrows were not much above the level of the tablecloth some books were brought in from the doctors study on which he was elevated and on which he always sat from that timecarrying them in and out himself on after occasions like a little elephant and castle  grace having been said by the doctor dinner began there was some nice soup also roast meat boiled meat vegetables pie and cheese every young gentleman had a massive silver fork and a napkin and all the arrangements were stately and handsome in particular there was a butler in a blue coat and bright buttons who gave quite a winey flavour to the table beer he poured it out so superbly  nobody spoke unless spoken to except doctor blimber mrs blimber and miss blimber who conversed occasionally whenever a young gentleman was not actually engaged with his knife and fork or spoon his eye with an irresistible attraction sought the eye of doctor blimber mrs blimber or miss blimber and modestly rested there toots appeared to be the only exception to this rule he sat next mr feeder on pauls side of the table and frequently looked behind and before the intervening boys to catch a glimpse of paul  only once during dinner was there any conversation that included the young gentlemen it happened at the epoch of the cheese when the doctor having taken a glass of port wine and hemmed twice or thrice said  it is remarkable mr feeder that the romans  at the mention of this terrible people their implacable enemies every young gentleman fastened his gaze upon the doctor with an assumption of the deepest interest one of the number who happened to be drinking and who caught the doctors eye glaring at him through the side of his tumbler left off so hastily that he was convulsed for some moments and in the sequel ruined doctor blimbers point  it is remarkable mr feeder said the doctor beginning again slowly that the romans in those gorgeous and profuse entertainments of which we read in the days of the emperors when luxury had attained a height unknown before or since and when whole provinces were ravaged to supply the splendid means of one imperial banquet  here the offender who had been swelling and straining and waiting in vain for a full stop broke out violently  johnson said mr feeder in a low reproachful voice take some water  the doctor looking very stern made a pause until the water was brought and then resumed  and when mr feeder  but mr feeder who saw that johnson must break out again and who knew that the doctor would never come to a period before the young gentlemen until he had finished all he meant to say couldnt keep his eye off johnson and thus was caught in the fact of not looking at the doctor who consequently stopped  i beg your pardon sir said mr feeder reddening i beg your pardon doctor blimber  and when said the doctor raising his voice when sir as we read and have no reason to doubtincredible as it may appear to the vulgarof our timethe brother of vitellius prepared for him a feast in which were served of fish two thousand dishes  take some water johnsondishes sir said mr feeder  of various sorts of fowl five thousand dishes  or try a crust of bread said mr feeder  and one dish pursued doctor blimber raising his voice still higher as he looked all round the table called from its enormous dimensions the shield of minerva and made among other costly ingredients of the brains of pheasants  ow ow ow from johnson  woodcocks  ow ow ow  the sounds of the fish called scari  youll burst some vessel in your head said mr feeder you had better let it come  and the spawn of the lamprey brought from the carpathian sea pursued the doctor in his severest voice when we read of costly entertainments such as these and still remember that we have a titus  what would be your mothers feelings if you died of apoplexy said mr feeder  a domitian  and youre blue you know said mr feeder  a nero a tiberius a caligula a heliogabalus and many more pursued the doctor it is mr feederif you are doing me the honour to attendremarkable very remarkable sir  but johnson unable to suppress it any longer burst at that moment into such an overwhelming fit of coughing that although both his immediate neighbours thumped him on the back and mr feeder himself held a glass of water to his lips and the butler walked him up and down several times between his own chair and the sideboard like a sentry it was a full five minutes before he was moderately composed then there was a profound silence  gentlemen said doctor blimber rise for grace cornelia lift dombey downnothing of whom but his scalp was accordingly seen above the tablecloth johnson will repeat to me tomorrow morning before breakfast without book and from the greek testament the first chapter of the epistle of saint paul to the ephesians we will resume our studies mr feeder in halfanhour  the young gentlemen bowed and withdrew mr feeder did likewise during the halfhour the young gentlemen broken into pairs loitered arminarm up and down a small piece of ground behind the house or endeavoured to kindle a spark of animation in the breast of briggs but nothing happened so vulgar as play punctually at the appointed time the gong was sounded and the studies under the joint auspices of doctor blimber and mr feeder were resumed  as the olympic game of lounging up and down had been cut shorter than usual that day on johnsons account they all went out for a walk before tea even briggs though he hadnt begun yet partook of this dissipation in the enjoyment of which he looked over the cliff two or three times darkly doctor blimber accompanied them and paul had the honour of being taken in tow by the doctor himself a distinguished state of things in which he looked very little and feeble  tea was served in a style no less polite than the dinner and after tea the young gentlemen rising and bowing as before withdrew to fetch up the unfinished tasks of that day or to get up the already looming tasks of tomorrow in the meantime mr feeder withdrew to his own room and paul sat in a corner wondering whether florence was thinking of him and what they were all about at mrs pipchins  mr toots who had been detained by an important letter from the duke of wellington found paul out after a time and having looked at him for a long while as before inquired if he was fond of waistcoats  paul said yes sir  so am i said toots  no word more spoke toots that night but he stood looking at paul as if he liked him and as there was company in that and paul was not inclined to talk it answered his purpose better than conversation  at eight oclock or so the gong sounded again for prayers in the diningroom where the butler afterwards presided over a sidetable on which bread and cheese and beer were spread for such young gentlemen as desired to partake of those refreshments the ceremonies concluded by the doctors saying gentlemen we will resume our studies at seven tomorrow and then for the first time paul saw cornelia blimbers eye and saw that it was upon him when the doctor had said these words gentlemen we will resume our studies at seven tomorrow the pupils bowed again and went to bed  in the confidence of their own room upstairs briggs said his head ached ready to split and that he should wish himself dead if it wasnt for his mother and a blackbird he had at home tozer didnt say much but he sighed a good deal and told paul to look out for his turn would come tomorrow after uttering those prophetic words he undressed himself moodily and got into bed briggs was in his bed too and paul in his bed too before the weakeyed young man appeared to take away the candle when he wished them goodnight and pleasant dreams but his benevolent wishes were in vain as far as briggs and tozer were concerned for paul who lay awake for a long while and often woke afterwards found that briggs was ridden by his lesson as a nightmare and that tozer whose mind was affected in his sleep by similar causes in a minor degree talked unknown tongues or scraps of greek and latinit was all one to paulwhich in the silence of night had an inexpressibly wicked and guilty effect  paul had sunk into a sweet sleep and dreamed that he was walking hand in hand with florence through beautiful gardens when they came to a large sunflower which suddenly expanded itself into a gong and began to sound opening his eyes he found that it was a dark windy morning with a drizzling rain and that the real gong was giving dreadful note of preparation down in the hall  so he got up directly and found briggs with hardly any eyes for nightmare and grief had made his face puffy putting his boots on while tozer stood shivering and rubbing his shoulders in a very bad humour poor paul couldnt dress himself easily not being used to it and asked them if they would have the goodness to tie some strings for him but as briggs merely said bother and tozer oh yes he went down when he was otherwise ready to the next storey where he saw a pretty young woman in leather gloves cleaning a stove the young woman seemed surprised at his appearance and asked him where his mother was when paul told her she was dead she took her gloves off and did what he wanted and furthermore rubbed his hands to warm them and gave him a kiss and told him whenever he wanted anything of that sortmeaning in the dressing wayto ask for melia which paul thanking her very much said he certainly would he then proceeded softly on his journey downstairs towards the room in which the young gentlemen resumed their studies when passing by a door that stood ajar a voice from within cried is that dombey on paul replying yes maam for he knew the voice to be miss blimbers miss blimber said come in dombey and in he went miss blimber presented exactly the appearance she had presented yesterday except that she wore a shawl her little light curls were as crisp as ever and she had already her spectacles on which made paul wonder whether she went to bed in them she had a cool little sittingroom of her own up there with some books in it and no fire but miss blimber was never cold and never sleepy  now dombey said miss blimber i am going out for a constitutional  paul wondered what that was and why she didnt send the footman out to get it in such unfavourable weather but he made no observation on the subject his attention being devoted to a little pile of new books on which miss blimber appeared to have been recently engaged  these are yours dombey said miss blimber  all of em maam said paul  yes returned miss blimber and mr feeder will look you out some more very soon if you are as studious as i expect you will be dombey  thank you maam said paul  i am going out for a constitutional resumed miss blimber and while i am gone that is to say in the interval between this and breakfast dombey i wish you to read over what i have marked in these books and to tell me if you quite understand what you have got to learn dont lose time dombey for you have none to spare but take them downstairs and begin directly  yes maam answered paul  there were so many of them that although paul put one hand under the bottom book and his other hand and his chin on the top book and hugged them all closely the middle book slipped out before he reached the door and then they all tumbled down on the floor miss blimber said oh dombey dombey this is really very careless and piled them up afresh for him and this time by dint of balancing them with great nicety paul got out of the room and down a few stairs before two of them escaped again but he held the rest so tight that he only left one more on the first floor and one in the passage and when he had got the main body down into the schoolroom he set off upstairs again to collect the stragglers having at last amassed the whole library and climbed into his place he fell to work encouraged by a remark from tozer to the effect that he was in for it now which was the only interruption he received till breakfast time at that meal for which he had no appetite everything was quite as solemn and genteel as at the others and when it was finished he followed miss blimber upstairs  now dombey said miss blimber how have you got on with those books  they comprised a little english and a deal of latinnames of things declensions of articles and substantives exercises thereon and preliminary rulesa trifle of orthography a glance at ancient history a wink or two at modern ditto a few tables two or three weights and measures and a little general information when poor paul had spelt out number two he found he had no idea of number one fragments whereof afterwards obtruded themselves into number three which slided into number four which grafted itself on to number two so that whether twenty romuluses made a remus or hic haec hoc was troy weight or a verb always agreed with an ancient briton or three times four was taurus a bull were open questions with him  oh dombey dombey said miss blimber this is very shocking  if you please said paul i think if i might sometimes talk a little to old glubb i should be able to do better  nonsense dombey said miss blimber i couldnt hear of it this is not the place for glubbs of any kind you must take the books down i suppose dombey one by one and perfect yourself in the days instalment of subject a before you turn at all to subject b i am sorry to say dombey that your education appears to have been very much neglected  so papa says returned paul but i told youi have been a weak child florence knows i have so does wickam  who is wickam asked miss blimber  she has been my nurse paul answered  i must beg you not to mention wickam to me then said miss blimberi couldnt allow it  you asked me who she was said paul  very well returned miss blimber but this is all very different indeed from anything of that sort dombey and i couldnt think of permitting it as to having been weak you must begin to be strong and now take away the top book if you please dombey and return when you are master of the theme  miss blimber expressed her opinions on the subject of pauls uninstructed state with a gloomy delight as if she had expected this result and were glad to find that they must be in constant communication paul withdrew with the top task as he was told and laboured away at it down below sometimes remembering every word of it and sometimes forgetting it all and everything else besides until at last he ventured upstairs again to repeat the lesson when it was nearly all driven out of his head before he began by miss blimbers shutting up the book and saying good dombey a proceeding so suggestive of the knowledge inside of her that paul looked upon the young lady with consternation as a kind of learned guy faux or artificial bogle stuffed full of scholastic straw  he acquitted himself very well nevertheless and miss blimber commending him as giving promise of getting on fast immediately provided him with subject b from which he passed to c and even d before dinner it was hard work resuming his studies soon after dinner and he felt giddy and confused and drowsy and dull but all the other young gentlemen had similar sensations and were obliged to resume their studies too if there were any comfort in that it was a wonder that the great clock in the hall instead of being constant to its first inquiry never said gentlemen we will now resume our studies for that phrase was often enough repeated in its neighbourhood the studies went round like a mighty wheel and the young gentlemen were always stretched upon it  after tea there were exercises again and preparations for next day by candlelight and in due course there was bed where but for that resumption of the studies which took place in dreams were rest and sweet forgetfulness  oh saturdays oh happy saturdays when florence always came at noon and never would in any weather stay away though mrs pipchin snarled and growled and worried her bitterly those saturdays were sabbaths for at least two little christians among all the jews and did the holy sabbath work of strengthening and knitting up a brothers and a sisters love  not even sunday nightsthe heavy sunday nights whose shadow darkened the first waking burst of light on sunday morningscould mar those precious saturdays whether it was the great seashore where they sat and strolled together or whether it was only mrs pipchins dull back room in which she sang to him so softly with his drowsy head upon her arm paul never cared it was florence that was all he thought of so on sunday nights when the doctors dark door stood agape to swallow him up for another week the time was come for taking leave of florence no one else  mrs wickam had been drafted home to the house in town and miss nipper now a smart young woman had come down to many a single combat with mrs pipchin did miss nipper gallantly devote herself and if ever mrs pipchin in all her life had found her match she had found it now miss nipper threw away the scabbard the first morning she arose in mrs pipchins house she asked and gave no quarter she said it must be war and war it was and mrs pipchin lived from that time in the midst of surprises harassings and defiances and skirmishing attacks that came bouncing in upon her from the passage even in unguarded moments of chops and carried desolation to her very toast  miss nipper had returned one sunday night with florence from walking back with paul to the doctors when florence took from her bosom a little piece of paper on which she had pencilled down some words  see here susan she said these are the names of the little books that paul brings home to do those long exercises with when he is so tired i copied them last night while he was writing  dont show em to me miss floy if you please returned nipper id as soon see mrs pipchin  i want you to buy them for me susan if you will tomorrow morning i have money enough said florence  why goodness gracious me miss floy returned miss nipper how can you talk like that when you have books upon books already and masterses and mississes a teaching of you everything continual though my belief is that your pa miss dombey never would have learnt you nothing never would have thought of it unless youd asked himwhen he couldnt well refuse but giving consent when asked and offering when unasked miss is quite two things i may not have my objections to a young mans keeping company with me and when he puts the question may say yes but thats not saying would you be so kind as like me  but you can buy me the books susan and you will when you know why i want them  well miss and why do you want em replied nipper adding in a lower voice if it was to fling at mrs pipchins head id buy a cartload  paul has a great deal too much to do susan said florence i am sure of it  and well you may be miss returned her maid and make your mind quite easy that the willing dear is worked and worked away if those is latin legs exclaimed miss nipper with strong feelingin allusion to pauls give me english ones  i am afraid he feels lonely and lost at doctor blimbers susan pursued florence turning away her face  ah said miss nipper with great sharpness oh them blimbers  dont blame anyone said florence its a mistake  i say nothing about blame miss cried miss nipper for i know that you object but i may wish miss that the family was set to work to make new roads and that miss blimber went in front and had the pickaxe  after this speech miss nipper who was perfectly serious wiped her eyes  i think i could perhaps give paul some help susan if i had these books said florence and make the coming week a little easier to him at least i want to try so buy them for me dear and i will never forget how kind it was of you to do it  it must have been a harder heart than susan nippers that could have rejected the little purse florence held out with these words or the gentle look of entreaty with which she seconded her petition susan put the purse in her pocket without reply and trotted out at once upon her errand  the books were not easy to procure and the answer at several shops was either that they were just out of them or that they never kept them or that they had had a great many last month or that they expected a great many next week but susan was not easily baffled in such an enterprise and having entrapped a whitehaired youth in a black calico apron from a library where she was known to accompany her in her quest she led him such a life in going up and down that he exerted himself to the utmost if it were only to get rid of her and finally enabled her to return home in triumph  with these treasures then after her own daily lessons were over florence sat down at night to track pauls footsteps through the thorny ways of learning and being possessed of a naturally quick and sound capacity and taught by that most wonderful of masters love it was not long before she gained upon pauls heels and caught and passed him  not a word of this was breathed to mrs pipchin but many a night when they were all in bed and when miss nipper with her hair in papers and herself asleep in some uncomfortable attitude reposed unconscious by her side and when the chinking ashes in the grate were cold and grey and when the candles were burnt down and guttering outflorence tried so hard to be a substitute for one small dombey that her fortitude and perseverance might have almost won her a free right to bear the name herself  and high was her reward when one saturday evening as little paul was sitting down as usual to resume his studies she sat down by his side and showed him all that was so rough made smooth and all that was so dark made clear and plain before him it was nothing but a startled look in pauls wan facea flusha smileand then a close embracebut god knows how her heart leapt up at this rich payment for her trouble  oh floy cried her brother how i love you how i love you floy  and i you dear  oh i am sure of that floy  he said no more about it but all that evening sat close by her very quiet and in the night he called out from his little room within hers three or four times that he loved her  regularly after that florence was prepared to sit down with paul on saturday night and patiently assist him through so much as they could anticipate together of his next weeks work the cheering thought that he was labouring on where florence had just toiled before him would of itself have been a stimulant to paul in the perpetual resumption of his studies but coupled with the actual lightening of his load consequent on this assistance it saved him possibly from sinking underneath the burden which the fair cornelia blimber piled upon his back  it was not that miss blimber meant to be too hard upon him or that doctor blimber meant to bear too heavily on the young gentlemen in general cornelia merely held the faith in which she had been bred and the doctor in some partial confusion of his ideas regarded the young gentlemen as if they were all doctors and were born grown up comforted by the applause of the young gentlemens nearest relations and urged on by their blind vanity and illconsidered haste it would have been strange if doctor blimber had discovered his mistake or trimmed his swelling sails to any other tack  thus in the case of paul when doctor blimber said he made great progress and was naturally clever mr dombey was more bent than ever on his being forced and crammed in the case of briggs when doctor blimber reported that he did not make great progress yet and was not naturally clever briggs senior was inexorable in the same purpose in short however high and false the temperature at which the doctor kept his hothouse the owners of the plants were always ready to lend a helping hand at the bellows and to stir the fire  such spirits as he had in the outset paul soon lost of course but he retained all that was strange and old and thoughtful in his character and under circumstances so favourable to the development of those tendencies became even more strange and old and thoughtful than before  the only difference was that he kept his character to himself he grew more thoughtful and reserved every day and had no such curiosity in any living member of the doctors household as he had had in mrs pipchin he loved to be alone and in those short intervals when he was not occupied with his books liked nothing so well as wandering about the house by himself or sitting on the stairs listening to the great clock in the hall he was intimate with all the paperhanging in the house saw things that no one else saw in the patterns found out miniature tigers and lions running up the bedroom walls and squinting faces leering in the squares and diamonds of the floorcloth  the solitary child lived on surrounded by this arabesque work of his musing fancy and no one understood him mrs blimber thought him odd and sometimes the servants said among themselves that little dombey moped but that was all  unless young toots had some idea on the subject to the expression of which he was wholly unequal ideas like ghosts according to the common notion of ghosts must be spoken to a little before they will explain themselves and toots had long left off asking any questions of his own mind some mist there may have been issuing from that leaden casket his cranium which if it could have taken shape and form would have become a genie but it could not and it only so far followed the example of the smoke in the arabian story as to roll out in a thick cloud and there hang and hover but it left a little figure visible upon a lonely shore and toots was always staring at it  how are you he would say to paul fifty times a day quite well sir thank you paul would answer shake hands would be tootss next advance  which paul of course would immediately do mr toots generally said again after a long interval of staring and hard breathing how are you to which paul again replied quite well sir thank you  one evening mr toots was sitting at his desk oppressed by correspondence when a great purpose seemed to flash upon him he laid down his pen and went off to seek paul whom he found at last after a long search looking through the window of his little bedroom  i say cried toots speaking the moment he entered the room lest he should forget it what do you think about  oh i think about a great many things replied paul  do you though said toots appearing to consider that fact in itself surprising if you had to die said paul looking up into his facemr toots started and seemed much disturbed  dont you think you would rather die on a moonlight night when the sky was quite clear and the wind blowing as it did last night  mr toots said looking doubtfully at paul and shaking his head that he didnt know about that  not blowing at least said paul but sounding in the air like the sea sounds in the shells it was a beautiful night when i had listened to the water for a long time i got up and looked out there was a boat over there in the full light of the moon a boat with a sail  the child looked at him so steadfastly and spoke so earnestly that mr toots feeling himself called upon to say something about this boat said smugglers but with an impartial remembrance of there being two sides to every question he added or preventive  a boat with a sail repeated paul in the full light of the moon the sail like an arm all silver it went away into the distance and what do you think it seemed to do as it moved with the waves  pitch said mr toots  it seemed to beckon said the child to beckon me to comethere she is there she is  toots was almost beside himself with dismay at this sudden exclamation after what had gone before and cried who  my sister florence cried paul looking up here and waving her hand she sees meshe sees me goodnight dear goodnight goodnight  his quick transition to a state of unbounded pleasure as he stood at his window kissing and clapping his hands and the way in which the light retreated from his features as she passed out of his view and left a patient melancholy on the little face were too remarkable wholly to escape even tootss notice their interview being interrupted at this moment by a visit from mrs pipchin who usually brought her black skirts to bear upon paul just before dusk once or twice a week toots had no opportunity of improving the occasion but it left so marked an impression on his mind that he twice returned after having exchanged the usual salutations to ask mrs pipchin how she did this the irascible old lady conceived to be a deeply devised and longmeditated insult originating in the diabolical invention of the weakeyed young man downstairs against whom she accordingly lodged a formal complaint with doctor blimber that very night who mentioned to the young man that if he ever did it again he should be obliged to part with him  the evenings being longer now paul stole up to his window every evening to look out for florence she always passed and repassed at a certain time until she saw him and their mutual recognition was a gleam of sunshine in pauls daily life often after dark one other figure walked alone before the doctors house he rarely joined them on the saturdays now he could not bear it he would rather come unrecognised and look up at the windows where his son was qualifying for a man and wait and watch and plan and hope  oh could he but have seen or seen as others did the slight spare boy above watching the waves and clouds at twilight with his earnest eyes and breasting the window of his solitary cage when birds flew by as if he would have emulated them and soared away    chapter 13 shipping intelligence and office business   mr dombeys offices were in a court where there was an oldestablished stall of choice fruit at the corner where perambulating merchants of both sexes offered for sale at any time between the hours of ten and five slippers pocketbooks sponges dogs collars and windsor soap and sometimes a pointer or an oilpainting  the pointer always came that way with a view to the stock exchange where a sporting taste originating generally in bets of new hats is much in vogue the other commodities were addressed to the general public but they were never offered by the vendors to mr dombey when he appeared the dealers in those wares fell off respectfully the principal slipper and dogs collar manwho considered himself a public character and whose portrait was screwed on to an artists door in cheapsidethrew up his forefinger to the brim of his hat as mr dombey went by the ticketporter if he were not absent on a job always ran officiously before to open mr dombeys office door as wide as possible and hold it open with his hat off while he entered  the clerks within were not a whit behindhand in their demonstrations of respect a solemn hush prevailed as mr dombey passed through the outer office the wit of the countinghouse became in a moment as mute as the row of leathern firebuckets hanging up behind him such vapid and flat daylight as filtered through the groundglass windows and skylights leaving a black sediment upon the panes showed the books and papers and the figures bending over them enveloped in a studious gloom and as much abstracted in appearance from the world without as if they were assembled at the bottom of the sea while a mouldy little strong room in the obscure perspective where a shaded lamp was always burning might have represented the cavern of some ocean monster looking on with a red eye at these mysteries of the deep  when perch the messenger whose place was on a little bracket like a timepiece saw mr dombey come inor rather when he felt that he was coming for he had usually an instinctive sense of his approachhe hurried into mr dombeys room stirred the fire carried fresh coals from the bowels of the coalbox hung the newspaper to air upon the fender put the chair ready and the screen in its place and was round upon his heel on the instant of mr dombeys entrance to take his greatcoat and hat and hang them up then perch took the newspaper and gave it a turn or two in his hands before the fire and laid it deferentially at mr dombeys elbow and so little objection had perch to being deferential in the last degree that if he might have laid himself at mr dombeys feet or might have called him by some such title as used to be bestowed upon the caliph haroun alraschid he would have been all the better pleased  as this honour would have been an innovation and an experiment perch was fain to content himself by expressing as well as he could in his manner you are the light of my eyes you are the breath of my soul you are the commander of the faithful perch with this imperfect happiness to cheer him he would shut the door softly walk away on tiptoe and leave his great chief to be stared at through a domeshaped window in the leads by ugly chimneypots and backs of houses and especially by the bold window of a haircutting saloon on a first floor where a waxen effigy bald as a mussulman in the morning and covered after eleven oclock in the day with luxuriant hair and whiskers in the latest christian fashion showed him the wrong side of its head for ever  between mr dombey and the common world as it was accessible through the medium of the outer officeto which mr dombeys presence in his own room may be said to have struck like damp or cold airthere were two degrees of descent mr carker in his own office was the first step mr morfin in his own office was the second each of these gentlemen occupied a little chamber like a bathroom opening from the passage outside mr dombeys door mr carker as grand vizier inhabited the room that was nearest to the sultan mr morfin as an officer of inferior state inhabited the room that was nearest to the clerks  the gentleman last mentioned was a cheerfullooking hazeleyed elderly bachelor gravely attired as to his upper man in black and as to his legs in pepperandsalt colour his dark hair was just touched here and there with specks of gray as though the tread of time had splashed it and his whiskers were already white he had a mighty respect for mr dombey and rendered him due homage but as he was of a genial temper himself and never wholly at his ease in that stately presence he was disquieted by no jealousy of the many conferences enjoyed by mr carker and felt a secret satisfaction in having duties to discharge which rarely exposed him to be singled out for such distinction he was a great musical amateur in his wayafter business and had a paternal affection for his violoncello which was once in every week transported from islington his place of abode to a certain clubroom hard by the bank where quartettes of the most tormenting and excruciating nature were executed every wednesday evening by a private party  mr carker was a gentleman thirtyeight or forty years old of a florid complexion and with two unbroken rows of glistening teeth whose regularity and whiteness were quite distressing it was impossible to escape the observation of them for he showed them whenever he spoke and bore so wide a smile upon his countenance a smile however very rarely indeed extending beyond his mouth that there was something in it like the snarl of a cat he affected a stiff white cravat after the example of his principal and was always closely buttoned up and tightly dressed his manner towards mr dombey was deeply conceived and perfectly expressed he was familiar with him in the very extremity of his sense of the distance between them mr dombey to a man in your position from a man in mine there is no show of subservience compatible with the transaction of business between us that i should think sufficient i frankly tell you sir i give it up altogether i feel that i could not satisfy my own mind and heaven knows mr dombey you can afford to dispense with the endeavour if he had carried these words about with him printed on a placard and had constantly offered it to mr dombeys perusal on the breast of his coat he could not have been more explicit than he was  this was carker the manager mr carker the junior walters friend was his brother two or three years older than he but widely removed in station the younger brothers post was on the top of the official ladder the elder brothers at the bottom the elder brother never gained a stave or raised his foot to mount one young men passed above his head and rose and rose but he was always at the bottom he was quite resigned to occupy that low condition never complained of it and certainly never hoped to escape from it  how do you do this morning said mr carker the manager entering mr dombeys room soon after his arrival one day with a bundle of papers in his hand  how do you do carker said mr dombey  coolish observed carker stirring the fire  rather said mr dombey  any news of the young gentleman who is so important to us all asked carker with his whole regiment of teeth on parade  yesnot direct newsi hear hes very well said mr dombey who had come from brighton overnight but no one knew it  very well and becoming a great scholar no doubt observed the manager  i hope so returned mr dombey  egad said mr carker shaking his head time flies  i think so sometimes returned mr dombey glancing at his newspaper  oh you you have no reason to think so observed carker one who sits on such an elevation as yours and can sit there unmoved in all seasonshasnt much reason to know anything about the flight of time its men like myself who are low down and are not superior in circumstances and who inherit new masters in the course of time that have cause to look about us i shall have a rising sun to worship soon  time enough time enough carker said mr dombey rising from his chair and standing with his back to the fire have you anything there for me  i dont know that i need trouble you returned carker turning over the papers in his hand you have a committee today at three you know  and one at three threequarters added mr dombey  catch you forgetting anything exclaimed carker still turning over his papers if mr paul inherits your memory hell be a troublesome customer in the house one of you is enough  you have an accurate memory of your own said mr dombey  oh i returned the manager its the only capital of a man like me  mr dombey did not look less pompous or at all displeased as he stood leaning against the chimneypiece surveying his of course unconscious clerk from head to foot the stiffness and nicety of mr carkers dress and a certain arrogance of manner either natural to him or imitated from a pattern not far off gave great additional effect to his humility he seemed a man who would contend against the power that vanquished him if he could but who was utterly borne down by the greatness and superiority of mr dombey  is morfin here asked mr dombey after a short pause during which mr carker had been fluttering his papers and muttering little abstracts of their contents to himself  morfins here he answered looking up with his widest and almost sudden smile humming musical recollectionsof his last nights quartette party i supposethrough the walls between us and driving me half mad i wish hed make a bonfire of his violoncello and burn his musicbooks in it  you respect nobody carker i think said mr dombey  no inquired carker with another wide and most feline show of his teeth well not many people i believe i wouldnt answer perhaps he murmured as if he were only thinking it for more than one  a dangerous quality if real and a not less dangerous one if feigned but mr dombey hardly seemed to think so as he still stood with his back to the fire drawn up to his full height and looking at his headclerk with a dignified composure in which there seemed to lurk a stronger latent sense of power than usual  talking of morfin resumed mr carker taking out one paper from the rest he reports a junior dead in the agency at barbados and proposes to reserve a passage in the son and heirshell sail in a month or sofor the successor you dont care who goes i suppose we have nobody of that sort here  mr dombey shook his head with supreme indifference  its no very precious appointment observed mr carker taking up a pen with which to endorse a memorandum on the back of the paper i hope he may bestow it on some orphan nephew of a musical friend it may perhaps stop his fiddleplaying if he has a gift that way whos that come in  i beg your pardon mr carker i didnt know you were here sir answered walter appearing with some letters in his hand unopened and newly arrived mr carker the junior sir  at the mention of this name mr carker the manager was or affected to be touched to the quick with shame and humiliation he cast his eyes full on mr dombey with an altered and apologetic look abased them on the ground and remained for a moment without speaking  i thought sir he said suddenly and angrily turning on walter that you had been before requested not to drag mr carker the junior into your conversation  i beg your pardon returned walter i was only going to say that mr carker the junior had told me he believed you were gone out or i should not have knocked at the door when you were engaged with mr dombey these are letters for mr dombey sir  very well sir returned mr carker the manager plucking them sharply from his hand go about your business  but in taking them with so little ceremony mr carker dropped one on the floor and did not see what he had done neither did mr dombey observe the letter lying near his feet walter hesitated for a moment thinking that one or other of them would notice it but finding that neither did he stopped came back picked it up and laid it himself on mr dombeys desk the letters were postletters and it happened that the one in question was mrs pipchins regular report directed as usualfor mrs pipchin was but an indifferent penwomanby florence mr dombey having his attention silently called to this letter by walter started and looked fiercely at him as if he believed that he had purposely selected it from all the rest  you can leave the room sir said mr dombey haughtily  he crushed the letter in his hand and having watched walter out at the door put it in his pocket without breaking the seal  these continual references to mr carker the junior mr carker the manager began as soon as they were alone are to a man in my position uttered before one in yours so unspeakably distressing  nonsense carker mr dombey interrupted you are too sensitive  i am sensitive he returned if one in your position could by any possibility imagine yourself in my place which you cannot you would be so too  as mr dombeys thoughts were evidently pursuing some other subject his discreet ally broke off here and stood with his teeth ready to present to him when he should look up  you want somebody to send to the west indies you were saying observed mr dombey hurriedly  yes replied carker  send young gay  good very good indeed nothing easier said mr carker without any show of surprise and taking up the pen to reendorse the letter as coolly as he had done before send young gay  call him back said mr dombey  mr carker was quick to do so and walter was quick to return  gay said mr dombey turning a little to look at him over his shoulder here is a  an opening said mr carker with his mouth stretched to the utmost  in the west indies at barbados i am going to send you said mr dombey scorning to embellish the bare truth to fill a junior situation in the countinghouse at barbados let your uncle know from me that i have chosen you to go to the west indies  walters breath was so completely taken away by his astonishment that he could hardly find enough for the repetition of the words west indies  somebody must go said mr dombey and you are young and healthy and your uncles circumstances are not good tell your uncle that you are appointed you will not go yet there will be an interval of a monthor two perhaps  shall i remain there sir inquired walter  will you remain there sir repeated mr dombey turning a little more round towards him what do you mean what does he mean carker  live there sir faltered walter  certainly returned mr dombey  walter bowed  thats all said mr dombey resuming his letters you will explain to him in good time about the usual outfit and so forth carker of course he neednt wait carker  you neednt wait gay observed mr carker bare to the gums  unless said mr dombey stopping in his reading without looking off the letter and seeming to listen unless he has anything to say  no sir returned walter agitated and confused and almost stunned as an infinite variety of pictures presented themselves to his mind among which captain cuttle in his glazed hat transfixed with astonishment at mrs macstingers and his uncle bemoaning his loss in the little back parlour held prominent places i hardly knowii am much obliged sir  he neednt wait carker said mr dombey  and as mr carker again echoed the words and also collected his papers as if he were going away too walter felt that his lingering any longer would be an unpardonable intrusionespecially as he had nothing to sayand therefore walked out quite confounded  going along the passage with the mingled consciousness and helplessness of a dream he heard mr dombeys door shut again as mr carker came out and immediately afterwards that gentleman called to him  bring your friend mr carker the junior to my room sir if you please  walter went to the outer office and apprised mr carker the junior of his errand who accordingly came out from behind a partition where he sat alone in one corner and returned with him to the room of mr carker the manager  that gentleman was standing with his back to the fire and his hands under his coattails looking over his white cravat as unpromisingly as mr dombey himself could have looked he received them without any change in his attitude or softening of his harsh and black expression merely signing to walter to close the door  john carker said the manager when this was done turning suddenly upon his brother with his two rows of teeth bristling as if he would have bitten him what is the league between you and this young man in virtue of which i am haunted and hunted by the mention of your name is it not enough for you john carker that i am your near relation and cant detach myself from that  say disgrace james interposed the other in a low voice finding that he stammered for a word you mean it and have reason say disgrace  from that disgrace assented his brother with keen emphasis but is the fact to be blurted out and trumpeted and proclaimed continually in the presence of the very house in moments of confidence too do you think your name is calculated to harmonise in this place with trust and confidence john carker  no returned the other no james god knows i have no such thought  what is your thought then said his brother and why do you thrust yourself in my way havent you injured me enough already  i have never injured you james wilfully  you are my brother said the manager thats injury enough  i wish i could undo it james  i wish you could and would  during this conversation walter had looked from one brother to the other with pain and amazement he who was the senior in years and junior in the house stood with his eyes cast upon the ground and his head bowed humbly listening to the reproaches of the other though these were rendered very bitter by the tone and look with which they were accompanied and by the presence of walter whom they so much surprised and shocked he entered no other protest against them than by slightly raising his right hand in a deprecatory manner as if he would have said spare me so had they been blows and he a brave man under strong constraint and weakened by bodily suffering he might have stood before the executioner  generous and quick in all his emotions and regarding himself as the innocent occasion of these taunts walter now struck in with all the earnestness he felt  mr carker he said addressing himself to the manager indeed indeed this is my fault solely in a kind of heedlessness for which i cannot blame myself enough i have i have no doubt mentioned mr carker the junior much oftener than was necessary and have allowed his name sometimes to slip through my lips when it was against your expressed wish but it has been my own mistake sir we have never exchanged one word upon the subjectvery few indeed on any subject and it has not been added walter after a moments pause all heedlessness on my part sir for i have felt an interest in mr carker ever since i have been here and have hardly been able to help speaking of him sometimes when i have thought of him so much  walter said this from his soul and with the very breath of honour for he looked upon the bowed head and the downcast eyes and upraised hand and thought i have felt it and why should i not avow it in behalf of this unfriended broken man  mr carker the manager looked at him as he spoke and when he had finished speaking with a smile that seemed to divide his face into two parts  you are an excitable youth gay he said and should endeavour to cool down a little now for it would be unwise to encourage feverish predispositions be as cool as you can gay be as cool as you can you might have asked mr john carker himself if you have not done so whether he claims to be or is an object of such strong interest  james do me justice said his brother i have claimed nothing and i claim nothing believe me on my  honour said his brother with another smile as he warmed himself before the fire  on my meon my fallen life returned the other in the same low voice but with a deeper stress on his words than he had yet seemed capable of giving them believe me i have held myself aloof and kept alone this has been unsought by me i have avoided him and everyone  indeed you have avoided me mr carker said walter with the tears rising to his eyes so true was his compassion i know it to my disappointment and regret when i first came here and ever since i am sure i have tried to be as much your friend as one of my age could presume to be but it has been of no use  and observe said the manager taking him up quickly it will be of still less use gay if you persist in forcing mr john carkers name on peoples attention that is not the way to befriend mr john carker ask him if he thinks it is  it is no service to me said the brother it only leads to such a conversation as the present which i need not say i could have well spared no one can be a better friend to me he spoke here very distinctly as if he would impress it upon walter than in forgetting me and leaving me to go my way unquestioned and unnoticed  your memory not being retentive gay of what you are told by others said mr carker the manager warming himself with great and increased satisfaction i thought it well that you should be told this from the best authority nodding towards his brother you are not likely to forget it now i hope thats all gay you can go  walter passed out at the door and was about to close it after him when hearing the voices of the brothers again and also the mention of his own name he stood irresolutely with his hand upon the lock and the door ajar uncertain whether to return or go away in this position he could not help overhearing what followed  think of me more leniently if you can james said john carker when i tell you i have hadhow could i help having with my history written herestriking himself upon the breastmy whole heart awakened by my observation of that boy walter gay i saw in him when he first came here almost my other self  your other self repeated the manager disdainfully  not as i am but as i was when i first came here too as sanguine giddy youthful inexperienced flushed with the same restless and adventurous fancies and full of the same qualities fraught with the same capacity of leading on to good or evil  i hope not said his brother with some hidden and sarcastic meaning in his tone  you strike me sharply and your hand is steady and your thrust is very deep returned the other speaking or so walter thought as if some cruel weapon actually stabbed him as he spoke i imagined all this when he was a boy i believed it it was a truth to me i saw him lightly walking on the edge of an unseen gulf where so many others walk with equal gaiety and from which  the old excuse interrupted his brother as he stirred the fire so many go on say so many fall  from which one traveller fell returned the other who set forward on his way a boy like him and missed his footing more and more and slipped a little and a little lower and went on stumbling still until he fell headlong and found himself below a shattered man think what i suffered when i watched that boy  you have only yourself to thank for it returned the brother  only myself he assented with a sigh i dont seek to divide the blame or shame  you have divided the shame james carker muttered through his teeth and through so many and such close teeth he could mutter well  ah james returned his brother speaking for the first time in an accent of reproach and seeming by the sound of his voice to have covered his face with his hands i have been since then a useful foil to you you have trodden on me freely in your climbing up dont spurn me with your heel  a silence ensued after a time mr carker the manager was heard rustling among his papers as if he had resolved to bring the interview to a conclusion at the same time his brother withdrew nearer to the door  thats all he said i watched him with such trembling and such fear as was some little punishment to me until he passed the place where i first fell and then though i had been his father i believe i never could have thanked god more devoutly i didnt dare to warn him and advise him but if i had seen direct cause i would have shown him my example i was afraid to be seen speaking with him lest it should be thought i did him harm and tempted him to evil and corrupted him or lest i really should there may be such contagion in me i dont know piece out my history in connexion with young walter gay and what he has made me feel and think of me more leniently james if you can  with these words he came out to where walter was standing he turned a little paler when he saw him there and paler yet when walter caught him by the hand and said in a whisper  mr carker pray let me thank you let me say how much i feel for you how sorry i am to have been the unhappy cause of all this how i almost look upon you now as my protector and guardian how very very much i feel obliged to you and pity you said walter squeezing both his hands and hardly knowing in his agitation what he did or said  mr morfins room being close at hand and empty and the door wide open they moved thither by one accord the passage being seldom free from someone passing to or fro when they were there and walter saw in mr carkers face some traces of the emotion within he almost felt as if he had never seen the face before it was so greatly changed  walter he said laying his hand on his shoulder i am far removed from you and may i ever be do you know what i am  what you are appeared to hang on walters lips as he regarded him attentively  it was begun said carker before my twentyfirst birthdayled up to long before but not begun till near that time i had robbed them when i came of age i robbed them afterwards before my twentysecond birthday it was all found out and then walter from all mens society i died  again his last few words hung trembling upon walters lips but he could neither utter them nor any of his own  the house was very good to me may heaven reward the old man for his forbearance this one too his son who was then newly in the firm where i had held great trust i was called into that room which is now hisi have never entered it sinceand came out what you know me for many years i sat in my present seat alone as now but then a known and recognised example to the rest they were all merciful to me and i lived time has altered that part of my poor expiation and i think except the three heads of the house there is no one here who knows my story rightly before the little boy grows up and has it told to him my corner may be vacant i would rather that it might be so this is the only change to me since that day when i left all youth and hope and good mens company behind me in that room god bless you walter keep you and all dear to you in honesty or strike them dead  some recollection of his trembling from head to foot as if with excessive cold and of his bursting into tears was all that walter could add to this when he tried to recall exactly what had passed between them  when walter saw him next he was bending over his desk in his old silent drooping humbled way then observing him at his work and feeling how resolved he evidently was that no further intercourse should arise between them and thinking again and again on all he had seen and heard that morning in so short a time in connexion with the history of both the carkers walter could hardly believe that he was under orders for the west indies and would soon be lost to uncle sol and captain cuttle and to glimpses few and far between of florence dombeyno he meant pauland to all he loved and liked and looked for in his daily life  but it was true and the news had already penetrated to the outer office for while he sat with a heavy heart pondering on these things and resting his head upon his arm perch the messenger descending from his mahogany bracket and jogging his elbow begged his pardon but wished to say in his ear did he think he could arrange to send home to england a jar of preserved ginger cheap for mrs perchs own eating in the course of her recovery from her next confinement    chapter 14 paul grows more and more oldfashioned and goes home for the holidays   when the midsummer vacation approached no indecent manifestations of joy were exhibited by the leadeneyed young gentlemen assembled at doctor blimbers any such violent expression as breaking up would have been quite inapplicable to that polite establishment the young gentlemen oozed away semiannually to their own homes but they never broke up they would have scorned the action  tozer who was constantly galled and tormented by a starched white cambric neckerchief which he wore at the express desire of mrs tozer his parent who designing him for the church was of opinion that he couldnt be in that forward state of preparation too soontozer said indeed that choosing between two evils he thought he would rather stay where he was than go home however inconsistent this declaration might appear with that passage in tozers essay on the subject wherein he had observed that the thoughts of home and all its recollections awakened in his mind the most pleasing emotions of anticipation and delight and had also likened himself to a roman general flushed with a recent victory over the iceni or laden with carthaginian spoil advancing within a few hours march of the capitol presupposed for the purposes of the simile to be the dwellingplace of mrs tozer still it was very sincerely made for it seemed that tozer had a dreadful uncle who not only volunteered examinations of him in the holidays on abstruse points but twisted innocent events and things and wrenched them to the same fell purpose so that if this uncle took him to the play or on a similar pretence of kindness carried him to see a giant or a dwarf or a conjuror or anything tozer knew he had read up some classical allusion to the subject beforehand and was thrown into a state of mortal apprehension not foreseeing where he might break out or what authority he might not quote against him  as to briggs his father made no show of artifice about it he never would leave him alone so numerous and severe were the mental trials of that unfortunate youth in vacation time that the friends of the family then resident near bayswater london seldom approached the ornamental piece of water in kensington gardens without a vague expectation of seeing master briggss hat floating on the surface and an unfinished exercise lying on the bank briggs therefore was not at all sanguine on the subject of holidays and these two sharers of little pauls bedroom were so fair a sample of the young gentlemen in general that the most elastic among them contemplated the arrival of those festive periods with genteel resignation  it was far otherwise with little paul the end of these first holidays was to witness his separation from florence but who ever looked forward to the end of holidays whose beginning was not yet come not paul assuredly as the happy time drew near the lions and tigers climbing up the bedroom walls became quite tame and frolicsome the grim sly faces in the squares and diamonds of the floorcloth relaxed and peeped out at him with less wicked eyes the grave old clock had more of personal interest in the tone of its formal inquiry and the restless sea went rolling on all night to the sounding of a melancholy strainyet it was pleasant toothat rose and fell with the waves and rocked him as it were to sleep  mr feeder ba seemed to think that he too would enjoy the holidays very much mr toots projected a life of holidays from that time forth for as he regularly informed paul every day it was his last half at doctor blimbers and he was going to begin to come into his property directly  it was perfectly understood between paul and mr toots that they were intimate friends notwithstanding their distance in point of years and station as the vacation approached and mr toots breathed harder and stared oftener in pauls society than he had done before paul knew that he meant he was sorry they were going to lose sight of each other and felt very much obliged to him for his patronage and good opinion  it was even understood by doctor blimber mrs blimber and miss blimber as well as by the young gentlemen in general that toots had somehow constituted himself protector and guardian of dombey and the circumstance became so notorious even to mrs pipchin that the good old creature cherished feelings of bitterness and jealousy against toots and in the sanctuary of her own home repeatedly denounced him as a chuckleheaded noodle whereas the innocent toots had no more idea of awakening mrs pipchins wrath than he had of any other definite possibility or proposition on the contrary he was disposed to consider her rather a remarkable character with many points of interest about her for this reason he smiled on her with so much urbanity and asked her how she did so often in the course of her visits to little paul that at last she one night told him plainly she wasnt used to it whatever he might think and she could not and she would not bear it either from himself or any other puppy then existing at which unexpected acknowledgment of his civilities mr toots was so alarmed that he secreted himself in a retired spot until she had gone nor did he ever again face the doughty mrs pipchin under doctor blimbers roof  they were within two or three weeks of the holidays when one day cornelia blimber called paul into her room and said dombey i am going to send home your analysis  thank you maam returned paul  you know what i mean do you dombey inquired miss blimber looking hard at him through the spectacles  no maam said paul  dombey dombey said miss blimber i begin to be afraid you are a sad boy when you dont know the meaning of an expression why dont you seek for information  mrs pipchin told me i wasnt to ask questions returned paul  i must beg you not to mention mrs pipchin to me on any account dombey returned miss blimber i couldnt think of allowing it the course of study here is very far removed from anything of that sort a repetition of such allusions would make it necessary for me to request to hear without a mistake before breakfasttime tomorrow morning from verbum personale down to simillimia cygno  i didnt mean maam began little paul  i must trouble you not to tell me that you didnt mean if you please dombey said miss blimber who preserved an awful politeness in her admonitions that is a line of argument i couldnt dream of permitting  paul felt it safest to say nothing at all so he only looked at miss blimbers spectacles miss blimber having shaken her head at him gravely referred to a paper lying before her  analysis of the character of p dombey if my recollection serves me said miss blimber breaking off the word analysis as opposed to synthesis is thus defined by walker the resolution of an object whether of the senses or of the intellect into its first elements as opposed to synthesis you observe now you know what analysis is dombey  dombey didnt seem to be absolutely blinded by the light let in upon his intellect but he made miss blimber a little bow  analysis resumed miss blimber casting her eye over the paper of the character of p dombey i find that the natural capacity of dombey is extremely good and that his general disposition to study may be stated in an equal ratio thus taking eight as our standard and highest number i find these qualities in dombey stated each at six threefourths  miss blimber paused to see how paul received this news being undecided whether six threefourths meant six pounds fifteen or sixpence three farthings or six foot three or three quarters past six or six somethings that he hadnt learnt yet with three unknown something elses over paul rubbed his hands and looked straight at miss blimber it happened to answer as well as anything else he could have done and cornelia proceeded  violence two selfishness two inclination to low company as evinced in the case of a person named glubb originally seven but since reduced gentlemanly demeanour four and improving with advancing years now what i particularly wish to call your attention to dombey is the general observation at the close of this analysis  paul set himself to follow it with great care  it may be generally observed of dombey said miss blimber reading in a loud voice and at every second word directing her spectacles towards the little figure before her that his abilities and inclinations are good and that he has made as much progress as under the circumstances could have been expected but it is to be lamented of this young gentleman that he is singular what is usually termed oldfashioned in his character and conduct and that without presenting anything in either which distinctly calls for reprobation he is often very unlike other young gentlemen of his age and social position now dombey said miss blimber laying down the paper do you understand that  i think i do maam said paul  this analysis you see dombey miss blimber continued is going to be sent home to your respected parent it will naturally be very painful to him to find that you are singular in your character and conduct it is naturally painful to us for we cant like you you know dombey as well as we could wish  she touched the child upon a tender point he had secretly become more and more solicitous from day to day as the time of his departure drew more near that all the house should like him from some hidden reason very imperfectly understood by himselfif understood at allhe felt a gradually increasing impulse of affection towards almost everything and everybody in the place he could not bear to think that they would be quite indifferent to him when he was gone he wanted them to remember him kindly and he had made it his business even to conciliate a great hoarse shaggy dog chained up at the back of the house who had previously been the terror of his life that even he might miss him when he was no longer there  little thinking that in this he only showed again the difference between himself and his compeers poor tiny paul set it forth to miss blimber as well as he could and begged her in despite of the official analysis to have the goodness to try and like him to mrs blimber who had joined them he preferred the same petition and when that lady could not forbear even in his presence from giving utterance to her oftenrepeated opinion that he was an odd child paul told her that he was sure she was quite right that he thought it must be his bones but he didnt know and that he hoped she would overlook it for he was fond of them all  not so fond said paul with a mixture of timidity and perfect frankness which was one of the most peculiar and most engaging qualities of the child not so fond as i am of florence of course that could never be you couldnt expect that could you maam  oh the oldfashioned little soul cried mrs blimber in a whisper  but i like everybody here very much pursued paul and i should grieve to go away and think that anyone was glad that i was gone or didnt care  mrs blimber was now quite sure that paul was the oddest child in the world and when she told the doctor what had passed the doctor did not controvert his wifes opinion but he said as he had said before when paul first came that study would do much and he also said as he had said on that occasion bring him on cornelia bring him on  cornelia had always brought him on as vigorously as she could and paul had had a hard life of it but over and above the getting through his tasks he had long had another purpose always present to him and to which he still held fast it was to be a gentle useful quiet little fellow always striving to secure the love and attachment of the rest and though he was yet often to be seen at his old post on the stairs or watching the waves and clouds from his solitary window he was oftener found too among the other boys modestly rendering them some little voluntary service thus it came to pass that even among those rigid and absorbed young anchorites who mortified themselves beneath the roof of doctor blimber paul was an object of general interest a fragile little plaything that they all liked and that no one would have thought of treating roughly but he could not change his nature or rewrite the analysis and so they all agreed that dombey was oldfashioned  there were some immunities however attaching to the character enjoyed by no one else they could have better spared a newerfashioned child and that alone was much when the others only bowed to doctor blimber and family on retiring for the night paul would stretch out his morsel of a hand and boldly shake the doctors also mrs blimbers also cornelias if anybody was to be begged off from impending punishment paul was always the delegate the weakeyed young man himself had once consulted him in reference to a little breakage of glass and china and it was darkly rumoured that the butler regarding him with favour such as that stern man had never shown before to mortal boy had sometimes mingled porter with his tablebeer to make him strong  over and above these extensive privileges paul had free right of entry to mr feeders room from which apartment he had twice led mr toots into the open air in a state of faintness consequent on an unsuccessful attempt to smoke a very blunt cigar one of a bundle which that young gentleman had covertly purchased on the shingle from a most desperate smuggler who had acknowledged in confidence that two hundred pounds was the price set upon his head dead or alive by the custom house it was a snug room mr feeders with his bed in another little room inside of it and a flute which mr feeder couldnt play yet but was going to make a point of learning he said hanging up over the fireplace there were some books in it too and a fishingrod for mr feeder said he should certainly make a point of learning to fish when he could find time mr feeder had amassed with similar intentions a beautiful little curly secondhand keybugle a chessboard and men a spanish grammar a set of sketching materials and a pair of boxinggloves the art of selfdefence mr feeder said he should undoubtedly make a point of learning as he considered it the duty of every man to do for it might lead to the protection of a female in distress but mr feeders great possession was a large green jar of snuff which mr toots had brought down as a present at the close of the last vacation and for which he had paid a high price having been the genuine property of the prince regent neither mr toots nor mr feeder could partake of this or any other snuff even in the most stinted and moderate degree without being seized with convulsions of sneezing nevertheless it was their great delight to moisten a boxfull with cold tea stir it up on a piece of parchment with a paperknife and devote themselves to its consumption then and there in the course of which cramming of their noses they endured surprising torments with the constancy of martyrs and drinking tablebeer at intervals felt all the glories of dissipation  to little paul sitting silent in their company and by the side of his chief patron mr toots there was a dread charm in these reckless occasions and when mr feeder spoke of the dark mysteries of london and told mr toots that he was going to observe it himself closely in all its ramifications in the approaching holidays and for that purpose had made arrangements to board with two old maiden ladies at peckham paul regarded him as if he were the hero of some book of travels or wild adventure and was almost afraid of such a slashing person  going into this room one evening when the holidays were very near paul found mr feeder filling up the blanks in some printed letters while some others already filled up and strewn before him were being folded and sealed by mr toots mr feeder said aha dombey there you are are youfor they were always kind to him and glad to see himand then said tossing one of the letters towards him and there you are too dombey thats yours  mine sir said paul  your invitation returned mr feeder  paul looking at it found in copperplate print with the exception of his own name and the date which were in mr feeders penmanship that doctor and mrs blimber requested the pleasure of mr p dombeys company at an early party on wednesday evening the seventeenth instant and that the hour was halfpast seven oclock and that the object was quadrilles mr toots also showed him by holding up a companion sheet of paper that doctor and mrs blimber requested the pleasure of mr tootss company at an early party on wednesday evening the seventeenth instant when the hour was halfpast seven oclock and when the object was quadrilles he also found on glancing at the table where mr feeder sat that the pleasure of mr briggss company and of mr tozers company and of every young gentlemans company was requested by doctor and mrs blimber on the same genteel occasion  mr feeder then told him to his great joy that his sister was invited and that it was a halfyearly event and that as the holidays began that day he could go away with his sister after the party if he liked which paul interrupted him to say he would like very much mr feeder then gave him to understand that he would be expected to inform doctor and mrs blimber in superfine smallhand that mr p dombey would be happy to have the honour of waiting on them in accordance with their polite invitation lastly mr feeder said he had better not refer to the festive occasion in the hearing of doctor and mrs blimber as these preliminaries and the whole of the arrangements were conducted on principles of classicality and high breeding and that doctor and mrs blimber on the one hand and the young gentlemen on the other were supposed in their scholastic capacities not to have the least idea of what was in the wind  paul thanked mr feeder for these hints and pocketing his invitation sat down on a stool by the side of mr toots as usual but pauls head which had long been ailing more or less and was sometimes very heavy and painful felt so uneasy that night that he was obliged to support it on his hand and yet it dropped so that by little and little it sunk on mr tootss knee and rested there as if it had no care to be ever lifted up again  that was no reason why he should be deaf but he must have been he thought for by and by he heard mr feeder calling in his ear and gently shaking him to rouse his attention and when he raised his head quite scared and looked about him he found that doctor blimber had come into the room and that the window was open and that his forehead was wet with sprinkled water though how all this had been done without his knowledge was very curious indeed  ah come come thats well how is my little friend now said doctor blimber encouragingly  oh quite well thank you sir said paul  but there seemed to be something the matter with the floor for he couldnt stand upon it steadily and with the walls too for they were inclined to turn round and round and could only be stopped by being looked at very hard indeed mr tootss head had the appearance of being at once bigger and farther off than was quite natural and when he took paul in his arms to carry him upstairs paul observed with astonishment that the door was in quite a different place from that in which he had expected to find it and almost thought at first that mr toots was going to walk straight up the chimney  it was very kind of mr toots to carry him to the top of the house so tenderly and paul told him that it was but mr toots said he would do a great deal more than that if he could and indeed he did more as it was for he helped paul to undress and helped him to bed in the kindest manner possible and then sat down by the bedside and chuckled very much while mr feeder ba leaning over the bottom of the bedstead set all the little bristles on his head bolt upright with his bony hands and then made believe to spar at paul with great science on account of his being all right again which was so uncommonly facetious and kind too in mr feeder that paul not being able to make up his mind whether it was best to laugh or cry at him did both at once  how mr toots melted away and mr feeder changed into mrs pipchin paul never thought of asking neither was he at all curious to know but when he saw mrs pipchin standing at the bottom of the bed instead of mr feeder he cried out mrs pipchin dont tell florence  dont tell florence what my little paul said mrs pipchin coming round to the bedside and sitting down in the chair  about me said paul  no no said mrs pipchin  what do you think i mean to do when i grow up mrs pipchin inquired paul turning his face towards her on his pillow and resting his chin wistfully on his folded hands  mrs pipchin couldnt guess  i mean said paul to put my money all together in one bank never try to get any more go away into the country with my darling florence have a beautiful garden fields and woods and live there with her all my life  indeed cried mrs pipchin  yes said paul thats what i mean to do when i he stopped and pondered for a moment  mrs pipchins grey eye scanned his thoughtful face  if i grow up said paul then he went on immediately to tell mrs pipchin all about the party about florences invitation about the pride he would have in the admiration that would be felt for her by all the boys about their being so kind to him and fond of him about his being so fond of them and about his being so glad of it then he told mrs pipchin about the analysis and about his being certainly oldfashioned and took mrs pipchins opinion on that point and whether she knew why it was and what it meant mrs pipchin denied the fact altogether as the shortest way of getting out of the difficulty but paul was far from satisfied with that reply and looked so searchingly at mrs pipchin for a truer answer that she was obliged to get up and look out of the window to avoid his eyes  there was a certain calm apothecary who attended at the establishment when any of the young gentlemen were ill and somehow he got into the room and appeared at the bedside with mrs blimber how they came there or how long they had been there paul didnt know but when he saw them he sat up in bed and answered all the apothecarys questions at full length and whispered to him that florence was not to know anything about it if he pleased and that he had set his mind upon her coming to the party he was very chatty with the apothecary and they parted excellent friends lying down again with his eyes shut he heard the apothecary say out of the room and quite a long way offor he dreamed itthat there was a want of vital power what was that paul wondered and great constitutional weakness that as the little fellow had set his heart on parting with his schoolmates on the seventeenth it would be better to indulge the fancy if he grew no worse that he was glad to hear from mrs pipchin that the little fellow would go to his friends in london on the eighteenth that he would write to mr dombey when he should have gained a better knowledge of the case and before that day that there was no immediate cause forwhat paul lost that word and that the little fellow had a fine mind but was an oldfashioned boy  what old fashion could that be paul wondered with a palpitating heart that was so visibly expressed in him so plainly seen by so many people  he could neither make it out nor trouble himself long with the effort mrs pipchin was again beside him if she had ever been away he thought she had gone out with the doctor but it was all a dream perhaps and presently a bottle and glass got into her hands magically and she poured out the contents for him after that he had some real good jelly which mrs blimber brought to him herself and then he was so well that mrs pipchin went home at his urgent solicitation and briggs and tozer came to bed poor briggs grumbled terribly about his own analysis which could hardly have discomposed him more if it had been a chemical process but he was very good to paul and so was tozer and so were all the rest for they every one looked in before going to bed and said how are you now dombey cheer up little dombey and so forth after briggs had got into bed he lay awake for a long time still bemoaning his analysis and saying he knew it was all wrong and they couldnt have analysed a murderer worse andhow would doctor blimber like it if his pocketmoney depended on it it was very easy briggs said to make a galleyslave of a boy all the halfyear and then score him up idle and to crib two dinners aweek out of his board and then score him up greedy but that wasnt going to be submitted to he believed was it oh ah  before the weakeyed young man performed on the gong next morning he came upstairs to paul and told him he was to lie still which paul very gladly did mrs pipchin reappeared a little before the apothecary and a little after the good young woman whom paul had seen cleaning the stove on that first morning how long ago it seemed now had brought him his breakfast there was another consultation a long way off or else paul dreamed it again and then the apothecary coming back with doctor and mrs blimber said  yes i think doctor blimber we may release this young gentleman from his books just now the vacation being so very near at hand  by all means said doctor blimber my love you will inform cornelia if you please  assuredly said mrs blimber  the apothecary bending down looked closely into pauls eyes and felt his head and his pulse and his heart with so much interest and care that paul said thank you sir  our little friend observed doctor blimber has never complained  oh no replied the apothecary he was not likely to complain  you find him greatly better said doctor blimber  oh he is greatly better sir returned the apothecary  paul had begun to speculate in his own odd way on the subject that might occupy the apothecarys mind just at that moment so musingly had he answered the two questions of doctor blimber but the apothecary happening to meet his little patients eyes as the latter set off on that mental expedition and coming instantly out of his abstraction with a cheerful smile paul smiled in return and abandoned it  he lay in bed all that day dozing and dreaming and looking at mr toots but got up on the next and went downstairs lo and behold there was something the matter with the great clock and a workman on a pair of steps had taken its face off and was poking instruments into the works by the light of a candle this was a great event for paul who sat down on the bottom stair and watched the operation attentively now and then glancing at the clock face leaning all askew against the wall hard by and feeling a little confused by a suspicion that it was ogling him  the workman on the steps was very civil and as he said when he observed paul how do you do sir paul got into conversation with him and told him he hadnt been quite well lately the ice being thus broken paul asked him a multitude of questions about chimes and clocks as whether people watched up in the lonely church steeples by night to make them strike and how the bells were rung when people died and whether those were different bells from wedding bells or only sounded dismal in the fancies of the living finding that his new acquaintance was not very well informed on the subject of the curfew bell of ancient days paul gave him an account of that institution and also asked him as a practical man what he thought about king alfreds idea of measuring time by the burning of candles to which the workman replied that he thought it would be the ruin of the clock trade if it was to come up again in fine paul looked on until the clock had quite recovered its familiar aspect and resumed its sedate inquiry when the workman putting away his tools in a long basket bade him good day and went away though not before he had whispered something on the doormat to the footman in which there was the phrase oldfashionedfor paul heard it what could that old fashion be that seemed to make the people sorry what could it be  having nothing to learn now he thought of this frequently though not so often as he might have done if he had had fewer things to think of but he had a great many and was always thinking all day long  first there was florence coming to the party florence would see that the boys were fond of him and that would make her happy this was his great theme let florence once be sure that they were gentle and good to him and that he had become a little favourite among them and then the would always think of the time he had passed there without being very sorry florence might be all the happier too for that perhaps when he came back  when he came back fifty times a day his noiseless little feet went up the stairs to his own room as he collected every book and scrap and trifle that belonged to him and put them all together there down to the minutest thing for taking home there was no shade of coming back on little paul no preparation for it or other reference to it grew out of anything he thought or did except this slight one in connexion with his sister on the contrary he had to think of everything familiar to him in his contemplative moods and in his wanderings about the house as being to be parted with and hence the many things he had to think of all day long  he had to peep into those rooms upstairs and think how solitary they would be when he was gone and wonder through how many silent days weeks months and years they would continue just as grave and undisturbed he had to thinkwould any other child oldfashioned like himself stray there at any time to whom the same grotesque distortions of pattern and furniture would manifest themselves and would anybody tell that boy of little dombey who had been there once he had to think of a portrait on the stairs which always looked earnestly after him as he went away eyeing it over his shoulder and which when he passed it in the company of anyone still seemed to gaze at him and not at his companion he had much to think of in association with a print that hung up in another place where in the centre of a wondering group one figure that he knew a figure with a light about its headbenignant mild and mercifulstood pointing upward  at his own bedroom window there were crowds of thoughts that mixed with these and came on one upon another like the rolling waves where those wild birds lived that were always hovering out at sea in troubled weather where the clouds rose and first began whence the wind issued on its rushing flight and where it stopped whether the spot where he and florence had so often sat and watched and talked about these things could ever be exactly as it used to be without them whether it could ever be the same to florence if he were in some distant place and she were sitting there alone  he had to think too of mr toots and mr feeder ba of all the boys and of doctor blimber mrs blimber and miss blimber of home and of his aunt and miss tox of his father dombey and son walter with the poor old uncle who had got the money he wanted and that gruffvoiced captain with the iron hand besides all this he had a number of little visits to pay in the course of the day to the schoolroom to doctor blimbers study to mrs blimbers private apartment to miss blimbers and to the dog for he was free of the whole house now to range it as he chose and in his desire to part with everybody on affectionate terms he attended in his way to them all sometimes he found places in books for briggs who was always losing them sometimes he looked up words in dictionaries for other young gentlemen who were in extremity sometimes he held skeins of silk for mrs blimber to wind sometimes he put cornelias desk to rights sometimes he would even creep into the doctors study and sitting on the carpet near his learned feet turn the globes softly and go round the world or take a flight among the faroff stars  in those days immediately before the holidays in short when the other young gentlemen were labouring for dear life through a general resumption of the studies of the whole halfyear paul was such a privileged pupil as had never been seen in that house before he could hardly believe it himself but his liberty lasted from hour to hour and from day to day and little dombey was caressed by everyone doctor blimber was so particular about him that he requested johnson to retire from the dinnertable one day for having thoughtlessly spoken to him as poor little dombey which paul thought rather hard and severe though he had flushed at the moment and wondered why johnson should pity him it was the more questionable justice paul thought in the doctor from his having certainly overheard that great authority give his assent on the previous evening to the proposition stated by mrs blimber that poor dear little dombey was more oldfashioned than ever and now it was that paul began to think it must surely be oldfashioned to be very thin and light and easily tired and soon disposed to lie down anywhere and rest for he couldnt help feeling that these were more and more his habits every day  at last the partyday arrived and doctor blimber said at breakfast gentlemen we will resume our studies on the twentyfifth of next month mr toots immediately threw off his allegiance and put on his ring and mentioning the doctor in casual conversation shortly afterwards spoke of him as blimber this act of freedom inspired the older pupils with admiration and envy but the younger spirits were appalled and seemed to marvel that no beam fell down and crushed him  not the least allusion was made to the ceremonies of the evening either at breakfast or at dinner but there was a bustle in the house all day and in the course of his perambulations paul made acquaintance with various strange benches and candlesticks and met a harp in a green greatcoat standing on the landing outside the drawingroom door there was something queer too about mrs blimbers head at dinnertime as if she had screwed her hair up too tight and though miss blimber showed a graceful bunch of plaited hair on each temple she seemed to have her own little curls in paper underneath and in a playbill too for paul read theatre royal over one of her sparkling spectacles and brighton over the other  there was a grand array of white waistcoats and cravats in the young gentlemens bedrooms as evening approached and such a smell of singed hair that doctor blimber sent up the footman with his compliments and wished to know if the house was on fire but it was only the hairdresser curling the young gentlemen and overheating his tongs in the ardour of business  when paul was dressedwhich was very soon done for he felt unwell and drowsy and was not able to stand about it very longhe went down into the drawingroom where he found doctor blimber pacing up and down the room full dressed but with a dignified and unconcerned demeanour as if he thought it barely possible that one or two people might drop in by and by shortly afterwards mrs blimber appeared looking lovely paul thought and attired in such a number of skirts that it was quite an excursion to walk round her miss blimber came down soon after her mama a little squeezed in appearance but very charming  mr toots and mr feeder were the next arrivals each of these gentlemen brought his hat in his hand as if he lived somewhere else and when they were announced by the butler doctor blimber said ay ay ay god bless my soul and seemed extremely glad to see them mr toots was one blaze of jewellery and buttons and he felt the circumstance so strongly that when he had shaken hands with the doctor and had bowed to mrs blimber and miss blimber he took paul aside and said what do you think of this dombey  but notwithstanding this modest confidence in himself mr toots appeared to be involved in a good deal of uncertainty whether on the whole it was judicious to button the bottom button of his waistcoat and whether on a calm revision of all the circumstances it was best to wear his waistbands turned up or turned down observing that mr feeders were turned up mr toots turned his up but the waistbands of the next arrival being turned down mr toots turned his down the differences in point of waistcoatbuttoning not only at the bottom but at the top too became so numerous and complicated as the arrivals thickened that mr toots was continually fingering that article of dress as if he were performing on some instrument and appeared to find the incessant execution it demanded quite bewildering all the young gentlemen tightly cravatted curled and pumped and with their best hats in their hands having been at different times announced and introduced mr baps the dancingmaster came accompanied by mrs baps to whom mrs blimber was extremely kind and condescending mr baps was a very grave gentleman with a slow and measured manner of speaking and before he had stood under the lamp five minutes he began to talk to toots who had been silently comparing pumps with him about what you were to do with your raw materials when they came into your ports in return for your drain of gold mr toots to whom the question seemed perplexing suggested cook em but mr baps did not appear to think that would do  paul now slipped away from the cushioned corner of a sofa which had been his post of observation and went downstairs into the tearoom to be ready for florence whom he had not seen for nearly a fortnight as he had remained at doctor blimbers on the previous saturday and sunday lest he should take cold presently she came looking so beautiful in her simple ball dress with her fresh flowers in her hand that when she knelt down on the ground to take paul round the neck and kiss him for there was no one there but his friend and another young woman waiting to serve out the tea he could hardly make up his mind to let her go again or to take away her bright and loving eyes from his face  but what is the matter floy asked paul almost sure that he saw a tear there  nothing darling nothing returned florence  paul touched her cheek gently with his fingerand it was a tear why floy said he  well go home together and ill nurse you love said florence  nurse me echoed paul  paul couldnt understand what that had to do with it nor why the two young women looked on so seriously nor why florence turned away her face for a moment and then turned it back lighted up again with smiles  floy said paul holding a ringlet of her dark hair in his hand tell me dear do you think i have grown oldfashioned  his sister laughed and fondled him and told him no  because i know they say so returned paul and i want to know what they mean floy but a loud double knock coming at the door and florence hurrying to the table there was no more said between them paul wondered again when he saw his friend whisper to florence as if she were comforting her but a new arrival put that out of his head speedily  it was sir barnet skettles lady skettles and master skettles master skettles was to be a new boy after the vacation and fame had been busy in mr feeders room with his father who was in the house of commons and of whom mr feeder had said that when he did catch the speakers eye which he had been expected to do for three or four years it was anticipated that he would rather touch up the radicals  and what room is this now for instance said lady skettles to pauls friend melia  doctor blimbers study maam was the reply  lady skettles took a panoramic survey of it through her glass and said to sir barnet skettles with a nod of approval very good sir barnet assented but master skettles looked suspicious and doubtful  and this little creature now said lady skettles turning to paul is he one of the  young gentlemen maam yes maam said pauls friend  and what is your name my pale child said lady skettles  dombey answered paul  sir barnet skettles immediately interposed and said that he had had the honour of meeting pauls father at a public dinner and that he hoped he was very well then paul heard him say to lady skettles cityvery richmost respectabledoctor mentioned it and then he said to paul will you tell your good papa that sir barnet skettles rejoiced to hear that he was very well and sent him his best compliments  yes sir answered paul  that is my brave boy said sir barnet skettles barnet to master skettles who was revenging himself for the studies to come on the plumcake this is a young gentleman you ought to know this is a young gentleman you may know barnet said sir barnet skettles with an emphasis on the permission  what eyes what hair what a lovely face exclaimed lady skettles softly as she looked at florence through her glass my sister said paul presenting her  the satisfaction of the skettleses was now complex and as lady skettles had conceived at first sight a liking for paul they all went upstairs together sir barnet skettles taking care of florence and young barnet following  young barnet did not remain long in the background after they had reached the drawingroom for dr blimber had him out in no time dancing with florence he did not appear to paul to be particularly happy or particularly anything but sulky or to care much what he was about but as paul heard lady skettles say to mrs blimber while she beat time with her fan that her dear boy was evidently smitten to death by that angel of a child miss dombey it would seem that skettles junior was in a state of bliss without showing it  little paul thought it a singular coincidence that nobody had occupied his place among the pillows and that when he came into the room again they should all make way for him to go back to it remembering it was his nobody stood before him either when they observed that he liked to see florence dancing but they left the space in front quite clear so that he might follow her with his eyes they were so kind too even the strangers of whom there were soon a great many that they came and spoke to him every now and then and asked him how he was and if his head ached and whether he was tired he was very much obliged to them for all their kindness and attention and reclining propped up in his corner with mrs blimber and lady skettles on the same sofa and florence coming and sitting by his side as soon as every dance was ended he looked on very happily indeed  florence would have sat by him all night and would not have danced at all of her own accord but paul made her by telling her how much it pleased him and he told her the truth too for his small heart swelled and his face glowed when he saw how much they all admired her and how she was the beautiful little rosebud of the room  from his nest among the pillows paul could see and hear almost everything that passed as if the whole were being done for his amusement among other little incidents that he observed he observed mr baps the dancingmaster get into conversation with sir barnet skettles and very soon ask him as he had asked mr toots what you were to do with your raw materials when they came into your ports in return for your drain of goldwhich was such a mystery to paul that he was quite desirous to know what ought to be done with them sir barnet skettles had much to say upon the question and said it but it did not appear to solve the question for mr baps retorted yes but supposing russia stepped in with her tallows which struck sir barnet almost dumb for he could only shake his head after that and say why then you must fall back upon your cottons he supposed  sir barnet skettles looked after mr baps when he went to cheer up mrs baps who being quite deserted was pretending to look over the musicbook of the gentleman who played the harp as if he thought him a remarkable kind of man and shortly afterwards he said so in those words to doctor blimber and inquired if he might take the liberty of asking who he was and whether he had ever been in the board of trade doctor blimber answered no he believed not and that in fact he was a professor of  of something connected with statistics ill swear observed sir barnet skettles  why no sir barnet replied doctor blimber rubbing his chin no not exactly  figures of some sort i would venture a bet said sir barnet skettles  why yes said doctor blimber yes but not of that sort mr baps is a very worthy sort of man sir barnet andin fact hes our professor of dancing  paul was amazed to see that this piece of information quite altered sir barnet skettless opinion of mr baps and that sir barnet flew into a perfect rage and glowered at mr baps over on the other side of the room he even went so far as to d mr baps to lady skettles in telling her what had happened and to say that it was like his most consummate and confounded impudence  there was another thing that paul observed mr feeder after imbibing several custardcups of negus began to enjoy himself the dancing in general was ceremonious and the music rather solemna little like church music in factbut after the custardcups mr feeder told mr toots that he was going to throw a little spirit into the thing after that mr feeder not only began to dance as if he meant dancing and nothing else but secretly to stimulate the music to perform wild tunes further he became particular in his attentions to the ladies and dancing with miss blimber whispered to herwhispered to herthough not so softly but that paul heard him say this remarkable poetry               had i a heart for falsehood framed               i neer could injure you  this paul heard him repeat to four young ladies in succession well might mr feeder say to mr toots that he was afraid he should be the worse for it tomorrow  mrs blimber was a little alarmed by thiscomparatively speakingprofligate behaviour and especially by the alteration in the character of the music which beginning to comprehend low melodies that were popular in the streets might not unnaturally be supposed to give offence to lady skettles but lady skettles was so very kind as to beg mrs blimber not to mention it and to receive her explanation that mr feeders spirits sometimes betrayed him into excesses on these occasions with the greatest courtesy and politeness observing that he seemed a very nice sort of person for his situation and that she particularly liked the unassuming style of his hairwhich as already hinted was about a quarter of an inch long  once when there was a pause in the dancing lady skettles told paul that he seemed very fond of music paul replied that he was and if she was too she ought to hear his sister florence sing lady skettles presently discovered that she was dying with anxiety to have that gratification and though florence was at first very much frightened at being asked to sing before so many people and begged earnestly to be excused yet on paul calling her to him and saying do floy please for me my dear she went straight to the piano and began when they all drew a little away that paul might see her and when he saw her sitting there all alone so young and good and beautiful and kind to him and heard her thrilling voice so natural and sweet and such a golden link between him and all his lifes love and happiness rising out of the silence he turned his face away and hid his tears not as he told them when they spoke to him not that the music was too plaintive or too sorrowful but it was so dear to him  they all loved florence how could they help it paul had known beforehand that they must and would and sitting in his cushioned corner with calmly folded hands and one leg loosely doubled under him few would have thought what triumph and delight expanded his childish bosom while he watched her or what a sweet tranquillity he felt lavish encomiums on dombeys sister reached his ears from all the boys admiration of the selfpossessed and modest little beauty was on every lip reports of her intelligence and accomplishments floated past him constantly and as if borne in upon the air of the summer night there was a half intelligible sentiment diffused around referring to florence and himself and breathing sympathy for both that soothed and touched him  he did not know why for all that the child observed and felt and thought that nightthe present and the absent what was then and what had beenwere blended like the colours in the rainbow or in the plumage of rich birds when the sun is shining on them or in the softening sky when the same sun is setting the many things he had had to think of lately passed before him in the music not as claiming his attention over again or as likely evermore to occupy it but as peacefully disposed of and gone a solitary window gazed through years ago looked out upon an ocean miles and miles away upon its waters fancies busy with him only yesterday were hushed and lulled to rest like broken waves the same mysterious murmur he had wondered at when lying on his couch upon the beach he thought he still heard sounding through his sisters song and through the hum of voices and the tread of feet and having some part in the faces flitting by and even in the heavy gentleness of mr toots who frequently came up to shake him by the hand through the universal kindness he still thought he heard it speaking to him and even his oldfashioned reputation seemed to be allied to it he knew not how thus little paul sat musing listening looking on and dreaming and was very happy  until the time arrived for taking leave and then indeed there was a sensation in the party sir barnet skettles brought up skettles junior to shake hands with him and asked him if he would remember to tell his good papa with his best compliments that he sir barnet skettles had said he hoped the two young gentlemen would become intimately acquainted lady skettles kissed him and patted his hair upon his brow and held him in her arms and even mrs bapspoor mrs baps paul was glad of thatcame over from beside the musicbook of the gentleman who played the harp and took leave of him quite as heartily as anybody in the room  goodbye doctor blimber said paul stretching out his hand  goodbye my little friend returned the doctor  im very much obliged to you sir said paul looking innocently up into his awful face ask them to take care of diogenes if you please  diogenes was the dog who had never in his life received a friend into his confidence before paul the doctor promised that every attention should be paid to diogenes in pauls absence and paul having again thanked him and shaken hands with him bade adieu to mrs blimber and cornelia with such heartfelt earnestness that mrs blimber forgot from that moment to mention cicero to lady skettles though she had fully intended it all the evening cornelia taking both pauls hands in hers saiddombey dombey you have always been my favourite pupil god bless you and it showed paul thought how easily one might do injustice to a person for miss blimber meant itthough she was a forcerand felt it  a boy then went round among the young gentlemen of dombeys going little dombeys going and there was a general move after paul and florence down the staircase and into the hall in which the whole blimber family were included such a circumstance mr feeder said aloud as had never happened in the case of any former young gentleman within his experience but it would be difficult to say if this were sober fact or custardcups the servants with the butler at their head had all an interest in seeing little dombey go and even the weakeyed young man taking out his books and trunks to the coach that was to carry him and florence to mrs pipchins for the night melted visibly  not even the influence of the softer passion on the young gentlemenand they all to a boy doted on florencecould restrain them from taking quite a noisy leave of paul waving hats after him pressing downstairs to shake hands with him crying individually dombey dont forget me and indulging in many such ebullitions of feeling uncommon among those young chesterfields paul whispered florence as she wrapped him up before the door was opened did she hear them would she ever forget it was she glad to know it and a lively delight was in his eyes as he spoke to her  once for a last look he turned and gazed upon the faces thus addressed to him surprised to see how shining and how bright and numerous they were and how they were all piled and heaped up as faces are at crowded theatres they swam before him as he looked like faces in an agitated glass and next moment he was in the dark coach outside holding close to florence from that time whenever he thought of doctor blimbers it came back as he had seen it in this last view and it never seemed to be a real place again but always a dream full of eyes  this was not quite the last of doctor blimbers however there was something else there was mr toots who unexpectedly letting down one of the coachwindows and looking in said with a most egregious chuckle is dombey there and immediately put it up again without waiting for an answer nor was this quite the last of mr toots even for before the coachman could drive off he as suddenly let down the other window and looking in with a precisely similar chuckle said in a precisely similar tone of voice is dombey there and disappeared precisely as before  how florence laughed paul often remembered it and laughed himself whenever he did so  but there was much soon afterwardsnext day and after thatwhich paul could only recollect confusedly as why they stayed at mrs pipchins days and nights instead of going home why he lay in bed with florence sitting by his side whether that had been his father in the room or only a tall shadow on the wall whether he had heard his doctor say of someone that if they had removed him before the occasion on which he had built up fancies strong in proportion to his own weakness it was very possible he might have pined away  he could not even remember whether he had often said to florence oh floy take me home and never leave me but he thought he had he fancied sometimes he had heard himself repeating take me home floy take me home  but he could remember when he got home and was carried up the wellremembered stairs that there had been the rumbling of a coach for many hours together while he lay upon the seat with florence still beside him and old mrs pipchin sitting opposite he remembered his old bed too when they laid him down in it his aunt miss tox and susan but there was something else and recent too that still perplexed him  i want to speak to florence if you please he said to florence by herself for a moment  she bent down over him and the others stood away  floy my pet wasnt that papa in the hall when they brought me from the coach  yes dear  he didnt cry and go into his room floy did he when he saw me coming in  florence shook her head and pressed her lips against his cheek  im very glad he didnt cry said little paul i thought he did dont tell them that i asked    chapter 15 amazing artfulness of captain cuttle and a new pursuit for walter gay   walter could not for several days decide what to do in the barbados business and even cherished some faint hope that mr dombey might not have meant what he had said or that he might change his mind and tell him he was not to go but as nothing occurred to give this idea which was sufficiently improbable in itself any touch of confirmation and as time was slipping by and he had none to lose he felt that he must act without hesitating any longer  walters chief difficulty was how to break the change in his affairs to uncle sol to whom he was sensible it would be a terrible blow he had the greater difficulty in dashing uncle sols spirits with such an astounding piece of intelligence because they had lately recovered very much and the old man had become so cheerful that the little back parlour was itself again uncle sol had paid the first appointed portion of the debt to mr dombey and was hopeful of working his way through the rest and to cast him down afresh when he had sprung up so manfully from his troubles was a very distressing necessity  yet it would never do to run away from him he must know of it beforehand and how to tell him was the point as to the question of going or not going walter did not consider that he had any power of choice in the matter mr dombey had truly told him that he was young and that his uncles circumstances were not good and mr dombey had plainly expressed in the glance with which he had accompanied that reminder that if he declined to go he might stay at home if he chose but not in his countinghouse his uncle and he lay under a great obligation to mr dombey which was of walters own soliciting he might have begun in secret to despair of ever winning that gentlemans favour and might have thought that he was now and then disposed to put a slight upon him which was hardly just but what would have been duty without that was still duty with itor walter thought soand duty must be done  when mr dombey had looked at him and told him he was young and that his uncles circumstances were not good there had been an expression of disdain in his face a contemptuous and disparaging assumption that he would be quite content to live idly on a reduced old man which stung the boys generous soul determined to assure mr dombey in so far as it was possible to give him the assurance without expressing it in words that indeed he mistook his nature walter had been anxious to show even more cheerfulness and activity after the west indian interview than he had shown before if that were possible in one of his quick and zealous disposition he was too young and inexperienced to think that possibly this very quality in him was not agreeable to mr dombey and that it was no steppingstone to his good opinion to be elastic and hopeful of pleasing under the shadow of his powerful displeasure whether it were right or wrong but it may have beenit may have beenthat the great man thought himself defied in this new exposition of an honest spirit and purposed to bring it down  well at last and at least uncle sol must be told thought walter with a sigh and as walter was apprehensive that his voice might perhaps quaver a little and that his countenance might not be quite as hopeful as he could wish it to be if he told the old man himself and saw the first effects of his communication on his wrinkled face he resolved to avail himself of the services of that powerful mediator captain cuttle sunday coming round he set off therefore after breakfast once more to beat up captain cuttles quarters  it was not unpleasant to remember on the way thither that mrs macstinger resorted to a great distance every sunday morning to attend the ministry of the reverend melchisedech howler who having been one day discharged from the west india docks on a false suspicion got up expressly against him by the general enemy of screwing gimlets into puncheons and applying his lips to the orifice had announced the destruction of the world for that day two years at ten in the morning and opened a front parlour for the reception of ladies and gentlemen of the ranting persuasion upon whom on the first occasion of their assemblage the admonitions of the reverend melchisedech had produced so powerful an effect that in their rapturous performance of a sacred jig which closed the service the whole flock broke through into a kitchen below and disabled a mangle belonging to one of the fold  this the captain in a moment of uncommon conviviality had confided to walter and his uncle between the repetitions of lovely peg on the night when brogley the broker was paid out the captain himself was punctual in his attendance at a church in his own neighbourhood which hoisted the union jack every sunday morning and where he was good enoughthe lawful beadle being infirmto keep an eye upon the boys over whom he exercised great power in virtue of his mysterious hook knowing the regularity of the captains habits walter made all the haste he could that he might anticipate his going out and he made such good speed that he had the pleasure on turning into brig place to behold the broad blue coat and waistcoat hanging out of the captains open window to air in the sun  it appeared incredible that the coat and waistcoat could be seen by mortal eyes without the captain but he certainly was not in them otherwise his legsthe houses in brig place not being loftywould have obstructed the street door which was perfectly clear quite wondering at this discovery walter gave a single knock  stinger he distinctly heard the captain say up in his room as if that were no business of his therefore walter gave two knocks  cuttle he heard the captain say upon that and immediately afterwards the captain in his clean shirt and braces with his neckerchief hanging loosely round his throat like a coil of rope and his glazed hat on appeared at the window leaning out over the broad blue coat and waistcoat  walr cried the captain looking down upon him in amazement  ay ay captain cuttle returned walter only me  whats the matter my lad inquired the captain with great concern gills ant been and sprung nothing again  no no said walter my uncles all right captain cuttle  the captain expressed his gratification and said he would come down below and open the door which he did  though youre early walr said the captain eyeing him still doubtfully when they got upstairs  why the fact is captain cuttle said walter sitting down i was afraid you would have gone out and i want to benefit by your friendly counsel  so you shall said the captain whatll you take  i want to take your opinion captain cuttle returned walter smiling thats the only thing for me  come on then said the captain with a will my lad  walter related to him what had happened and the difficulty in which he felt respecting his uncle and the relief it would be to him if captain cuttle in his kindness would help him to smooth it away captain cuttles infinite consternation and astonishment at the prospect unfolded to him gradually swallowing that gentleman up until it left his face quite vacant and the suit of blue the glazed hat and the hook apparently without an owner  you see captain cuttle pursued walter for myself i am young as mr dombey said and not to be considered i am to fight my way through the world i know but there are two points i was thinking as i came along that i should be very particular about in respect to my uncle i dont mean to say that i deserve to be the pride and delight of his lifeyou believe me i knowbut i am now dont you think i am  the captain seemed to make an endeavour to rise from the depths of his astonishment and get back to his face but the effort being ineffectual the glazed hat merely nodded with a mute unutterable meaning  if i live and have my health said walter and i am not afraid of that still when i leave england i can hardly hope to see my uncle again he is old captain cuttle and besides his life is a life of custom  steady walr of a want of custom said the captain suddenly reappearing  too true returned walter shaking his head but i meant a life of habit captain cuttlethat sort of custom and if as you very truly said i am sure he would have died the sooner for the loss of the stock and all those objects to which he has been accustomed for so many years dont you think he might die a little sooner for the loss of  of his nevy interposed the captain right  well then said walter trying to speak gaily we must do our best to make him believe that the separation is but a temporary one after all but as i know better or dread that i know better captain cuttle and as i have so many reasons for regarding him with affection and duty and honour i am afraid i should make but a very poor hand at that if i tried to persuade him of it thats my great reason for wishing you to break it out to him and thats the first point  keep her off a point or so observed the captain in a comtemplative voice  what did you say captain cuttle inquired walter  stand by returned the captain thoughtfully  walter paused to ascertain if the captain had any particular information to add to this but as he said no more went on  now the second point captain cuttle i am sorry to say i am not a favourite with mr dombey i have always tried to do my best and i have always done it but he does not like me he cant help his likings and dislikings perhaps i say nothing of that i only say that i am certain he does not like me he does not send me to this post as a good one he disclaims to represent it as being better than it is and i doubt very much if it will ever lead me to advancement in the housewhether it does not on the contrary dispose of me for ever and put me out of the way now we must say nothing of this to my uncle captain cuttle but must make it out to be as favourable and promising as we can and when i tell you what it really is i only do so that in case any means should ever arise of lending me a hand so far off i may have one friend at home who knows my real situation  walr my boy replied the captain in the proverbs of solomon you will find the following words may we never want a friend in need nor a bottle to give him when found make a note of  here the captain stretched out his hand to walter with an air of downright good faith that spoke volumes at the same time repeating for he felt proud of the accuracy and pointed application of his quotation when found make a note of  captain cuttle said walter taking the immense fist extended to him by the captain in both his hands which it completely filled next to my uncle sol i love you there is no one on earth in whom i can more safely trust i am sure as to the mere going away captain cuttle i dont care for that why should i care for that if i were free to seek my own fortuneif i were free to go as a common sailorif i were free to venture on my own account to the farthest end of the worldi would gladly go i would have gladly gone years ago and taken my chance of what might come of it but it was against my uncles wishes and against the plans he had formed for me and there was an end of that but what i feel captain cuttle is that we have been a little mistaken all along and that so far as any improvement in my prospects is concerned i am no better off now than i was when i first entered dombeys houseperhaps a little worse for the house may have been kindly inclined towards me then and it certainly is not now  turn again whittington muttered the disconsolate captain after looking at walter for some time  ay replied walter laughing and turn a great many times too captain cuttle im afraid before such fortune as his ever turns up again not that i complain he added in his lively animated energetic way i have nothing to complain of i am provided for i can live when i leave my uncle i leave him to you and i can leave him to no one better captain cuttle i havent told you all this because i despair not i its to convince you that i cant pick and choose in dombeys house and that where i am sent there i must go and what i am offered that i must take its better for my uncle that i should be sent away for mr dombey is a valuable friend to him as he proved himself you know when captain cuttle and i am persuaded he wont be less valuable when he hasnt me there every day to awaken his dislike so hurrah for the west indies captain cuttle how does that tune go that the sailors sing                for the port of barbados boys                                              cheerily                leaving old england behind us boys                                              cheerily here the captain roared in chorus                oh cheerily cheerily                                              oh cheerily  the last line reaching the quick ears of an ardent skipper not quite sober who lodged opposite and who instantly sprung out of bed threw up his window and joined in across the street at the top of his voice produced a fine effect when it was impossible to sustain the concluding note any longer the skipper bellowed forth a terrific ahoy intended in part as a friendly greeting and in part to show that he was not at all breathed that done he shut down his window and went to bed again  and now captain cuttle said walter handing him the blue coat and waistcoat and bustling very much if youll come and break the news to uncle sol which he ought to have known days upon days ago by rights ill leave you at the door you know and walk about until the afternoon  the captain however scarcely appeared to relish the commission or to be by any means confident of his powers of executing it he had arranged the future life and adventures of walter so very differently and so entirely to his own satisfaction he had felicitated himself so often on the sagacity and foresight displayed in that arrangement and had found it so complete and perfect in all its parts that to suffer it to go to pieces all at once and even to assist in breaking it up required a great effort of his resolution the captain too found it difficult to unload his old ideas upon the subject and to take a perfectly new cargo on board with that rapidity which the circumstances required or without jumbling and confounding the two consequently instead of putting on his coat and waistcoat with anything like the impetuosity that could alone have kept pace with walters mood he declined to invest himself with those garments at all at present and informed walter that on such a serious matter he must be allowed to bite his nails a bit  its an old habit of mine walr said the captain any time these fifty year when you see ned cuttle bite his nails walr then you may know that ned cuttles aground  thereupon the captain put his iron hook between his teeth as if it were a hand and with an air of wisdom and profundity that was the very concentration and sublimation of all philosophical reflection and grave inquiry applied himself to the consideration of the subject in its various branches  theres a friend of mine murmured the captain in an absent manner but hes at present coasting round to whitby that would deliver such an opinion on this subject or any other that could be named as would give parliament six and beat em been knocked overboard that man said the captain twice and none the worse for it was beat in his apprenticeship for three weeks off and on about the head with a ringbolt and yet a clearerminded man dont walk  despite of his respect for captain cuttle walter could not help inwardly rejoicing at the absence of this sage and devoutly hoping that his limpid intellect might not be brought to bear on his difficulties until they were quite settled  if you was to take and show that man the buoy at the nore said captain cuttle in the same tone and ask him his opinion of it walr hed give you an opinion that was no more like that buoy than your uncles buttons are there aint a man that walkscertainly not on two legsthat can come near him not near him  whats his name captain cuttle inquired walter determined to be interested in the captains friend  his names bunsby said the captain but lord it might be anything for the matter of that with such a mind as his  the exact idea which the captain attached to this concluding piece of praise he did not further elucidate neither did walter seek to draw it forth for on his beginning to review with the vivacity natural to himself and to his situation the leading points in his own affairs he soon discovered that the captain had relapsed into his former profound state of mind and that while he eyed him steadfastly from beneath his bushy eyebrows he evidently neither saw nor heard him but remained immersed in cogitation  in fact captain cuttle was labouring with such great designs that far from being aground he soon got off into the deepest of water and could find no bottom to his penetration by degrees it became perfectly plain to the captain that there was some mistake here that it was undoubtedly much more likely to be walters mistake than his that if there were really any west india scheme afoot it was a very different one from what walter who was young and rash supposed and could only be some new device for making his fortune with unusual celerity or if there should be any little hitch between em thought the captain meaning between walter and mr dombey it only wants a word in season from a friend of both parties to set it right and smooth and make all taut again captain cuttles deduction from these considerations was that as he already enjoyed the pleasure of knowing mr dombey from having spent a very agreeable halfhour in his company at brighton on the morning when they borrowed the money and that as a couple of men of the world who understood each other and were mutually disposed to make things comfortable could easily arrange any little difficulty of this sort and come at the real facts the friendly thing for him to do would be without saying anything about it to walter at present just to step up to mr dombeys housesay to the servant would ye be so good my lad as report capen cuttle heremeet mr dombey in a confidential spirithook him by the buttonholetalk it overmake it all rightand come away triumphant  as these reflections presented themselves to the captains mind and by slow degrees assumed this shape and form his visage cleared like a doubtful morning when it gives place to a bright noon his eyebrows which had been in the highest degree portentous smoothed their rugged bristling aspect and became serene his eyes which had been nearly closed in the severity of his mental exercise opened freely a smile which had been at first but three specksone at the righthand corner of his mouth and one at the corner of each eyegradually overspread his whole face and rippling up into his forehead lifted the glazed hat as if that too had been aground with captain cuttle and were now like him happily afloat again  finally the captain left off biting his nails and said now walr my boy you may help me on with them slops by which the captain meant his coat and waistcoat  walter little imagined why the captain was so particular in the arrangement of his cravat as to twist the pendent ends into a sort of pigtail and pass them through a massive gold ring with a picture of a tomb upon it and a neat iron railing and a tree in memory of some deceased friend nor why the captain pulled up his shirtcollar to the utmost limits allowed by the irish linen below and by so doing decorated himself with a complete pair of blinkers nor why he changed his shoes and put on an unparalleled pair of anklejacks which he only wore on extraordinary occasions the captain being at length attired to his own complete satisfaction and having glanced at himself from head to foot in a shavingglass which he removed from a nail for that purpose took up his knotted stick and said he was ready  the captains walk was more complacent than usual when they got out into the street but this walter supposed to be the effect of the anklejacks and took little heed of before they had gone very far they encountered a woman selling flowers when the captain stopping short as if struck by a happy idea made a purchase of the largest bundle in her basket a most glorious nosegay fanshaped some two feet and a half round and composed of all the jolliestlooking flowers that blow  armed with this little token which he designed for mr dombey captain cuttle walked on with walter until they reached the instrumentmakers door before which they both paused  youre going in said walter  yes returned the captain who felt that walter must be got rid of before he proceeded any further and that he had better time his projected visit somewhat later in the day  and you wont forget anything  no returned the captain  ill go upon my walk at once said walter and then i shall be out of the way captain cuttle  take a good long un my lad replied the captain calling after him walter waved his hand in assent and went his way  his way was nowhere in particular but he thought he would go out into the fields where he could reflect upon the unknown life before him and resting under some tree ponder quietly he knew no better fields than those near hampstead and no better means of getting at them than by passing mr dombeys house  it was as stately and as dark as ever when he went by and glanced up at its frowning front the blinds were all pulled down but the upper windows stood wide open and the pleasant air stirring those curtains and waving them to and fro was the only sign of animation in the whole exterior walter walked softly as he passed and was glad when he had left the house a door or two behind  he looked back then with the interest he had always felt for the place since the adventure of the lost child years ago and looked especially at those upper windows while he was thus engaged a chariot drove to the door and a portly gentleman in black with a heavy watchchain alighted and went in when he afterwards remembered this gentleman and his equipage together walter had no doubt be was a physician and then he wondered who was ill but the discovery did not occur to him until he had walked some distance thinking listlessly of other things  though still of what the house had suggested to him for walter pleased himself with thinking that perhaps the time might come when the beautiful child who was his old friend and had always been so grateful to him and so glad to see him since might interest her brother in his behalf and influence his fortunes for the better he liked to imagine thismore at that moment for the pleasure of imagining her continued remembrance of him than for any worldly profit he might gain but another and more sober fancy whispered to him that if he were alive then he would be beyond the sea and forgotten she married rich proud happy there was no more reason why she should remember him with any interest in such an altered state of things than any plaything she ever had no not so much  yet walter so idealised the pretty child whom he had found wandering in the rough streets and so identified her with her innocent gratitude of that night and the simplicity and truth of its expression that he blushed for himself as a libeller when he argued that she could ever grow proud on the other hand his meditations were of that fantastic order that it seemed hardly less libellous in him to imagine her grown a woman to think of her as anything but the same artless gentle winning little creature that she had been in the days of good mrs brown in a word walter found out that to reason with himself about florence at all was to become very unreasonable indeed and that he could do no better than preserve her image in his mind as something precious unattainable unchangeable and indefiniteindefinite in all but its power of giving him pleasure and restraining him like an angels hand from anything unworthy  it was a long stroll in the fields that walter took that day listening to the birds and the sunday bells and the softened murmur of the townbreathing sweet scents glancing sometimes at the dim horizon beyond which his voyage and his place of destination lay then looking round on the green english grass and the home landscape but he hardly once thought even of going away distinctly and seemed to put off reflection idly from hour to hour and from minute to minute while he yet went on reflecting all the time  walter had left the fields behind him and was plodding homeward in the same abstracted mood when he heard a shout from a man and then a womans voice calling to him loudly by name turning quickly in his surprise he saw that a hackneycoach going in the contrary direction had stopped at no great distance that the coachman was looking back from his box and making signals to him with his whip and that a young woman inside was leaning out of the window and beckoning with immense energy running up to this coach he found that the young woman was miss nipper and that miss nipper was in such a flutter as to be almost beside herself  staggss gardens mr walter said miss nipper if you please oh do  eh cried walter what is the matter  oh mr walter staggss gardens if you please said susan  there cried the coachman appealing to walter with a sort of exalting despair thats the way the young ladys been a goin on for upards of a mortal hour and me continivally backing out of no thoroughfares where she would drive up ive had a many fares in this coach first and last but never such a fare as her  do you want to go to staggss gardens susan inquired walter  ah she wants to go there where is it growled the coachman  i dont know where it is exclaimed susan wildly mr walter i was there once myself along with miss floy and our poor darling master paul on the very day when you found miss floy in the city for we lost her coming home mrs richards and me and a mad bull and mrs richardss eldest and though i went there afterwards i cant remember where it is i think its sunk into the ground oh mr walter dont desert me staggss gardens if you please miss floys darlingall our darlingslittle meek meek master paul oh mr walter  good god cried walter is he very ill  the pretty flower cried susan wringing her hands has took the fancy that hed like to see his old nurse and ive come to bring her to his bedside mrs staggs of polly toodles gardens someone pray  greatly moved by what he heard and catching susans earnestness immediately walter now that he understood the nature of her errand dashed into it with such ardour that the coachman had enough to do to follow closely as he ran before inquiring here and there and everywhere the way to staggss gardens  there was no such place as staggss gardens it had vanished from the earth where the old rotten summerhouses once had stood palaces now reared their heads and granite columns of gigantic girth opened a vista to the railway world beyond the miserable waste ground where the refusematter had been heaped of yore was swallowed up and gone and in its frowsy stead were tiers of warehouses crammed with rich goods and costly merchandise the old bystreets now swarmed with passengers and vehicles of every kind the new streets that had stopped disheartened in the mud and waggonruts formed towns within themselves originating wholesome comforts and conveniences belonging to themselves and never tried nor thought of until they sprung into existence bridges that had led to nothing led to villas gardens churches healthy public walks the carcasses of houses and beginnings of new thoroughfares had started off upon the line at steams own speed and shot away into the country in a monster train  as to the neighbourhood which had hesitated to acknowledge the railroad in its straggling days that had grown wise and penitent as any christian might in such a case and now boasted of its powerful and prosperous relation there were railway patterns in its drapers shops and railway journals in the windows of its newsmen there were railway hotels officehouses lodginghouses boardinghouses railway plans maps views wrappers bottles sandwichboxes and timetables railway hackneycoach and stands railway omnibuses railway streets and buildings railway hangerson and parasites and flatterers out of all calculation there was even railway time observed in clocks as if the sun itself had given in among the vanquished was the master chimneysweeper whilom incredulous at staggss gardens who now lived in a stuccoed house three stories high and gave himself out with golden flourishes upon a varnished board as contractor for the cleansing of railway chimneys by machinery  to and from the heart of this great change all day and night throbbing currents rushed and returned incessantly like its lifes blood crowds of people and mountains of goods departing and arriving scores upon scores of times in every fourandtwenty hours produced a fermentation in the place that was always in action the very houses seemed disposed to pack up and take trips wonderful members of parliament who little more than twenty years before had made themselves merry with the wild railroad theories of engineers and given them the liveliest rubs in crossexamination went down into the north with their watches in their hands and sent on messages before by the electric telegraph to say that they were coming night and day the conquering engines rumbled at their distant work or advancing smoothly to their journeys end and gliding like tame dragons into the allotted corners grooved out to the inch for their reception stood bubbling and trembling there making the walls quake as if they were dilating with the secret knowledge of great powers yet unsuspected in them and strong purposes not yet achieved  but staggss gardens had been cut up root and branch oh woe the day when not a rood of english groundlaid out in staggss gardensis secure  at last after much fruitless inquiry walter followed by the coach and susan found a man who had once resided in that vanished land and who was no other than the master sweep before referred to grown stout and knocking a double knock at his own door he knowed toodle he said well belonged to the railroad didnt he  yes sir yes cried susan nipper from the coach window  where did he live now hastily inquired walter  he lived in the companys own buildings second turning to the right down the yard cross over and take the second on the right again it was number eleven they couldnt mistake it but if they did they had only to ask for toodle engine fireman and any one would show them which was his house at this unexpected stroke of success susan nipper dismounted from the coach with all speed took walters arm and set off at a breathless pace on foot leaving the coach there to await their return  has the little boy been long ill susan inquired walter as they hurried on  ailing for a deal of time but no one knew how much said susan adding with excessive sharpness oh them blimbers  blimbers echoed walter  i couldnt forgive myself at such a time as this mr walter said susan and when theres so much serious distress to think about if i rested hard on anyone especially on them that little darling paul speaks well of but i may wish that the family was set to work in a stony soil to make new roads and that miss blimber went in front and had the pickaxe  miss nipper then took breath and went on faster than before as if this extraordinary aspiration had relieved her walter who had by this time no breath of his own to spare hurried along without asking any more questions and they soon in their impatience burst in at a little door and came into a clean parlour full of children  wheres mrs richards exclaimed susan nipper looking round oh mrs richards mrs richards come along with me my dear creetur  why if it aint susan cried polly rising with her honest face and motherly figure from among the group in great surprise  yes mrs richards its me said susan and i wish it wasnt though i may not seem to flatter when i say so but little master paul is very ill and told his pa today that he would like to see the face of his old nurse and him and miss floy hope youll come along with meand mr walter mrs richardsforgetting what is past and do a kindness to the sweet dear that is withering away oh mrs richards withering away susan nipper crying polly shed tears to see her and to hear what she had said and all the children gathered round including numbers of new babies and mr toodle who had just come home from birmingham and was eating his dinner out of a basin laid down his knife and fork and put on his wifes bonnet and shawl for her which were hanging up behind the door then tapped her on the back and said with more fatherly feeling than eloquence polly cut away  so they got back to the coach long before the coachman expected them and walter putting susan and mrs richards inside took his seat on the box himself that there might be no more mistakes and deposited them safely in the hall of mr dombeys housewhere by the bye he saw a mighty nosegay lying which reminded him of the one captain cuttle had purchased in his company that morning he would have lingered to know more of the young invalid or waited any length of time to see if he could render the least service but painfully sensible that such conduct would be looked upon by mr dombey as presumptuous and forward he turned slowly sadly anxiously away  he had not gone five minutes walk from the door when a man came running after him and begged him to return walter retraced his steps as quickly as he could and entered the gloomy house with a sorrowful foreboding    chapter 16 what the waves were always saying   paul had never risen from his little bed he lay there listening to the noises in the street quite tranquilly not caring much how the time went but watching it and watching everything about him with observing eyes  when the sunbeams struck into his room through the rustling blinds and quivered on the opposite wall like golden water he knew that evening was coming on and that the sky was red and beautiful as the reflection died away and a gloom went creeping up the wall he watched it deepen deepen deepen into night then he thought how the long streets were dotted with lamps and how the peaceful stars were shining overhead his fancy had a strange tendency to wander to the river which he knew was flowing through the great city and now he thought how black it was and how deep it would look reflecting the hosts of starsand more than all how steadily it rolled away to meet the sea  as it grew later in the night and footsteps in the street became so rare that he could hear them coming count them as they passed and lose them in the hollow distance he would lie and watch the manycoloured ring about the candle and wait patiently for day his only trouble was the swift and rapid river he felt forced sometimes to try to stop itto stem it with his childish handsor choke its way with sandand when he saw it coming on resistless he cried out but a word from florence who was always at his side restored him to himself and leaning his poor head upon her breast he told floy of his dream and smiled  when day began to dawn again he watched for the sun and when its cheerful light began to sparkle in the room he pictured to himselfpictured he sawthe high church towers rising up into the morning sky the town reviving waking starting into life once more the river glistening as it rolled but rolling fast as ever and the country bright with dew familiar sounds and cries came by degrees into the street below the servants in the house were roused and busy faces looked in at the door and voices asked his attendants softly how he was paul always answered for himself i am better i am a great deal better thank you tell papa so  by little and little he got tired of the bustle of the day the noise of carriages and carts and people passing and repassing and would fall asleep or be troubled with a restless and uneasy sense againthe child could hardly tell whether this were in his sleeping or his waking momentsof that rushing river why will it never stop floy he would sometimes ask her it is bearing me away i think  but floy could always soothe and reassure him and it was his daily delight to make her lay her head down on his pillow and take some rest  you are always watching me floy let me watch you now they would prop him up with cushions in a corner of his bed and there he would recline the while she lay beside him bending forward oftentimes to kiss her and whispering to those who were near that she was tired and how she had sat up so many nights beside him  thus the flush of the day in its heat and light would gradually decline and again the golden water would be dancing on the wall  he was visited by as many as three grave doctorsthey used to assemble downstairs and come up togetherand the room was so quiet and paul was so observant of them though he never asked of anybody what they said that he even knew the difference in the sound of their watches but his interest centred in sir parker peps who always took his seat on the side of the bed for paul had heard them say long ago that that gentleman had been with his mama when she clasped florence in her arms and died and he could not forget it now he liked him for it he was not afraid  the people round him changed as unaccountably as on that first night at doctor blimbersexcept florence florence never changedand what had been sir parker peps was now his father sitting with his head upon his hand old mrs pipchin dozing in an easy chair often changed to miss tox or his aunt and paul was quite content to shut his eyes again and see what happened next without emotion but this figure with its head upon its hand returned so often and remained so long and sat so still and solemn never speaking never being spoken to and rarely lifting up its face that paul began to wonder languidly if it were real and in the nighttime saw it sitting there with fear  floy he said what is that  where dearest  there at the bottom of the bed  theres nothing there except papa  the figure lifted up its head and rose and coming to the bedside said  my own boy dont you know me  paul looked it in the face and thought was this his father but the face so altered to his thinking thrilled while he gazed as if it were in pain and before he could reach out both his hands to take it between them and draw it towards him the figure turned away quickly from the little bed and went out at the door  paul looked at florence with a fluttering heart but he knew what she was going to say and stopped her with his face against her lips the next time he observed the figure sitting at the bottom of the bed he called to it  dont be sorry for me dear papa indeed i am quite happy  his father coming and bending down to himwhich he did quickly and without first pausing by the bedsidepaul held him round the neck and repeated those words to him several times and very earnestly and paul never saw him in his room again at any time whether it were day or night but he called out dont be sorry for me indeed i am quite happy this was the beginning of his always saying in the morning that he was a great deal better and that they were to tell his father so  how many times the golden water danced upon the wall how many nights the dark dark river rolled towards the sea in spite of him paul never counted never sought to know if their kindness or his sense of it could have increased they were more kind and he more grateful every day but whether they were many days or few appeared of little moment now to the gentle boy  one night he had been thinking of his mother and her picture in the drawingroom downstairs and thought she must have loved sweet florence better than his father did to have held her in her arms when she felt that she was dyingfor even he her brother who had such dear love for her could have no greater wish than that the train of thought suggested to him to inquire if he had ever seen his mother for he could not remember whether they had told him yes or no the river running very fast and confusing his mind  floy did i ever see mama  no darling why  did i ever see any kind face like mamas looking at me when i was a baby floy  he asked incredulously as if he had some vision of a face before him  oh yes dear  whose floy  your old nurses often  and where is my old nurse said paul is she dead too floy are we all dead except you  there was a hurry in the room for an instantlonger perhaps but it seemed no morethen all was still again and florence with her face quite colourless but smiling held his head upon her arm her arm trembled very much  show me that old nurse floy if you please  she is not here darling she shall come tomorrow  thank you floy  paul closed his eyes with those words and fell asleep when he awoke the sun was high and the broad day was clear and he lay a little looking at the windows which were open and the curtains rustling in the air and waving to and fro then he said floy is it tomorrow is she come  someone seemed to go in quest of her perhaps it was susan paul thought he heard her telling him when he had closed his eyes again that she would soon be back but he did not open them to see she kept her wordperhaps she had never been awaybut the next thing that happened was a noise of footsteps on the stairs and then paul wokewoke mind and bodyand sat upright in his bed he saw them now about him there was no grey mist before them as there had been sometimes in the night he knew them every one and called them by their names  and who is this is this my old nurse said the child regarding with a radiant smile a figure coming in  yes yes no other stranger would have shed those tears at sight of him and called him her dear boy her pretty boy her own poor blighted child no other woman would have stooped down by his bed and taken up his wasted hand and put it to her lips and breast as one who had some right to fondle it no other woman would have so forgotten everybody there but him and floy and been so full of tenderness and pity  floy this is a kind good face said paul i am glad to see it again dont go away old nurse stay here  his senses were all quickened and he heard a name he knew  who was that who said walter he asked looking round someone said walter is he here i should like to see him very much  nobody replied directly but his father soon said to susan call him back then let him come up alter a short pause of expectation during which he looked with smiling interest and wonder on his nurse and saw that she had not forgotten floy walter was brought into the room his open face and manner and his cheerful eyes had always made him a favourite with paul and when paul saw him he stretched out his hand and said goodbye  goodbye my child said mrs pipchin hurrying to his beds head not goodbye  for an instant paul looked at her with the wistful face with which he had so often gazed upon her in his corner by the fire yes he said placidly goodbye walter dear goodbyeturning his head to where he stood and putting out his hand again where is papa  he felt his fathers breath upon his cheek before the words had parted from his lips  remember walter dear papa he whispered looking in his face remember walter i was fond of walter the feeble hand waved in the air as if it cried goodbye to walter once again  now lay me down he said and floy come close to me and let me see you  sister and brother wound their arms around each other and the golden light came streaming in and fell upon them locked together  how fast the river runs between its green banks and the rushes floy but its very near the sea i hear the waves they always said so  presently he told her the motion of the boat upon the stream was lulling him to rest how green the banks were now how bright the flowers growing on them and how tall the rushes now the boat was out at sea but gliding smoothly on and now there was a shore before him who stood on the bank  he put his hands together as he had been used to do at his prayers he did not remove his arms to do it but they saw him fold them so behind her neck  mama is like you floy i know her by the face but tell them that the print upon the stairs at school is not divine enough the light about the head is shining on me as i go  the golden ripple on the wall came back again and nothing else stirred in the room the old old fashion the fashion that came in with our first garments and will last unchanged until our race has run its course and the wide firmament is rolled up like a scroll the old old fashiondeath  oh thank god all who see it for that older fashion yet of immortality and look upon us angels of young children with regards not quite estranged when the swift river bears us to the ocean  dear me dear me to think said miss tox bursting out afresh that night as if her heart were broken that dombey and son should be a daughter after all    chapter 17 captain cuttle does a little business for the young people   captain cuttle in the exercise of that surprising talent for deeplaid and unfathomable scheming with which as is not unusual in men of transparent simplicity he sincerely believed himself to be endowed by nature had gone to mr dombeys house on the eventful sunday winking all the way as a vent for his superfluous sagacity and had presented himself in the full lustre of the anklejacks before the eyes of towlinson hearing from that individual to his great concern of the impending calamity captain cuttle in his delicacy sheered off again confounded merely handing in the nosegay as a small mark of his solicitude and leaving his respectful compliments for the family in general which he accompanied with an expression of his hope that they would lay their heads well to the wind under existing circumstances and a friendly intimation that he would look up again tomorrow  the captains compliments were never heard of any more the captains nosegay after lying in the hall all night was swept into the dustbin next morning and the captains sly arrangement involved in one catastrophe with greater hopes and loftier designs was crushed to pieces so when an avalanche bears down a mountainforest twigs and bushes suffer with the trees and all perish together  when walter returned home on the sunday evening from his long walk and its memorable close he was too much occupied at first by the tidings he had to give them and by the emotions naturally awakened in his breast by the scene through which he had passed to observe either that his uncle was evidently unacquainted with the intelligence the captain had undertaken to impart or that the captain made signals with his hook warning him to avoid the subject not that the captains signals were calculated to have proved very comprehensible however attentively observed for like those chinese sages who are said in their conferences to write certain learned words in the air that are wholly impossible of pronunciation the captain made such waves and flourishes as nobody without a previous knowledge of his mystery would have been at all likely to understand  captain cuttle however becoming cognisant of what had happened relinquished these attempts as he perceived the slender chance that now existed of his being able to obtain a little easy chat with mr dombey before the period of walters departure but in admitting to himself with a disappointed and crestfallen countenance that sol gills must be told and that walter must gotaking the case for the present as he found it and not having it enlightened or improved beforehand by the knowing management of a friendthe captain still felt an unabated confidence that he ned cuttle was the man for mr dombey and that to set walters fortunes quite square nothing was wanted but that they two should come together for the captain never could forget how well he and mr dombey had got on at brighton with what nicety each of them had put in a word when it was wanted how exactly they had taken one anothers measure nor how ned cuttle had pointed out that resources in the first extremity and had brought the interview to the desired termination on all these grounds the captain soothed himself with thinking that though ned cuttle was forced by the pressure of events to stand by almost useless for the present ned would fetch up with a wet sail in good time and carry all before him  under the influence of this goodnatured delusion captain cuttle even went so far as to revolve in his own bosom while he sat looking at walter and listening with a tear on his shirtcollar to what he related whether it might not be at once genteel and politic to give mr dombey a verbal invitation whenever they should meet to come and cut his mutton in brig place on some day of his own naming and enter on the question of his young friends prospects over a social glass but the uncertain temper of mrs macstinger and the possibility of her setting up her rest in the passage during such an entertainment and there delivering some homily of an uncomplimentary nature operated as a check on the captains hospitable thoughts and rendered him timid of giving them encouragement  one fact was quite clear to the captain as walter sitting thoughtfully over his untasted dinner dwelt on all that had happened namely that however walters modesty might stand in the way of his perceiving it himself he was as one might say a member of mr dombeys family he had been in his own person connected with the incident he so pathetically described he had been by name remembered and commended in close association with it and his fortunes must have a particular interest in his employers eyes if the captain had any lurking doubt whatever of his own conclusions he had not the least doubt that they were good conclusions for the peace of mind of the instrumentmaker therefore he availed himself of so favourable a moment for breaking the west indian intelligence to his friend as a piece of extraordinary preferment declaring that for his part he would freely give a hundred thousand pounds if he had it for walters gain in the longrun and that he had no doubt such an investment would yield a handsome premium  solomon gills was at first stunned by the communication which fell upon the little backparlour like a thunderbolt and tore up the hearth savagely but the captain flashed such golden prospects before his dim sight hinted so mysteriously at whittingtonian consequences laid such emphasis on what walter had just now told them and appealed to it so confidently as a corroboration of his predictions and a great advance towards the realisation of the romantic legend of lovely peg that he bewildered the old man walter for his part feigned to be so full of hope and ardour and so sure of coming home again soon and backed up the captain with such expressive shakings of his head and rubbings of his hands that solomon looking first at him then at captain cuttle began to think he ought to be transported with joy  but im behind the time you understand he observed in apology passing his hand nervously down the whole row of bright buttons on his coat and then up again as if they were beads and he were telling them twice over and i would rather have my dear boy here its an oldfashioned notion i daresay he was always fond of the sea hesand he looked wistfully at walterhes glad to go  uncle sol cried walter quickly if you say that i wont go no captain cuttle i wont if my uncle thinks i could be glad to leave him though i was going to be made governor of all the islands in the west indies thats enough im a fixture  walr my lad said the captain steady sol gills take an observation of your nevy  following with his eyes the majestic action of the captains hook the old man looked at walter  here is a certain craft said the captain with a magnificent sense of the allegory into which he was soaring agoing to put out on a certain voyage what name is wrote upon that craft indelibly is it the gay or said the captain raising his voice as much as to say observe the point of this is it the gills  ned said the old man drawing walter to his side and taking his arm tenderly through his i know i know of course i know that wally considers me more than himself always thats in my mind when i say he is glad to go i mean i hope he is eh look you ned and you too wally my dear this is new and unexpected to me and im afraid my being behind the time and poor is at the bottom of it is it really good fortune for him do you tell me now said the old man looking anxiously from one to the other really and truly is it i can reconcile myself to almost anything that advances wally but i wont have wally putting himself at any disadvantage for me or keeping anything from me you ned cuttle said the old man fastening on the captain to the manifest confusion of that diplomatist are you dealing plainly by your old friend speak out ned cuttle is there anything behind ought he to go how do you know it first and why  as it was a contest of affection and selfdenial walter struck in with infinite effect to the captains relief and between them they tolerably reconciled old sol gills by continued talking to the project or rather so confused him that nothing not even the pain of separation was distinctly clear to his mind  he had not much time to balance the matter for on the very next day walter received from mr carker the manager the necessary credentials for his passage and outfit together with the information that the son and heir would sail in a fortnight or within a day or two afterwards at latest in the hurry of preparation which walter purposely enhanced as much as possible the old man lost what little selfpossession he ever had and so the time of departure drew on rapidly  the captain who did not fail to make himself acquainted with all that passed through inquiries of walter from day to day found the time still tending on towards his going away without any occasion offering itself or seeming likely to offer itself for a better understanding of his position it was after much consideration of this fact and much pondering over such an unfortunate combination of circumstances that a bright idea occurred to the captain suppose he made a call on mr carker and tried to find out from him how the land really lay  captain cuttle liked this idea very much it came upon him in a moment of inspiration as he was smoking an early pipe in brig place after breakfast and it was worthy of the tobacco it would quiet his conscience which was an honest one and was made a little uneasy by what walter had confided to him and what sol gills had said and it would be a deep shrewd act of friendship he would sound mr carker carefully and say much or little just as he read that gentlemans character and discovered that they got on well together or the reverse  accordingly without the fear of walter before his eyes who he knew was at home packing captain cuttle again assumed his anklejacks and mourning brooch and issued forth on this second expedition he purchased no propitiatory nosegay on the present occasion as he was going to a place of business but he put a small sunflower in his buttonhole to give himself an agreeable relish of the country and with this and the knobby stick and the glazed hat bore down upon the offices of dombey and son  after taking a glass of warm rumandwater at a tavern close by to collect his thoughts the captain made a rush down the court lest its good effects should evaporate and appeared suddenly to mr perch  matey said the captain in persuasive accents one of your governors is named carker mr perch admitted it but gave him to understand as in official duty bound that all his governors were engaged and never expected to be disengaged any more  lookee here mate said the captain in his ear my names capen cuttle  the captain would have hooked perch gently to him but mr perch eluded the attempt not so much in design as in starting at the sudden thought that such a weapon unexpectedly exhibited to mrs perch might in her then condition be destructive to that ladys hopes  if youll be so good as just report capen cuttle here when you get a chance said the captain ill wait  saying which the captain took his seat on mr perchs bracket and drawing out his handkerchief from the crown of the glazed hat which he jammed between his knees without injury to its shape for nothing human could bend it rubbed his head well all over and appeared refreshed he subsequently arranged his hair with his hook and sat looking round the office contemplating the clerks with a serene respect  the captains equanimity was so impenetrable and he was altogether so mysterious a being that perch the messenger was daunted  what name was it you said asked mr perch bending down over him as he sat on the bracket  capen in a deep hoarse whisper  yes said mr perch keeping time with his head  cuttle  oh said mr perch in the same tone for he caught it and couldnt help it the captain in his diplomacy was so impressive ill see if hes disengaged now i dont know perhaps he may be for a minute  ay ay my lad i wont detain him longer than a minute said the captain nodding with all the weighty importance that he felt within him perch soon returning said will captain cuttle walk this way  mr carker the manager standing on the hearthrug before the empty fireplace which was ornamented with a castellated sheet of brown paper looked at the captain as he came in with no very special encouragement  mr carker said captain cuttle  i believe so said mr carker showing all his teeth  the captain liked his answering with a smile it looked pleasant you see began the captain rolling his eyes slowly round the little room and taking in as much of it as his shirtcollar permitted im a seafaring man myself mr carker and walr as is on your books here is almost a son of mine  walter gay said mr carker showing all his teeth again  walr gay it is replied the captain right the captains manner expressed a warm approval of mr carkers quickness of perception im a intimate friend of his and his uncles perhaps said the captain you may have heard your head governor mention my namecaptain cuttle  no said mr carker with a still wider demonstration than before  well resumed the captain ive the pleasure of his acquaintance i waited upon him down on the sussex coast there with my young friend walr whenin short when there was a little accommodation wanted the captain nodded his head in a manner that was at once comfortable easy and expressive you remember i daresay  i think said mr carker i had the honour of arranging the business  to be sure returned the captain right again you had now ive took the liberty of coming here  wont you sit down said mr carker smiling  thankee returned the captain availing himself of the offer a man does get more way upon himself perhaps in his conversation when he sits down wont you take a cheer yourself  no thank you said the manager standing perhaps from the force of winter habit with his back against the chimneypiece and looking down upon the captain with an eye in every tooth and gum you have taken the liberty you were going to saythough its none  thankee kindly my lad returned the captain of coming here on account of my friend walr sol gills his uncle is a man of science and in science he may be considered a clipper but he aint what i should altogether call a able seamannot man of practice walr is as trim a lad as ever stepped but hes a little down by the head in one respect and that is modesty now what i should wish to put to you said the captain lowering his voice and speaking in a kind of confidential growl in a friendly way entirely between you and me and for my own private reckoning till your head governor has wore round a bit and i can come alongside of him is thisis everything right and comfortable here and is walr outard bound with a pretty fair wind  what do you think now captain cuttle returned carker gathering up his skirts and settling himself in his position you are a practical man what do you think  the acuteness and the significance of the captains eye as he cocked it in reply no words short of those unutterable chinese words before referred to could describe  come said the captain unspeakably encouraged what do you say am i right or wrong  so much had the captain expressed in his eye emboldened and incited by mr carkers smiling urbanity that he felt himself in as fair a condition to put the question as if he had expressed his sentiments with the utmost elaboration  right said mr carker i have no doubt  outard bound with fair weather then i say cried captain cuttle  mr carker smiled assent  wind right astarn and plenty of it pursued the captain  mr carker smiled assent again  ay ay said captain cuttle greatly relieved and pleased i knowd how she headed well enough i told walr so thankee thankee  gay has brilliant prospects observed mr carker stretching his mouth wider yet all the world before him  all the world and his wife too as the saying is returned the delighted captain  at the word wife which he had uttered without design the captain stopped cocked his eye again and putting the glazed hat on the top of the knobby stick gave it a twirl and looked sideways at his always smiling friend  id bet a gill of old jamaica said the captain eyeing him attentively that i know what youre a smiling at  mr carker took his cue and smiled the more  it goes no farther said the captain making a poke at the door with the knobby stick to assure himself that it was shut  not an inch said mr carker  youre thinking of a capital f perhaps said the captain  mr carker didnt deny it  anything about a l said the captain or a o  mr carker still smiled  am i right again inquired the captain in a whisper with the scarlet circle on his forehead swelling in his triumphant joy  mr carker in reply still smiling and now nodding assent captain cuttle rose and squeezed him by the hand assuring him warmly that they were on the same tack and that as for him cuttle he had laid his course that way all along he knowd her first said the captain with all the secrecy and gravity that the subject demanded in an uncommon manneryou remember his finding her in the street when she was amost a babbyhe has liked her ever since and she him as much as two youngsters can weve always said sol gills and me that they was cut out for each other  a cat or a monkey or a hyena or a deathshead could not have shown the captain more teeth at one time than mr carker showed him at this period of their interview  theres a general indraught that way observed the happy captain wind and water sets in that direction you see look at his being present tother day  most favourable to his hopes said mr carker  look at his being towed along in the wake of that day pursued the captain why what can cut him adrift now  nothing replied mr carker  youre right again returned the captain giving his hand another squeeze nothing it is so steady theres a son gone pretty little creetur aint there  yes theres a son gone said the acquiescent carker  pass the word and theres another ready for you quoth the captain nevy of a scientific uncle nevy of sol gills walr walr as is already in your business andsaid the captain rising gradually to a quotation he was preparing for a final burst whocomes from sol gillss daily to your business and your buzzums the captains complacency as he gently jogged mr carker with his elbow on concluding each of the foregoing short sentences could be surpassed by nothing but the exultation with which he fell back and eyed him when he had finished this brilliant display of eloquence and sagacity his great blue waistcoat heaving with the throes of such a masterpiece and his nose in a state of violent inflammation from the same cause  am i right said the captain  captain cuttle said mr carker bending down at the knees for a moment in an odd manner as if he were falling together to hug the whole of himself at once your views in reference to walter gay are thoroughly and accurately right i understand that we speak together in confidence  honour interposed the captain not a word  to him or anyone pursued the manager  captain cuttle frowned and shook his head  but merely for your own satisfaction and guidanceand guidance of course repeated mr carker with a view to your future proceedings  thankee kindly i am sure said the captain listening with great attention  i have no hesitation in saying thats the fact you have hit the probabilities exactly  and with regard to your head governor said the captain why an interview had better come about natral between us theres time enough  mr carker with his mouth from ear to ear repeated time enough not articulating the words but bowing his head affably and forming them with his tongue and lips  and as i knowits what i always saidthat walrs in a way to make his fortune said the captain  to make his fortune mr carker repeated in the same dumb manner  and as walrs going on this little voyage is as i may say in his days work and a part of his general expectations here said the captain  of his general expectations here assented mr carker dumbly as before  why so long as i know that pursued the captain theres no hurry and my minds at ease  mr carker still blandly assenting in the same voiceless manner captain cuttle was strongly confirmed in his opinion that he was one of the most agreeable men he had ever met and that even mr dombey might improve himself on such a model with great heartiness therefore the captain once again extended his enormous hand not unlike an old block in colour and gave him a grip that left upon his smoother flesh a proof impression of the chinks and crevices with which the captains palm was liberally tattooed  farewell said the captain i aint a man of many words but i take it very kind of you to be so friendly and aboveboard youll excuse me if ive been at all intruding will you said the captain  not at all returned the other  thankee my berth aint very roomy said the captain turning back again but its tolerably snug and if you was to find yourself near brig place number nine at any timewill you make a note of itand would come upstairs without minding what was said by the person at the door i should be proud to see you  with that hospitable invitation the captain said good day and walked out and shut the door leaving mr carker still reclining against the chimneypiece in whose sly look and watchful manner in whose false mouth stretched but not laughing in whose spotless cravat and very whiskers even in whose silent passing of his soft hand over his white linen and his smooth face there was something desperately catlike  the unconscious captain walked out in a state of selfglorification that imparted quite a new cut to the broad blue suit stand by ned said the captain to himself youve done a little business for the youngsters today my lad  in his exultation and in his familiarity present and prospective with the house the captain when he reached the outer office could not refrain from rallying mr perch a little and asking him whether he thought everybody was still engaged but not to be bitter on a man who had done his duty the captain whispered in his ear that if he felt disposed for a glass of rumandwater and would follow he would be happy to bestow the same upon him  before leaving the premises the captain somewhat to the astonishment of the clerks looked round from a central point of view and took a general survey of the officers part and parcel of a project in which his young friend was nearly interested the strongroom excited his especial admiration but that he might not appear too particular he limited himself to an approving glance and with a graceful recognition of the clerks as a body that was full of politeness and patronage passed out into the court being promptly joined by mr perch he conveyed that gentleman to the tavern and fulfilled his pledgehastily for perchs time was precious  ill give you for a toast said the captain walr  who submitted mr perch  walr repeated the captain in a voice of thunder  mr perch who seemed to remember having heard in infancy that there was once a poet of that name made no objection but he was much astonished at the captains coming into the city to propose a poet indeed if he had proposed to put a poets statue upsay shakespeares for examplein a civic thoroughfare he could hardly have done a greater outrage to mr perchs experience on the whole he was such a mysterious and incomprehensible character that mr perch decided not to mention him to mrs perch at all in case of giving rise to any disagreeable consequences  mysterious and incomprehensible the captain with that lively sense upon him of having done a little business for the youngsters remained all day even to his most intimate friends and but that walter attributed his winks and grins and other such pantomimic reliefs of himself to his satisfaction in the success of their innocent deception upon old sol gills he would assuredly have betrayed himself before night as it was however he kept his own secret and went home late from the instrumentmakers house wearing the glazed hat so much on one side and carrying such a beaming expression in his eyes that mrs macstinger who might have been brought up at doctor blimbers she was such a roman matron fortified herself at the first glimpse of him behind the open street door and refused to come out to the contemplation of her blessed infants until he was securely lodged in his own room    chapter 18 father and daughter   there is a hush through mr dombeys house servants gliding up and down stairs rustle but make no sound of footsteps they talk together constantly and sit long at meals making much of their meat and drink and enjoying themselves after a grim unholy fashion mrs wickam with her eyes suffused with tears relates melancholy anecdotes and tells them how she always said at mrs pipchins that it would be so and takes more tableale than usual and is very sorry but sociable cooks state of mind is similar she promises a little fry for supper and struggles about equally against her feelings and the onions towlinson begins to think theres a fate in it and wants to know if anybody can tell him of any good that ever came of living in a corner house it seems to all of them as having happened a long time ago though yet the child lies calm and beautiful upon his little bed  after dark there come some visitorsnoiseless visitors with shoes of feltwho have been there before and with them comes that bed of rest which is so strange a one for infant sleepers all this time the bereaved father has not been seen even by his attendant for he sits in an inner corner of his own dark room when anyone is there and never seems to move at other times except to pace it to and fro but in the morning it is whispered among the household that he was heard to go upstairs in the dead night and that he stayed therein the roomuntil the sun was shining  at the offices in the city the groundglass windows are made more dim by shutters and while the lighted lamps upon the desks are half extinguished by the day that wanders in the day is half extinguished by the lamps and an unusual gloom prevails there is not much business done the clerks are indisposed to work and they make assignations to eat chops in the afternoon and go up the river perch the messenger stays long upon his errands and finds himself in bars of publichouses invited thither by friends and holding forth on the uncertainty of human affairs he goes home to balls pond earlier in the evening than usual and treats mrs perch to a veal cutlet and scotch ale mr carker the manager treats no one neither is he treated but alone in his own room he shows his teeth all day and it would seem that there is something gone from mr carkers pathsome obstacle removedwhich clears his way before him  now the rosy children living opposite to mr dombeys house peep from their nursery windows down into the street for there are four black horses at his door with feathers on their heads and feathers tremble on the carriage that they draw and these and an array of men with scarves and staves attract a crowd the juggler who was going to twirl the basin puts his loose coat on again over his fine dress and his trudging wife onesided with her heavy baby in her arms loiters to see the company come out but closer to her dingy breast she presses her baby when the burden that is so easily carried is borne forth and the youngest of the rosy children at the high window opposite needs no restraining hand to check her in her glee when pointing with her dimpled finger she looks into her nurses face and asks whats that  and now among the knot of servants dressed in mourning and the weeping women mr dombey passes through the hall to the other carriage that is waiting to receive him he is not brought down these observers think by sorrow and distress of mind his walk is as erect his bearing is as stiff as ever it has been he hides his face behind no handkerchief and looks before him but that his face is something sunk and rigid and is pale it bears the same expression as of old he takes his place within the carriage and three other gentlemen follow then the grand funeral moves slowly down the street the feathers are yet nodding in the distance when the juggler has the basin spinning on a cane and has the same crowd to admire it but the jugglers wife is less alert than usual with the moneybox for a childs burial has set her thinking that perhaps the baby underneath her shabby shawl may not grow up to be a man and wear a skyblue fillet round his head and salmoncoloured worsted drawers and tumble in the mud  the feathers wind their gloomy way along the streets and come within the sound of a church bell in this same church the pretty boy received all that will soon be left of him on eartha name all of him that is dead they lay there near the perishable substance of his mother it is well their ashes lie where florence in her walksoh lonely lonely walksmay pass them any day  the service over and the clergyman withdrawn mr dombey looks round demanding in a low voice whether the person who has been requested to attend to receive instructions for the tablet is there  someone comes forward and says yes  mr dombey intimates where he would have it placed and shows him with his hand upon the wall the shape and size and how it is to follow the memorial to the mother then with his pencil he writes out the inscription and gives it to him adding i wish to have it done at once  it shall be done immediately sir  there is really nothing to inscribe but name and age you see  the man bows glancing at the paper but appears to hesitate mr dombey not observing his hesitation turns away and leads towards the porch  i beg your pardon sir a touch falls gently on his mourning cloak but as you wish it done immediately and it may be put in hand when i get back  well  will you be so good as read it over again i think theres a mistake  where  the statuary gives him back the paper and points out with his pocket rule the words beloved and only child  it should be son i think sir  you are right of course make the correction  the father with a hastier step pursues his way to the coach when the other three who follow closely take their seats his face is hidden for the first timeshaded by his cloak nor do they see it any more that day he alights first and passes immediately into his own room the other mourners who are only mr chick and two of the medical attendants proceed upstairs to the drawingroom to be received by mrs chick and miss tox and what the face is in the shutup chamber underneath or what the thoughts are what the heart is what the contest or the suffering no one knows  the chief thing that they know below stairs in the kitchen is that it seems like sunday they can hardly persuade themselves but that there is something unbecoming if not wicked in the conduct of the people out of doors who pursue their ordinary occupations and wear their everyday attire it is quite a novelty to have the blinds up and the shutters open and they make themselves dismally comfortable over bottles of wine which are freely broached as on a festival they are much inclined to moralise mr towlinson proposes with a sigh amendment to us all for which as cook says with another sigh theres room enough god knows in the evening mrs chick and miss tox take to needlework again in the evening also mr towlinson goes out to take the air accompanied by the housemaid who has not yet tried her mourning bonnet they are very tender to each other at dusky streetcorners and towlinson has visions of leading an altered and blameless existence as a serious greengrocer in oxford market  there is sounder sleep and deeper rest in mr dombeys house tonight than there has been for many nights the morning sun awakens the old household settled down once more in their old ways the rosy children opposite run past with hoops there is a splendid wedding in the church the jugglers wife is active with the moneybox in another quarter of the town the mason sings and whistles as he chips out paul in the marble slab before him  and can it be that in a world so full and busy the loss of one weak creature makes a void in any heart so wide and deep that nothing but the width and depth of vast eternity can fill it up florence in her innocent affliction might have answered oh my brother oh my dearly loved and loving brother only friend and companion of my slighted childhood could any less idea shed the light already dawning on your early grave or give birth to the softened sorrow that is springing into life beneath this rain of tears  my dear child said mrs chick who held it as a duty incumbent on her to improve the occasion when you are as old as i am  which will be the prime of life observed miss tox  you will then pursued mrs chick gently squeezing miss toxs hand in acknowledgment of her friendly remark you will then know that all grief is unavailing and that it is our duty to submit  i will try dear aunt i do try answered florence sobbing  i am glad to hear it said mrs chick because my love as our dear miss toxof whose sound sense and excellent judgment there cannot possibly be two opinions  my dear louisa i shall really be proud soon said miss toxwill tell you and confirm by her experience pursued mrs chick we are called upon on all occasions to make an effort it is required of us if anymy dear turning to miss tox i want a word mismis  demeanour suggested miss tox  no no no said mrs chic how can you goodness me its on the end of my tongue mis  placed affection suggested miss tox timidly  good gracious lucretia returned mrs chick how very monstrous misanthrope is the word i want the idea misplaced affection i say if any misanthrope were to put in my presence the question why were we born i should reply to make an effort  very good indeed said miss tox much impressed by the originality of the sentiment very good  unhappily pursued mrs chick we have a warning under our own eyes we have but too much reason to suppose my dear child that if an effort had been made in time in this family a train of the most trying and distressing circumstances might have been avoided nothing shall ever persuade me observed the good matron with a resolute air but that if that effort had been made by poor dear fanny the poor dear darling child would at least have had a stronger constitution  mrs chick abandoned herself to her feelings for half a moment but as a practical illustration of her doctrine brought herself up short in the middle of a sob and went on again  therefore florence pray let us see that you have some strength of mind and do not selfishly aggravate the distress in which your poor papa is plunged  dear aunt said florence kneeling quickly down before her that she might the better and more earnestly look into her face tell me more about papa pray tell me about him is he quite heartbroken  miss tox was of a tender nature and there was something in this appeal that moved her very much whether she saw it in a succession on the part of the neglected child to the affectionate concern so often expressed by her dead brotheror a love that sought to twine itself about the heart that had loved him and that could not bear to be shut out from sympathy with such a sorrow in such sad community of love and griefor whether the only recognised the earnest and devoted spirit which although discarded and repulsed was wrung with tenderness long unreturned and in the waste and solitude of this bereavement cried to him to seek a comfort in it and to give some by some small responsewhatever may have been her understanding of it it moved miss tox for the moment she forgot the majesty of mrs chick and patting florence hastily on the cheek turned aside and suffered the tears to gush from her eyes without waiting for a lead from that wise matron  mrs chick herself lost for a moment the presence of mind on which she so much prided herself and remained mute looking on the beautiful young face that had so long so steadily and patiently been turned towards the little bed but recovering her voicewhich was synonymous with her presence of mind indeed they were one and the same thingshe replied with dignity  florence my dear child your poor papa is peculiar at times and to question me about him is to question me upon a subject which i really do not pretend to understand i believe i have as much influence with your papa as anybody has still all i can say is that he has said very little to me and that i have only seen him once or twice for a minute at a time and indeed have hardly seen him then for his room has been dark i have said to your papa paulthat is the exact expression i usedpaul why do you not take something stimulating your papas reply has always been louisa have the goodness to leave me i want nothing i am better by myself if i was to be put upon my oath tomorrow lucretia before a magistrate said mrs chick i have no doubt i could venture to swear to those identical words  miss tox expressed her admiration by saying my louisa is ever methodical  in short florence resumed her aunt literally nothing has passed between your poor papa and myself until today when i mentioned to your papa that sir barnet and lady skettles had written exceedingly kind notesour sweet boy lady skettles loved him like awheres my pocket handkerchief  miss tox produced one  exceedingly kind notes proposing that you should visit them for change of scene mentioning to your papa that i thought miss tox and myself might now go home in which he quite agreed i inquired if he had any objection to your accepting this invitation he said no louisa not the least florence raised her tearful eye  at the same time if you would prefer staying here florence to paying this visit at present or to going home with me  i should much prefer it aunt was the faint rejoinder  why then childsaid mrs chick you can its a strange choice i must say but you always were strange anybody else at your time of life and after what has passedmy dear miss tox i have lost my pocket handkerchief againwould be glad to leave here one would suppose  i should not like to feel said florence as if the house was avoided i should not like to think that thehisthe rooms upstairs were quite empty and dreary aunt i would rather stay here for the present oh my brother oh my brother  it was a natural emotion not to be suppressed and it would make way even between the fingers of the hands with which she covered up her face the overcharged and heavyladen breast must some times have that vent or the poor wounded solitary heart within it would have fluttered like a bird with broken wings and sunk down in the dust  well child said mrs chick after a pause i wouldnt on any account say anything unkind to you and that im sure you know you will remain here then and do exactly as you like no one will interfere with you florence or wish to interfere with you im sure  florence shook her head in sad assent  i had no sooner begun to advise your poor papa that he really ought to seek some distraction and restoration in a temporary change said mrs chick than he told me he had already formed the intention of going into the country for a short time im sure i hope hell go very soon he cant go too soon but i suppose there are some arrangements connected with his private papers and so forth consequent on the affliction that has tried us all so muchi cant think whats become of mine lucretia lend me yours my dearthat may occupy him for one or two evenings in his own room your papas a dombey child if ever there was one said mrs chick drying both her eyes at once with great care on opposite corners of miss toxs handkerchief hell make an effort theres no fear of him  is there nothing aunt said florence trembling i might do to lord my dear child interposed mrs chick hastily what are you talking about if your papa said to mei have given you his exact words louisa i want nothing i am better by myselfwhat do you think hed say to you you mustnt show yourself to him child dont dream of such a thing  aunt said florence i will go and lie down on my bed  mrs chick approved of this resolution and dismissed her with a kiss but miss tox on a faint pretence of looking for the mislaid handkerchief went upstairs after her and tried in a few stolen minutes to comfort her in spite of great discouragement from susan nipper for miss nipper in her burning zeal disparaged miss tox as a crocodile yet her sympathy seemed genuine and had at least the vantageground of disinterestednessthere was little favour to be won by it  and was there no one nearer and dearer than susan to uphold the striving heart in its anguish was there no other neck to clasp no other face to turn to no one else to say a soothing word to such deep sorrow was florence so alone in the bleak world that nothing else remained to her nothing stricken motherless and brotherless at oncefor in the loss of little paul that first and greatest loss fell heavily upon herthis was the only help she had oh who can tell how much she needed help at first  at first when the house subsided into its accustomed course and they had all gone away except the servants and her father shut up in his own rooms florence could do nothing but weep and wander up and down and sometimes in a sudden pang of desolate remembrance fly to her own chamber wring her hands lay her face down on her bed and know no consolation nothing but the bitterness and cruelty of grief this commonly ensued upon the recognition of some spot or object very tenderly dated with him and it made the ale house at first a place of agony  but it is not in the nature of pure love to burn so fiercely and unkindly long the flame that in its grosser composition has the taint of earth may prey upon the breast that gives it shelter but the fire from heaven is as gentle in the heart as when it rested on the heads of the assembled twelve and showed each man his brother brightened and unhurt the image conjured up there soon returned the placid face the softened voice the loving looks the quiet trustfulness and peace and florence though she wept still wept more tranquilly and courted the remembrance  it was not very long before the golden water dancing on the wall in the old place at the old serene time had her calm eye fixed upon it as it ebbed away it was not very long before that room again knew her often sitting there alone as patient and as mild as when she had watched beside the little bed when any sharp sense of its being empty smote upon her she could kneel beside it and pray godit was the pouring out of her full heartto let one angel love her and remember her  it was not very long before in the midst of the dismal house so wide and dreary her low voice in the twilight slowly and stopping sometimes touched the old air to which he had so often listened with his drooping head upon her arm and after that and when it was quite dark a little strain of music trembled in the room so softly played and sung that it was more like the mournful recollection of what she had done at his request on that last night than the reality repeated but it was repeated oftenvery often in the shadowy solitude and broken murmurs of the strain still trembled on the keys when the sweet voice was hushed in tears  thus she gained heart to look upon the work with which her fingers had been busy by his side on the seashore and thus it was not very long before she took to it againwith something of a human love for it as if it had been sentient and had known him and sitting in a window near her mothers picture in the unused room so long deserted wore away the thoughtful hours  why did the dark eyes turn so often from this work to where the rosy children lived they were not immediately suggestive of her loss for they were all girls four little sisters but they were motherless like herand had a father  it was easy to know when he had gone out and was expected home for the elder child was always dressed and waiting for him at the drawingroom window or on the balcony and when he appeared her expectant face lighted up with joy while the others at the high window and always on the watch too clapped their hands and drummed them on the sill and called to him the elder child would come down to the hall and put her hand in his and lead him up the stairs and florence would see her afterwards sitting by his side or on his knee or hanging coaxingly about his neck and talking to him and though they were always gay together he would often watch her face as if he thought her like her mother that was dead florence would sometimes look no more at this and bursting into tears would hide behind the curtain as if she were frightened or would hurry from the window yet she could not help returning and her work would soon fall unheeded from her hands again  it was the house that had been empty years ago it had remained so for a long time at last and while she had been away from home this family had taken it and it was repaired and newly painted and there were birds and flowers about it and it looked very different from its old self but she never thought of the house the children and their father were all in all  when he had dined she could see them through the open windows go down with their governess or nurse and cluster round the table and in the still summer weather the sound of their childish voices and clear laughter would come ringing across the street into the drooping air of the room in which she sat then they would climb and clamber upstairs with him and romp about him on the sofa or group themselves at his knee a very nosegay of little faces while he seemed to tell them some story or they would come running out into the balcony and then florence would hide herself quickly lest it should check them in their joy to see her in her black dress sitting there alone  the elder child remained with her father when the rest had gone away and made his tea for himhappy little housekeeper she was thenand sat conversing with him sometimes at the window sometimes in the room until the candles came he made her his companion though she was some years younger than florence and she could be as staid and pleasantly demure with her little book or workbox as a woman when they had candles florence from her own dark room was not afraid to look again but when the time came for the child to say goodnight papa and go to bed florence would sob and tremble as she raised her face to him and could look no more  though still she would turn again and again before going to bed herself from the simple air that had lulled him to rest so often long ago and from the other low soft broken strain of music back to that house but that she ever thought of it or watched it was a secret which she kept within her own young breast  and did that breast of florenceflorence so ingenuous and trueso worthy of the love that he had borne her and had whispered in his last faint wordswhose guileless heart was mirrored in the beauty of her face and breathed in every accent of her gentle voicedid that young breast hold any other secret yes one more  when no one in the house was stirring and the lights were all extinguished she would softly leave her own room and with noiseless feet descend the staircase and approach her fathers door against it scarcely breathing she would rest her face and head and press her lips in the yearning of her love she crouched upon the cold stone floor outside it every night to listen even for his breath and in her one absorbing wish to be allowed to show him some affection to be a consolation to him to win him over to the endurance of some tenderness from her his solitary child she would have knelt down at his feet if she had dared in humble supplication  no one knew it no one thought of it the door was ever closed and he shut up within he went out once or twice and it was said in the house that he was very soon going on his country journey but he lived in those rooms and lived alone and never saw her or inquired for her perhaps he did not even know that she was in the house  one day about a week after the funeral florence was sitting at her work when susan appeared with a face half laughing and half crying to announce a visitor  a visitor to me susan said florence looking up in astonishment  well it is a wonder aint it now miss floy said susan but i wish you had a many visitors i do indeed for youd be all the better for it and its my opinion that the sooner you and me goes even to them old skettleses miss the better for both i may not wish to live in crowds miss floy but still im not a oyster  to do miss nipper justice she spoke more for her young mistress than herself and her face showed it  but the visitor susan said florence  susan with an hysterical explosion that was as much a laugh as a sob and as much a sob as a laugh answered  mr toots  the smile that appeared on florences face passed from it in a moment and her eyes filled with tears but at any rate it was a smile and that gave great satisfaction to miss nipper  my own feelings exactly miss floy said susan putting her apron to her eyes and shaking her head immediately i see that innocent in the hall miss floy i burst out laughing first and then i choked  susan nipper involuntarily proceeded to do the like again on the spot in the meantime mr toots who had come upstairs after her all unconscious of the effect he produced announced himself with his knuckles on the door and walked in very briskly  how dye do miss dombey said mr toots im very well i thank you how are you  mr tootsthan whom there were few better fellows in the world though there may have been one or two brighter spiritshad laboriously invented this long burst of discourse with the view of relieving the feelings both of florence and himself but finding that he had run through his property as it were in an injudicious manner by squandering the whole before taking a chair or before florence had uttered a word or before he had well got in at the door he deemed it advisable to begin again  how dye do miss dombey said mr toots im very well i thank you how are you  florence gave him her hand and said she was very well  im very well indeed said mr toots taking a chair very well indeed i am i dont remember said mr toots after reflecting a little that i was ever better thank you  its very kind of you to come said florence taking up her work i am very glad to see you  mr toots responded with a chuckle thinking that might be too lively he corrected it with a sigh thinking that might be too melancholy he corrected it with a chuckle not thoroughly pleasing himself with either mode of reply he breathed hard  you were very kind to my dear brother said florence obeying her own natural impulse to relieve him by saying so he often talked to me about you  oh its of no consequence said mr toots hastily warm aint it  it is beautiful weather replied florence  it agrees with me said mr toots i dont think i ever was so well as i find myself at present im obliged to you  after stating this curious and unexpected fact mr toots fell into a deep well of silence  you have left dr blimbers i think said florence trying to help him out  i should hope so returned mr toots and tumbled in again  he remained at the bottom apparently drowned for at least ten minutes at the expiration of that period he suddenly floated and said  well good morning miss dombey  are you going asked florence rising  i dont know though no not just at present said mr toots sitting down again most unexpectedly the fact isi say miss dombey  dont be afraid to speak to me said florence with a quiet smile i should be very glad if you would talk about my brother  would you though retorted mr toots with sympathy in every fibre of his otherwise expressionless face poor dombey im sure i never thought that burgess and cofashionable tailors but very dear that we used to talk aboutwould make this suit of clothes for such a purpose mr toots was dressed in mourning poor dombey i say miss dombey blubbered toots  yes said florence  theres a friend he took to very much at last i thought youd like to have him perhaps as a sort of keepsake you remember his remembering diogenes  oh yes oh yes cried florence  poor dombey so do i said mr toots  mr toots seeing florence in tears had great difficulty in getting beyond this point and had nearly tumbled into the well again but a chuckle saved him on the brink  i say he proceeded miss dombey i could have had him stolen for ten shillings if they hadnt given him up and i would but they were glad to get rid of him i think if youd like to have him hes at the door i brought him on purpose for you he aint a ladys dog you know said mr toots but you wont mind that will you  in fact diogenes was at that moment as they presently ascertained from looking down into the street staring through the window of a hackney cabriolet into which for conveyance to that spot he had been ensnared on a false pretence of rats among the straw sooth to say he was as unlike a ladys dog as might be and in his gruff anxiety to get out presented an appearance sufficiently unpromising as he gave short yelps out of one side of his mouth and overbalancing himself by the intensity of every one of those efforts tumbled down into the straw and then sprung panting up again putting out his tongue as if he had come express to a dispensary to be examined for his health  but though diogenes was as ridiculous a dog as one would meet with on a summers day a blundering illfavoured clumsy bulletheaded dog continually acting on a wrong idea that there was an enemy in the neighbourhood whom it was meritorious to bark at and though he was far from goodtempered and certainly was not clever and had hair all over his eyes and a comic nose and an inconsistent tail and a gruff voice he was dearer to florence in virtue of that parting remembrance of him and that request that he might be taken care of than the most valuable and beautiful of his kind so dear indeed was this same ugly diogenes and so welcome to her that she took the jewelled hand of mr toots and kissed it in her gratitude and when diogenes released came tearing up the stairs and bouncing into the room such a business as there was first to get him out of the cabriolet dived under all the furniture and wound a long iron chain that dangled from his neck round legs of chairs and tables and then tugged at it until his eyes became unnaturally visible in consequence of their nearly starting out of his head and when he growled at mr toots who affected familiarity and went pellmell at towlinson morally convinced that he was the enemy whom he had barked at round the corner all his life and had never seen yet florence was as pleased with him as if he had been a miracle of discretion  mr toots was so overjoyed by the success of his present and was so delighted to see florence bending down over diogenes smoothing his coarse back with her little delicate handdiogenes graciously allowing it from the first moment of their acquaintancethat he felt it difficult to take leave and would no doubt have been a much longer time in making up his mind to do so if he had not been assisted by diogenes himself who suddenly took it into his head to bay mr toots and to make short runs at him with his mouth open not exactly seeing his way to the end of these demonstrations and sensible that they placed the pantaloons constructed by the art of burgess and co in jeopardy mr toots with chuckles lapsed out at the door by which after looking in again two or three times without any object at all and being on each occasion greeted with a fresh run from diogenes he finally took himself off and got away  come then di dear di make friends with your new mistress let us love each other disaid florence fondling his shaggy head and di the rough and gruff as if his hairy hide were pervious to the tear that dropped upon it and his dogs heart melted as it fell put his nose up to her face and swore fidelity  diogenes the man did not speak plainer to alexander the great than diogenes the dog spoke to florence he subscribed to the offer of his little mistress cheerfully and devoted himself to her service a banquet was immediately provided for him in a corner and when he had eaten and drunk his fill he went to the window where florence was sitting looking on rose up on his hind legs with his awkward fore paws on her shoulders licked her face and hands nestled his great head against her heart and wagged his tail till he was tired finally diogenes coiled himself up at her feet and went to sleep  although miss nipper was nervous in regard of dogs and felt it necessary to come into the room with her skirts carefully collected about her as if she were crossing a brook on steppingstones also to utter little screams and stand up on chairs when diogenes stretched himself she was in her own manner affected by the kindness of mr toots and could not see florence so alive to the attachment and society of this rude friend of little pauls without some mental comments thereupon that brought the water to her eyes mr dombey as a part of her reflections may have been in the association of ideas connected with the dog but at any rate after observing diogenes and his mistress all the evening and after exerting herself with much goodwill to provide diogenes a bed in an antechamber outside his mistresss door she said hurriedly to florence before leaving her for the night  your pas a going off miss floy tomorrow morning  tomorrow morning susan  yes miss thats the orders early  do you know asked florence without looking at her where papa is going susan  not exactly miss hes going to meet that precious major first and i must say if i was acquainted with any major myself which heavens forbid it shouldnt be a blue one  hush susan urged florence gently  well miss floy returned miss nipper who was full of burning indignation and minded her stops even less than usual i cant help it blue he is and while i was a christian although humble i would have naturalcoloured friends or none  it appeared from what she added and had gleaned downstairs that mrs chick had proposed the major for mr dombeys companion and that mr dombey after some hesitation had invited him  talk of him being a change indeed observed miss nipper to herself with boundless contempt if hes a change give me a constancy  goodnight susan said florence  goodnight my darling dear miss floy  her tone of commiseration smote the chord so often roughly touched but never listened to while she or anyone looked on florence left alone laid her head upon her hand and pressing the other over her swelling heart held free communication with her sorrows  it was a wet night and the melancholy rain fell pattering and dropping with a weary sound a sluggish wind was blowing and went moaning round the house as if it were in pain or grief a shrill noise quivered through the trees while she sat weeping it grew late and dreary midnight tolled out from the steeples  florence was little more than a child in yearsnot yet fourteenand the loneliness and gloom of such an hour in the great house where death had lately made its own tremendous devastation might have set an older fancy brooding on vague terrors but her innocent imagination was too full of one theme to admit them nothing wandered in her thoughts but lovea wandering love indeed and castawaybut turning always to her father there was nothing in the dropping of the rain the moaning of the wind the shuddering of the trees the striking of the solemn clocks that shook this one thought or diminished its interest her recollections of the dear dead boyand they were never absentwere itself the same thing and oh to be shut out to be so lost never to have looked into her fathers face or touched him since that hour  she could not go to bed poor child and never had gone yet since then without making her nightly pilgrimage to his door it would have been a strange sad sight to see her now stealing lightly down the stairs through the thick gloom and stopping at it with a beating heart and blinded eyes and hair that fell down loosely and unthought of and touching it outside with her wet cheek but the night covered it and no one knew  the moment that she touched the door on this night florence found that it was open for the first time it stood open though by but a hairsbreadth and there was a light within the first impulse of the timid childand she yielded to itwas to retire swiftly her next to go back and to enter and this second impulse held her in irresolution on the staircase  in its standing open even by so much as that chink there seemed to be hope there was encouragement in seeing a ray of light from within stealing through the dark stern doorway and falling in a thread upon the marble floor she turned back hardly knowing what she did but urged on by the love within her and the trial they had undergone together but not shared and with her hands a little raised and trembling glided in  her father sat at his old table in the middle room he had been arranging some papers and destroying others and the latter lay in fragile ruins before him the rain dripped heavily upon the glass panes in the outer room where he had so often watched poor paul a baby and the low complainings of the wind were heard without  but not by him he sat with his eyes fixed on the table so immersed in thought that a far heavier tread than the light foot of his child could make might have failed to rouse him his face was turned towards her by the waning lamp and at that haggard hour it looked worn and dejected and in the utter loneliness surrounding him there was an appeal to florence that struck home  papa papa speak to me dear papa  he started at her voice and leaped up from his seat she was close before him with extended arms but he fell back  what is the matter he said sternly why do you come here what has frightened you  if anything had frightened her it was the face he turned upon her the glowing love within the breast of his young daughter froze before it and she stood and looked at him as if stricken into stone  there was not one touch of tenderness or pity in it there was not one gleam of interest parental recognition or relenting in it there was a change in it but not of that kind the old indifference and cold constraint had given place to something what she never thought and did not dare to think and yet she felt it in its force and knew it well without a name that as it looked upon her seemed to cast a shadow on her head  did he see before him the successful rival of his son in health and life did he look upon his own successful rival in that sons affection did a mad jealousy and withered pride poison sweet remembrances that should have endeared and made her precious to him could it be possible that it was gall to him to look upon her in her beauty and her promise thinking of his infant boy  florence had no such thoughts but love is quick to know when it is spurned and hopeless and hope died out of hers as she stood looking in her fathers face  i ask you florence are you frightened is there anything the matter that you come here  i came papa  against my wishes why  she saw he knew why it was written broadly on his face and dropped her head upon her hands with one prolonged low cry  let him remember it in that room years to come it has faded from the air before he breaks the silence it may pass as quickly from his brain as he believes but it is there let him remember it in that room years to come  he took her by the arm his hand was cold and loose and scarcely closed upon her  you are tired i daresay he said taking up the light and leading her towards the door and want rest we all want rest go florence you have been dreaming  the dream she had had was over then god help her and she felt that it could never more come back  i will remain here to light you up the stairs the whole house is yours above there said her father slowly you are its mistress now goodnight  still covering her face she sobbed and answered goodnight dear papa and silently ascended once she looked back as if she would have returned to him but for fear it was a momentary thought too hopeless to encourage and her father stood there with the lighthard unresponsive motionlessuntil the fluttering dress of his fair child was lost in the darkness  let him remember it in that room years to come the rain that falls upon the roof the wind that mourns outside the door may have foreknowledge in their melancholy sound let him remember it in that room years to come  the last time he had watched her from the same place winding up those stairs she had had her brother in her arms it did not move his heart towards her now it steeled it but he went into his room and locked his door and sat down in his chair and cried for his lost boy  diogenes was broad awake upon his post and waiting for his little mistress  oh di oh dear di love me for his sake  diogenes already loved her for her own and didnt care how much he showed it so he made himself vastly ridiculous by performing a variety of uncouth bounces in the antechamber and concluded when poor florence was at last asleep and dreaming of the rosy children opposite by scratching open her bedroom door rolling up his bed into a pillow lying down on the boards at the full length of his tether with his head towards her and looking lazily at her upside down out of the tops of his eyes until from winking and winking he fell asleep himself and dreamed with gruff barks of his enemy    chapter 19 walter goes away   the wooden midshipman at the instrumentmakers door like the hardhearted little midshipman he was remained supremely indifferent to walters going away even when the very last day of his sojourn in the back parlour was on the decline with his quadrant at his round black knob of an eye and his figure in its old attitude of indomitable alacrity the midshipman displayed his elfin smallclothes to the best advantage and absorbed in scientific pursuits had no sympathy with worldly concerns he was so far the creature of circumstances that a dry day covered him with dust and a misty day peppered him with little bits of soot and a wet day brightened up his tarnished uniform for the moment and a very hot day blistered him but otherwise he was a callous obdurate conceited midshipman intent on his own discoveries and caring as little for what went on about him terrestrially as archimedes at the taking of syracuse  such a midshipman he seemed to be at least in the then position of domestic affairs walter eyed him kindly many a time in passing in and out and poor old sol when walter was not there would come and lean against the doorpost resting his weary wig as near the shoebuckles of the guardian genius of his trade and shop as he could but no fierce idol with a mouth from ear to ear and a murderous visage made of parrots feathers was ever more indifferent to the appeals of its savage votaries than was the midshipman to these marks of attachment  walters heart felt heavy as he looked round his old bedroom up among the parapets and chimneypots and thought that one more night already darkening would close his acquaintance with it perhaps for ever dismantled of his little stock of books and pictures it looked coldly and reproachfully on him for his desertion and had already a foreshadowing upon it of its coming strangeness a few hours more thought walter and no dream i ever had here when i was a schoolboy will be so little mine as this old room the dream may come back in my sleep and i may return waking to this place it may be but the dream at least will serve no other master and the room may have a score and every one of them may change neglect misuse it  but his uncle was not to be left alone in the little back parlour where he was then sitting by himself for captain cuttle considerate in his roughness stayed away against his will purposely that they should have some talk together unobserved so walter newly returned home from his last days bustle descended briskly to bear him company  uncle he said gaily laying his hand upon the old mans shoulder what shall i send you home from barbados  hope my dear wally hope that we shall meet again on this side of the grave send me as much of that as you can  so i will uncle i have enough and to spare and ill not be chary of it and as to lively turtles and limes for captain cuttles punch and preserves for you on sundays and all that sort of thing why ill send you shiploads uncle when im rich enough  old sol wiped his spectacles and faintly smiled  thats right uncle cried walter merrily and clapping him half a dozen times more upon the shoulder you cheer up me ill cheer up you well be as gay as larks tomorrow morning uncle and well fly as high as to my anticipations they are singing out of sight now  wally my dear boy returned the old man ill do my best ill do my best  and your best uncle said walter with his pleasant laugh is the best best that i know youll not forget what youre to send me uncle  no wally no replied the old man everything i hear about miss dombey now that she is left alone poor lamb ill write i fear it wont be much though wally  why ill tell you what uncle said walter after a moments hesitation i have just been up there  ay ay ay murmured the old man raising his eyebrows and his spectacles with them  not to see her said walter though i could have seen her i daresay if i had asked mr dombey being out of town but to say a parting word to susan i thought i might venture to do that you know under the circumstances and remembering when i saw miss dombey last  yes my boy yes replied his uncle rousing himself from a temporary abstraction  so i saw her pursued walter susan i mean and i told her i was off and away tomorrow and i said uncle that you had always had an interest in miss dombey since that night when she was here and always wished her well and happy and always would be proud and glad to serve her in the least i thought i might say that you know under the circumstances dont you think so  yes my boy yes replied his uncle in the tone as before  and i added pursued walter that if shesusan i meancould ever let you know either through herself or mrs richards or anybody else who might be coming this way that miss dombey was well and happy you would take it very kindly and would write so much to me and i should take it very kindly too there upon my word uncle said walter i scarcely slept all last night through thinking of doing this and could not make up my mind when i was out whether to do it or not and yet i am sure it is the true feeling of my heart and i should have been quite miserable afterwards if i had not relieved it  his honest voice and manner corroborated what he said and quite established its ingenuousness  so if you ever see her uncle said walter i mean miss dombey nowand perhaps you may who knowstell her how much i felt for her how much i used to think of her when i was here how i spoke of her with the tears in my eyes uncle on this last night before i went away tell her that i said i never could forget her gentle manner or her beautiful face or her sweet kind disposition that was better than all and as i didnt take them from a womans feet or a young ladys only a little innocent childs said walter tell her if you dont mind uncle that i kept those shoesshell remember how often they fell off that nightand took them away with me as a remembrance  they were at that very moment going out at the door in one of walters trunks a porter carrying off his baggage on a truck for shipment at the docks on board the son and heir had got possession of them and wheeled them away under the very eye of the insensible midshipman before their owner had well finished speaking  but that ancient mariner might have been excused his insensibility to the treasure as it rolled away for under his eye at the same moment accurately within his range of observation coming full into the sphere of his startled and intensely wideawake lookout were florence and susan nipper florence looking up into his face half timidly and receiving the whole shock of his wooden ogling  more than this they passed into the shop and passed in at the parlour door before they were observed by anybody but the midshipman and walter having his back to the door would have known nothing of their apparition even then but for seeing his uncle spring out of his own chair and nearly tumble over another  why uncle exclaimed walter whats the matter  old solomon replied miss dombey  is it possible cried walter looking round and starting up in his turn here  why it was so possible and so actual that while the words were on his lips florence hurried past him took uncle sols snuffcoloured lapels one in each hand kissed him on the cheek and turning gave her hand to walter with a simple truth and earnestness that was her own and no one elses in the world  going away walter said florence  yes miss dombey he replied but not so hopefully as he endeavoured i have a voyage before me  and your uncle said florence looking back at solomon he is sorry you are going i am sure ah i see he is dear walter i am very sorry too  goodness knows exclaimed miss nipper theres a many we could spare instead if numbers is a object mrs pipchin as a overseer would come cheap at her weight in gold and if a knowledge of black slavery should be required them blimbers is the very people for the sitiwation  with that miss nipper untied her bonnet strings and alter looking vacantly for some moments into a little black teapot that was set forth with the usual homely service on the table shook her head and a tin canister and began unasked to make the tea  in the meantime florence had turned again to the instrumentmaker who was as full of admiration as surprise so grown said old sol so improved and yet not altered just the same  indeed said florence  yeyes returned old sol rubbing his hands slowly and considering the matter half aloud as something pensive in the bright eyes looking at him arrested his attention yes that expression was in the younger face too  you remember me said florence with a smile and what a little creature i was then  my dear young lady returned the instrumentmaker how could i forget you often as i have thought of you and heard of you since at the very moment indeed when you came in wally was talking about you to me and leaving messages for you and  was he said florence thank you walter oh thank you walter i was afraid you might be going away and hardly thinking of me and again she gave him her little hand so freely and so faithfully that walter held it for some moments in his own and could not bear to let it go  yet walter did not hold it as he might have held it once nor did its touch awaken those old daydreams of his boyhood that had floated past him sometimes even lately and confused him with their indistinct and broken shapes the purity and innocence of her endearing manner and its perfect trustfulness and the undisguised regard for him that lay so deeply seated in her constant eyes and glowed upon her fair face through the smile that shadedfor alas it was a smile too sad to brightenit were not of their romantic race they brought back to his thoughts the early deathbed he had seen her tending and the love the child had borne her and on the wings of such remembrances she seemed to rise up far above his idle fancies into clearer and serener air  ii am afraid i must call you walters uncle sir said florence to the old man if youll let me  my dear young lady cried old sol let you good gracious  we always knew you by that name and talked of you said florence glancing round and sighing gently the nice old parlour just the same how well i recollect it  old sol looked first at her then at his nephew and then rubbed his hands and rubbed his spectacles and said below his breath ah time time time  there was a short silence during which susan nipper skilfully impounded two extra cups and saucers from the cupboard and awaited the drawing of the tea with a thoughtful air  i want to tell walters uncle said florence laying her hand timidly upon the old mans as it rested on the table to bespeak his attention something that i am anxious about he is going to be left alone and if he will allow menot to take walters place for that i couldnt do but to be his true friend and help him if i ever can while walter is away i shall be very much obliged to him indeed will you may i walters uncle  the instrumentmaker without speaking put her hand to his lips and susan nipper leaning back with her arms crossed in the chair of presidency into which she had voted herself bit one end of her bonnet strings and heaved a gentle sigh as she looked up at the skylight  you will let me come to see you said florence when i can and you will tell me everything about yourself and walter and you will have no secrets from susan when she comes and i do not but will confide in us and trust us and rely upon us and youll try to let us be a comfort to you will you walters uncle  the sweet face looking into his the gentle pleading eyes the soft voice and the light touch on his arm made the more winning by a childs respect and honour for his age that gave to all an air of graceful doubt and modest hesitationthese and her natural earnestness so overcame the poor old instrumentmaker that he only answered  wally say a word for me my dear im very grateful  no walter returned florence with her quiet smile say nothing for him if you please i understand him very well and we must learn to talk together without you dear walter  the regretful tone in which she said these latter words touched walter more than all the rest  miss florence he replied with an effort to recover the cheerful manner he had preserved while talking with his uncle i know no more than my uncle what to say in acknowledgment of such kindness i am sure but what could i say after all if i had the power of talking for an hour except that it is like you  susan nipper began upon a new part of her bonnet string and nodded at the skylight in approval of the sentiment expressed  oh but walter said florence there is something that i wish to say to you before you go away and you must call me florence if you please and not speak like a stranger  like a stranger returned walter no i couldnt speak so i am sure at least i couldnt feel like one  ay but that is not enough and is not what i mean for walter added florence bursting into tears he liked you very much and said before he died that he was fond of you and said remember walter and if youll be a brother to me walter now that he is gone and i have none on earth ill be your sister all my life and think of you like one wherever we may be this is what i wished to say dear walter but i cannot say it as i would because my heart is full  and in its fulness and its sweet simplicity she held out both her hands to him walter taking them stooped down and touched the tearful face that neither shrunk nor turned away nor reddened as he did so but looked up at him with confidence and truth in that one moment every shadow of doubt or agitation passed away from walters soul it seemed to him that he responded to her innocent appeal beside the dead childs bed and in the solemn presence he had seen there pledged himself to cherish and protect her very image in his banishment with brotherly regard to garner up her simple faith inviolate and hold himself degraded if he breathed upon it any thought that was not in her own breast when she gave it to him  susan nipper who had bitten both her bonnet strings at once and imparted a great deal of private emotion to the skylight during this transaction now changed the subject by inquiring who took milk and who took sugar and being enlightened on these points poured out the tea they all four gathered socially about the little table and took tea under that young ladys active superintendence and the presence of florence in the back parlour brightened the tartar frigate on the wall  half an hour ago walter for his life would have hardly called her by her name but he could do so now when she entreated him he could think of her being there without a lurking misgiving that it would have been better if she had not come he could calmly think how beautiful she was how full of promise what a home some happy man would find in such a heart one day he could reflect upon his own place in that heart with pride and with a brave determination if not to deserve ithe still thought that far above himnever to deserve it less  some fairy influence must surely have hovered round the hands of susan nipper when she made the tea engendering the tranquil air that reigned in the back parlour during its discussion some counterinfluence must surely have hovered round the hands of uncle sols chronometer and moved them faster than the tartar frigate ever went before the wind be this as it may the visitors had a coach in waiting at a quiet corner not far off and the chronometer on being incidentally referred to gave such a positive opinion that it had been waiting a long time that it was impossible to doubt the fact especially when stated on such unimpeachable authority if uncle sol had been going to be hanged by his own time he never would have allowed that the chronometer was too fast by the least fraction of a second  florence at parting recapitulated to the old man all that she had said before and bound him to the compact uncle sol attended her lovingly to the legs of the wooden midshipman and there resigned her to walter who was ready to escort her and susan nipper to the coach  walter said florence by the way i have been afraid to ask before your uncle do you think you will be absent very long  indeed said walter i dont know i fear so mr dombey signified as much i thought when he appointed me  is it a favour walter inquired florence after a moments hesitation and looking anxiously in his face  the appointment returned walter  yes  walter would have given anything to have answered in the affirmative but his face answered before his lips could and florence was too attentive to it not to understand its reply  i am afraid you have scarcely been a favourite with papa she said timidly  there is no reason replied walter smiling why i should be  no reason walter  there was no reason said walter understanding what she meant there are many people employed in the house between mr dombey and a young man like me theres a wide space of separation if i do my duty i do what i ought and do no more than all the rest  had florence any misgiving of which she was hardly conscious any misgiving that had sprung into an indistinct and undefined existence since that recent night when she had gone down to her fathers room that walters accidental interest in her and early knowledge of her might have involved him in that powerful displeasure and dislike had walter any such idea or any sudden thought that it was in her mind at that moment neither of them hinted at it neither of them spoke at all for some short time susan walking on the other side of walter eyed them both sharply and certainly miss nippers thoughts travelled in that direction and very confidently too  you may come back very soon said florence perhaps walter  i may come back said walter an old man and find you an old lady but i hope for better things  papa said florence after a moment willwill recover from his grief andspeak more freely to me one day perhaps and if he should i will tell him how much i wish to see you back again and ask him to recall you for my sake  there was a touching modulation in these words about her father that walter understood too well  the coach being close at hand he would have left her without speaking for now he felt what parting was but florence held his hand when she was seated and then he found there was a little packet in her own  walter she said looking full upon him with her affectionate eyes like you i hope for better things i will pray for them and believe that they will arrive i made this little gift for paul pray take it with my love and do not look at it until you are gone away and now god bless you walter never forget me you are my brother dear  he was glad that susan nipper came between them or he might have left her with a sorrowful remembrance of him he was glad too that she did not look out of the coach again but waved the little hand to him instead as long as he could see it  in spite of her request he could not help opening the packet that night when he went to bed it was a little purse and there was was money in it  bright rose the sun next morning from his absence in strange countries and up rose walter with it to receive the captain who was already at the door having turned out earlier than was necessary in order to get under weigh while mrs macstinger was still slumbering the captain pretended to be in tiptop spirits and brought a very smoky tongue in one of the pockets of the of the broad blue coat for breakfast  and walr said the captain when they took their seats at table if your uncles the man i think him hell bring out the last bottle of the madeira on the present occasion  no no ned returned the old man no that shall be opened when walter comes home again  well said cried the captain hear him  there it lies said sol gills down in the little cellar covered with dirt and cobwebs there may be dirt and cobwebs over you and me perhaps ned before it sees the light  hear him cried the captain good morality walr my lad train up a figtree in the way it should go and when you are old sit under the shade on it overhaul thewell said the captain on second thoughts i aint quite certain where thats to be found but when found make a note of sol gills heave ahead again  but there or somewhere it shall lie ned until wally comes back to claim it said the old man thats all i meant to say  and well said too returned the captain and if we three dont crack that bottle in company ill give you two leave to  notwithstanding the captains excessive joviality he made but a poor hand at the smoky tongue though he tried very hard when anybody looked at him to appear as if he were eating with a vast appetite he was terribly afraid likewise of being left alone with either uncle or nephew appearing to consider that his only chance of safety as to keeping up appearances was in there being always three together this terror on the part of the captain reduced him to such ingenious evasions as running to the door when solomon went to put his coat on under pretence of having seen an extraordinary hackneycoach pass and darting out into the road when walter went upstairs to take leave of the lodgers on a feint of smelling fire in a neighbouring chimney these artifices captain cuttle deemed inscrutable by any uninspired observer  walter was coming down from his parting expedition upstairs and was crossing the shop to go back to the little parlour when he saw a faded face he knew looking in at the door and darted towards it  mr carker cried walter pressing the hand of john carker the junior pray come in this is kind of you to be here so early to say goodbye to me you knew how glad it would make me to shake hands with you once before going away i cannot say how glad i am to have this opportunity pray come in  it is not likely that we may ever meet again walter returned the other gently resisting his invitation and i am glad of this opportunity too i may venture to speak to you and to take you by the hand on the eve of separation i shall not have to resist your frank approaches walter any more  there was a melancholy in his smile as he said it that showed he had found some company and friendship for his thoughts even in that  ah mr carker returned walter why did you resist them you could have done me nothing but good i am very sure  he shook his head if there were any good he said i could do on this earth i would do it walter for you the sight of you from day to day has been at once happiness and remorse to me but the pleasure has outweighed the pain i know that now by knowing what i lose  come in mr carker and make acquaintance with my good old uncle urged walter i have often talked to him about you and he will be glad to tell you all he hears from me i have not said walter noticing his hesitation and speaking with embarrassment himself i have not told him anything about our last conversation mr carker not even him believe me  the grey junior pressed his hand and tears rose in his eyes  if i ever make acquaintance with him walter he returned it will be that i may hear tidings of you rely on my not wronging your forbearance and consideration it would be to wrong it not to tell him all the truth before i sought a word of confidence from him but i have no friend or acquaintance except you and even for your sake am little likely to make any  i wish said walter you had suffered me to be your friend indeed i always wished it mr carker as you know but never half so much as now when we are going to part  it is enough replied the other that you have been the friend of my own breast and that when i have avoided you most my heart inclined the most towards you and was fullest of you walter goodbye  goodbye mr carker heaven be with you sir cried walter with emotion  if said the other retaining his hand while he spoke if when you come back you miss me from my old corner and should hear from anyone where i am lying come and look upon my grave think that i might have been as honest and as happy as you and let me think when i know time is coming on that some one like my former self may stand there for a moment and remember me with pity and forgiveness walter goodbye  his figure crept like a shadow down the bright sunlighted street so cheerful yet so solemn in the early summer morning and slowly passed away  the relentless chronometer at last announced that walter must turn his back upon the wooden midshipman and away they went himself his uncle and the captain in a hackneycoach to a wharf where they were to take steamboat for some reach down the river the name of which as the captain gave it out was a hopeless mystery to the ears of landsmen arrived at this reach whither the ship had repaired by last nights tide they were boarded by various excited watermen and among others by a dirty cyclops of the captains acquaintance who with his one eye had made the captain out some mile and a half off and had been exchanging unintelligible roars with him ever since becoming the lawful prize of this personage who was frightfully hoarse and constitutionally in want of shaving they were all three put aboard the son and heir and the son and heir was in a pretty state of confusion with sails lying all bedraggled on the wet decks loose ropes tripping people up men in red shirts running barefoot to and fro casks blockading every foot of space and in the thickest of the fray a black cook in a black caboose up to his eyes in vegetables and blinded with smoke  the captain immediately drew walter into a corner and with a great effort that made his face very red pulled up the silver watch which was so big and so tight in his pocket that it came out like a bung  walr said the captain handing it over and shaking him heartily by the hand a parting gift my lad put it back half an hour every morning and about another quarter towards the arternoon and its a watch thatll do you credit  captain cuttle i couldnt think of it cried walter detaining him for he was running away pray take it back i have one already  then walr said the captain suddenly diving into one of his pockets and bringing up the two teaspoons and the sugartongs with which he had armed himself to meet such an objection take this here trifle of plate instead  no no i couldnt indeed cried walter a thousand thanks dont throw them away captain cuttle for the captain was about to jerk them overboard theyll be of much more use to you than me give me your stick i have often thought i should like to have it there goodbye captain cuttle take care of my uncle uncle sol god bless you  they were over the side in the confusion before walter caught another glimpse of either and when he ran up to the stern and looked after them he saw his uncle hanging down his head in the boat and captain cuttle rapping him on the back with the great silver watch it must have been very painful and gesticulating hopefully with the teaspoons and sugartongs catching sight of walter captain cuttle dropped the property into the bottom of the boat with perfect unconcern being evidently oblivious of its existence and pulling off the glazed hat hailed him lustily the glazed hat made quite a show in the sun with its glistening and the captain continued to wave it until he could be seen no longer then the confusion on board which had been rapidly increasing reached its height two or three other boats went away with a cheer the sails shone bright and full above as walter watched them spread their surface to the favourable breeze the water flew in sparkles from the prow and off upon her voyage went the son and heir as hopefully and trippingly as many another son and heir gone down had started on his way before her  day after day old sol and captain cuttle kept her reckoning in the little hack parlour and worked out her course with the chart spread before them on the round table at night when old sol climbed upstairs so lonely to the attic where it sometimes blew great guns he looked up at the stars and listened to the wind and kept a longer watch than would have fallen to his lot on board the ship the last bottle of the old madeira which had had its cruising days and known its dangers of the deep lay silently beneath its dust and cobwebs in the meanwhile undisturbed    chapter 20 mr dombey goes upon a journey   mr dombey sir said major bagstock joee b is not in general a man of sentiment for joseph is tough but joe has his feelings sir and when they are awakeneddamme mr dombey cried the major with sudden ferocity this is weakness and i wont submit to it  major bagstock delivered himself of these expressions on receiving mr dombey as his guest at the head of his own staircase in princesss place mr dombey had come to breakfast with the major previous to their setting forth on their trip and the illstarved native had already undergone a world of misery arising out of the muffins while in connexion with the general question of boiled eggs life was a burden to him  it is not for an old soldier of the bagstock breed observed the major relapsing into a mild state to deliver himself up a prey to his own emotions butdamme sir cried the major in another spasm of ferocity i condole with you  the majors purple visage deepened in its hue and the majors lobster eyes stood out in bolder relief as he shook mr dombey by the hand imparting to that peaceful action as defiant a character as if it had been the prelude to his immediately boxing mr dombey for a thousand pounds a side and the championship of england with a rotatory motion of his head and a wheeze very like the cough of a horse the major then conducted his visitor to the sittingroom and there welcomed him having now composed his feelings with the freedom and frankness of a travelling companion  dombey said the major im glad to see you im proud to see you there are not many men in europe to whom j bagstock would say thatfor josh is blunt sir its his naturebut joey b is proud to see you dombey  major returned mr dombey you are very obliging  no sir said the major devil a bit thats not my character if that had been joes character joe might have been by this time lieutenantgeneral sir joseph bagstock kcb and might have received you in very different quarters you dont know old joe yet i find but this occasion being special is a source of pride to me by the lord sir said the major resolutely its an honour to me  mr dombey in his estimation of himself and his money felt that this was very true and therefore did not dispute the point but the instinctive recognition of such a truth by the major and his plain avowal of it were very able it was a confirmation to mr dombey if he had required any of his not being mistaken in the major it was an assurance to him that his power extended beyond his own immediate sphere and that the major as an officer and a gentleman had a no less becoming sense of it than the beadle of the royal exchange  and if it were ever consolatory to know this or the like of this it was consolatory then when the impotence of his will the instability of his hopes the feebleness of wealth had been so direfully impressed upon him what could it do his boy had asked him sometimes thinking of the baby question he could hardly forbear inquiring himself what could it do indeed what had it done  but these were lonely thoughts bred late at night in the sullen despondency and gloom of his retirement and pride easily found its reassurance in many testimonies to the truth as unimpeachable and precious as the majors mr dombey in his friendlessness inclined to the major it cannot be said that he warmed towards him but he thawed a little the major had had some partand not too muchin the days by the seaside he was a man of the world and knew some great people he talked much and told stories and mr dombey was disposed to regard him as a choice spirit who shone in society and who had not that poisonous ingredient of poverty with which choice spirits in general are too much adulterated his station was undeniable altogether the major was a creditable companion well accustomed to a life of leisure and to such places as that they were about to visit and having an air of gentlemanly ease about him that mixed well enough with his own city character and did not compete with it at all if mr dombey had any lingering idea that the major as a man accustomed in the way of his calling to make light of the ruthless hand that had lately crushed his hopes might unconsciously impart some useful philosophy to him and scare away his weak regrets he hid it from himself and left it lying at the bottom of his pride unexamined  where is my scoundrel said the major looking wrathfully round the room  the native who had no particular name but answered to any vituperative epithet presented himself instantly at the door and ventured to come no nearer  you villain said the choleric major wheres the breakfast  the dark servant disappeared in search of it and was quickly heard reascending the stairs in such a tremulous state that the plates and dishes on the tray he carried trembling sympathetically as he came rattled again all the way up  dombey said the major glancing at the native as he arranged the table and encouraging him with an awful shake of his fist when he upset a spoon here is a devilled grill a savoury pie a dish of kidneys and so forth pray sit down old joe can give you nothing but camp fare you see  very excellent fare major replied his guest and not in mere politeness either for the major always took the best possible care of himself and indeed ate rather more of rich meats than was good for him insomuch that his imperial complexion was mainly referred by the faculty to that circumstance  you have been looking over the way sir observed the major have you seen our friend  you mean miss tox retorted mr dombey no  charming woman sir said the major with a fat laugh rising in his short throat and nearly suffocating him  miss tox is a very good sort of person i believe replied mr dombey  the haughty coldness of the reply seemed to afford major bagstock infinite delight he swelled and swelled exceedingly and even laid down his knife and fork for a moment to rub his hands  old joe sir said the major was a bit of a favourite in that quarter once but joe has had his day j bagstock is extinguishedoutrivalledfloored sir  i should have supposed mr dombey replied that the ladys day for favourites was over but perhaps you are jesting major  perhaps you are jesting dombey was the majors rejoinder  there never was a more unlikely possibility it was so clearly expressed in mr dombeys face that the major apologised  i beg your pardon he said i see you are in earnest i tell you what dombey the major paused in his eating and looked mysteriously indignant thats a devilish ambitious woman sir  mr dombey said indeed with frigid indifference mingled perhaps with some contemptuous incredulity as to miss tox having the presumption to harbour such a superior quality  that woman sir said the major is in her way a lucifer joey b has had his day sir but he keeps his eyes he sees does joe his royal highness the late duke of york observed of joey at a levee that he saw  the major accompanied this with such a look and between eating drinking hot tea devilled grill muffins and meaning was altogether so swollen and inflamed about the head that even mr dombey showed some anxiety for him  that ridiculous old spectacle sir pursued the major aspires she aspires skyhigh sir matrimonially dombey  i am sorry for her said mr dombey  dont say that dombey returned the major in a warning voice  why should i not major said mr dombey  the major gave no answer but the horses cough and went on eating vigorously  she has taken an interest in your household said the major stopping short again and has been a frequent visitor at your house for some time now  yes replied mr dombey with great stateliness miss tox was originally received there at the time of mrs dombeys death as a friend of my sisters and being a wellbehaved person and showing a liking for the poor infant she was permittedmay i say encouragedto repeat her visits with my sister and gradually to occupy a kind of footing of familiarity in the family i have said mr dombey in the tone of a man who was making a great and valuable concession i have a respect for miss tox she his been so obliging as to render many little services in my house trifling and insignificant services perhaps major but not to be disparaged on that account and i hope i have had the good fortune to be enabled to acknowledge them by such attention and notice as it has been in my power to bestow i hold myself indebted to miss tox major added mr dombey with a slight wave of his hand for the pleasure of your acquaintance  dombey said the major warmly no no sir joseph bagstock can never permit that assertion to pass uncontradicted your knowledge of old joe sir such as he is and old joes knowledge of you sir had its origin in a noble fellow sirin a great creature sir dombey said the major with a struggle which it was not very difficult to parade his whole life being a struggle against all kinds of apoplectic symptoms we knew each other through your boy  mr dombey seemed touched as it is not improbable the major designed he should be by this allusion he looked down and sighed and the major rousing himself fiercely again said in reference to the state of mind into which he felt himself in danger of falling that this was weakness and nothing should induce him to submit to it  our friend had a remote connexion with that event said the major and all the credit that belongs to her j b is willing to give her sir notwithstanding which maam he added raising his eyes from his plate and casting them across princesss place to where miss tox was at that moment visible at her window watering her flowers youre a scheming jade maam and your ambition is a piece of monstrous impudence if it only made yourself ridiculous maam said the major rolling his head at the unconscious miss tox while his starting eyes appeared to make a leap towards her you might do that to your hearts content maam without any objection i assure you on the part of bagstock here the major laughed frightfully up in the tips of his ears and in the veins of his head but when maam said the major you compromise other people and generous unsuspicious people too as a repayment for their condescension you stir the blood of old joe in his body  major said mr dombey reddening i hope you do not hint at anything so absurd on the part of miss tox as  dombey returned the major i hint at nothing but joey b has lived in the world sir lived in the world with his eyes open sir and his ears cocked and joe tells you dombey that theres a devilish artful and ambitious woman over the way  mr dombey involuntarily glanced over the way and an angry glance he sent in that direction too  thats all on such a subject that shall pass the lips of joseph bagstock said the major firmly joe is not a talebearer but there are times when he must speak when he will speakconfound your arts maam cried the major again apostrophising his fair neighbour with great irewhen the provocation is too strong to admit of his remaining silent  the emotion of this outbreak threw the major into a paroxysm of horses coughs which held him for a long time on recovering he added  and now dombey as you have invited joeold joe who has no other merit sir but that he is tough and heartyto be your guest and guide at leamington command him in any way you please and he is wholly yours i dont know sir said the major wagging his double chin with a jocose air what it is you people see in joe to make you hold him in such great request all of you but this i know sir that if he wasnt pretty tough and obstinate in his refusals youd kill him among you with your invitations and so forth in doublequick time  mr dombey in a few words expressed his sense of the preference he received over those other distinguished members of society who were clamouring for the possession of major bagstock but the major cut him short by giving him to understand that he followed his own inclinations and that they had risen up in a body and said with one accord j b dombey is the man for you to choose as a friend  the major being by this time in a state of repletion with essence of savoury pie oozing out at the corners of his eyes and devilled grill and kidneys tightening his cravat and the time moreover approaching for the departure of the railway train to birmingham by which they were to leave town the native got him into his greatcoat with immense difficulty and buttoned him up until his face looked staring and gasping over the top of that garment as if he were in a barrel the native then handed him separately and with a decent interval between each supply his washleather gloves his thick stick and his hat which latter article the major wore with a rakish air on one side of his head by way of toning down his remarkable visage the native had previously packed in all possible and impossible parts of mr dombeys chariot which was in waiting an unusual quantity of carpetbags and small portmanteaus no less apoplectic in appearance than the major himself and having filled his own pockets with seltzer water east india sherry sandwiches shawls telescopes maps and newspapers any or all of which light baggage the major might require at any instant of the journey he announced that everything was ready to complete the equipment of this unfortunate foreigner currently believed to be a prince in his own country when he took his seat in the rumble by the side of mr towlinson a pile of the majors cloaks and greatcoats was hurled upon him by the landlord who aimed at him from the pavement with those great missiles like a titan and so covered him up that he proceeded in a living tomb to the railroad station  but before the carriage moved away and while the native was in the act of sepulture miss tox appearing at her window waved a lilywhite handkerchief mr dombey received this parting salutation very coldlyvery coldly even for himand honouring her with the slightest possible inclination of his head leaned back in the carriage with a very discontented look his marked behaviour seemed to afford the major who was all politeness in his recognition of miss tox unbounded satisfaction and he sat for a long time afterwards leering and choking like an overfed mephistopheles  during the bustle of preparation at the railway mr dombey and the major walked up and down the platform side by side the former taciturn and gloomy and the latter entertaining him or entertaining himself with a variety of anecdotes and reminiscences in most of which joe bagstock was the principal performer neither of the two observed that in the course of these walks they attracted the attention of a working man who was standing near the engine and who touched his hat every time they passed for mr dombey habitually looked over the vulgar herd not at them and the major was looking at the time into the core of one of his stories at length however this man stepped before them as they turned round and pulling his hat off and keeping it off ducked his head to mr dombey  beg your pardon sir said the man but i hope youre a doin pretty well sir  he was dressed in a canvas suit abundantly besmeared with coaldust and oil and had cinders in his whiskers and a smell of halfslaked ashes all over him he was not a badlooking fellow nor even what could be fairly called a dirtylooking fellow in spite of this and in short he was mr toodle professionally clothed  i shall have the honour of stokin of you down sir said mr toodle beg your pardon siri hope you find yourself a coming round  mr dombey looked at him in return for his tone of interest as if a man like that would make his very eyesight dirty  scuse the liberty sir said toodle seeing he was not clearly remembered but my wife polly as was called richards in your family  a change in mr dombeys face which seemed to express recollection of him and so it did but it expressed in a much stronger degree an angry sense of humiliation stopped mr toodle short  your wife wants money i suppose said mr dombey putting his hand in his pocket and speaking but that he always did haughtily  no thankee sir returned toodle i cant say she does i dont  mr dombey was stopped short now in his turn and awkwardly with his hand in his pocket  no sir said toodle turning his oilskin cap round and round were a doin pretty well sir we havent no cause to complain in the worldly way sir weve had four more since then sir but we rubs on  mr dombey would have rubbed on to his own carriage though in so doing he had rubbed the stoker underneath the wheels but his attention was arrested by something in connexion with the cap still going slowly round and round in the mans hand  we lost one babby observed toodle theres no denyin  lately added mr dombey looking at the cap  no sir upard of three years ago but all the rest is hearty and in the matter o readin sir said toodle ducking again as if to remind mr dombey of what had passed between them on that subject long ago them boys o mine they learned me among em arter all theyve made a wery tolerable scholar of me sir them boys  come major said mr dombey  beg your pardon sir resumed toodle taking a step before them and deferentially stopping them again still cap in hand i wouldnt have troubled you with such a pint except as a way of gettin in the name of my son bilerchristened robinhim as you was so good as to make a charitable grinder on  well man said mr dombey in his severest manner what about him  why sir returned toodle shaking his head with a face of great anxiety and distress im forced to say sir that hes gone wrong  he has gone wrong has he said mr dombey with a hard kind of satisfaction  he has fell into bad company you see genelmen pursued the father looking wistfully at both and evidently taking the major into the conversation with the hope of having his sympathy he has got into bad ways god send he may come to again genelmen but hes on the wrong track now you could hardly be off hearing of it somehow sir said toodle again addressing mr dombey individually and its better i should out and say my boys gone rather wrong pollys dreadful down about it genelmen said toodle with the same dejected look and another appeal to the major  a son of this mans whom i caused to be educated major said mr dombey giving him his arm the usual return  take advice from plain old joe and never educate that sort of people sir returned the major damme sir it never does it always fails  the simple father was beginning to submit that he hoped his son the quondam grinder huffed and cuffed and flogged and badged and taught as parrots are by a brute jobbed into his place of schoolmaster with as much fitness for it as a hound might not have been educated on quite a right plan in some undiscovered respect when mr dombey angrily repeating the usual return led the major away and the major being heavy to hoist into mr dombeys carriage elevated in midair and having to stop and swear that he would flay the native alive and break every bone in his skin and visit other physical torments upon him every time he couldnt get his foot on the step and fell back on that dark exile had barely time before they started to repeat hoarsely that it would never do that it always failed and that if he were to educate his own vagabond he would certainly be hanged  mr dombey assented bitterly but there was something more in his bitterness and in his moody way of falling back in the carriage and looking with knitted brows at the changing objects without than the failure of that noble educational system administered by the grinders company he had seen upon the mans rough cap a piece of new crape and he had assured himself from his manner and his answers that he wore it for his son  sol from high to low at home or abroad from florence in his great house to the coarse churl who was feeding the fire then smoking before them everyone set up some claim or other to a share in his dead boy and was a bidder against him could he ever forget how that woman had wept over his pillow and called him her own child or how he waking from his sleep had asked for her and had raised himself in his bed and brightened when she came in  to think of this presumptuous raker among coals and ashes going on before there with his sign of mourning to think that he dared to enter even by a common show like that into the trial and disappointment of a proud gentlemans secret heart to think that this lost child who was to have divided with him his riches and his projects and his power and allied with whom he was to have shut out all the world as with a double door of gold should have let in such a herd to insult him with their knowledge of his defeated hopes and their boasts of claiming community of feeling with himself so far removed if not of having crept into the place wherein he would have lorded it alone  he found no pleasure or relief in the journey tortured by these thoughts he carried monotony with him through the rushing landscape and hurried headlong not through a rich and varied country but a wilderness of blighted plans and gnawing jealousies the very speed at which the train was whirled along mocked the swift course of the young life that had been borne away so steadily and so inexorably to its foredoomed end the power that forced itself upon its iron wayits owndefiant of all paths and roads piercing through the heart of every obstacle and dragging living creatures of all classes ages and degrees behind it was a type of the triumphant monster death  away with a shriek and a roar and a rattle from the town burrowing among the dwellings of men and making the streets hum flashing out into the meadows for a moment mining in through the damp earth booming on in darkness and heavy air bursting out again into the sunny day so bright and wide away with a shriek and a roar and a rattle through the fields through the woods through the corn through the hay through the chalk through the mould through the clay through the rock among objects close at hand and almost in the grasp ever flying from the traveller and a deceitful distance ever moving slowly within him like as in the track of the remorseless monster death  through the hollow on the height by the heath by the orchard by the park by the garden over the canal across the river where the sheep are feeding where the mill is going where the barge is floating where the dead are lying where the factory is smoking where the stream is running where the village clusters where the great cathedral rises where the bleak moor lies and the wild breeze smooths or ruffles it at its inconstant will away with a shriek and a roar and a rattle and no trace to leave behind but dust and vapour like as in the track of the remorseless monster death  breasting the wind and light the shower and sunshine away and still away it rolls and roars fierce and rapid smooth and certain and great works and massive bridges crossing up above fall like a beam of shadow an inch broad upon the eye and then are lost away and still away onward and onward ever glimpses of cottagehomes of houses mansions rich estates of husbandry and handicraft of people of old roads and paths that look deserted small and insignificant as they are left behind and so they do and what else is there but such glimpses in the track of the indomitable monster death  away with a shriek and a roar and a rattle plunging down into the earth again and working on in such a storm of energy and perseverance that amidst the darkness and whirlwind the motion seems reversed and to tend furiously backward until a ray of light upon the wet wall shows its surface flying past like a fierce stream away once more into the day and through the day with a shrill yell of exultation roaring rattling tearing on spurning everything with its dark breath sometimes pausing for a minute where a crowd of faces are that in a minute more are not sometimes lapping water greedily and before the spout at which it drinks has ceased to drip upon the ground shrieking roaring rattling through the purple distance  louder and louder yet it shrieks and cries as it comes tearing on resistless to the goal and now its way still like the way of death is strewn with ashes thickly everything around is blackened there are dark pools of water muddy lanes and miserable habitations far below there are jagged walls and falling houses close at hand and through the battered roofs and broken windows wretched rooms are seen where want and fever hide themselves in many wretched shapes while smoke and crowded gables and distorted chimneys and deformity of brick and mortar penning up deformity of mind and body choke the murky distance as mr dombey looks out of his carriage window it is never in his thoughts that the monster who has brought him there has let the light of day in on these things not made or caused them it was the journeys fitting end and might have been the end of everything it was so ruinous and dreary  so pursuing the one course of thought he had the one relentless monster still before him all things looked black and cold and deadly upon him and he on them he found a likeness to his misfortune everywhere there was a remorseless triumph going on about him and it galled and stung him in his pride and jealousy whatever form it took though most of all when it divided with him the love and memory of his lost boy  there was a facehe had looked upon it on the previous night and it on him with eyes that read his soul though they were dim with tears and hidden soon behind two quivering handsthat often had attended him in fancy on this ride he had seen it with the expression of last night timidly pleading to him it was not reproachful but there was something of doubt almost of hopeful incredulity in it which as he once more saw that fade away into a desolate certainty of his dislike was like reproach it was a trouble to him to think of this face of florence  because he felt any new compunction towards it no because the feeling it awakened in himof which he had had some old foreshadowing in older timeswas fullformed now and spoke out plainly moving him too much and threatening to grow too strong for his composure because the face was abroad in the expression of defeat and persecution that seemed to encircle him like the air because it barbed the arrow of that cruel and remorseless enemy on which his thoughts so ran and put into its grasp a doublehanded sword because he knew full well in his own breast as he stood there tinging the scene of transition before him with the morbid colours of his own mind and making it a ruin and a picture of decay instead of hopeful change and promise of better things that life had quite as much to do with his complainings as death one child was gone and one child left why was the object of his hope removed instead of her  the sweet calm gentle presence in his fancy moved him to no reflection but that she had been unwelcome to him from the first she was an aggravation of his bitterness now if his son had been his only child and the same blow had fallen on him it would have been heavy to bear but infinitely lighter than now when it might have fallen on her whom he could have lost or he believed it without a pang and had not her loving and innocent face rising before him had no softening or winning influence he rejected the angel and took up with the tormenting spirit crouching in his bosom her patience goodness youth devotion love were as so many atoms in the ashes upon which he set his heel he saw her image in the blight and blackness all around him not irradiating but deepening the gloom more than once upon this journey and now again as he stood pondering at this journeys end tracing figures in the dust with his stick the thought came into his mind what was there he could interpose between himself and it  the major who had been blowing and panting all the way down like another engine and whose eye had often wandered from his newspaper to leer at the prospect as if there were a procession of discomfited miss toxes pouring out in the smoke of the train and flying away over the fields to hide themselves in any place of refuge aroused his friends by informing him that the posthorses were harnessed and the carriage ready  dombey said the major rapping him on the arm with his cane dont be thoughtful its a bad habit old joe sir wouldnt be as tough as you see him if he had ever encouraged it you are too great a man dombey to be thoughtful in your position sir youre far above that kind of thing  the major even in his friendly remonstrances thus consulting the dignity and honour of mr dombey and showing a lively sense of their importance mr dombey felt more than ever disposed to defer to a gentleman possessing so much good sense and such a wellregulated mind accordingly he made an effort to listen to the majors stories as they trotted along the turnpike road and the major finding both the pace and the road a great deal better adapted to his conversational powers than the mode of travelling they had just relinquished came out of his entertainment  but still the major blunt and tough as he was and as he so very often said he was administered some palatable catering to his companions appetite he related or rather suffered it to escape him accidentally and as one might say grudgingly and against his will how there was great curiosity and excitement at the club in regard of his friend dombey how he was suffocated with questions sir how old joe bagstock was a greater man than ever there on the strength of dombey how they said bagstock your friend dombey now what is the view he takes of such and such a question though by the rood sir said the major with a broad stare how they discovered that j b ever came to know you is a mystery  in this flow of spirits and conversation only interrupted by his usual plethoric symptoms and by intervals of lunch and from time to time by some violent assault upon the native who wore a pair of earrings in his darkbrown ears and on whom his european clothes sat with an outlandish impossibility of adjustmentbeing of their own accord and without any reference to the tailors art long where they ought to be short short where they ought to be long tight where they ought to be loose and loose where they ought to be tightand to which he imparted a new grace whenever the major attacked him by shrinking into them like a shrivelled nut or a cold monkeyin this flow of spirits and conversation the major continued all day so that when evening came on and found them trotting through the green and leafy road near leamington the majors voice what with talking and eating and chuckling and choking appeared to be in the box under the rumble or in some neighbouring haystack nor did the major improve it at the royal hotel where rooms and dinner had been ordered and where he so oppressed his organs of speech by eating and drinking that when he retired to bed he had no voice at all except to cough with and could only make himself intelligible to the dark servant by gasping at him  he not only rose next morning however like a giant refreshed but conducted himself at breakfast like a giant refreshing at this meal they arranged their daily habits the major was to take the responsibility of ordering everything to eat and drink and they were to have a late breakfast together every morning and a late dinner together every day mr dombey would prefer remaining in his own room or walking in the country by himself on that first day of their sojourn at leamington but next morning he would be happy to accompany the major to the pumproom and about the town so they parted until dinnertime mr dombey retired to nurse his wholesome thoughts in his own way the major attended by the native carrying a campstool a greatcoat and an umbrella swaggered up and down through all the public places looking into subscription books to find out who was there looking up old ladies by whom he was much admired reporting j b tougher than ever and puffing his rich friend dombey wherever he went there never was a man who stood by a friend more staunchly than the major when in puffing him he puffed himself  it was surprising how much new conversation the major had to let off at dinnertime and what occasion he gave mr dombey to admire his social qualities at breakfast next morning he knew the contents of the latest newspapers received and mentioned several subjects in connexion with them on which his opinion had recently been sought by persons of such power and might that they were only to be obscurely hinted at mr dombey who had been so long shut up within himself and who had rarely at any time overstepped the enchanted circle within which the operations of dombey and son were conducted began to think this an improvement on his solitary life and in place of excusing himself for another day as he had thought of doing when alone walked out with the major arminarm    chapter 21 new faces   the major more bluefaced and staringmore overripe as it were than everand giving vent every now and then to one of the horses coughs not so much of necessity as in a spontaneous explosion of importance walked arminarm with mr dombey up the sunny side of the way with his cheeks swelling over his tight stock his legs majestically wide apart and his great head wagging from side to side as if he were remonstrating within himself for being such a captivating object they had not walked many yards before the major encountered somebody he knew nor many yards farther before the major encountered somebody else he knew but he merely shook his fingers at them as he passed and led mr dombey on pointing out the localities as they went and enlivening the walk with any current scandal suggested by them  in this manner the major and mr dombey were walking arminarm much to their own satisfaction when they beheld advancing towards them a wheeled chair in which a lady was seated indolently steering her carriage by a kind of rudder in front while it was propelled by some unseen power in the rear although the lady was not young she was very blooming in the facequite rosyand her dress and attitude were perfectly juvenile walking by the side of the chair and carrying her gossamer parasol with a proud and weary air as if so great an effort must be soon abandoned and the parasol dropped sauntered a much younger lady very handsome very haughty very wilful who tossed her head and drooped her eyelids as though if there were anything in all the world worth looking into save a mirror it certainly was not the earth or sky  why what the devil have we here sir cried the major stopping as this little cavalcade drew near  my dearest edith drawled the lady in the chair major bagstock  the major no sooner heard the voice than he relinquished mr dombeys arm darted forward took the hand of the lady in the chair and pressed it to his lips with no less gallantry the major folded both his gloves upon his heart and bowed low to the other lady and now the chair having stopped the motive power became visible in the shape of a flushed page pushing behind who seemed to have in part outgrown and in part outpushed his strength for when he stood upright he was tall and wan and thin and his plight appeared the more forlorn from his having injured the shape of his hat by butting at the carriage with his head to urge it forward as is sometimes done by elephants in oriental countries  joe bagstock said the major to both ladies is a proud and happy man for the rest of his life  you false creature said the old lady in the chair insipidly where do you come from i cant bear you  then suffer old joe to present a friend maam said the major promptly as a reason for being tolerated mr dombey mrs skewton the lady in the chair was gracious mr dombey mrs granger the lady with the parasol was faintly conscious of mr dombeys taking off his hat and bowing low i am delighted sir said the major to have this opportunity  the major seemed in earnest for he looked at all the three and leered in his ugliest manner  mrs skewton dombey said the major makes havoc in the heart of old josh  mr dombey signified that he didnt wonder at it  you perfidious goblin said the lady in the chair have done how long have you been here bad man  one day replied the major  and can you be a day or even a minute returned the lady slightly settling her false curls and false eyebrows with her fan and showing her false teeth set off by her false complexion in the garden of whatsitsname  eden i suppose mama interrupted the younger lady scornfully  my dear edith said the other i cannot help it i never can remember those frightful nameswithout having your whole soul and being inspired by the sight of nature by the perfume said mrs skewton rustling a handkerchief that was faint and sickly with essences of her artless breath you creature  the discrepancy between mrs skewtons fresh enthusiasm of words and forlornly faded manner was hardly less observable than that between her age which was about seventy and her dress which would have been youthful for twentyseven her attitude in the wheeled chair which she never varied was one in which she had been taken in a barouche some fifty years before by a then fashionable artist who had appended to his published sketch the name of cleopatra in consequence of a discovery made by the critics of the time that it bore an exact resemblance to that princess as she reclined on board her galley mrs skewton was a beauty then and bucks threw wineglasses over their heads by dozens in her honour the beauty and the barouche had both passed away but she still preserved the attitude and for this reason expressly maintained the wheeled chair and the butting page there being nothing whatever except the attitude to prevent her from walking  mr dombey is devoted to nature i trust said mrs skewton settling her diamond brooch and by the way she chiefly lived upon the reputation of some diamonds and her family connexions  my friend dombey maam returned the major may be devoted to her in secret but a man who is paramount in the greatest city in the universe  no one can be a stranger said mrs skewton to mr dombeys immense influence  as mr dombey acknowledged the compliment with a bend of his head the younger lady glancing at him met his eyes  you reside here madam said mr dombey addressing her  no we have been to a great many places to harrogate and scarborough and into devonshire we have been visiting and resting here and there mama likes change  edith of course does not said mrs skewton with a ghastly archness  i have not found that there is any change in such places was the answer delivered with supreme indifference  they libel me there is only one change mr dombey observed mrs skewton with a mincing sigh for which i really care and that i fear i shall never be permitted to enjoy people cannot spare one but seclusion and contemplation are my whathisname  if you mean paradise mama you had better say so to render yourself intelligible said the younger lady  my dearest edith returned mrs skewton you know that i am wholly dependent upon you for those odious names i assure you mr dombey nature intended me for an arcadian i am thrown away in society cows are my passion what i have ever sighed for has been to retreat to a swiss farm and live entirely surrounded by cowsand china  this curious association of objects suggesting a remembrance of the celebrated bull who got by mistake into a crockery shop was received with perfect gravity by mr dombey who intimated his opinion that nature was no doubt a very respectable institution  what i want drawled mrs skewton pinching her shrivelled throat is heart it was frightfully true in one sense if not in that in which she used the phrase what i want is frankness confidence less conventionality and freer play of soul we are so dreadfully artificial  we were indeed  in short said mrs skewton i want nature everywhere it would be so extremely charming  nature is inviting us away now mama if you are ready said the younger lady curling her handsome lip at this hint the wan page who had been surveying the party over the top of the chair vanished behind it as if the ground had swallowed him up  stop a moment withers said mrs skewton as the chair began to move calling to the page with all the languid dignity with which she had called in days of yore to a coachman with a wig cauliflower nosegay and silk stockings where are you staying abomination the major was staying at the royal hotel with his friend dombey  you may come and see us any evening when you are good lisped mrs skewton if mr dombey will honour us we shall be happy withers go on  the major again pressed to his blue lips the tips of the fingers that were disposed on the ledge of the wheeled chair with careful carelessness after the cleopatra model and mr dombey bowed the elder lady honoured them both with a very gracious smile and a girlish wave of her hand the younger lady with the very slightest inclination of her head that common courtesy allowed  the last glimpse of the wrinkled face of the mother with that patched colour on it which the sun made infinitely more haggard and dismal than any want of colour could have been and of the proud beauty of the daughter with her graceful figure and erect deportment engendered such an involuntary disposition on the part of both the major and mr dombey to look after them that they both turned at the same moment the page nearly as much aslant as his own shadow was toiling after the chair uphill like a slow batteringram the top of cleopatras bonnet was fluttering in exactly the same corner to the inch as before and the beauty loitering by herself a little in advance expressed in all her elegant form from head to foot the same supreme disregard of everything and everybody  i tell you what sir said the major as they resumed their walk again if joe bagstock were a younger man theres not a woman in the world whom hed prefer for mrs bagstock to that woman by george sir said the major shes superb  do you mean the daughter inquired mr dombey  is joey b a turnip dombey said the major that he should mean the mother  you were complimentary to the mother returned mr dombey  an ancient flame sir chuckled major bagstock devilish ancient i humour her  she impresses me as being perfectly genteel said mr dombey  genteel sir said the major stopping short and staring in his companions face the honourable mrs skewton sir is sister to the late lord feenix and aunt to the present lord the family are not wealthytheyre poor indeedand she lives upon a small jointure but if you come to blood sir the major gave a flourish with his stick and walked on again in despair of being able to say what you came to if you came to that  you addressed the daughter i observed said mr dombey after a short pause as mrs granger  edith skewton sir returned the major stopping short again and punching a mark in the ground with his cane to represent her married at eighteen granger of ours whom the major indicated by another punch granger sir said the major tapping the last ideal portrait and rolling his head emphatically was colonel of ours a devilish handsome fellow sir of fortyone he died sir in the second year of his marriage the major ran the representative of the deceased granger through and through the body with his walkingstick and went on again carrying his stick over his shoulder  how long is this ago asked mr dombey making another halt  edith granger sir replied the major shutting one eye putting his head on one side passing his cane into his left hand and smoothing his shirtfrill with his right is at this present time not quite thirty and damme sir said the major shouldering his stick once more and walking on again shes a peerless woman  was there any family asked mr dombey presently  yes sir said the major there was a boy  mr dombeys eyes sought the ground and a shade came over his face  who was drowned sir pursued the major when a child of four or five years old  indeed said mr dombey raising his head  by the upsetting of a boat in which his nurse had no business to have put him said the major thats his history edith granger is edith granger still but if tough old joey b sir were a little younger and a little richer the name of that immortal paragon should be bagstock  the major heaved his shoulders and his cheeks and laughed more like an overfed mephistopheles than ever as he said the words  provided the lady made no objection i suppose said mr dombey coldly  by gad sir said the major the bagstock breed are not accustomed to that sort of obstacle though its true enough that edith might have married twenty times but for being proud sir proud  mr dombey seemed by his face to think no worse of her for that  its a great quality after all said the major by the lord its a high quality dombey you are proud yourself and your friend old joe respects you for it sir  with this tribute to the character of his ally which seemed to be wrung from him by the force of circumstances and the irresistible tendency of their conversation the major closed the subject and glided into a general exposition of the extent to which he had been beloved and doted on by splendid women and brilliant creatures  on the next day but one mr dombey and the major encountered the honourable mrs skewton and her daughter in the pumproom on the day after they met them again very near the place where they had met them first after meeting them thus three or four times in all it became a point of mere civility to old acquaintances that the major should go there one evening mr dombey had not originally intended to pay visits but on the major announcing this intention he said he would have the pleasure of accompanying him so the major told the native to go round before dinner and say with his and mr dombeys compliments that they would have the honour of visiting the ladies that same evening if the ladies were alone in answer to which message the native brought back a very small note with a very large quantity of scent about it indited by the honourable mrs skewton to major bagstock and briefly saying you are a shocking bear and i have a great mind not to forgive you but if you are very good indeed which was underlined you may come compliments in which edith unites to mr dombey  the honourable mrs skewton and her daughter mrs granger resided while at leamington in lodgings that were fashionable enough and dear enough but rather limited in point of space and conveniences so that the honourable mrs skewton being in bed had her feet in the window and her head in the fireplace while the honourable mrs skewtons maid was quartered in a closet within the drawingroom so extremely small that to avoid developing the whole of its accommodations she was obliged to writhe in and out of the door like a beautiful serpent withers the wan page slept out of the house immediately under the tiles at a neighbouring milkshop and the wheeled chair which was the stone of that young sisyphus passed the night in a shed belonging to the same dairy where newlaid eggs were produced by the poultry connected with the establishment who roosted on a broken donkeycart persuaded to all appearance that it grew there and was a species of tree  mr dombey and the major found mrs skewton arranged as cleopatra among the cushions of a sofa very airily dressed and certainly not resembling shakespeares cleopatra whom age could not wither on their way upstairs they had heard the sound of a harp but it had ceased on their being announced and edith now stood beside it handsomer and haughtier than ever it was a remarkable characteristic of this ladys beauty that it appeared to vaunt and assert itself without her aid and against her will she knew that she was beautiful it was impossible that it could be otherwise but she seemed with her own pride to defy her very self  whether she held cheap attractions that could only call forth admiration that was worthless to her or whether she designed to render them more precious to admirers by this usage of them those to whom they were precious seldom paused to consider  i hope mrs granger said mr dombey advancing a step towards her we are not the cause of your ceasing to play  you oh no  why do you not go on then my dearest edith said cleopatra  i left off as i beganof my own fancy  the exquisite indifference of her manner in saying this an indifference quite removed from dulness or insensibility for it was pointed with proud purpose was well set off by the carelessness with which she drew her hand across the strings and came from that part of the room  do you know mr dombey said her languishing mother playing with a handscreen that occasionally my dearest edith and myself actually almost differ  not quite sometimes mama said edith  oh never quite my darling fie fie it would break my heart returned her mother making a faint attempt to pat her with the screen which edith made no movement to meet about these old conventionalities of manner that are observed in little things why are we not more natural dear me with all those yearnings and gushings and impulsive throbbings that we have implanted in our souls and which are so very charming why are we not more natural  mr dombey said it was very true very true  we could be more natural i suppose if we tried said mrs skewton  mr dombey thought it possible  devil a bit maam said the major we couldnt afford it unless the world was peopled with jbstough and blunt old joes maam plain red herrings with hard roes sirwe couldnt afford it it wouldnt do  you naughty infidel said mrs skewton be mute  cleopatra commands returned the major kissing his hand and antony bagstock obeys  the man has no sensitiveness said mrs skewton cruelly holding up the handscreen so as to shut the major out no sympathy and what do we live for but sympathy what else is so extremely charming without that gleam of sunshine on our cold cold earth said mrs skewton arranging her lace tucker and complacently observing the effect of her bare lean arm looking upward from the wrist how could we possibly bear it in short obdurate man glancing at the major round the screen i would have my world all heart and faith is so excessively charming that i wont allow you to disturb it do you hear  the major replied that it was hard in cleopatra to require the world to be all heart and yet to appropriate to herself the hearts of all the world which obliged cleopatra to remind him that flattery was insupportable to her and that if he had the boldness to address her in that strain any more she would positively send him home  withers the wan at this period handing round the tea mr dombey again addressed himself to edith  there is not much company here it would seem said mr dombey in his own portentous gentlemanly way  i believe not we see none  why really observed mrs skewton from her couch there are no people here just now with whom we care to associate  they have not enough heart said edith with a smile the very twilight of a smile so singularly were its light and darkness blended  my dearest edith rallies me you see said her mother shaking her head which shook a little of itself sometimes as if the palsy bed now and then in opposition to the diamonds wicked one  you have been here before if i am not mistaken said mr dombey still to edith  oh several times i think we have been everywhere  a beautiful country  i suppose it is everybody says so  your cousin feenix raves about it edith interposed her mother from her couch  the daughter slightly turned her graceful head and raising her eyebrows by a hairsbreadth as if her cousin feenix were of all the mortal world the least to be regarded turned her eyes again towards mr dombey  i hope for the credit of my good taste that i am tired of the neighbourhood she said  you have almost reason to be madam he replied glancing at a variety of landscape drawings of which he had already recognised several as representing neighbouring points of view and which were strewn abundantly about the room if these beautiful productions are from your hand  she gave him no reply but sat in a disdainful beauty quite amazing  have they that interest said mr dombey are they yours  yes  and you play i already know  yes  and sing  yes  she answered all these questions with a strange reluctance and with that remarkable air of opposition to herself already noticed as belonging to her beauty yet she was not embarrassed but wholly selfpossessed neither did she seem to wish to avoid the conversation for she addressed her face andso far as she couldher manner also to him and continued to do so when he was silent  you have many resources against weariness at least said mr dombey  whatever their efficiency may be she returned you know them all now i have no more  may i hope to prove them all said mr dombey with solemn gallantry laying down a drawing he had held and motioning towards the harp  oh certainly if you desire it  she rose as she spoke and crossing by her mothers couch and directing a stately look towards her which was instantaneous in its duration but inclusive if anyone had seen it of a multitude of expressions among which that of the twilight smile without the smile itself overshadowed all the rest went out of the room  the major who was quite forgiven by this time had wheeled a little table up to cleopatra and was sitting down to play picquet with her mr dombey not knowing the game sat down to watch them for his edification until edith should return  we are going to have some music mr dombey i hope said cleopatra  mrs granger has been kind enough to promise so said mr dombey  ah thats very nice do you propose major  no maam said the major couldnt do it  youre a barbarous being replied the lady and my hands destroyed you are fond of music mr dombey  eminently so was mr dombeys answer  yes its very nice said cleopatra looking at her cards so much heart in itundeveloped recollections of a previous state of existenceand all thatwhich is so truly charming do you know simpered cleopatra reversing the knave of clubs who had come into her game with his heels uppermost that if anything could tempt me to put a period to my life it would be curiosity to find out what its all about and what it means there are so many provoking mysteries really that are hidden from us major you to play  the major played and mr dombey looking on for his instruction would soon have been in a state of dire confusion but that he gave no attention to the game whatever and sat wondering instead when edith would come back  she came at last and sat down to her harp and mr dombey rose and stood beside her listening he had little taste for music and no knowledge of the strain she played but he saw her bending over it and perhaps he heard among the sounding strings some distant music of his own that tamed the monster of the iron road and made it less inexorable  cleopatra had a sharp eye verily at picquet it glistened like a birds and did not fix itself upon the game but pierced the room from end to end and gleamed on harp performer listener everything  when the haughty beauty had concluded she arose and receiving mr dombeys thanks and compliments in exactly the same manner as before went with scarcely any pause to the piano and began there  edith granger any song but that edith granger you are very handsome and your touch upon the keys is brilliant and your voice is deep and rich but not the air that his neglected daughter sang to his dead son  alas he knows it not and if he did what air of hers would stir him rigid man sleep lonely florence sleep peace in thy dreams although the night has turned dark and the clouds are gathering and threaten to discharge themselves in hail    chapter 22 a trifle of management by mr carker the manager   mr carker the manager sat at his desk smooth and soft as usual reading those letters which were reserved for him to open backing them occasionally with such memoranda and references as their business purport required and parcelling them out into little heaps for distribution through the several departments of the house the post had come in heavy that morning and mr carker the manager had a good deal to do  the general action of a man so engagedpausing to look over a bundle of papers in his hand dealing them round in various portions taking up another bundle and examining its contents with knitted brows and pursedout lipsdealing and sorting and pondering by turnswould easily suggest some whimsical resemblance to a player at cards the face of mr carker the manager was in good keeping with such a fancy it was the face of a man who studied his play warily who made himself master of all the strong and weak points of the game who registered the cards in his mind as they fell about him knew exactly what was on them what they missed and what they made who was crafty to find out what the other players held and who never betrayed his own hand  the letters were in various languages but mr carker the manager read them all if there had been anything in the offices of dombey and son that he could read there would have been a card wanting in the pack he read almost at a glance and made combinations of one letter with another and one business with another as he went on adding new matter to the heapsmuch as a man would know the cards at sight and work out their combinations in his mind after they were turned something too deep for a partner and much too deep for an adversary mr carker the manager sat in the rays of the sun that came down slanting on him through the skylight playing his game alone  and although it is not among the instincts wild or domestic of the cat tribe to play at cards feline from sole to crown was mr carker the manager as he basked in the strip of summerlight and warmth that shone upon his table and the ground as if they were a crooked dialplate and himself the only figure on it with hair and whiskers deficient in colour at all times but feebler than common in the rich sunshine and more like the coat of a sandy tortoiseshell cat with long nails nicely pared and sharpened with a natural antipathy to any speck of dirt which made him pause sometimes and watch the falling motes of dust and rub them off his smooth white hand or glossy linen mr carker the manager sly of manner sharp of tooth soft of foot watchful of eye oily of tongue cruel of heart nice of habit sat with a dainty steadfastness and patience at his work as if he were waiting at a mouses hole  at length the letters were disposed of excepting one which he reserved for a particular audience having locked the more confidential correspondence in a drawer mr carker the manager rang his bell  why do you answer it was his reception of his brother  the messenger is out and i am the next was the submissive reply  you are the next muttered the manager yes creditable to me there  pointing to the heaps of opened letters he turned disdainfully away in his elbowchair and broke the seal of that one which he held in his hand  i am sorry to trouble you james said the brother gathering them up but  oh you have something to say i knew that well  mr carker the manager did not raise his eyes or turn them on his brother but kept them on his letter though without opening it  well he repeated sharply  i am uneasy about harriet  harriet who what harriet i know nobody of that name  she is not well and has changed very much of late  she changed very much a great many years ago replied the manager and that is all i have to say  i think if you would hear me  why should i hear you brother john returned the manager laying a sarcastic emphasis on those two words and throwing up his head but not lifting his eyes i tell you harriet carker made her choice many years ago between her two brothers she may repent it but she must abide by it  dont mistake me i do not say she does repent it it would be black ingratitude in me to hint at such a thing returned the other though believe me james i am as sorry for her sacrifice as you  as i exclaimed the manager as i  as sorry for her choicefor what you call her choiceas you are angry at it said the junior  angry repeated the other with a wide show of his teeth  displeased whatever word you like best you know my meaning there is no offence in my intention  there is offence in everything you do replied his brother glancing at him with a sudden scowl which in a moment gave place to a wider smile than the last carry those papers away if you please i am busy  his politeness was so much more cutting than his wrath that the junior went to the door but stopping at it and looking round he said  when harriet tried in vain to plead for me with you on your first just indignation and my first disgrace and when she left you james to follow my broken fortunes and devote herself in her mistaken affection to a ruined brother because without her he had no one and was lost she was young and pretty i think if you could see her nowif you would go and see hershe would move your admiration and compassion  the manager inclined his head and showed his teeth as who should say in answer to some careless smalltalk dear me is that the case but said never a word  we thought in those days you and i both that she would marry young and lead a happy and lighthearted life pursued the other oh if you knew how cheerfully she cast those hopes away how cheerfully she has gone forward on the path she took and never once looked back you never could say again that her name was strange in your ears never  again the manager inclined his head and showed his teeth and seemed to say remarkable indeed you quite surprise me and again he uttered never a word  may i go on said john carker mildly  on your way replied his smiling brother if you will have the goodness  john carker with a sigh was passing slowly out at the door when his brothers voice detained him for a moment on the threshold  if she has gone and goes her own way cheerfully he said throwing the still unfolded letter on his desk and putting his hands firmly in his pockets you may tell her that i go as cheerfully on mine if she has never once looked back you may tell her that i have sometimes to recall her taking part with you and that my resolution is no easier to wear away he smiled very sweetly here than marble  i tell her nothing of you we never speak about you once a year on your birthday harriet says always let us remember james by name and wish him happy but we say no more  tell it then if you please returned the other to yourself you cant repeat it too often as a lesson to you to avoid the subject in speaking to me i know no harriet carker there is no such person you may have a sister make much of her i have none  mr carker the manager took up the letter again and waved it with a smile of mock courtesy towards the door unfolding it as his brother withdrew and looking darkly after him as he left the room he once more turned round in his elbowchair and applied himself to a diligent perusal of its contents  it was in the writing of his great chief mr dombey and dated from leamington though he was a quick reader of all other letters mr carker read this slowly weighing the words as he went and bringing every tooth in his head to bear upon them when he had read it through once he turned it over again and picked out these passages i find myself benefited by the change and am not yet inclined to name any time for my return i wish carker you would arrange to come down once and see me here and let me know how things are going on in person i omitted to speak to you about young gay if not gone per son and heir or if son and heir still lying in the docks appoint some other young man and keep him in the city for the present i am not decided now thats unfortunate said mr carker the manager expanding his mouth as if it were made of indiarubber for hes far away  still that passage which was in a postscript attracted his attention and his teeth once more  i think he said my good friend captain cuttle mentioned something about being towed along in the wake of that day what a pity hes so far away  he refolded the letter and was sitting trifling with it standing it longwise and broadwise on his table and turning it over and over on all sidesdoing pretty much the same thing perhaps by its contentswhen mr perch the messenger knocked softly at the door and coming in on tiptoe bending his body at every step as if it were the delight of his life to bow laid some papers on the table  would you please to be engaged sir asked mr perch rubbing his hands and deferentially putting his head on one side like a man who felt he had no business to hold it up in such a presence and would keep it as much out of the way as possible  who wants me  why sir said mr perch in a soft voice really nobody sir to speak of at present mr gills the ships instrumentmaker sir has looked in about a little matter of payment he says but i mentioned to him sir that you was engaged several deep several deep  mr perch coughed once behind his hand and waited for further orders  anybody else  well sir said mr perch i wouldnt of my own self take the liberty of mentioning sir that there was anybody else but that same young lad that was here yesterday sir and last week has been hanging about the place and it looks sir added mr perch stopping to shut the door dreadful unbusinesslike to see him whistling to the sparrows down the court and making of em answer him  you said he wanted something to do didnt you perch asked mr carker leaning back in his chair and looking at that officer  why sir said mr perch coughing behind his hand again his expression certainly were that he was in wants of a sitiwation and that he considered something might be done for him about the docks being used to fishing with a rod and line but mr perch shook his head very dubiously indeed  what does he say when he comes asked mr carker  indeed sir said mr perch coughing another cough behind his hand which was always his resource as an expression of humility when nothing else occurred to him his observation generally air that he would humbly wish to see one of the gentlemen and that he wants to earn a living but you see sir added perch dropping his voice to a whisper and turning in the inviolable nature of his confidence to give the door a thrust with his hand and knee as if that would shut it any more when it was shut already its hardly to be bore sir that a common lad like that should come a prowling here and saying that his mother nursed our houses young gentleman and that he hopes our house will give him a chance on that account i am sure sir observed mr perch that although mrs perch was at that time nursing as thriving a little girl sir as weve ever took the liberty of adding to our family i wouldnt have made so free as drop a hint of her being capable of imparting nourishment not if it was never so  mr carker grinned at him like a shark but in an absent thoughtful manner  whether submitted mr perch after a short silence and another cough it mightnt be best for me to tell him that if he was seen here any more he would be given into custody and to keep to it with respect to bodily fear said mr perch im so timid myself by nature sir and my nerves is so unstrung by mrs perchs state that i could take my affidavit easy  let me see this fellow perch said mr carker bring him in  yes sir begging your pardon sir said mr perch hesitating at the door hes rough sir in appearance  never mind if hes there bring him in ill see mr gills directly ask him to wait  mr perch bowed and shutting the door as precisely and carefully as if he were not coming back for a week went on his quest among the sparrows in the court while he was gone mr carker assumed his favourite attitude before the fireplace and stood looking at the door presenting with his under lip tucked into the smile that showed his whole row of upper teeth a singularly crouching apace  the messenger was not long in returning followed by a pair of heavy boots that came bumping along the passage like boxes with the unceremonious words come along with youa very unusual form of introduction from his lipsmr perch then ushered into the presence a strongbuilt lad of fifteen with a round red face a round sleek head round black eyes round limbs and round body who to carry out the general rotundity of his appearance had a round hat in his hand without a particle of brim to it  obedient to a nod from mr carker perch had no sooner confronted the visitor with that gentleman than he withdrew the moment they were face to face alone mr carker without a word of preparation took him by the throat and shook him until his head seemed loose upon his shoulders  the boy who in the midst of his astonishment could not help staring wildly at the gentleman with so many white teeth who was choking him and at the office walls as though determined if he were choked that his last look should be at the mysteries for his intrusion into which he was paying such a severe penalty at last contrived to utter  come sir you let me alone will you  let you alone said mr carker what i have got you have i there was no doubt of that and tightly too you dog said mr carker through his set jaws ill strangle you  biler whimpered would he though oh no he wouldntand what was he doing ofand why didnt he strangle somebody of his own size and not him but biler was quelled by the extraordinary nature of his reception and as his head became stationary and he looked the gentleman in the face or rather in the teeth and saw him snarling at him he so far forgot his manhood as to cry  i havent done nothing to you sir said biler otherwise rob otherwise grinder and always toodle  you young scoundrel replied mr carker slowly releasing him and moving back a step into his favourite position what do you mean by daring to come here  i didnt mean no harm sir whimpered rob putting one hand to his throat and the knuckles of the other to his eyes ill never come again sir i only wanted work  work young cain that you are repeated mr carker eyeing him narrowly aint you the idlest vagabond in london  the impeachment while it much affected mr toodle junior attached to his character so justly that he could not say a word in denial he stood looking at the gentleman therefore with a frightened selfconvicted and remorseful air as to his looking at him it may be observed that he was fascinated by mr carker and never took his round eyes off him for an instant  aint you a thief said mr carker with his hands behind him in his pockets  no sir pleaded rob  you are said mr carker  i aint indeed sir whimpered rob i never did such a thing as thieve sir if youll believe me i know ive been a going wrong sir ever since i took to birdcatching and walkingmatching im sure a cove might think said mr toodle junior with a burst of penitence that singing birds was innocent company but nobody knows what harm is in them little creeturs and what they brings you down to  they seemed to have brought him down to a velveteen jacket and trousers very much the worse for wear a particularly small red waistcoat like a gorget an interval of blue check and the hat before mentioned  i aint been home twenty times since them birds got their will of me said rob and thats ten months how can i go home when everybodys miserable to see me i wonder said biler blubbering outright and smearing his eyes with his coatcuff that i havent been and drownded myself over and over again  all of which including his expression of surprise at not having achieved this last scarce performance the boy said just as if the teeth of mr carker drew it out of him and he had no power of concealing anything with that battery of attraction in full play  youre a nice young gentleman said mr carker shaking his head at him theres hempseed sown for you my fine fellow  im sure sir returned the wretched biler blubbering again and again having recourse to his coatcuff i shouldnt care sometimes if it was growed too my misfortunes all began in wagging sir but what could i do exceptin wag  excepting what said mr carker  wag sir wagging from school  do you mean pretending to go there and not going said mr carker  yes sir thats wagging sir returned the quondam grinder much affected i was chivied through the streets sir when i went there and pounded when i got there so i wagged and hid myself and that began it  and you mean to tell me said mr carker taking him by the throat again holding him out at armslength and surveying him in silence for some moments that you want a place do you  i should be thankful to be tried sir returned toodle junior faintly  mr carker the manager pushed him backward into a cornerthe boy submitting quietly hardly venturing to breathe and never once removing his eyes from his faceand rang the bell  tell mr gills to come here  mr perch was too deferential to express surprise or recognition of the figure in the corner and uncle sol appeared immediately  mr gills said carker with a smile sit down how do you do you continue to enjoy your health i hope  thank you sir returned uncle sol taking out his pocketbook and handing over some notes as he spoke nothing ails me in body but old age twentyfive sir  you are as punctual and exact mr gills replied the smiling manager taking a paper from one of his many drawers and making an endorsement on it while uncle sol looked over him as one of your own chronometers quite right  the son and heir has not been spoken i find by the list sir said uncle sol with a slight addition to the usual tremor in his voice  the son and heir has not been spoken returned carker there seems to have been tempestuous weather mr gills and she has probably been driven out of her course  she is safe i trust in heaven said old sol  she is safe i trust in heaven assented mr carker in that voiceless manner of his which made the observant young toodle tremble again mr gills he added aloud throwing himself back in his chair you must miss your nephew very much  uncle sol standing by him shook his head and heaved a deep sigh  mr gills said carker with his soft hand playing round his mouth and looking up into the instrumentmakers face it would be company to you to have a young fellow in your shop just now and it would be obliging me if you would give one houseroom for the present no to be sure he added quickly in anticipation of what the old man was going to say theres not much business doing there i know but you can make him clean the place out polish up the instruments drudge mr gills thats the lad  sol gills pulled down his spectacles from his forehead to his eyes and looked at toodle junior standing upright in the corner his head presenting the appearance which it always did of having been newly drawn out of a bucket of cold water his small waistcoat rising and falling quickly in the play of his emotions and his eyes intently fixed on mr carker without the least reference to his proposed master  will you give him houseroom mr gills said the manager  old sol without being quite enthusiastic on the subject replied that he was glad of any opportunity however slight to oblige mr carker whose wish on such a point was a command and that the wooden midshipman would consider himself happy to receive in his berth any visitor of mr carkers selecting  mr carker bared himself to the tops and bottoms of his gums making the watchful toodle junior tremble more and more and acknowledged the instrumentmakers politeness in his most affable manner  ill dispose of him so then mr gills he answered rising and shaking the old man by the hand until i make up my mind what to do with him and what he deserves as i consider myself responsible for him mr gills here he smiled a wide smile at rob who shook before it i shall be glad if youll look sharply after him and report his behaviour to me ill ask a question or two of his parents as i ride home this afternoonrespectable peopleto confirm some particulars in his own account of himself and that done mr gills ill send him round to you tomorrow morning goodbye  his smile at parting was so full of teeth that it confused old sol and made him vaguely uncomfortable he went home thinking of raging seas foundering ships drowning men an ancient bottle of madeira never brought to light and other dismal matters  now boy said mr carker putting his hand on young toodles shoulder and bringing him out into the middle of the room you have heard me  rob said yes sir  perhaps you understand pursued his patron that if you ever deceive or play tricks with me you had better have drowned yourself indeed once for all before you came here  there was nothing in any branch of mental acquisition that rob seemed to understand better than that  if you have lied to me said mr carker in anything never come in my way again if not you may let me find you waiting for me somewhere near your mothers house this afternoon i shall leave this at five oclock and ride there on horseback now give me the address  rob repeated it slowly as mr carker wrote it down rob even spelt it over a second time letter by letter as if he thought that the omission of a dot or scratch would lead to his destruction mr carker then handed him out of the room and rob keeping his round eyes fixed upon his patron to the last vanished for the time being  mr carker the manager did a great deal of business in the course of the day and stowed his teeth upon a great many people in the office in the court in the street and on change they glistened and bristled to a terrible extent five oclock arriving and with it mr carkers bay horse they got on horseback and went gleaming up cheapside  as no one can easily ride fast even if inclined to do so through the press and throng of the city at that hour and as mr carker was not inclined he went leisurely along picking his way among the carts and carriages avoiding whenever he could the wetter and more dirty places in the overwatered road and taking infinite pains to keep himself and his steed clean glancing at the passersby while he was thus ambling on his way he suddenly encountered the round eyes of the sleekheaded rob intently fixed upon his face as if they had never been taken off while the boy himself with a pockethandkerchief twisted up like a speckled eel and girded round his waist made a very conspicuous demonstration of being prepared to attend upon him at whatever pace he might think proper to go  this attention however flattering being one of an unusual kind and attracting some notice from the other passengers mr carker took advantage of a clearer thoroughfare and a cleaner road and broke into a trot rob immediately did the same mr carker presently tried a canter rob was still in attendance then a short gallop it was all one to the boy whenever mr carker turned his eyes to that side of the road he still saw toodle junior holding his course apparently without distress and working himself along by the elbows after the most approved manner of professional gentlemen who get over the ground for wagers  ridiculous as this attendance was it was a sign of an influence established over the boy and therefore mr carker affecting not to notice it rode away into the neighbourhood of mr toodles house on his slackening his pace here rob appeared before him to point out the turnings and when he called to a man at a neighbouring gateway to hold his horse pending his visit to the buildings that had succeeded staggss gardens rob dutifully held the stirrup while the manager dismounted  now sir said mr carker taking him by the shoulder come along  the prodigal son was evidently nervous of visiting the parental abode but mr carker pushing him on before he had nothing for it but to open the right door and suffer himself to be walked into the midst of his brothers and sisters mustered in overwhelming force round the family teatable at sight of the prodigal in the grasp of a stranger these tender relations united in a general howl which smote upon the prodigals breast so sharply when he saw his mother stand up among them pale and trembling with the baby in her arms that he lent his own voice to the chorus  nothing doubting now that the stranger if not mr ketch in person was one of that company the whole of the young family wailed the louder while its more infantine members unable to control the transports of emotion appertaining to their time of life threw themselves on their backs like young birds when terrified by a hawk and kicked violently at length poor polly making herself audible said with quivering lips oh rob my poor boy what have you done at last  nothing mother cried rob in a piteous voice ask the gentleman  dont be alarmed said mr carker i want to do him good  at this announcement polly who had not cried yet began to do so the elder toodles who appeared to have been meditating a rescue unclenched their fists the younger toodles clustered round their mothers gown and peeped from under their own chubby arms at their desperado brother and his unknown friend everybody blessed the gentleman with the beautiful teeth who wanted to do good  this fellow said mr carker to polly giving him a gentle shake is your son eh maam  yes sir sobbed polly with a curtsey yes sir  a bad son i am afraid said mr carker  never a bad son to me sir returned polly  to whom then demanded mr carker  he has been a little wild sir returned polly checking the baby who was making convulsive efforts with his arms and legs to launch himself on biler through the ambient air and has gone with wrong companions but i hope he has seen the misery of that sir and will do well again  mr carker looked at polly and the clean room and the clean children and the simple toodle face combined of father and mother that was reflected and repeated everywhere about himand seemed to have achieved the real purpose of his visit  your husband i take it is not at home he said  no sir replied polly hes down the line at present  the prodigal rob seemed very much relieved to hear it though still in the absorption of all his faculties in his patron he hardly took his eyes from mr carkers face unless for a moment at a time to steal a sorrowful glance at his mother  then said mr carker ill tell you how i have stumbled on this boy of yours and who i am and what i am going to do for him  this mr carker did in his own way saying that he at first intended to have accumulated nameless terrors on his presumptuous head for coming to the whereabout of dombey and son that he had relented in consideration of his youth his professed contrition and his friends that he was afraid he took a rash step in doing anything for the boy and one that might expose him to the censure of the prudent but that he did it of himself and for himself and risked the consequences singlehanded and that his mothers past connexion with mr dombeys family had nothing to do with it and that mr dombey had nothing to do with it but that he mr carker was the beall and the endall of this business taking great credit to himself for his goodness and receiving no less from all the family then present mr carker signified indirectly but still pretty plainly that robs implicit fidelity attachment and devotion were for evermore his due and the least homage he could receive and with this great truth rob himself was so impressed that standing gazing on his patron with tears rolling down his cheeks he nodded his shiny head until it seemed almost as loose as it had done under the same patrons hands that morning  polly who had passed heaven knows how many sleepless nights on account of this her dissipated firstborn and had not seen him for weeks and weeks could have almost kneeled to mr carker the manager as to a good spiritin spite of his teeth but mr carker rising to depart she only thanked him with her mothers prayers and blessings thanks so rich when paid out of the hearts mint especially for any service mr carker had rendered that he might have given back a large amount of change and yet been overpaid  as that gentleman made his way among the crowding children to the door rob retreated on his mother and took her and the baby in the same repentant hug  ill try hard dear mother now upon my soul i will said rob  oh do my dear boy i am sure you will for our sakes and your own cried polly kissing him but youre coming back to speak to me when you have seen the gentleman away  i dont know mother rob hesitated and looked down fatherwhens he coming home  not till two oclock tomorrow morning  ill come back mother dear cried rob and passing through the shrill cry of his brothers and sisters in reception of this promise he followed mr carker out  what said mr carker who had heard this you have a bad father have you  no sir returned rob amazed there aint a better nor a kinder father going than mine is  why dont you want to see him then inquired his patron  theres such a difference between a father and a mother sir said rob after faltering for a moment he couldnt hardly believe yet that i was doing to do betterthough i know hed try to but a mothershe always believes whats good sir at least i know my mother does god bless her  mr carkers mouth expanded but he said no more until he was mounted on his horse and had dismissed the man who held it when looking down from the saddle steadily into the attentive and watchful face of the boy he said  youll come to me tomorrow morning and you shall be shown where that old gentleman lives that old gentleman who was with me this morning where you are going as you heard me say  yes sir returned rob  i have a great interest in that old gentleman and in serving him you serve me boy do you understand well he added interrupting him for he saw his round face brighten when he was told that i see you do i want to know all about that old gentleman and how he goes on from day to dayfor i am anxious to be of service to himand especially who comes there to see him do you understand  rob nodded his steadfast face and said yes sir again  i should like to know that he has friends who are attentive to him and that they dont desert himfor he lives very much alone now poor fellow but that they are fond of him and of his nephew who has gone abroad there is a very young lady who may perhaps come to see him i want particularly to know all about her  ill take care sir said the boy  and take care returned his patron bending forward to advance his grinning face closer to the boys and pat him on the shoulder with the handle of his whip take care you talk about affairs of mine to nobody but me  to nobody in the world sir replied rob shaking his head  neither there said mr carker pointing to the place they had just left nor anywhere else ill try how true and grateful you can be ill prove you making this by his display of teeth and by the action of his head as much a threat as a promise he turned from robs eyes which were nailed upon him as if he had won the boy by a charm body and soul and rode away but again becoming conscious after trotting a short distance that his devoted henchman girt as before was yielding him the same attendance to the great amusement of sundry spectators he reined up and ordered him off to ensure his obedience he turned in the saddle and watched him as he retired it was curious to see that even then rob could not keep his eyes wholly averted from his patrons face but constantly turning and turning again to look after him involved himself in a tempest of buffetings and jostlings from the other passengers in the street of which in the pursuit of the one paramount idea he was perfectly heedless  mr carker the manager rode on at a footpace with the easy air of one who had performed all the business of the day in a satisfactory manner and got it comfortably off his mind complacent and affable as man could be mr carker picked his way along the streets and hummed a soft tune as he went he seemed to purr he was so glad  and in some sort mr carker in his fancy basked upon a hearth too coiled up snugly at certain feet he was ready for a spring or for a tear or for a scratch or for a velvet touch as the humour took him and occasion served was there any bird in a cage that came in for a share of his regards  a very young lady thought mr carker the manager through his song ay when i saw her last she was a little child with dark eyes and hair i recollect and a good face a very good face i daresay shes pretty  more affable and pleasant yet and humming his song until his many teeth vibrated to it mr carker picked his way along and turned at last into the shady street where mr dombeys house stood he had been so busy winding webs round good faces and obscuring them with meshes that he hardly thought of being at this point of his ride until glancing down the cold perspective of tall houses he reined in his horse quickly within a few yards of the door but to explain why mr carker reined in his horse quickly and what he looked at in no small surprise a few digressive words are necessary  mr toots emancipated from the blimber thraldom and coming into the possession of a certain portion of his worldly wealth which as he had been wont during his last halfyears probation to communicate to mr feeder every evening as a new discovery the executors couldnt keep him out of had applied himself with great diligence to the science of life fired with a noble emulation to pursue a brilliant and distinguished career mr toots had furnished a choice set of apartments had established among them a sporting bower embellished with the portraits of winning horses in which he took no particle of interest and a divan which made him poorly in this delicious abode mr toots devoted himself to the cultivation of those gentle arts which refine and humanise existence his chief instructor in which was an interesting character called the game chicken who was always to be heard of at the bar of the black badger wore a shaggy white greatcoat in the warmest weather and knocked mr toots about the head three times a week for the small consideration of ten and six per visit  the game chicken who was quite the apollo of mr tootss pantheon had introduced to him a marker who taught billiards a life guard who taught fencing a jobmaster who taught riding a cornish gentleman who was up to anything in the athletic line and two or three other friends connected no less intimately with the fine arts under whose auspices mr toots could hardly fail to improve apace and under whose tuition he went to work  but however it came about it came to pass even while these gentlemen had the gloss of novelty upon them that mr toots felt he didnt know how unsettled and uneasy there were husks in his corn that even game chickens couldnt peck up gloomy giants in his leisure that even game chickens couldnt knock down nothing seemed to do mr toots so much good as incessantly leaving cards at mr dombeys door no taxgatherer in the british dominionsthat widespread territory on which the sun never sets and where the taxgatherer never goes to bedwas more regular and persevering in his calls than mr toots  mr toots never went upstairs and always performed the same ceremonies richly dressed for the purpose at the hall door  oh good morning would be mr tootss first remark to the servant for mr dombey would be mr tootss next remark as he handed in a card for miss dombey would be his next as he handed in another  mr toots would then turn round as if to go away but the man knew him by this time and knew he wouldnt  oh i beg your pardon mr toots would say as if a thought had suddenly descended on him is the young woman at home  the man would rather think she was but wouldnt quite know then he would ring a bell that rang upstairs and would look up the staircase and would say yes she was at home and was coming down then miss nipper would appear and the man would retire  oh how de do mr toots would say with a chuckle and a blush  susan would thank him and say she was very well  hows diogenes going on would be mr tootss second interrogation  very well indeed miss florence was fonder and fonder of him every day mr toots was sure to hail this with a burst of chuckles like the opening of a bottle of some effervescent beverage  miss florence is quite well sir susan would add  oh its of no consequence thankee was the invariable reply of mr toots and when he had said so he always went away very fast  now it is certain that mr toots had a filmy something in his mind which led him to conclude that if he could aspire successfully in the fulness of time to the hand of florence he would be fortunate and blest it is certain that mr toots by some remote and roundabout road had got to that point and that there he made a stand his heart was wounded he was touched he was in love he had made a desperate attempt one night and had sat up all night for the purpose to write an acrostic on florence which affected him to tears in the conception but he never proceeded in the execution further than the words for when i gazethe flow of imagination in which he had previously written down the initial letters of the other seven lines deserting him at that point  beyond devising that very artful and politic measure of leaving a card for mr dombey daily the brain of mr toots had not worked much in reference to the subject that held his feelings prisoner but deep consideration at length assured mr toots that an important step to gain was the conciliation of miss susan nipper preparatory to giving her some inkling of his state of mind  a little light and playful gallantry towards this lady seemed the means to employ in that early chapter of the history for winning her to his interests not being able quite to make up his mind about it he consulted the chickenwithout taking that gentleman into his confidence merely informing him that a friend in yorkshire had written to him mr toots for his opinion on such a question the chicken replying that his opinion always was go in and win and further when your mans before you and your work cut out go in and do it mr toots considered this a figurative way of supporting his own view of the case and heroically resolved to kiss miss nipper next day  upon the next day therefore mr toots putting into requisition some of the greatest marvels that burgess and co had ever turned out went off to mr dombeys upon this design but his heart failed him so much as he approached the scene of action that although he arrived on the ground at three oclock in the afternoon it was six before he knocked at the door  everything happened as usual down to the point where susan said her young mistress was well and mr toots said it was of no consequence to her amazement mr toots instead of going off like a rocket after that observation lingered and chuckled  perhaps youd like to walk upstairs sir said susan  well i think i will come in said mr toots  but instead of walking upstairs the bold toots made an awkward plunge at susan when the door was shut and embracing that fair creature kissed her on the cheek  go along with you cried susan or ill tear your eyes out  just another said mr toots  go along with you exclaimed susan giving him a push innocents like you too wholl begin next go along sir  susan was not in any serious strait for she could hardly speak for laughing but diogenes on the staircase hearing a rustling against the wall and a shuffling of feet and seeing through the banisters that there was some contention going on and foreign invasion in the house formed a different opinion dashed down to the rescue and in the twinkling of an eye had mr toots by the leg  susan screamed laughed opened the streetdoor and ran downstairs the bold toots tumbled staggering out into the street with diogenes holding on to one leg of his pantaloons as if burgess and co were his cooks and had provided that dainty morsel for his holiday entertainment diogenes shaken off rolled over and over in the dust got up again whirled round the giddy toots and snapped at him and all this turmoil mr carker reigning up his horse and sitting a little at a distance saw to his amazement issue from the stately house of mr dombey  mr carker remained watching the discomfited toots when diogenes was called in and the door shut and while that gentleman taking refuge in a doorway near at hand bound up the torn leg of his pantaloons with a costly silk handkerchief that had formed part of his expensive outfit for the advent  i beg your pardon sir said mr carker riding up with his most propitiatory smile i hope you are not hurt  oh no thank you replied mr toots raising his flushed face its of no consequence mr toots would have signified if he could that he liked it very much  if the dogs teeth have entered the leg sir began carker with a display of his own  no thank you said mr toots its all quite right its very comfortable thank you  i have the pleasure of knowing mr dombey observed carker  have you though rejoined the blushing took  and you will allow me perhaps to apologise in his absence said mr carker taking off his hat for such a misadventure and to wonder how it can possibly have happened  mr toots is so much gratified by this politeness and the lucky chance of making friends with a friend of mr dombey that he pulls out his cardcase which he never loses an opportunity of using and hands his name and address to mr carker who responds to that courtesy by giving him his own and with that they part  as mr carker picks his way so softly past the house looking up at the windows and trying to make out the pensive face behind the curtain looking at the children opposite the rough head of diogenes came clambering up close by it and the dog regardless of all soothing barks and growls and makes at him from that height as if he would spring down and tear him limb from limb  well spoken di so near your mistress another and another with your head up your eyes flashing and your vexed mouth worrying itself for want of him another as he picks his way along you have a good scent dicats boy cats    chapter 23 florence solitary and the midshipman mysterious   florence lived alone in the great dreary house and day succeeded day and still she lived alone and the blank walls looked down upon her with a vacant stare as if they had a gorgonlike mind to stare her youth and beauty into stone  no magic dwellingplace in magic story shut up in the heart of a thick wood was ever more solitary and deserted to the fancy than was her fathers mansion in its grim reality as it stood lowering on the street always by night when lights were shining from neighbouring windows a blot upon its scanty brightness always by day a frown upon its neversmiling face  there were not two dragon sentries keeping ward before the gate of this above as in magic legend are usually found on duty over the wronged innocence imprisoned but besides a glowering visage with its thin lips parted wickedly that surveyed all comers from above the archway of the door there was a monstrous fantasy of rusty iron curling and twisting like a petrifaction of an arbour over threshold budding in spikes and corkscrew points and bearing one on either side two ominous extinguishers that seemed to say who enter here leave light behind there were no talismanic characters engraven on the portal but the house was now so neglected in appearance that boys chalked the railings and the pavementparticularly round the corner where the side wall wasand drew ghosts on the stable door and being sometimes driven off by mr towlinson made portraits of him in return with his ears growing out horizontally from under his hat noise ceased to be within the shadow of the roof the brass band that came into the street once a week in the morning never brayed a note in at those windows but all such company down to a poor little piping organ of weak intellect with an imbecile party of automaton dancers waltzing in and out at foldingdoors fell off from it with one accord and shunned it as a hopeless place  the spell upon it was more wasting than the spell that used to set enchanted houses sleeping once upon a time but left their waking freshness unimpaired the passive desolation of disuse was everywhere silently manifest about it within doors curtains drooping heavily lost their old folds and shapes and hung like cumbrous palls hecatombs of furniture still piled and covered up shrunk like imprisoned and forgotten men and changed insensibly mirrors were dim as with the breath of years patterns of carpets faded and became perplexed and faint like the memory of those years trifling incidents boards starting at unwonted footsteps creaked and shook keys rusted in the locks of doors damp started on the walls and as the stains came out the pictures seemed to go in and secrete themselves mildew and mould began to lurk in closets fungus trees grew in corners of the cellars dust accumulated nobody knew whence nor how spiders moths and grubs were heard of every day an exploratory blackbeetle now and then was found immovable upon the stairs or in an upper room as wondering how he got there rats began to squeak and scuffle in the night time through dark galleries they mined behind the panelling  the dreary magnificence of the state rooms seen imperfectly by the doubtful light admitted through closed shutters would have answered well enough for an enchanted abode such as the tarnished paws of gilded lions stealthily put out from beneath their wrappers the marble lineaments of busts on pedestals fearfully revealing themselves through veils the clocks that never told the time or if wound up by any chance told it wrong and struck unearthly numbers which are not upon the dial the accidental tinklings among the pendant lustres more startling than alarmbells the softened sounds and laggard air that made their way among these objects and a phantom crowd of others shrouded and hooded and made spectral of shape but besides there was the great staircase where the lord of the place so rarely set his foot and by which his little child had gone up to heaven there were other staircases and passages where no one went for weeks together there were two closed rooms associated with dead members of the family and with whispered recollections of them and to all the house but florence there was a gentle figure moving through the solitude and gloom that gave to every lifeless thing a touch of present human interest and wonder  for florence lived alone in the deserted house and day succeeded day and still she lived alone and the cold walls looked down upon her with a vacant stare as if they had a gorgonlike mind to stare her youth and beauty into stone  the grass began to grow upon the roof and in the crevices of the basement paving a scaly crumbling vegetation sprouted round the windowsills fragments of mortar lost their hold upon the insides of the unused chimneys and came dropping down the two trees with the smoky trunks were blighted high up and the withered branches domineered above the leaves through the whole building white had turned yellow yellow nearly black and since the time when the poor lady died it had slowly become a dark gap in the long monotonous street  but florence bloomed there like the kings fair daughter in the story her books her music and her daily teachers were her only real companions susan nipper and diogenes excepted of whom the former in her attendance on the studies of her young mistress began to grow quite learned herself while the latter softened possibly by the same influences would lay his head upon the windowledge and placidly open and shut his eyes upon the street all through a summer morning sometimes pricking up his head to look with great significance after some noisy dog in a cart who was barking his way along and sometimes with an exasperated and unaccountable recollection of his supposed enemy in the neighbourhood rushing to the door whence after a deafening disturbance he would come jogging back with a ridiculous complacency that belonged to him and lay his jaw upon the windowledge again with the air of a dog who had done a public service  so florence lived in her wilderness of a home within the circle of her innocent pursuits and thoughts and nothing harmed her she could go down to her fathers rooms now and think of him and suffer her loving heart humbly to approach him without fear of repulse she could look upon the objects that had surrounded him in his sorrow and could nestle near his chair and not dread the glance that she so well remembered she could render him such little tokens of her duty and service as putting everything in order for him with her own hands binding little nosegays for table changing them as one by one they withered and he did not come back preparing something for him every day and leaving some timid mark of her presence near his usual seat today it was a little painted stand for his watch tomorrow she would be afraid to leave it and would substitute some other trifle of her making not so likely to attract his eye waking in the night perhaps she would tremble at the thought of his coming home and angrily rejecting it and would hurry down with slippered feet and quickly beating heart and bring it away at another time she would only lay her face upon his desk and leave a kiss there and a tear  still no one knew of this unless the household found it out when she was not thereand they all held mr dombeys rooms in aweit was as deep a secret in her breast as what had gone before it florence stole into those rooms at twilight early in the morning and at times when meals were served downstairs and although they were in every nook the better and the brighter for her care she entered and passed out as quietly as any sunbeam opting that she left her light behind  shadowy company attended florence up and down the echoing house and sat with her in the dismantled rooms as if her life were an enchanted vision there arose out of her solitude ministering thoughts that made it fanciful and unreal she imagined so often what her life would have been if her father could have loved her and she had been a favourite child that sometimes for the moment she almost believed it was so and borne on by the current of that pensive fiction seemed to remember how they had watched her brother in his grave together how they had freely shared his heart between them how they were united in the dear remembrance of him how they often spoke about him yet and her kind father looking at her gently told her of their common hope and trust in god at other times she pictured to herself her mother yet alive and oh the happiness of falling on her neck and clinging to her with the love and confidence of all her soul and oh the desolation of the solitary house again with evening coming on and no one there  but there was one thought scarcely shaped out to herself yet fervent and strong within her that upheld florence when she strove and filled her true young heart so sorely tried with constancy of purpose into her mind as into all others contending with the great affliction of our mortal nature there had stolen solemn wonderings and hopes arising in the dim world beyond the present life and murmuring like faint music of recognition in the faroff land between her brother and her mother of some present consciousness in both of her some love and commiseration for her and some knowledge of her as she went her way upon the earth it was a soothing consolation to florence to give shelter to these thoughts until one dayit was soon after she had last seen her father in his own room late at nightthe fancy came upon her that in weeping for his alienated heart she might stir the spirits of the dead against him wild weak childish as it may have been to think so and to tremble at the halfformed thought it was the impulse of her loving nature and from that hour florence strove against the cruel wound in her breast and tried to think of him whose hand had made it only with hope  her father did not knowshe held to it from that timehow much she loved him she was very young and had no mother and had never learned by some fault or misfortune how to express to him that she loved him she would be patient and would try to gain that art in time and win him to a better knowledge of his only child  this became the purpose of her life the morning sun shone down upon the faded house and found the resolution bright and fresh within the bosom of its solitary mistress through all the duties of the day it animated her for florence hoped that the more she knew and the more accomplished she became the more glad he would be when he came to know and like her sometimes she wondered with a swelling heart and rising tear whether she was proficient enough in anything to surprise him when they should become companions sometimes she tried to think if there were any kind of knowledge that would bespeak his interest more readily than another always at her books her music and her work in her morning walks and in her nightly prayers she had her engrossing aim in view strange study for a child to learn the road to a hard parents heart  there were many careless loungers through the street as the summer evening deepened into night who glanced across the road at the sombre house and saw the youthful figure at the window such a contrast to it looking upward at the stars as they began to shine who would have slept the worse if they had known on what design she mused so steady the reputation of the mansion as a haunted house would not have been the gayer with some humble dwellers elsewhere who were struck by its external gloom in passing and repassing on their daily avocations and so named it if they could have read its story in the darkening face but florence held her sacred purpose unsuspected and unaided and studied only how to bring her father to the understanding that she loved him and made no appeal against him in any wandering thought  thus florence lived alone in the deserted house and day succeeded day and still she lived alone and the monotonous walls looked down upon her with a stare as if they had a gorgonlike intent to stare her youth and beauty into stone  susan nipper stood opposite to her young mistress one morning as she folded and sealed a note she had been writing and showed in her looks an approving knowledge of its contents  better late than never dear miss floy said susan and i do say that even a visit to them old skettleses will be a godsend  it is very good of sir barnet and lady skettles susan returned florence with a mild correction of that young ladys familiar mention of the family in question to repeat their invitation so kindly  miss nipper who was perhaps the most thoroughgoing partisan on the face of the earth and who carried her partisanship into all matters great or small and perpetually waged war with it against society screwed up her lips and shook her head as a protest against any recognition of disinterestedness in the skettleses and a plea in bar that they would have valuable consideration for their kindness in the company of florence  they know what theyre about if ever people did murmured miss nipper drawing in her breath oh trust them skettleses for that  i am not very anxious to go to fulham susan i confess said florence thoughtfully but it will be right to go i think it will be better  much better interposed susan with another emphatic shake of her head  and so said florence though i would prefer to have gone when there was no one there instead of in this vacation time when it seems there are some young people staying in the house i have thankfully said yes  for which i say miss floy oh be joyful returned susan ah  this last ejaculation with which miss nipper frequently wound up a sentence at about that epoch of time was supposed below the level of the hall to have a general reference to mr dombey and to be expressive of a yearning in miss nipper to favour that gentleman with a piece of her mind but she never explained it and it had in consequence the charm of mystery in addition to the advantage of the sharpest expression  how long it is before we have any news of walter susan observed florence after a moments silence  long indeed miss floy replied her maid and perch said when he came just now to see for lettersbut what signifies what he says exclaimed susan reddening and breaking off much he knows about it  florence raised her eyes quickly and a flush overspread her face  if i hadnt said susan nipper evidently struggling with some latent anxiety and alarm and looking full at her young mistress while endeavouring to work herself into a state of resentment with the unoffending mr perchs image if i hadnt more manliness than that insipidest of his sex id never take pride in my hair again but turn it up behind my ears and wear coarse caps without a bit of border until death released me from my insignificance i may not be a amazon miss floy and wouldnt so demean myself by such disfigurement but anyways im not a giver up i hope  give up what cried florence with a face of terror  why nothing miss said susan good gracious nothing its only that wet curlpaper of a man perch that anyone might almost make away with with a touch and really it would be a blessed event for all parties if someone would take pity on him and would have the goodness  does he give up the ship susan inquired florence very pale  no miss returned susan i should like to see him make so bold as do it to my face no miss but he goes on about some bothering ginger that mr walter was to send to mrs perch and shakes his dismal head and says he hopes it may be coming anyhow he says it cant come now in time for the intended occasion but may do for next which really said miss nipper with aggravated scorn puts me out of patience with the man for though i can bear a great deal i am not a camel neither am i added susan after a moments consideration if i know myself a dromedary neither  what else does he say susan inquired florence earnestly wont you tell me  as if i wouldnt tell you anything miss floy and everything said susan why nothing miss he says that there begins to be a general talk about the ship and that they have never had a ship on that voyage half so long unheard of and that the captains wife was at the office yesterday and seemed a little put out about it but anyone could say that we knew nearly that before  i must visit walters uncle said florence hurriedly before i leave home i will go and see him this morning let us walk there directly susan  miss nipper having nothing to urge against the proposal but being perfectly acquiescent they were soon equipped and in the streets and on their way towards the little midshipman  the state of mind in which poor walter had gone to captain cuttles on the day when brogley the broker came into possession and when there seemed to him to be an execution in the very steeples was pretty much the same as that in which florence now took her way to uncle sols with this difference that florence suffered the added pain of thinking that she had been perhaps the innocent occasion of involving walter in peril and all to whom he was dear herself included in an agony of suspense for the rest uncertainty and danger seemed written upon everything the weathercocks on spires and housetops were mysterious with hints of stormy wind and pointed like so many ghostly fingers out to dangerous seas where fragments of great wrecks were drifting perhaps and helpless men were rocked upon them into a sleep as deep as the unfathomable waters when florence came into the city and passed gentlemen who were talking together she dreaded to hear them speaking of the ship and saying it was lost pictures and prints of vessels fighting with the rolling waves filled her with alarm the smoke and clouds though moving gently moved too fast for her apprehensions and made her fear there was a tempest blowing at that moment on the ocean  susan nipper may or may not have been affected similarly but having her attention much engaged in struggles with boys whenever there was any press of peoplefor between that grade of human kind and herself there was some natural animosity that invariably broke out whenever they came togetherit would seem that she had not much leisure on the road for intellectual operations  arriving in good time abreast of the wooden midshipman on the opposite side of the way and waiting for an opportunity to cross the street they were a little surprised at first to see at the instrumentmakers door a roundheaded lad with his chubby face addressed towards the sky who as they looked at him suddenly thrust into his capacious mouth two fingers of each hand and with the assistance of that machinery whistled with astonishing shrillness to some pigeons at a considerable elevation in the air  mrs richardss eldest miss said susan and the worrit of mrs richardss life  as polly had been to tell florence of the resuscitated prospects of her son and heir florence was prepared for the meeting so a favourable moment presenting itself they both hastened across without any further contemplation of mrs richardss bane that sporting character unconscious of their approach again whistled with his utmost might and then yelled in a rapture of excitement strays whip strays which identification had such an effect upon the consciencestricken pigeons that instead of going direct to some town in the north of england as appeared to have been their original intention they began to wheel and falter whereupon mrs richardss first born pierced them with another whistle and again yelled in a voice that rose above the turmoil of the street strays whooop strays  from this transport he was abruptly recalled to terrestrial objects by a poke from miss nipper which sent him into the shop  is this the way you show your penitence when mrs richards has been fretting for you months and months said susan following the poke wheres mr gills  rob who smoothed his first rebellious glance at miss nipper when he saw florence following put his knuckles to his hair in honour of the latter and said to the former that mr gills was out  fetch him home said miss nipper with authority and say that my young ladys here  i dont know where hes gone said rob  is that your penitence cried susan with stinging sharpness  why how can i go and fetch him when i dont know where to go whimpered the baited rob how can you be so unreasonable  did mr gills say when he should be home asked florence  yes miss replied rob with another application of his knuckles to his hair he said he should be home early in the afternoon in about a couple of hours from now miss  is he very anxious about his nephew inquired susan  yes miss returned rob preferring to address himself to florence and slighting nipper i should say he was very much so he aint indoors miss not a quarter of an hour together he cant settle in one place five minutes he goes about like ajust like a stray said rob stooping to get a glimpse of the pigeons through the window and checking himself with his fingers halfway to his mouth on the verge of another whistle  do you know a friend of mr gills called captain cuttle inquired florence after a moments reflection  him with a hook miss rejoined rob with an illustrative twist of his left hand yes miss he was here the day before yesterday  has he not been here since asked susan  no miss returned rob still addressing his reply to florence  perhaps walters uncle has gone there susan observed florence turning to her  to captain cuttles miss interposed rob no hes not gone there miss because he left particular word that if captain cuttle called i should tell him how surprised he was not to have seen him yesterday and should make him stop till he came back  do you know where captain cuttle lives asked florence  rob replied in the affirmative and turning to a greasy parchment book on the shop desk read the address aloud  florence again turned to her maid and took counsel with her in a low voice while rob the roundeyed mindful of his patrons secret charge looked on and listened florence proposed that they could go to captain cuttles house hear from his own lips what he thought of the absence of any tidings ofthe son and heir and bring him if they could to comfort uncle sol susan at first objected slightly on the score of distance but a hackneycoach being mentioned by her mistress withdrew that opposition and gave in her assent there were some minutes of discussion between them before they came to this conclusion during which the staring rob paid close attention to both speakers and inclined his ear to each by turns as if he were appointed arbitrator of the argument  in time rob was despatched for a coach the visitors keeping shop meanwhile and when he brought it they got into it leaving word for uncle sol that they would be sure to call again on their way back rob having stared after the coach until it was as invisible as the pigeons had now become sat down behind the desk with a most assiduous demeanour and in order that he might forget nothing of what had transpired made notes of it on various small scraps of paper with a vast expenditure of ink there was no danger of these documents betraying anything if accidentally lost for long before a word was dry it became as profound a mystery to rob as if he had had no part whatever in its production  while he was yet busy with these labours the hackneycoach after encountering unheardof difficulties from swivelbridges soft roads impassable canals caravans of casks settlements of scarletbeans and little washhouses and many such obstacles abounding in that country stopped at the corner of brig place alighting here florence and susan nipper walked down the street and sought out the abode of captain cuttle  it happened by evil chance to be one of mrs macstingers great cleaning days on these occasions mrs macstinger was knocked up by the policeman at a quarter before three in the morning and rarely such before twelve oclock next night the chief object of this institution appeared to be that mrs macstinger should move all the furniture into the back garden at early dawn walk about the house in pattens all day and move the furniture back again after dark these ceremonies greatly fluttered those doves the young macstingers who were not only unable at such times to find any restingplace for the soles of their feet but generally came in for a good deal of pecking from the maternal bird during the progress of the solemnities  at the moment when florence and susan nipper presented themselves at mrs macstingers door that worthy but redoubtable female was in the act of conveying alexander macstinger aged two years and three months along the passage for forcible deposition in a sitting posture on the street pavement alexander being black in the face with holding his breath after punishment and a cool pavingstone being usually found to act as a powerful restorative in such cases  the feelings of mrs macstinger as a woman and a mother were outraged by the look of pity for alexander which she observed on florences face therefore mrs macstinger asserting those finest emotions of our nature in preference to weakly gratifying her curiosity shook and buffeted alexander both before and during the application of the pavingstone and took no further notice of the strangers  i beg your pardon maam said florence when the child had found his breath again and was using it is this captain cuttles house  no said mrs macstinger  not number nine asked florence hesitating  who said it wasnt number nine said mrs macstinger  susan nipper instantly struck in and begged to inquire what mrs macstinger meant by that and if she knew whom she was talking to  mrs macstinger in retort looked at her all over what do you want with captain cuttle i should wish to know said mrs macstinger  should you then im sorry that you wont be satisfied returned miss nipper  hush susan if you please said florence perhaps you can have the goodness to tell us where captain cuttle lives maam as he dont live here  who says he dont live here retorted the implacable macstinger i said it wasnt capen cuttles houseand it aint his houseand forbid it that it ever should be his housefor capen cuttle dont know how to keep a houseand dont deserve to have a houseits my houseand when i let the upper floor to capen cuttle oh i do a thankless thing and cast pearls before swine  mrs macstinger pitched her voice for the upper windows in offering these remarks and cracked off each clause sharply by itself as if from a rifle possessing an infinity of barrels after the last shot the captains voice was heard to say in feeble remonstrance from his own room steady below  since you want capen cuttle there he is said mrs macstinger with an angry motion of her hand on florence making bold to enter without any more parley and on susan following mrs macstinger recommenced her pedestrian exercise in pattens and alexander macstinger still on the pavingstone who had stopped in his crying to attend to the conversation began to wail again entertaining himself during that dismal performance which was quite mechanical with a general survey of the prospect terminating in the hackneycoach  the captain in his own apartment was sitting with his hands in his pockets and his legs drawn up under his chair on a very small desolate island lying about midway in an ocean of soap and water the captains windows had been cleaned the walls had been cleaned the stove had been cleaned and everything the stove excepted was wet and shining with soft soap and sand the smell of which drysaltery impregnated the air in the midst of the dreary scene the captain cast away upon his island looked round on the waste of waters with a rueful countenance and seemed waiting for some friendly bark to come that way and take him off  but when the captain directing his forlorn visage towards the door saw florence appear with her maid no words can describe his astonishment mrs macstingers eloquence having rendered all other sounds but imperfectly distinguishable he had looked for no rarer visitor than the potboy or the milkman wherefore when florence appeared and coming to the confines of the island put her hand in his the captain stood up aghast as if he supposed her for the moment to be some young member of the flying dutchmans family  instantly recovering his selfpossession however the captains first care was to place her on dry land which he happily accomplished with one motion of his arm issuing forth then upon the main captain cuttle took miss nipper round the waist and bore her to the island also captain cuttle then with great respect and admiration raised the hand of florence to his lips and standing off a little for the island was not large enough for three beamed on her from the soap and water like a new description of triton  you are amazed to see us i am suresaid florence with a smile  the inexpressibly gratified captain kissed his hook in reply and growled as if a choice and delicate compliment were included in the words stand by stand by  but i couldnt rest said florence without coming to ask you what you think about dear walterwho is my brother nowand whether there is anything to fear and whether you will not go and console his poor uncle every day until we have some intelligence of him  at these words captain cuttle as by an involuntary gesture clapped his hand to his head on which the hard glazed hat was not and looked discomfited  have you any fears for walters safety inquired florence from whose face the captain so enraptured he was with it could not take his eyes while she in her turn looked earnestly at him to be assured of the sincerity of his reply  no heartsdelight said captain cuttle i am not afeard walr is a lad asll go through a deal o hard weather walr is a lad asll bring as much success to that ere brig as a lad is capable on walr said the captain his eyes glistening with the praise of his young friend and his hook raised to announce a beautiful quotation is what you may call a outard and visible sign of an inard and spirited grasp and when found make a note of  florence who did not quite understand this though the captain evidently thought it full of meaning and highly satisfactory mildly looked to him for something more  i am not afeard my heartsdelight resumed the captain theres been most uncommon bad weather in them latitudes theres no denyin and they have drove and drove and been beat off may be tother side the world but the ships a good ship and the lads a good lad and it aint easy thank the lord the captain made a little bow to break up hearts of oak whether theyre in brigs or buzzums here we have em both ways which is bringing it up with a round turn and so i aint a bit afeard as yet  as yet repeated florence  not a bit returned the captain kissing his iron hand and afore i begin to be my heartsdelight walr will have wrote home from the island or from some port or another and made all taut and shipsahape and with regard to old sol gills here the captain became solemn who ill stand by and not desert until death do us part and when the stormy winds do blow do blow do blowoverhaul the catechism said the captain parenthetically and there youll find them expressionsif it would console sol gills to have the opinion of a seafaring man as has got a mind equal to any undertaking that he puts it alongside of and as was all but smashed in his prenticeship and of which the name is bunsby that ere man shall give him such an opinion in his own parlour asll stun him ah said captain cuttle vauntingly as much as if hed gone and knocked his head again a door  let us take this gentleman to see him and let us hear what he says cried florence will you go with us now we have a coach here  again the captain clapped his hand to his head on which the hard glazed hat was not and looked discomfited but at this instant a most remarkable phenomenon occurred the door opening without any note of preparation and apparently of itself the hard glazed hat in question skimmed into the room like a bird and alighted heavily at the captains feet the door then shut as violently as it had opened and nothing ensued in explanation of the prodigy  captain cuttle picked up his hat and having turned it over with a look of interest and welcome began to polish it on his sleeve while doing so the captain eyed his visitors intently and said in a low voice  you see i should have bore down on sol gills yesterday and this morning but sheshe took it away and kep it thats the long and short ofthe subject  who did for goodness sake asked susan nipper  the lady of the house my dearreturned the captain in a gruff whisper and making signals of secrecywe had some words about the swabbing of these here planks and shein short said the captain eyeing the door and relieving himself with a long breath she stopped my liberty  oh i wish she had me to deal with said susan reddening with the energy of the wish id stop her  would you do you my dear rejoined the captain shaking his head doubtfully but regarding the desperate courage of the fair aspirant with obvious admiration i dont know its difficult navigation shes very hard to carry on with my dear you never can tell how shell head you see shes full one minute and round upon you next and when she in a tartar said the captain with the perspiration breaking out upon his forehead there was nothing but a whistle emphatic enough for the conclusion of the sentence so the captain whistled tremulously after which he again shook his head and recurring to his admiration of miss nippers devoted bravery timidly repeated would you do you think my dear  susan only replied with a bridling smile but that was so very full of defiance that there is no knowing how long captain cuttle might have stood entranced in its contemplation if florence in her anxiety had not again proposed their immediately resorting to the oracular bunsby thus reminded of his duty captain cuttle put on the glazed hat firmly took up another knobby stick with which he had supplied the place of that one given to walter and offering his arm to florence prepared to cut his way through the enemy  it turned out however that mrs macstinger had already changed her course and that she headed as the captain had remarked she often did in quite a new direction for when they got downstairs they found that exemplary woman beating the mats on the doorsteps with alexander still upon the pavingstone dimly looming through a fog of dust and so absorbed was mrs macstinger in her household occupation that when captain cuttle and his visitors passed she beat the harder and neither by word nor gesture showed any consciousness of their vicinity the captain was so well pleased with this easy escapealthough the effect of the doormats on him was like a copious administration of snuff and made him sneeze until the tears ran down his facethat he could hardly believe his good fortune but more than once between the door and the hackneycoach looked over his shoulder with an obvious apprehension of mrs macstingers giving chase yet  however they got to the corner of brig place without any molestation from that terrible fireship and the captain mounting the coachboxfor his gallantry would not allow him to ride inside with the ladies though besought to do sopiloted the driver on his course for captain bunsbys vessel which was called the cautious clara and was lying hard by ratcliffe  arrived at the wharf off which this great commanders ship was jammed in among some five hundred companions whose tangled rigging looked like monstrous cobwebs half swept down captain cuttle appeared at the coachwindow and invited florence and miss nipper to accompany him on board observing that bunsby was to the last degree softhearted in respect of ladies and that nothing would so much tend to bring his expansive intellect into a state of harmony as their presentation to the cautious clara  florence readily consented and the captain taking her little hand in his prodigious palm led her with a mixed expression of patronage paternity pride and ceremony that was pleasant to see over several very dirty decks until coming to the clara they found that cautious craft which lay outside the tier with her gangway removed and halfadozen feet of river interposed between herself and her nearest neighbour it appeared from captain cuttles explanation that the great bunsby like himself was cruelly treated by his landlady and that when her usage of him for the time being was so hard that he could bear it no longer he set this gulf between them as a last resource  clara ahoy cried the captain putting a hand to each side of his mouth  ahoy cried a boy like the captains echo tumbling up from below  bunsby aboard cried the captain hailing the boy in a stentorian voice as if he were halfamile off instead of two yards  ay ay cried the boy in the same tone  the boy then shoved out a plank to captain cuttle who adjusted it carefully and led florence across returning presently for miss nipper so they stood upon the deck of the cautious clara in whose standing rigging divers fluttering articles of dress were curing in company with a few tongues and some mackerel  immediately there appeared coming slowly up above the bulkhead of the cabin another bulkhead human and very largewith one stationary eye in the mahogany face and one revolving one on the principle of some lighthouses this head was decorated with shaggy hair like oakum which had no governing inclination towards the north east west or south but inclined to all four quarters of the compass and to every point upon it the head was followed by a perfect desert of chin and by a shirtcollar and neckerchief and by a dreadnought pilotcoat and by a pair of dreadnought pilottrousers whereof the waistband was so very broad and high that it became a succedaneum for a waistcoat being ornamented near the wearers breastbone with some massive wooden buttons like backgammon men as the lower portions of these pantaloons became revealed bunsby stood confessed his hands in their pockets which were of vast size and his gaze directed not to captain cuttle or the ladies but the masthead  the profound appearance of this philosopher who was bulky and strong and on whose extremely red face an expression of taciturnity sat enthroned not inconsistent with his character in which that quality was proudly conspicuous almost daunted captain cuttle though on familiar terms with him whispering to florence that bunsby had never in his life expressed surprise and was considered not to know what it meant the captain watched him as he eyed his masthead and afterwards swept the horizon and when the revolving eye seemed to be coming round in his direction said  bunsby my lad how fares it  a deep gruff husky utterance which seemed to have no connexion with bunsby and certainly had not the least effect upon his face replied ay ay shipmet how goes it at the same time bunsbys right hand and arm emerging from a pocket shook the captains and went back again  bunsby said the captain striking home at once here you are a man of mind and a man as can give an opinion heres a young lady as wants to take that opinion in regard of my friend walr likewise my tother friend sol gills which is a character for you to come within hail of being a man of science which is the mother of invention and knows no law bunsby will you wear to oblige me and come along with us  the great commander who seemed by expression of his visage to be always on the lookout for something in the extremest distance and to have no ocular knowledge of anything within ten miles made no reply whatever  here is a man said the captain addressing himself to his fair auditors and indicating the commander with his outstretched hook that has fell down more than any man alive that has had more accidents happen to his own self than the seamens hospital to all hands that took as many spars and bars and bolts about the outside of his head when he was young as youd want a order for on chathamyard to build a pleasure yacht with and yet that his opinions in that way its my belief for there aint nothing like em afloat or ashore  the stolid commander appeared by a very slight vibration in his elbows to express some satisfaction in this encomium but if his face had been as distant as his gaze was it could hardly have enlightened the beholders less in reference to anything that was passing in his thoughts  shipmate said bunsby all of a sudden and stooping down to look out under some interposing spar whatll the ladies drink  captain cuttle whose delicacy was shocked by such an inquiry in connection with florence drew the sage aside and seeming to explain in his ear accompanied him below where that he might not take offence the captain drank a dram himself which florence and susan glancing down the open skylight saw the sage with difficulty finding room for himself between his berth and a very little brass fireplace serve out for self and friend they soon reappeared on deck and captain cuttle triumphing in the success of his enterprise conducted florence back to the coach while bunsby followed escorting miss nipper whom he hugged upon the way much to that young ladys indignation with his pilotcoated arm like a blue bear  the captain put his oracle inside and gloried so much in having secured him and having got that mind into a hackneycoach that he could not refrain from often peeping in at florence through the little window behind the driver and testifying his delight in smiles and also in taps upon his forehead to hint to her that the brain of bunsby was hard at it in the meantime bunsby still hugging miss nipper for his friend the captain had not exaggerated the softness of his heart uniformly preserved his gravity of deportment and showed no other consciousness of her or anything  uncle sol who had come home received them at the door and ushered them immediately into the little back parlour strangely altered by the absence of walter on the table and about the room were the charts and maps on which the heavyhearted instrumentmaker had again and again tracked the missing vessel across the sea and on which with a pair of compasses that he still had in his hand he had been measuring a minute before how far she must have driven to have driven here or there and trying to demonstrate that a long time must elapse before hope was exhausted  whether she can have run said uncle sol looking wistfully over the chart but no thats almost impossible or whether she can have been forced by stress of weatherbut thats not reasonably likely or whether there is any hope she so far changed her course asbut even i can hardly hope that with such broken suggestions poor old uncle sol roamed over the great sheet before him and could not find a speck of hopeful probability in it large enough to set one small point of the compasses upon  florence saw immediatelyit would have been difficult to help seeingthat there was a singular indescribable change in the old man and that while his manner was far more restless and unsettled than usual there was yet a curious contradictory decision in it that perplexed her very much she fancied once that he spoke wildly and at random for on her saying she regretted not to have seen him when she had been there before that morning he at first replied that he had been to see her and directly afterwards seemed to wish to recall that answer  you have been to see me said florence today  yes my dear young lady returned uncle sol looking at her and away from her in a confused manner i wished to see you with my own eyes and to hear you with my own ears once more before there he stopped  before when before what said florence putting her hand upon his arm  did i say before replied old sol if i did i must have meant before we should have news of my dear boy  you are not well said florence tenderly you have been so very anxious i am sure you are not well  i am as well returned the old man shutting up his right hand and holding it out to show her as well and firm as any man at my time of life can hope to be see its steady is its master not as capable of resolution and fortitude as many a younger man i think so we shall see  there was that in his manner more than in his words though they remained with her too which impressed florence so much that she would have confided her uneasiness to captain cuttle at that moment if the captain had not seized that moment for expounding the state of circumstance on which the opinion of the sagacious bunsby was requested and entreating that profound authority to deliver the same  bunsby whose eye continued to be addressed to somewhere about the halfway house between london and gravesend two or three times put out his rough right arm as seeking to wind it for inspiration round the fair form of miss nipper but that young female having withdrawn herself in displeasure to the opposite side of the table the soft heart of the commander of the cautious clara met with no response to its impulses after sundry failures in this wise the commander addressing himself to nobody thus spake or rather the voice within him said of its own accord and quite independent of himself as if he were possessed by a gruff spirit  my names jack bunsby  he was christened john cried the delighted captain cuttle hear him  and what i says pursued the voice after some deliberation i stands to  the captain with florence on his arm nodded at the auditory and seemed to say now hes coming out this is what i meant when i brought him  whereby proceeded the voice why not if so what odds can any man say otherwise no awast then  when it had pursued its train of argument to this point the voice stopped and rested it then proceeded very slowly thus  do i believe that this here son and heirs gone down my lads mayhap do i say so which if a skipper stands out by sen georges channel making for the downs whats right ahead of him the goodwins he isnt forced to run upon the goodwins but he may the bearings of this observation lays in the application on it that aint no part of my duty awast then keep a bright lookout forard and good luck to you  the voice here went out of the back parlour and into the street taking the commander of the cautious clara with it and accompanying him on board again with all convenient expedition where he immediately turned in and refreshed his mind with a nap  the students of the sages precepts left to their own application of his wisdomupon a principle which was the main leg of the bunsby tripod as it is perchance of some other oracular stoolslooked upon one another in a little uncertainty while rob the grinder who had taken the innocent freedom of peering in and listening through the skylight in the roof came softly down from the leads in a state of very dense confusion captain cuttle however whose admiration of bunsby was if possible enhanced by the splendid manner in which he had justified his reputation and come through this solemn reference proceeded to explain that bunsby meant nothing but confidence that bunsby had no misgivings and that such an opinion as that man had given coming from such a mind as his was hopes own anchor with good roads to cast it in florence endeavoured to believe that the captain was right but the nipper with her arms tight folded shook her head in resolute denial and had no more trust in bunsby than in mr perch himself  the philosopher seemed to have left uncle sol pretty much where he had found him for he still went roaming about the watery world compasses in hand and discovering no rest for them it was in pursuance of a whisper in his ear from florence while the old man was absorbed in this pursuit that captain cuttle laid his heavy hand upon his shoulder  what cheer sol gills cried the captain heartily  but soso ned returned the instrumentmaker i have been remembering all this afternoon that on the very day when my boy entered dombeys house and came home late to dinner sitting just there where you stand we talked of storm and shipwreck and i could hardly turn him from the subject  but meeting the eyes of florence which were fixed with earnest scrutiny upon his face the old man stopped and smiled  stand by old friend cried the captain look alive i tell you what sol gills arter ive convoyed heartsdelight safe home here the captain kissed his hook to florence ill come back and take you in tow for the rest of this blessed day youll come and eat your dinner along with me sol somewheres or another  not today ned said the old man quickly and appearing to be unaccountably startled by the proposition not today i couldnt do it  why not returned the captain gazing at him in astonishment  ii have so much to do ii mean to think of and arrange i couldnt do it ned indeed i must go out again and be alone and turn my mind to many things today  the captain looked at the instrumentmaker and looked at florence and again at the instrumentmaker tomorrow then he suggested at last  yes yes tomorrow said the old man think of me tomorrow say tomorrow  i shall come here early mind sol gills stipulated the captain  yes yes the first thing tomorrow morning said old sol and now goodbye ned cuttle and god bless you  squeezing both the captains hands with uncommon fervour as he said it the old man turned to florence folded hers in his own and put them to his lips then hurried her out to the coach with very singular precipitation altogether he made such an effect on captain cuttle that the captain lingered behind and instructed rob to be particularly gentle and attentive to his master until the morning which injunction he strengthened with the payment of one shilling down and the promise of another sixpence before noon next day this kind office performed captain cuttle who considered himself the natural and lawful bodyguard of florence mounted the box with a mighty sense of his trust and escorted her home at parting he assured her that he would stand by sol gills close and true and once again inquired of susan nipper unable to forget her gallant words in reference to mrs macstinger would you do you think my dear though  when the desolate house had closed upon the two the captains thoughts reverted to the old instrumentmaker and he felt uncomfortable therefore instead of going home he walked up and down the street several times and eking out his leisure until evening dined late at a certain angular little tavern in the city with a public parlour like a wedge to which glazed hats much resorted the captains principal intention was to pass sol gillss after dark and look in through the window which he did the parlour door stood open and he could see his old friend writing busily and steadily at the table within while the little midshipman already sheltered from the night dews watched him from the counter under which rob the grinder made his own bed preparatory to shutting the shop reassured by the tranquillity that reigned within the precincts of the wooden mariner the captain headed for brig place resolving to weigh anchor betimes in the morning    chapter 24 the study of a loving heart   sir barnet and lady skettles very good people resided in a pretty villa at fulham on the banks of the thames which was one of the most desirable residences in the world when a rowingmatch happened to be going past but had its little inconveniences at other times among which may be enumerated the occasional appearance of the river in the drawingroom and the contemporaneous disappearance of the lawn and shrubbery  sir barnet skettles expressed his personal consequence chiefly through an antique gold snuffbox and a ponderous silk pocketkerchief which he had an imposing manner of drawing out of his pocket like a banner and using with both hands at once sir barnets object in life was constantly to extend the range of his acquaintance like a heavy body dropped into waternot to disparage so worthy a gentleman by the comparisonit was in the nature of things that sir barnet must spread an ever widening circle about him until there was no room left or like a sound in air the vibration of which according to the speculation of an ingenious modern philosopher may go on travelling for ever through the interminable fields of space nothing but coming to the end of his moral tether could stop sir barnet skettles in his voyage of discovery through the social system  sir barnet was proud of making people acquainted with people he liked the thing for its own sake and it advanced his favourite object too for example if sir barnet had the good fortune to get hold of a law recruit or a country gentleman and ensnared him to his hospitable villa sir barnet would say to him on the morning after his arrival now my dear sir is there anybody you would like to know who is there you would wish to meet do you take any interest in writing people or in painting or sculpturing people or in acting people or in anything of that sort possibly the patient answered yes and mentioned somebody of whom sir barnet had no more personal knowledge than of ptolemy the great sir barnet replied that nothing on earth was easier as he knew him very well immediately called on the aforesaid somebody left his card wrote a short notemy dear sirpenalty of your eminent positionfriend at my house naturally desirouslady skettles and myself participatetrust that genius being superior to ceremonies you will do us the distinguished favour of giving us the pleasure etc etcand so killed a brace of birds with one stone dead as doornails  with the snuffbox and banner in full force sir barnet skettles propounded his usual inquiry to florence on the first morning of her visit when florence thanked him and said there was no one in particular whom she desired to see it was natural she should think with a pang of poor lost walter when sir barnet skettles urging his kind offer said my dear miss dombey are you sure you can remember no one whom your good papato whom i beg you present the best compliments of myself and lady skettles when you writemight wish you to know it was natural perhaps that her poor head should droop a little and that her voice should tremble as it softly answered in the negative  skettles junior much stiffened as to his cravat and sobered down as to his spirits was at home for the holidays and appeared to feel himself aggrieved by the solicitude of his excellent mother that he should be attentive to florence another and a deeper injury under which the soul of young barnet chafed was the company of dr and mrs blimber who had been invited on a visit to the paternal rooftree and of whom the young gentleman often said he would have preferred their passing the vacation at jericho  is there anybody you can suggest now doctor blimber said sir barnet skettles turning to that gentleman  you are very kind sir barnet returned doctor blimber really i am not aware that there is in particular i like to know my fellowmen in general sir barnet what does terence say anyone who is the parent of a son is interesting to me  has mrs blimber any wish to see any remarkable person asked sir barnet courteously  mrs blimber replied with a sweet smile and a shake of her skyblue cap that if sir barnet could have made her known to cicero she would have troubled him but such an introduction not being feasible and she already enjoying the friendship of himself and his amiable lady and possessing with the doctor her husband their joint confidence in regard to their dear sonhere young barnet was observed to curl his noseshe asked no more  sir barnet was fain under these circumstances to content himself for the time with the company assembled florence was glad of that for she had a study to pursue among them and it lay too near her heart and was too precious and momentous to yield to any other interest  there were some children staying in the house children who were as frank and happy with fathers and with mothers as those rosy faces opposite home children who had no restraint upon their love and freely showed it florence sought to learn their secret sought to find out what it was she had missed what simple art they knew and she knew not how she could be taught by them to show her father that she loved him and to win his love again  many a day did florence thoughtfully observe these children on many a bright morning did she leave her bed when the glorious sun rose and walking up and down upon the rivers bank before anyone in the house was stirring look up at the windows of their rooms and think of them asleep so gently tended and affectionately thought of florence would feel more lonely then than in the great house all alone and would think sometimes that she was better there than here and that there was greater peace in hiding herself than in mingling with others of her age and finding how unlike them all she was but attentive to her study though it touched her to the quick at every little leaf she turned in the hard book florence remained among them and tried with patient hope to gain the knowledge that she wearied for  ah how to gain it how to know the charm in its beginning there were daughters here who rose up in the morning and lay down to rest at night possessed of fathers hearts already they had no repulse to overcome no coldness to dread no frown to smooth away as the morning advanced and the windows opened one by one and the dew began to dry upon the flowers and and youthful feet began to move upon the lawn florence glancing round at the bright faces thought what was there she could learn from these children it was too late to learn from them each could approach her father fearlessly and put up her lips to meet the ready kiss and wind her arm about the neck that bent down to caress her she could not begin by being so bold oh could it be that there was less and less hope as she studied more and more  she remembered well that even the old woman who had robbed her when a little childwhose image and whose house and all she had said and done were stamped upon her recollection with the enduring sharpness of a fearful impression made at that early period of lifehad spoken fondly of her daughter and how terribly even she had cried out in the pain of hopeless separation from her child but her own mother she would think again when she recalled this had loved her well then sometimes when her thoughts reverted swiftly to the void between herself and her father florence would tremble and the tears would start upon her face as she pictured to herself her mother living on and coming also to dislike her because of her wanting the unknown grace that should conciliate that father naturally and had never done so from her cradle she knew that this imagination did wrong to her mothers memory and had no truth in it or base to rest upon and yet she tried so hard to justify him and to find the whole blame in herself that she could not resist its passing like a wild cloud through the distance of her mind  there came among the other visitors soon after florence one beautiful girl three or four years younger than she who was an orphan child and who was accompanied by her aunt a greyhaired lady who spoke much to florence and who greatly liked but that they all did to hear her sing of an evening and would always sit near her at that time with motherly interest they had only been two days in the house when florence being in an arbour in the garden one warm morning musingly observant of a youthful group upon the turf through some intervening boughsand wreathing flowers for the head of one little creature among them who was the pet and plaything of the rest heard this same lady and her niece in pacing up and down a sheltered nook close by speak of herself  is florence an orphan like me aunt said the child  no my love she has no mother but her father is living  is she in mourning for her poor mama now inquired the child quickly  no for her only brother  has she no other brother  none  no sister  none  i am very very sorry said the little girl  as they stopped soon afterwards to watch some boats and had been silent in the meantime florence who had risen when she heard her name and had gathered up her flowers to go and meet them that they might know of her being within hearing resumed her seat and work expecting to hear no more but the conversation recommenced next moment  florence is a favourite with everyone here and deserves to be i am sure said the child earnestly where is her papa  the aunt replied after a moments pause that she did not know her tone of voice arrested florence who had started from her seat again and held her fastened to the spot with her work hastily caught up to her bosom and her two hands saving it from being scattered on the ground  he is in england i hope aunt said the child  i believe so yes i know he is indeed  has he ever been here  i believe not no  is he coming here to see her  i believe not  is he lame or blind or ill aunt asked the child  the flowers that florence held to her breast began to fall when she heard those words so wonderingly spoke she held them closer and her face hung down upon them  kate said the lady after another moment of silence i will tell you the whole truth about florence as i have heard it and believe it to be tell no one else my dear because it may be little known here and your doing so would give her pain  i never will exclaimed the child  i know you never will returned the lady i can trust you as myself i fear then kate that florences father cares little for her very seldom sees her never was kind to her in her life and now quite shuns her and avoids her she would love him dearly if he would suffer her but he will notthough for no fault of hers and she is greatly to be loved and pitied by all gentle hearts  more of the flowers that florence held fell scattering on the ground those that remained were wet but not with dew and her face dropped upon her laden hands  poor florence dear good florence cried the child  do you know why i have told you this kate said the lady  that i may be very kind to her and take great care to try to please her is that the reason aunt  partly said the lady but not all though we see her so cheerful with a pleasant smile for everyone ready to oblige us all and bearing her part in every amusement here she can hardly be quite happy do you think she can kate  i am afraid not said the little girl  and you can understand pursued the lady why her observation of children who have parents who are fond of them and proud of themlike many here just nowshould make her sorrowful in secret  yes dear aunt said the child i understand that very well poor florence  more flowers strayed upon the ground and those she yet held to her breast trembled as if a wintry wind were rustling them  my kate said the lady whose voice was serious but very calm and sweet and had so impressed florence from the first moment of her hearing it of all the youthful people here you are her natural and harmless friend you have not the innocent means that happier children have  there are none happier aunt exclaimed the child who seemed to cling about her  as other children have dear kate of reminding her of her misfortune therefore i would have you when you try to be her little friend try all the more for that and feel that the bereavement you sustainedthank heaven before you knew its weightgives you claim and hold upon poor florence  but i am not without a parents love aunt and i never have been said the child with you  however that may be my dear returned the lady your misfortune is a lighter one than florences for not an orphan in the wide world can be so deserted as the child who is an outcast from a living parents love  the flowers were scattered on the ground like dust the empty hands were spread upon the face and orphaned florence shrinking down upon the ground wept long and bitterly  but true of heart and resolute in her good purpose florence held to it as her dying mother held by her upon the day that gave paul life he did not know how much she loved him however long the time in coming and however slow the interval she must try to bring that knowledge to her fathers heart one day or other meantime she must be careful in no thoughtless word or look or burst of feeling awakened by any chance circumstance to complain against him or to give occasion for these whispers to his prejudice  even in the response she made the orphan child to whom she was attracted strongly and whom she had such occasion to remember florence was mindful of him if she singled her out too plainly florence thought from among the rest she would confirmin one mind certainly perhaps in morethe belief that he was cruel and unnatural her own delight was no setoff to this what she had overheard was a reason not for soothing herself but for saving him and florence did it in pursuance of the study of her heart  she did so always if a book were read aloud and there were anything in the story that pointed at an unkind father she was in pain for their application of it to him not for herself so with any trifle of an interlude that was acted or picture that was shown or game that was played among them the occasions for such tenderness towards him were so many that her mind misgave her often it would indeed be better to go back to the old house and live again within the shadow of its dull walls undisturbed how few who saw sweet florence in her spring of womanhood the modest little queen of those small revels imagined what a load of sacred care lay heavy in her breast how few of those who stiffened in her fathers freezing atmosphere suspected what a heap of fiery coals was piled upon his head  florence pursued her study patiently and failing to acquire the secret of the nameless grace she sought among the youthful company who were assembled in the house often walked out alone in the early morning among the children of the poor but still she found them all too far advanced to learn from they had won their household places long ago and did not stand without as she did with a bar across the door  there was one man whom she several times observed at work very early and often with a girl of about her own age seated near him he was a very poor man who seemed to have no regular employment but now went roaming about the banks of the river when the tide was low looking out for bits and scraps in the mud and now worked at the unpromising little patch of gardenground before his cottage and now tinkered up a miserable old boat that belonged to him or did some job of that kind for a neighbour as chance occurred whatever the mans labour the girl was never employed but sat when she was with him in a listless moping state and idle  florence had often wished to speak to this man yet she had never taken courage to do so as he made no movement towards her but one morning when she happened to come upon him suddenly from a bypath among some pollard willows which terminated in the little shelving piece of stony ground that lay between his dwelling and the water where he was bending over a fire he had made to caulk the old boat which was lying bottom upwards close by he raised his head at the sound of her footstep and gave her good morning  good morning said florence approaching nearer you are at work early  id be glad to be often at work earlier miss if i had work to do  is it so hard to get asked florence  i find it so replied the man  florence glanced to where the girl was sitting drawn together with her elbows on her knees and her chin on her hands and said  is that your daughter  he raised his head quickly and looking towards the girl with a brightened face nodded to her and said yes florence looked towards her too and gave her a kind salutation the girl muttered something in return ungraciously and sullenly  is she in want of employment also said florence  the man shook his head no miss he said i work for both  are there only you two then inquired florence  only us two said the man her mother his been dead these ten year martha lifted up his head again and whistled to her wont you say a word to the pretty young lady  the girl made an impatient gesture with her cowering shoulders and turned her head another way ugly misshapen peevish illconditioned ragged dirtybut beloved oh yes florence had seen her fathers look towards her and she knew whose look it had no likeness to  im afraid shes worse this morning my poor girl said the man suspending his work and contemplating his illfavoured child with a compassion that was the more tender for being rougher  she is ill then said florence  the man drew a deep sigh i dont believe my marthas had five short days good health he answered looking at her still in as many long years  ay and more than that john said a neighbour who had come down to help him with the boat  more than that you say do you cried the other pushing back his battered hat and drawing his hand across his forehead very like it seems a long long time  and the more the time pursued the neighbour the more youve favoured and humoured her john till shes got to be a burden to herself and everybody else  not to me said her father falling to his work not to me  florence could feelwho betterhow truly he spoke she drew a little closer to him and would have been glad to touch his rugged hand and thank him for his goodness to the miserable object that he looked upon with eyes so different from any other mans  who would favour my poor girlto call it favouringif i didnt said the father  ay ay cried the neighbour in reason john but you you rob yourself to give to her you bind yourself hand and foot on her account you make your life miserable along of her and what does she care you dont believe she knows it  the father lifted up his head again and whistled to her martha made the same impatient gesture with her crouching shoulders in reply and he was glad and happy  only for that miss said the neighbour with a smile in which there was more of secret sympathy than he expressed only to get that he never lets her out of his sight  because the dayll come and has been coming a long while observed the other bending low over his work when to get half as much from that unfortnate child of mineto get the trembling of a finger or the waving of a hairwould be to raise the dead  florence softly put some money near his hand on the old boat and left him  and now florence began to think if she were to fall ill if she were to fade like her dear brother would he then know that she had loved him would she then grow dear to him would he come to her bedside when she was weak and dim of sight and take her into his embrace and cancel all the past would he so forgive her in that changed condition for not having been able to lay open her childish heart to him as to make it easy to relate with what emotions she had gone out of his room that night what she had meant to say if she had had the courage and how she had endeavoured afterwards to learn the way she never knew in infancy  yes she thought if she were dying he would relent she thought that if she lay serene and not unwilling to depart upon the bed that was curtained round with recollections of their darling boy he would be touched home and would say dear florence live for me and we will love each other as we might have done and be as happy as we might have been these many years she thought that if she heard such words from him and had her arms clasped round him she could answer with a smile it is too late for anything but this i never could be happier dear father and so leave him with a blessing on her lips  the golden water she remembered on the wall appeared to florence in the light of such reflections only as a current flowing on to rest and to a region where the dear ones gone before were waiting hand in hand and often when she looked upon the darker river rippling at her feet she thought with awful wonder but not terror of that river which her brother had so often said was bearing him away  the father and his sick daughter were yet fresh in florences mind and indeed that incident was not a week old when sir barnet and his lady going out walking in the lanes one afternoon proposed to her to bear them company florence readily consenting lady skettles ordered out young barnet as a matter of course for nothing delighted lady skettles so much as beholding her eldest son with florence on his arm  barnet to say the truth appeared to entertain an opposite sentiment on the subject and on such occasions frequently expressed himself audibly though indefinitely in reference to a parcel of girls as it was not easy to ruffle her sweet temper however florence generally reconciled the young gentleman to his fate after a few minutes and they strolled on amicably lady skettles and sir barnet following in a state of perfect complacency and high gratification  this was the order of procedure on the afternoon in question and florence had almost succeeded in overruling the present objections of skettles junior to his destiny when a gentleman on horseback came riding by looked at them earnestly as he passed drew in his rein wheeled round and came riding back again hat in hand  the gentleman had looked particularly at florence and when the little party stopped on his riding back he bowed to her before saluting sir barnet and his lady florence had no remembrance of having ever seen him but she started involuntarily when he came near her and drew back  my horse is perfectly quiet i assure you said the gentleman  it was not that but something in the gentleman himselfflorence could not have said whatthat made her recoil as if she had been stung  i have the honour to address miss dombey i believe said the gentleman with a most persuasive smile on florence inclining her head he added my name is carker i can hardly hope to be remembered by miss dombey except by name carker  florence sensible of a strange inclination to shiver though the day was hot presented him to her host and hostess by whom he was very graciously received  i beg pardon said mr carker a thousand times but i am going down tomorrow morning to mr dombey at leamington and if miss dombey can entrust me with any commission need i say how very happy i shall be  sir barnet immediately divining that florence would desire to write a letter to her father proposed to return and besought mr carker to come home and dine in his riding gear mr carker had the misfortune to be engaged to dinner but if miss dombey wished to write nothing would delight him more than to accompany them back and to be her faithful slave in waiting as long as she pleased as he said this with his widest smile and bent down close to her to pat his horses neck florence meeting his eyes saw rather than heard him say there is no news of the ship  confused frightened shrinking from him and not even sure that he had said those words for he seemed to have shown them to her in some extraordinary manner through his smile instead of uttering them florence faintly said that she was obliged to him but she would not write she had nothing to say  nothing to send miss dombey said the man of teeth  nothing said florence but mybut my dear loveif you please  disturbed as florence was she raised her eyes to his face with an imploring and expressive look that plainly besought him if he knewwhich he as plainly didthat any message between her and her father was an uncommon charge but that one most of all to spare her mr carker smiled and bowed low and being charged by sir barnet with the best compliments of himself and lady skettles took his leave and rode away leaving a favourable impression on that worthy couple florence was seized with such a shudder as he went that sir barnet adopting the popular superstition supposed somebody was passing over her grave mr carker turning a corner on the instant looked back and bowed and disappeared as if he rode off to the churchyard straight to do it    chapter 25 strange news of uncle sol   captain cuttle though no sluggard did not turn out so early on the morning after he had seen sol gills through the shopwindow writing in the parlour with the midshipman upon the counter and rob the grinder making up his bed below it but that the clocks struck six as he raised himself on his elbow and took a survey of his little chamber the captains eyes must have done severe duty if he usually opened them as wide on awaking as he did that morning and were but roughly rewarded for their vigilance if he generally rubbed them half as hard but the occasion was no common one for rob the grinder had certainly never stood in the doorway of captain cuttles room before and in it he stood then panting at the captain with a flushed and touzled air of bed about him that greatly heightened both his colour and expression  holloa roared the captain whats the matter  before rob could stammer a word in answer captain cuttle turned out all in a heap and covered the boys mouth with his hand  steady my lad said the captain dont ye speak a word to me as yet  the captain looking at his visitor in great consternation gently shouldered him into the next room after laying this injunction upon him and disappearing for a few moments forthwith returned in the blue suit holding up his hand in token of the injunction not yet being taken off captain cuttle walked up to the cupboard and poured himself out a dram a counterpart of which he handed to the messenger the captain then stood himself up in a corner against the wall as if to forestall the possibility of being knocked backwards by the communication that was to be made to him and having swallowed his liquor with his eyes fixed on the messenger and his face as pale as his face could be requested him to heave ahead  do you mean tell you captain asked rob who had been greatly impressed by these precautions  ay said the captain  well sir said rob i aint got much to tell but look here  rob produced a bundle of keys the captain surveyed them remained in his corner and surveyed the messenger  and look here pursued rob  the boy produced a sealed packet which captain cuttle stared at as he had stared at the keys  when i woke this morning captain said rob which was about a quarter after five i found these on my pillow the shopdoor was unbolted and unlocked and mr gills gone  gone roared the captain  flowed sir returned rob  the captains voice was so tremendous and he came out of his corner with such way on him that rob retreated before him into another corner holding out the keys and packet to prevent himself from being run down  for captain cuttle sir cried rob is on the keys and on the packet too upon my word and honour captain cuttle i dont know anything more about it i wish i may die if i do heres a sitiwation for a lad thats just got a sitiwation cried the unfortunate grinder screwing his cuff into his face his master bolted with his place and him blamed for it  these lamentations had reference to captain cuttles gaze or rather glare which was full of vague suspicions threatenings and denunciations taking the proffered packet from his hand the captain opened it and read as follows my dear ned cuttle enclosed is my will the captain turned it over with a doubtful lookand testamentwheres the testament said the captain instantly impeaching the illfated grinder what have you done with that my lad  i never see it whimpered rob dont keep on suspecting an innocent lad captain i never touched the testament  captain cuttle shook his head implying that somebody must be made answerable for it and gravely proceeded  which dont break open for a year or until you have decisive intelligence of my dear walter who is dear to you ned too i am sure the captain paused and shook his head in some emotion then as a reestablishment of his dignity in this trying position looked with exceeding sternness at the grinder if you should never hear of me or see me more ned remember an old friend as he will remember you to the lastkindly and at least until the period i have mentioned has expired keep a home in the old place for walter there are no debts the loan from dombeys house is paid off and all my keys i send with this keep this quiet and make no inquiry for me it is useless so no more dear ned from your true friend solomon gills the captain took a long breath and then read these words written below the boy rob well recommended as i told you from dombeys house if all else should come to the hammer take care ned of the little midshipman  to convey to posterity any idea of the manner in which the captain after turning this letter over and over and reading it a score of times sat down in his chair and held a courtmartial on the subject in his own mind would require the united genius of all the great men who discarding their own untoward days have determined to go down to posterity and have never got there at first the captain was too much confounded and distressed to think of anything but the letter itself and even when his thoughts began to glance upon the various attendant facts they might perhaps as well have occupied themselves with their former theme for any light they reflected on them in this state of mind captain cuttle having the grinder before the court and no one else found it a great relief to decide generally that he was an object of suspicion which the captain so clearly expressed in his visage that rob remonstrated  oh dont captain cried the grinder i wonder how you can what have i done to be looked at like that  my lad said captain cuttle dont you sing out afore youre hurt and dont you commit yourself whatever you do  i havent been and committed nothing captain answered rob  keep her free then said the captain impressively and ride easy  with a deep sense of the responsibility imposed upon him and the necessity of thoroughly fathoming this mysterious affair as became a man in his relations with the parties captain cuttle resolved to go down and examine the premises and to keep the grinder with him considering that youth as under arrest at present the captain was in some doubt whether it might not be expedient to handcuff him or tie his ankles together or attach a weight to his legs but not being clear as to the legality of such formalities the captain decided merely to hold him by the shoulder all the way and knock him down if he made any objection  however he made none and consequently got to the instrumentmakers house without being placed under any more stringent restraint as the shutters were not yet taken down the captains first care was to have the shop opened and when the daylight was freely admitted he proceeded with its aid to further investigation  the captains first care was to establish himself in a chair in the shop as president of the solemn tribunal that was sitting within him and to require rob to lie down in his bed under the counter show exactly where he discovered the keys and packet when he awoke how he found the door when he went to try it how he started off to brig placecautiously preventing the latter imitation from being carried farther than the thresholdand so on to the end of the chapter when all this had been done several times the captain shook his head and seemed to think the matter had a bad look  next the captain with some indistinct idea of finding a body instituted a strict search over the whole house groping in the cellars with a lighted candle thrusting his hook behind doors bringing his head into violent contact with beams and covering himself with cobwebs mounting up to the old mans bedroom they found that he had not been in bed on the previous night but had merely lain down on the coverlet as was evident from the impression yet remaining there  and i think captain said rob looking round the room that when mr gills was going in and out so often these last few days he was taking little things away piecemeal not to attract attention  ay said the captain mysteriously why so my lad  why returned rob looking about i dont see his shaving tackle nor his brushes captain nor no shirts nor yet his shoes  as each of these articles was mentioned captain cuttle took particular notice of the corresponding department of the grinder lest he should appear to have been in recent use or should prove to be in present possession thereof but rob had no occasion to shave was not brushed and wore the clothes he had on for a long time past beyond all possibility of a mistake  and what should you say said the captainnot committing yourselfabout his time of sheering off hey  why i think captain returned rob that he must have gone pretty soon after i began to snore  what oclock was that said the captain prepared to be very particular about the exact time  how can i tell captain answered rob i only know that im a heavy sleeper at first and a light one towards morning and if mr gills had come through the shop near daybreak though ever so much on tiptoe im pretty sure i should have heard him shut the door at all events  on mature consideration of this evidence captain cuttle began to think that the instrumentmaker must have vanished of his own accord to which logical conclusion he was assisted by the letter addressed to himself which as being undeniably in the old mans handwriting would seem with no great forcing to bear the construction that he arranged of his own will to go and so went the captain had next to consider where and why and as there was no way whatsoever that he saw to the solution of the first difficulty he confined his meditations to the second  remembering the old mans curious manner and the farewell he had taken of him unaccountably fervent at the time but quite intelligible now a terrible apprehension strengthened on the captain that overpowered by his anxieties and regrets for walter he had been driven to commit suicide unequal to the wear and tear of daily life as he had often professed himself to be and shaken as he no doubt was by the uncertainty and deferred hope he had undergone it seemed no violently strained misgiving but only too probable free from debt and with no fear for his personal liberty or the seizure of his goods what else but such a state of madness could have hurried him away alone and secretly as to his carrying some apparel with him if he had really done soand they were not even sure of thathe might have done so the captain argued to prevent inquiry to distract attention from his probable fate or to ease the very mind that was now revolving all these possibilities such reduced into plain language and condensed within a small compass was the final result and substance of captain cuttles deliberations which took a long time to arrive at this pass and were like some more public deliberations very discursive and disorderly  dejected and despondent in the extreme captain cuttle felt it just to release rob from the arrest in which he had placed him and to enlarge him subject to a kind of honourable inspection which he still resolved to exercise and having hired a man from brogley the broker to sit in the shop during their absence the captain taking rob with him issued forth upon a dismal quest after the mortal remains of solomon gills  not a stationhouse or bonehouse or workhouse in the metropolis escaped a visitation from the hard glazed hat along the wharves among the shipping on the bankside up the river down the river here there everywhere it went gleaming where men were thickest like the heros helmet in an epic battle for a whole week the captain read of all the found and missing people in all the newspapers and handbills and went forth on expeditions at all hours of the day to identify solomon gills in poor little shipboys who had fallen overboard and in tall foreigners with dark beards who had taken poisonto make sure captain cuttle said that it wamt him it is a sure thing that it never was and that the good captain had no other satisfaction  captain cuttle at last abandoned these attempts as hopeless and set himself to consider what was to be done next after several new perusals of his poor friends letter he considered that the maintenance of a home in the old place for walter was the primary duty imposed upon him therefore the captains decision was that he would keep house on the premises of solomon gills himself and would go into the instrumentbusiness and see what came of it  but as this step involved the relinquishment of his apartments at mrs macstingers and he knew that resolute woman would never hear of his deserting them the captain took the desperate determination of running away  now look ye here my lad said the captain to rob when he had matured this notable scheme tomorrow i shant be found in this here roadstead till nightnot till arter midnight prhaps but you keep watch till you hear me knock and the moment you do turnto and open the door  very good captain said rob  youll continue to be rated on these here books pursued the captain condescendingly and i dont say but what you may get promotion if you and me should pull together with a will but the moment you hear me knock tomorrow night whatever time it is turnto and show yourself smart with the door  ill be sure to do it captain replied rob  because you understand resumed the captain coming back again to enforce this charge upon his mind there may be for anything i can say a chase and i might be took while i was waiting if you didnt show yourself smart with the door  rob again assured the captain that he would be prompt and wakeful and the captain having made this prudent arrangement went home to mrs macstingers for the last time  the sense the captain had of its being the last time and of the awful purpose hidden beneath his blue waistcoat inspired him with such a mortal dread of mrs macstinger that the sound of that ladys foot downstairs at any time of the day was sufficient to throw him into a fit of trembling it fell out too that mrs macstinger was in a charming tempermild and placid as a houselamb and captain cuttles conscience suffered terrible twinges when she came up to inquire if she could cook him nothing for his dinner  a nice small kidneypudding now capen cuttle said his landlady or a sheeps heart dont mind my trouble  no thankee maam returned the captain  have a roast fowl said mrs macstinger with a bit of weal stuffing and some egg sauce come capen cuttle give yourself a little treat  no thankee maam returned the captain very humbly  im sure youre out of sorts and want to be stimulated said mrs macstinger why not have for once in a way a bottle of sherry wine  well maam rejoined the captain if youd be so good as take a glass or two i think i would try that would you do me the favour maam said the captain torn to pieces by his conscience to accept a quarters rent ahead  and why so capen cuttle retorted mrs macstingersharply as the captain thought  the captain was frightened to dead if you would maam he said with submission it would oblige me i cant keep my money very well it pays itself out i should take it kind if youd comply  well capen cuttle said the unconscious macstinger rubbing her hands you can do as you please its not for me with my family to refuse no more than it is to ask  and would you maam said the captain taking down the tin canister in which he kept his cash from the top shelf of the cupboard be so good as offer eighteenpence apiece to the little family all round if you could make it convenient maam to pass the word presently for them children to come forard in a body i should be glad to see em  these innocent macstingers were so many daggers to the captains breast when they appeared in a swarm and tore at him with the confiding trustfulness he so little deserved the eye of alexander macstinger who had been his favourite was insupportable to the captain the voice of juliana macstinger who was the picture of her mother made a coward of him  captain cuttle kept up appearances nevertheless tolerably well and for an hour or two was very hardly used and roughly handled by the young macstingers who in their childish frolics did a little damage also to the glazed hat by sitting in it two at a time as in a nest and drumming on the inside of the crown with their shoes at length the captain sorrowfully dismissed them taking leave of these cherubs with the poignant remorse and grief of a man who was going to execution  in the silence of night the captain packed up his heavier property in a chest which he locked intending to leave it there in all probability for ever but on the forlorn chance of one day finding a man sufficiently bold and desperate to come and ask for it of his lighter necessaries the captain made a bundle and disposed his plate about his person ready for flight at the hour of midnight when brig place was buried in slumber and mrs macstinger was lulled in sweet oblivion with her infants around her the guilty captain stealing down on tiptoe in the dark opened the door closed it softly after him and took to his heels  pursued by the image of mrs macstinger springing out of bed and regardless of costume following and bringing him back pursued also by a consciousness of his enormous crime captain cuttle held on at a great pace and allowed no grass to grow under his feet between brig place and the instrumentmakers door it opened when he knockedfor rob was on the watchand when it was bolted and locked behind him captain cuttle felt comparatively safe  whew cried the captain looking round him its a breather  nothing the matter is there captain cried the gaping rob  no no said captain cuttle after changing colour and listening to a passing footstep in the street but mind ye my lad if any lady except either of them two as you see tother day ever comes and asks for capen cuttle be sure to report no person of that name known nor never heard of here observe them orders will you  ill take care captain returned rob  you might sayif you liked hesitated the captain that youd read in the paper that a capen of that name was gone to australia emigrating along with a whole ships complement of people as had all swore never to come back no more  rob nodded his understanding of these instructions and captain cuttle promising to make a man of him if he obeyed orders dismissed him yawning to his bed under the counter and went aloft to the chamber of solomon gills  what the captain suffered next day whenever a bonnet passed or how often he darted out of the shop to elude imaginary macstingers and sought safety in the attic cannot be told but to avoid the fatigues attendant on this means of selfpreservation the captain curtained the glass door of communication between the shop and parlour on the inside fitted a key to it from the bunch that had been sent to him and cut a small hole of espial in the wall the advantage of this fortification is obvious on a bonnet appearing the captain instantly slipped into his garrison locked himself up and took a secret observation of the enemy finding it a false alarm the captain instantly slipped out again and the bonnets in the street were so very numerous and alarms were so inseparable from their appearance that the captain was almost incessantly slipping in and out all day long  captain cuttle found time however in the midst of this fatiguing service to inspect the stock in connexion with which he had the general idea very laborious to rob that too much friction could not be bestowed upon it and that it could not be made too bright he also ticketed a few attractivelooking articles at a venture at prices ranging from ten shillings to fifty pounds and exposed them in the window to the great astonishment of the public  after effecting these improvements captain cuttle surrounded by the instruments began to feel scientific and looked up at the stars at night through the skylight when he was smoking his pipe in the little back parlour before going to bed as if he had established a kind of property in them as a tradesman in the city too he began to have an interest in the lord mayor and the sheriffs and in public companies and felt bound to read the quotations of the funds every day though he was unable to make out on any principle of navigation what the figures meant and could have very well dispensed with the fractions florence the captain waited on with his strange news of uncle sol immediately after taking possession of the midshipman but she was away from home so the captain sat himself down in his altered station of life with no company but rob the grinder and losing count of time as men do when great changes come upon them thought musingly of walter and of solomon gills and even of mrs macstinger herself as among the things that had been    chapter 26 shadows of the past and future   your most obedient sir said the major damme sir a friend of my friend dombeys is a friend of mine and im glad to see you  i am infinitely obliged carker explained mr dombey to major bagstock for his company and conversation major bagstock has rendered me great service carker  mr carker the manager hat in hand just arrived at leamington and just introduced to the major showed the major his whole double range of teeth and trusted he might take the liberty of thanking him with all his heart for having effected so great an improvement in mr dombeys looks and spirits  by gad sir said the major in reply there are no thanks due to me for its a give and take affair a great creature like our friend dombey sir said the major lowering his voice but not lowering it so much as to render it inaudible to that gentleman cannot help improving and exalting his friends he strengthens and invigorates a man sir does dombey in his moral nature  mr carker snapped at the expression in his moral nature exactly the very words he had been on the point of suggesting  but when my friend dombey sir added the major talks to you of major bagstock i must crave leave to set him and you right he means plain joe sirjoey bjosh bagstockjosephrough and tough old j sir at your service  mr carkers excessively friendly inclinations towards the major and mr carkers admiration of his roughness toughness and plainness gleamed out of every tooth in mr carkers head  and now sir said the major you and dombey have the devils own amount of business to talk over  by no means major observed mr dombey  dombey said the major defiantly i know better a man of your markthe colossus of commerceis not to be interrupted your moments are precious we shall meet at dinnertime in the interval old joseph will be scarce the dinnerhour is a sharp seven mr carker  with that the major greatly swollen as to his face withdrew but immediately putting in his head at the door again said  i beg your pardon dombey have you any message to em  mr dombey in some embarrassment and not without a glance at the courteous keeper of his business confidence entrusted the major with his compliments  by the lord sir said the major you must make it something warmer than that or old joe will be far from welcome  regards then if you will major returned mr dombey  damme sir said the major shaking his shoulders and his great cheeks jocularly make it something warmer than that  what you please then major observed mr dombey  our friend is sly sir sly sir devilish sly said the major staring round the door at carker so is bagstock but stopping in the midst of a chuckle and drawing himself up to his full height the major solemnly exclaimed as he struck himself on the chest dombey i envy your feelings god bless you and withdrew  you must have found the gentleman a great resource said carker following him with his teeth  very great indeed said mr dombey  he has friends here no doubt pursued carker i perceive from what he has said that you go into society here do you know smiling horribly i am so very glad that you go into society  mr dombey acknowledged this display of interest on the part of his second in command by twirling his watchchain and slightly moving his head  you were formed for society said carker of all the men i know you are the best adapted by nature and by position for society do you know i have been frequently amazed that you should have held it at arms length so long  i have had my reasons carker i have been alone and indifferent to it but you have great social qualifications yourself and are the more likely to have been surprised  oh i returned the other with ready selfdisparagement its quite another matter in the case of a man like me i dont come into comparison with you  mr dombey put his hand to his neckcloth settled his chin in it coughed and stood looking at his faithful friend and servant for a few moments in silence  i shall have the pleasure carker said mr dombey at length making as if he swallowed something a little too large for his throat to present you to myto the majors friends highly agreeable people  ladies among them i presume insinuated the smooth manager  they are allthat is to say they are bothladies replied mr dombey  only two smiled carker  they are only two i have confined my visits to their residence and have made no other acquaintance here  sisters perhaps quoth carker  mother and daughter replied mr dombey  as mr dombey dropped his eyes and adjusted his neckcloth again the smiling face of mr carker the manager became in a moment and without any stage of transition transformed into a most intent and frowning face scanning his closely and with an ugly sneer as mr dombey raised his eyes it changed back no less quickly to its old expression and showed him every gum of which it stood possessed  you are very kind said carker i shall be delighted to know them speaking of daughters i have seen miss dombey  there was a sudden rush of blood to mr dombeys face  i took the liberty of waiting on her said carker to inquire if she could charge me with any little commission i am not so fortunate as to be the bearer of any but herbut her dear love  wolfs face that it was then with even the hot tongue revealing itself through the stretched mouth as the eyes encountered mr dombeys  what business intelligence is there inquired the latter gentleman after a silence during which mr carker had produced some memoranda and other papers  there is very little returned carker upon the whole we have not had our usual good fortune of late but that is of little moment to you at lloyds they give up the son and heir for lost well she was insured from her keel to her masthead  carker said mr dombey taking a chair near him i cannot say that young man gay ever impressed me favourably  nor me interposed the manager  but i wish said mr dombey without heeding the interruption he had never gone on board that ship i wish he had never been sent out  it is a pity you didnt say so in good time is it not retorted carker coolly however i think its all for the best i really think its all for the best did i mention that there was something like a little confidence between miss dombey and myself  no said mr dombey sternly  i have no doubt returned mr carker after an impressive pause that wherever gay is he is much better where he is than at home here if i were or could be in your place i should be satisfied of that i am quite satisfied of it myself miss dombey is confiding and youngperhaps hardly proud enough for your daughterif she have a fault not that that is much though i am sure will you check these balances with me  mr dombey leaned back in his chair instead of bending over the papers that were laid before him and looked the manager steadily in the face the manager with his eyelids slightly raised affected to be glancing at his figures and to await the leisure of his principal he showed that he affected this as if from great delicacy and with a design to spare mr dombeys feelings and the latter as he looked at him was cognizant of his intended consideration and felt that but for it this confidential carker would have said a great deal more which he mr dombey was too proud to ask for it was his way in business often little by little mr dombeys gaze relaxed and his attention became diverted to the papers before him but while busy with the occupation they afforded him he frequently stopped and looked at mr carker again whenever he did so mr carker was demonstrative as before in his delicacy and impressed it on his great chief more and more  while they were thus engaged and under the skilful culture of the manager angry thoughts in reference to poor florence brooded and bred in mr dombeys breast usurping the place of the cold dislike that generally reigned there major bagstock much admired by the old ladies of leamington and followed by the native carrying the usual amount of light baggage straddled along the shady side of the way to make a morning call on mrs skewton it being midday when the major reached the bower of cleopatra he had the good fortune to find his princess on her usual sofa languishing over a cup of coffee with the room so darkened and shaded for her more luxurious repose that withers who was in attendance on her loomed like a phantom page  what insupportable creature is this coming in said mrs skewton i cannot hear it go away whoever you are  you have not the heart to banish j b maam said the major halting midway to remonstrate with his cane over his shoulder  oh its you is it on second thoughts you may enter observed cleopatra  the major entered accordingly and advancing to the sofa pressed her charming hand to his lips  sit down said cleopatra listlessly waving her fan a long way off dont come too near me for i am frightfully faint and sensitive this morning and you smell of the sun you are absolutely tropical  by george maam said the major the time has been when joseph bagstock has been grilled and blistered by the sun then time was when he was forced maam into such full blow by high hothouse heat in the west indies that he was known as the flower a man never heard of bagstock maam in those days he heard of the flowerthe flower of ours the flower may have faded more or less maam observed the major dropping into a much nearer chair than had been indicated by his cruel divinity but it is a tough plant yet and constant as the evergreen  here the major under cover of the dark room shut up one eye rolled his head like a harlequin and in his great selfsatisfaction perhaps went nearer to the confines of apoplexy than he had ever gone before  where is mrs granger inquired cleopatra of her page  withers believed she was in her own room  very well said mrs skewton go away and shut the door i am engaged  as withers disappeared mrs skewton turned her head languidly towards the major without otherwise moving and asked him how his friend was  dombey maam returned the major with a facetious gurgling in his throat is as well as a man in his condition can be his condition is a desperate one maam he is touched is dombey touched cried the major he is bayonetted through the body  cleopatra cast a sharp look at the major that contrasted forcibly with the affected drawl in which she presently said  major bagstock although i know but little of the worldnor can i really regret my experience for i fear it is a false place full of withering conventionalities where nature is but little regarded and where the music of the heart and the gushing of the soul and all that sort of thing which is so truly poetical is seldom heardi cannot misunderstand your meaning there is an allusion to edithto my extremely dear child said mrs skewton tracing the outline of her eyebrows with her forefinger in your words to which the tenderest of chords vibrates excessively  bluntness maam returned the major has ever been the characteristic of the bagstock breed you are right joe admits it  and that allusion pursued cleopatra would involve one of the mostif not positively the mosttouching and thrilling and sacred emotions of which our sadlyfallen nature is susceptible i conceive  the major laid his hand upon his lips and wafted a kiss to cleopatra as if to identify the emotion in question  i feel that i am weak i feel that i am wanting in that energy which should sustain a mama not to say a parent on such a subject said mrs skewton trimming her lips with the laced edge of her pockethandkerchief but i can hardly approach a topic so excessively momentous to my dearest edith without a feeling of faintness nevertheless bad man as you have boldly remarked upon it and as it has occasioned me great anguish mrs skewton touched her left side with her fan i will not shrink from my duty  the major under cover of the dimness swelled and swelled and rolled his purple face about and winked his lobster eye until he fell into a fit of wheezing which obliged him to rise and take a turn or two about the room before his fair friend could proceed  mr dombey said mrs skewton when she at length resumed was obliging enough now many weeks ago to do us the honour of visiting us here in company my dear major with yourself i acknowledgelet me be openthat it is my failing to be the creature of impulse and to wear my heart as it were outside i know my failing full well my enemy cannot know it better but i am not penitent i would rather not be frozen by the heartless world and am content to bear this imputation justly  mrs skewton arranged her tucker pinched her wiry throat to give it a soft surface and went on with great complacency  it gave me my dearest edith too i am sure infinite pleasure to receive mr dombey as a friend of yours my dear major we were naturally disposed to be prepossessed in his favour and i fancied that i observed an amount of heart in mr dombey that was excessively refreshing  there is devilish little heart in dombey now maam said the major  wretched man cried mrs skewton looking at him languidly pray be silent  j b is dumb maam said the major  mr dombey pursued cleopatra smoothing the rosy hue upon her cheeks accordingly repeated his visit and possibly finding some attraction in the simplicity and primitiveness of our tastesfor there is always a charm in natureit is so very sweetbecame one of our little circle every evening little did i think of the awful responsibility into which i plunged when i encouraged mr dombeyto  to beat up these quarters maam suggested major bagstock  coarse person said mrs skewton you anticipate my meaning though in odious language  here mrs skewton rested her elbow on the little table at her side and suffering her wrist to droop in what she considered a graceful and becoming manner dangled her fan to and fro and lazily admired her hand while speaking  the agony i have endured she said mincingly as the truth has by degrees dawned upon me has been too exceedingly terrific to dilate upon my whole existence is bound up in my sweetest edith and to see her change from day to daymy beautiful pet who has positively garnered up her heart since the death of that most delightful creature grangeris the most affecting thing in the world  mrs skewtons world was not a very trying one if one might judge of it by the influence of its most affecting circumstance upon her but this by the way  edith simpered mrs skewton who is the perfect pearl of my life is said to resemble me i believe we are alike  there is one man in the world who never will admit that anyone resembles you maam said the major and that mans name is old joe bagstock  cleopatra made as if she would brain the flatterer with her fan but relenting smiled upon him and proceeded  if my charming girl inherits any advantages from me wicked one the major was the wicked one she inherits also my foolish nature she has great force of charactermine has been said to be immense though i dont believe itbut once moved she is susceptible and sensitive to the last extent what are my feelings when i see her pining they destroy me  the major advancing his double chin and pursing up his blue lips into a soothing expression affected the profoundest sympathy  the confidence said mrs skewton that has subsisted between usthe free development of soul and openness of sentimentis touching to think of we have been more like sisters than mama and child  j bs own sentiment observed the major expressed by j b fifty thousand times  do not interrupt rude man said cleopatra what are my feelings then when i find that there is one subject avoided by us that there is a whatshisnamea gulfopened between us that my own artless edith is changed to me they are of the most poignant description of course  the major left his chair and took one nearer to the little table  from day to day i see this my dear major proceeded mrs skewton from day to day i feel this from hour to hour i reproach myself for that excess of faith and trustfulness which has led to such distressing consequences and almost from minute to minute i hope that mr dombey may explain himself and relieve the torture i undergo which is extremely wearing but nothing happens my dear major i am the slave of remorsetake care of the coffeecup you are so very awkwardmy darling edith is an altered being and i really dont see what is to be done or what good creature i can advise with  major bagstock encouraged perhaps by the softened and confidential tone into which mrs skewton after several times lapsing into it for a moment seemed now to have subsided for good stretched out his hand across the little table and said with a leer  advise with joe maam  then you aggravating monster said cleopatra giving one hand to the major and tapping his knuckles with her fan which she held in the other why dont you talk to me you know what i mean why dont you tell me something to the purpose  the major laughed and kissed the hand she had bestowed upon him and laughed again immensely  is there as much heart in mr dombey as i gave him credit for languished cleopatra tenderly do you think he is in earnest my dear major would you recommend his being spoken to or his being left alone now tell me like a dear man what would you advise  shall we marry him to edith granger maam chuckled the major hoarsely  mysterious creature returned cleopatra bringing her fan to bear upon the majors nose how can we marry him  shall we marry him to edith granger maam i say chuckled the major again  mrs skewton returned no answer in words but smiled upon the major with so much archness and vivacity that that gallant officer considering himself challenged would have imprinted a kiss on her exceedingly red lips but for her interposing the fan with a very winning and juvenile dexterity it might have been in modesty it might have been in apprehension of some danger to their bloom  dombey maam said the major is a great catch  oh mercenary wretch cried cleopatra with a little shriek i am shocked  and dombey maam pursued the major thrusting forward his head and distending his eyes is in earnest joseph says it bagstock knows it j b keeps him to the mark leave dombey to himself maam dombey is safe maam do as you have done do no more and trust to j b for the end  you really think so my dear major returned cleopatra who had eyed him very cautiously and very searchingly in spite of her listless bearing  sure of it maam rejoined the major cleopatra the peerless and her antony bagstock will often speak of this triumphantly when sharing the elegance and wealth of edith dombeys establishment dombeys righthand man maam said the major stopping abruptly in a chuckle and becoming serious has arrived  this morning said cleopatra  this morning maam returned the major and dombeys anxiety for his arrival maam is to be referredtake j bs word for this for joe is devilish slythe major tapped his nose and screwed up one of his eyes tight which did not enhance his native beautyto his desire that what is in the wind should become known to him without dombeys telling and consulting him for dombey is as proud maam said the major as lucifer  a charming quality lisped mrs skewton reminding one of dearest edith  well maam said the major i have thrown out hints already and the righthand man understands em and ill throw out more before the day is done dombey projected this morning a ride to warwick castle and to kenilworth tomorrow to be preceded by a breakfast with us i undertook the delivery of this invitation will you honour us so far maam said the major swelling with shortness of breath and slyness as he produced a note addressed to the honourable mrs skewton by favour of major bagstock wherein hers ever faithfully paul dombey besought her and her amiable and accomplished daughter to consent to the proposed excursion and in a postscript unto which the same ever faithfully paul dombey entreated to be recalled to the remembrance of mrs granger  hush said cleopatra suddenly edith  the loving mother can scarcely be described as resuming her insipid and affected air when she made this exclamation for she had never cast it off nor was it likely that she ever would or could in any other place than in the grave but hurriedly dismissing whatever shadow of earnestness or faint confession of a purpose laudable or wicked that her face or voice or manner had for the moment betrayed she lounged upon the couch her most insipid and most languid self again as edith entered the room  edith so beautiful and stately but so cold and so repelling who slightly acknowledging the presence of major bagstock and directing a keen glance at her mother drew back the from a window and sat down there looking out  my dearest edith said mrs skewton where on earth have you been i have wanted you my love most sadly  you said you were engaged and i stayed away she answered without turning her head  it was cruel to old joe maam said the major in his gallantry  it was very cruel i know she said still looking outand said with such calm disdain that the major was discomfited and could think of nothing in reply  major bagstock my darling edith drawled her mother who is generally the most useless and disagreeable creature in the world as you know  it is surely not worthwhile mama said edith looking round to observe these forms of speech we are quite alone we know each other  the quiet scorn that sat upon her handsome facea scorn that evidently lighted on herself no less than themwas so intense and deep that her mothers simper for the instant though of a hardy constitution drooped before it  my darling girl she began again  not woman yet said edith with a smile  how very odd you are today my dear pray let me say my love that major bagstock has brought the kindest of notes from mr dombey proposing that we should breakfast with him tomorrow and ride to warwick and kenilworth will you go edith  will i go she repeated turning very red and breathing quickly as she looked round at her mother  i knew you would my own observed the latter carelessly it is as you say quite a form to ask here is mr dombeys letter edith  thank you i have no desire to read it was her answer  then perhaps i had better answer it myself said mrs skewton though i had thought of asking you to be my secretary darling as edith made no movement and no answer mrs skewton begged the major to wheel her little table nearer and to set open the desk it contained and to take out pen and paper for her all which congenial offices of gallantry the major discharged with much submission and devotion  your regards edith my dear said mrs skewton pausing pen in hand at the postscript  what you will mama she answered without turning her head and with supreme indifference  mrs skewton wrote what she would without seeking for any more explicit directions and handed her letter to the major who receiving it as a precious charge made a show of laying it near his heart but was fain to put it in the pocket of his pantaloons on account of the insecurity of his waistcoat the major then took a very polished and chivalrous farewell of both ladies which the elder one acknowledged in her usual manner while the younger sitting with her face addressed to the window bent her head so slightly that it would have been a greater compliment to the major to have made no sign at all and to have left him to infer that he had not been heard or thought of  as to alteration in her sir mused the major on his way back on which expeditionthe afternoon being sunny and hothe ordered the native and the light baggage to the front and walked in the shadow of that expatriated prince as to alteration sir and pining and so forth that wont go down with joseph bagstock none of that sir it wont do here but as to there being something of a division between emor a gulf as the mother calls itdamme sir that seems true enough and its odd enough well sir panted the major edith granger and dombey are well matched let em fight it out bagstock backs the winner  the major by saying these latter words aloud in the vigour of his thoughts caused the unhappy native to stop and turn round in the belief that he was personally addressed exasperated to the last degree by this act of insubordination the major though he was swelling with enjoyment of his own humour at the moment of its occurrence instantly thrust his cane among the natives ribs and continued to stir him up at short intervals all the way to the hotel  nor was the major less exasperated as he dressed for dinner during which operation the dark servant underwent the pelting of a shower of miscellaneous objects varying in size from a boot to a hairbrush and including everything that came within his masters reach for the major plumed himself on having the native in a perfect state of drill and visited the least departure from strict discipline with this kind of fatigue duty add to this that he maintained the native about his person as a counterirritant against the gout and all other vexations mental as well as bodily and the native would appear to have earned his paywhich was not large  at length the major having disposed of all the missiles that were convenient to his hand and having called the native so many new names as must have given him great occasion to marvel at the resources of the english language submitted to have his cravat put on and being dressed and finding himself in a brisk flow of spirits after this exercise went downstairs to enliven dombey and his righthand man  dombey was not yet in the room but the righthand man was there and his dental treasures were as usual ready for the major  well sir said the major how have you passed the time since i had the happiness of meeting you have you walked at all  a saunter of barely half an hours duration returned carker we have been so much occupied  business eh said the major  a variety of little matters necessary to be gone through replied carker but do you knowthis is quite unusual with me educated in a distrustful school and who am not generally disposed to be communicative he said breaking off and speaking in a charming tone of franknessbut i feel quite confidential with you major bagstock  you do me honour sir returned the major you may be  do you know then pursued carker that i have not found my friendour friend i ought rather to call him  meaning dombey sir cried the major you see me mr carker standing here j b  he was puffy enough to see and blue enough and mr carker intimated the he had that pleasure  then you see a man sir who would go through fire and water to serve dombey returned major bagstock  mr carker smiled and said he was sure of it do you know major he proceeded to resume where i left off that i have not found our friend so attentive to business today as usual  no observed the delighted major  i have found him a little abstracted and with his attention disposed to wander said carker  by jove sir cried the major theres a lady in the case  indeed i begin to believe there really is returned carker i thought you might be jesting when you seemed to hint at it for i know you military men  the major gave the horses cough and shook his head and shoulders as much as to say well we are gay dogs theres no denying he then seized mr carker by the buttonhole and with starting eyes whispered in his ear that she was a woman of extraordinary charms sir that she was a young widow sir that she was of a fine family sir that dombey was over head and ears in love with her sir and that it would be a good match on both sides for she had beauty blood and talent and dombey had fortune and what more could any couple have hearing mr dombeys footsteps without the major cut himself short by saying that mr carker would see her tomorrow morning and would judge for himself and between his mental excitement and the exertion of saying all this in wheezy whispers the major sat gurgling in the throat and watering at the eyes until dinner was ready  the major like some other noble animals exhibited himself to great advantage at feedingtime on this occasion he shone resplendent at one end of the table supported by the milder lustre of mr dombey at the other while carker on one side lent his ray to either light or suffered it to merge into both as occasion arose  during the first course or two the major was usually grave for the native in obedience to general orders secretly issued collected every sauce and cruet round him and gave him a great deal to do in taking out the stoppers and mixing up the contents in his plate besides which the native had private zests and flavours on a sidetable with which the major daily scorched himself to say nothing of strange machines out of which he spirited unknown liquids into the majors drink but on this occasion major bagstock even amidst these many occupations found time to be social and his sociality consisted in excessive slyness for the behoof of mr carker and the betrayal of mr dombeys state of mind  dombey said the major you dont eat whats the matter  thank you returned the gentleman i am doing very well i have no great appetite today  why dombey whats become of it asked the major wheres it gone you havent left it with our friends ill swear for i can answer for their having none today at luncheon i can answer for one of em at least i wont say which  then the major winked at carker and became so frightfully sly that his dark attendant was obliged to pat him on the back without orders or he would probably have disappeared under the table  in a later stage of the dinner that is to say when the native stood at the majors elbow ready to serve the first bottle of champagne the major became still slyer  fill this to the brim you scoundrel said the major holding up his glass fill mr carkers to the brim too and mr dombeys too by gad gentlemen said the major winking at his new friend while mr dombey looked into his plate with a conscious air well consecrate this glass of wine to a divinity whom joe is proud to know and at a distance humbly and reverently to admire edith said the major is her name angelic edith  to angelic edith cried the smiling carker  edith by all means said mr dombey  the entrance of the waiters with new dishes caused the major to be slyer yet but in a more serious vein for though among ourselves joe bagstock mingles jest and earnest on this subject sir said the major laying his finger on his lips and speaking half apart to carker he holds that name too sacred to be made the property of these fellows or of any fellows not a word sir while they are here  this was respectful and becoming on the majors part and mr dombey plainly felt it so although embarrassed in his own frigid way by the majors allusions mr dombey had no objection to such rallying it was clear but rather courted it perhaps the major had been pretty near the truth when he had divined that morning that the great man who was too haughty formally to consult with or confide in his prime minister on such a matter yet wished him to be fully possessed of it let this be how it may he often glanced at mr carker while the major plied his light artillery and seemed watchful of its effect upon him  but the major having secured an attentive listener and a smiler who had not his match in all the worldin short a devilish intelligent and able fellow as he often afterwards declaredwas not going to let him off with a little slyness personal to mr dombey therefore on the removal of the cloth the major developed himself as a choice spirit in the broader and more comprehensive range of narrating regimental stories and cracking regimental jokes which he did with such prodigal exuberance that carker was or feigned to be quite exhausted with laughter and admiration while mr dombey looked on over his starched cravat like the majors proprietor or like a stately showman who was glad to see his bear dancing well  when the major was too hoarse with meat and drink and the display of his social powers to render himself intelligible any longer they adjourned to coffee after which the major inquired of mr carker the manager with little apparent hope of an answer in the affirmative if he played picquet  yes i play picquet a little said mr carker  backgammon perhaps observed the major hesitating  yes i play backgammon a little too replied the man of teeth  carker plays at all games i believe said mr dombey laying himself on a sofa like a man of wood without a hinge or a joint in him and plays them well  in sooth he played the two in question to such perfection that the major was astonished and asked him at random if he played chess  yes i play chess a little answered carker i have sometimes played and won a gameits a mere trickwithout seeing the board  by gad sir said the major staring you are a contrast to dombey who plays nothing  oh he returned the manager he has never had occasion to acquire such little arts to men like me they are sometimes useful as at present major bagstock when they enable me to take a hand with you  it might be only the false mouth so smooth and wide and yet there seemed to lurk beneath the humility and subserviency of this short speech a something like a snarl and for a moment one might have thought that the white teeth were prone to bite the hand they fawned upon but the major thought nothing about it and mr dombey lay meditating with his eyes half shut during the whole of the play which lasted until bedtime  by that time mr carker though the winner had mounted high into the majors good opinion insomuch that when he left the major at his own room before going to bed the major as a special attention sent the nativewho always rested on a mattress spread upon the ground at his masters dooralong the gallery to light him to his room in state  there was a faint blur on the surface of the mirror in mr carkers chamber and its reflection was perhaps a false one but it showed that night the image of a man who saw in his fancy a crowd of people slumbering on the ground at his feet like the poor native at his masters door who picked his way among them looking down maliciously enough but trod upon no upturned faceas yet    chapter 27 deeper shadows   mr carker the manager rose with the lark and went out walking in the summer day his meditationsand he meditated with contracted brows while he strolled alonghardly seemed to soar as high as the lark or to mount in that direction rather they kept close to their nest upon the earth and looked about among the dust and worms but there was not a bird in the air singing unseen farther beyond the reach of human eye than mr carkers thoughts he had his face so perfectly under control that few could say more in distinct terms of its expression than that it smiled or that it pondered it pondered now intently as the lark rose higher he sank deeper in thought as the lark poured out her melody clearer and stronger he fell into a graver and profounder silence at length when the lark came headlong down with an accumulating stream of song and dropped among the green wheat near him rippling in the breath of the morning like a river he sprang up from his reverie and looked round with a sudden smile as courteous and as soft as if he had had numerous observers to propitiate nor did he relapse after being thus awakened but clearing his face like one who bethought himself that it might otherwise wrinkle and tell tales went smiling on as if for practice  perhaps with an eye to first impressions mr carker was very carefully and trimly dressed that morning though always somewhat formal in his dress in imitation of the great man whom he served he stopped short of the extent of mr dombeys stiffness at once perhaps because he knew it to be ludicrous and because in doing so he found another means of expressing his sense of the difference and distance between them some people quoted him indeed in this respect as a pointed commentary and not a flattering one on his icy patronbut the world is prone to misconstruction and mr carker was not accountable for its bad propensity  clean and florid with his light complexion fading as it were in the sun and his dainty step enhancing the softness of the turf mr carker the manager strolled about meadows and green lanes and glided among avenues of trees until it was time to return to breakfast taking a nearer way back mr carker pursued it airing his teeth and said aloud as he did so now to see the second mrs dombey  he had strolled beyond the town and reentered it by a pleasant walk where there was a deep shade of leafy trees and where there were a few benches here and there for those who chose to rest it not being a place of general resort at any hour and wearing at that time of the still morning the air of being quite deserted and retired mr carker had it or thought he had it all to himself so with the whim of an idle man to whom there yet remained twenty minutes for reaching a destination easily able in ten mr carker threaded the great boles of the trees and went passing in and out before this one and behind that weaving a chain of footsteps on the dewy ground  but he found he was mistaken in supposing there was no one in the grove for as he softly rounded the trunk of one large tree on which the obdurate bark was knotted and overlapped like the hide of a rhinoceros or some kindred monster of the ancient days before the flood he saw an unexpected figure sitting on a bench near at hand about which in another moment he would have wound the chain he was making  it was that of a lady elegantly dressed and very handsome whose dark proud eyes were fixed upon the ground and in whom some passion or struggle was raging for as she sat looking down she held a corner of her under lip within her mouth her bosom heaved her nostril quivered her head trembled indignant tears were on her cheek and her foot was set upon the moss as though she would have crushed it into nothing and yet almost the selfsame glance that showed him this showed him the selfsame lady rising with a scornful air of weariness and lassitude and turning away with nothing expressed in face or figure but careless beauty and imperious disdain  a withered and very ugly old woman dressed not so much like a gipsy as like any of that medley race of vagabonds who tramp about the country begging and stealing and tinkering and weaving rushes by turns or all together had been observing the lady too for as she rose this second figure strangely confronting the first scrambled up from the groundout of it it almost appearedand stood in the way  let me tell your fortune my pretty lady said the old woman munching with her jaws as if the deaths head beneath her yellow skin were impatient to get out  i can tell it for myself was the reply  ay ay pretty lady but not right you didnt tell it right when you were sitting there i see you give me a piece of silver pretty lady and ill tell your fortune true theres riches pretty lady in your face  i know returned the lady passing her with a dark smile and a proud step i knew it before  what you wont give me nothing cried the old woman you wont give me nothing to tell your fortune pretty lady how much will you give me to tell it then give me something or ill call it after you croaked the old woman passionately  mr carker whom the lady was about to pass close slinking against his tree as she crossed to gain the path advanced so as to meet her and pulling off his hat as she went by bade the old woman hold her peace the lady acknowledged his interference with an inclination of the head and went her way  you give me something then or ill call it after her screamed the old woman throwing up her arms and pressing forward against his outstretched hand or come she added dropping her voice suddenly looking at him earnestly and seeming in a moment to forget the object of her wrath give me something or ill call it after you  after me old lady returned the manager putting his hand in his pocket  yes said the woman steadfast in her scrutiny and holding out her shrivelled hand i know  what do you know demanded carker throwing her a shilling do you know who the handsome lady is  munching like that sailors wife of yore who had chestnuts in her lap and scowling like the witch who asked for some in vain the old woman picked the shilling up and going backwards like a crab or like a heap of crabs for her alternately expanding and contracting hands might have represented two of that species and her creeping face some halfadozen more crouched on the veinous root of an old tree pulled out a short black pipe from within the crown of her bonnet lighted it with a match and smoked in silence looking fixedly at her questioner  mr carker laughed and turned upon his heel  good said the old woman one child dead and one child living one wife dead and one wife coming go and meet her  in spite of himself the manager looked round again and stopped the old woman who had not removed her pipe and was munching and mumbling while she smoked as if in conversation with an invisible familiar pointed with her finger in the direction he was going and laughed  what was that you said bedlamite he demanded  the woman mumbled and chattered and smoked and still pointed before him but remained silent muttering a farewell that was not complimentary mr carker pursued his way but as he turned out of that place and looked over his shoulder at the root of the old tree he could yet see the finger pointing before him and thought he heard the woman screaming go and meet her  preparations for a choice repast were completed he found at the hotel and mr dombey and the major and the breakfast were awaiting the ladies individual constitution has much to do with the development of such facts no doubt but in this case appetite carried it hollow over the tender passion mr dombey being very cool and collected and the major fretting and fuming in a state of violent heat and irritation at length the door was thrown open by the native and after a pause occupied by her languishing along the gallery a very blooming but not very youthful lady appeared  my dear mr dombey said the lady i am afraid we are late but edith has been out already looking for a favourable point of view for a sketch and kept me waiting for her falsest of majors giving him her little finger how do you do  mrs skewton said mr dombey let me gratify my friend carker mr dombey unconsciously emphasised the word friend as saying no really i do allow him to take credit for that distinction by presenting him to you you have heard me mention mr carker  i am charmed i am sure said mrs skewton graciously  mr carker was charmed of course would he have been more charmed on mr dombeys behalf if mrs skewton had been as he at first supposed her the edith whom they had toasted overnight  why where for heavens sake is edith exclaimed mrs skewton looking round still at the door giving withers orders about the mounting of those drawings my dear mr dombey will you have the kindness  mr dombey was already gone to seek her next moment he returned bearing on his arm the same elegantly dressed and very handsome lady whom mr carker had encountered underneath the trees  carker began mr dombey but their recognition of each other was so manifest that mr dombey stopped surprised  i am obliged to the gentleman said edith with a stately bend for sparing me some annoyance from an importunate beggar just now  i am obliged to my good fortune said mr carker bowing low for the opportunity of rendering so slight a service to one whose servant i am proud to be  as her eye rested on him for an instant and then lighted on the ground he saw in its bright and searching glance a suspicion that he had not come up at the moment of his interference but had secretly observed her sooner as he saw that she saw in his eye that her distrust was not without foundation  really cried mrs skewton who had taken this opportunity of inspecting mr carker through her glass and satisfying herself as she lisped audibly to the major that he was all heart really now this is one of the most enchanting coincidences that i ever heard of the idea my dearest edith there is such an obvious destiny in it that really one might almost be induced to cross ones arms upon ones frock and say like those wicked turks there is no whatshisname but thingummy and whatyoumaycallit is his prophet  edith designed no revision of this extraordinary quotation from the koran but mr dombey felt it necessary to offer a few polite remarks  it gives me great pleasure said mr dombey with cumbrous gallantry that a gentleman so nearly connected with myself as carker is should have had the honour and happiness of rendering the least assistance to mrs granger mr dombey bowed to her but it gives me some pain and it occasions me to be really envious of carker he unconsciously laid stress on these words as sensible that they must appear to involve a very surprising proposition envious of carker that i had not that honour and that happiness myself mr dombey bowed again edith saving for a curl of her lip was motionless  by the lord sir cried the major bursting into speech at sight of the waiter who was come to announce breakfast its an extraordinary thing to me that no one can have the honour and happiness of shooting all such beggars through the head without being brought to book for it but heres an arm for mrs granger if shell do j b the honour to accept it and the greatest service joe can render you maam just now is to lead you into table  with this the major gave his arm to edith mr dombey led the way with mrs skewton mrs carker went last smiling on the party  i am quite rejoiced mr carker said the ladymother at breakfast after another approving survey of him through her glass that you have timed your visit so happily as to go with us today it is the most enchanting expedition  any expedition would be enchanting in such society returned carker but i believe it is in itself full of interest  oh cried mrs skewton with a faded little scream of rapture the castle is charmingassociations of the middle agesand all thatwhich is so truly exquisite dont you dote upon the middle ages mr carker  very much indeed said mr carker  such charming times cried cleopatra so full of faith so vigorous and forcible so picturesque so perfectly removed from commonplace oh dear if they would only leave us a little more of the poetry of existence in these terrible days  mrs skewton was looking sharp after mr dombey all the time she said this who was looking at edith who was listening but who never lifted up her eyes  we are dreadfully real mr carker said mrs skewton are we not  few people had less reason to complain of their reality than cleopatra who had as much that was false about her as could well go to the composition of anybody with a real individual existence but mr carker commiserated our reality nevertheless and agreed that we were very hardly used in that regard  pictures at the castle quite divine said cleopatra i hope you dote upon pictures  i assure you mrs skewton said mr dombey with solemn encouragement of his manager that carker has a very good taste for pictures quite a natural power of appreciating them he is a very creditable artist himself he will be delighted i am sure with mrs grangers taste and skill  damme sir cried major bagstock my opinion is that youre the admirable carker and can do anything  oh smiled carker with humility you are much too sanguine major bagstock i can do very little but mr dombey is so generous in his estimation of any trivial accomplishment a man like myself may find it almost necessary to acquire and to which in his very different sphere he is far superior that mr carker shrugged his shoulders deprecating further praise and said no more  all this time edith never raised her eyes unless to glance towards her mother when that ladys fervent spirit shone forth in words but as carker ceased she looked at mr dombey for a moment for a moment only but with a transient gleam of scornful wonder on her face not lost on one observer who was smiling round the board  mr dombey caught the dark eyelash in its descent and took the opportunity of arresting it  you have been to warwick often unfortunately said mr dombey  several times  the visit will be tedious to you i am afraid  oh no not at all  ah you are like your cousin feenix my dearest edith said mrs skewton he has been to warwick castle fifty times if he has been there once yet if he came to leamington tomorrowi wish he would dear angelhe would make his fiftysecond visit next day  we are all enthusiastic are we not mama said edith with a cold smile  too much so for our peace perhaps my dear returned her mother but we wont complain our own emotions are our recompense if as your cousin feenix says the sword wears out the whatsitsname  the scabbard perhaps said edith  exactlya little too fast it is because it is bright and glowing you know my dearest love  mrs skewton heaved a gentle sigh supposed to cast a shadow on the surface of that dagger of lath whereof her susceptible bosom was the sheath and leaning her head on one side in the cleopatra manner looked with pensive affection on her darling child  edith had turned her face towards mr dombey when he first addressed her and had remained in that attitude while speaking to her mother and while her mother spoke to her as though offering him her attention if he had anything more to say there was something in the manner of this simple courtesy almost defiant and giving it the character of being rendered on compulsion or as a matter of traffic to which she was a reluctant party again not lost upon that same observer who was smiling round the board it set him thinking of her as he had first seen her when she had believed herself to be alone among the trees  mr dombey having nothing else to say proposedthe breakfast being now finished and the major gorged like any boa constrictorthat they should start a barouche being in waiting according to the orders of that gentleman the two ladies the major and himself took their seats in it the native and the wan page mounted the box mr towlinson being left behind and mr carker on horseback brought up the rear mr carker cantered behind the carriage at the distance of a hundred yards or so and watched it during all the ride as if he were a cat indeed and its four occupants mice whether he looked to one side of the road or to the otherover distant landscape with its smooth undulations windmills corn grass bean fields wildflowers farmyards hayricks and the spire among the woodor upwards in the sunny air where butterflies were sporting round his head and birds were pouring out their songsor downward where the shadows of the branches interlaced and made a trembling carpet on the roador onward where the overhanging trees formed aisles and arches dim with the softened light that steeped through leavesone corner of his eye was ever on the formal head of mr dombey addressed towards him and the feather in the bonnet drooping so neglectfully and scornfully between them much as he had seen the haughty eyelids droop not least so when the face met that now fronting it once and once only did his wary glance release these objects and that was when a leap over a low hedge and a gallop across a field enabled him to anticipate the carriage coming by the road and to be standing ready at the journeys end to hand the ladies out then and but then he met her glance for an instant in her first surprise but when he touched her in alighting with his soft white hand it overlooked him altogether as before  mrs skewton was bent on taking charge of mr carker herself and showing him the beauties of the castle she was determined to have his arm and the majors too it would do that incorrigible creature who was the most barbarous infidel in point of poetry good to be in such company this chance arrangement left mr dombey at liberty to escort edith which he did stalking before them through the apartments with a gentlemanly solemnity  those darling byegone times mr carker said cleopatra with their delicious fortresses and their dear old dungeons and their delightful places of torture and their romantic vengeances and their picturesque assaults and sieges and everything that makes life truly charming how dreadfully we have degenerated  yes we have fallen off deplorably said mr carker  the peculiarity of their conversation was that mrs skewton in spite of her ecstasies and mr carker in spite of his urbanity were both intent on watching mr dombey and edith with all their conversational endowments they spoke somewhat distractedly and at random in consequence  we have no faith left positively said mrs skewton advancing her shrivelled ear for mr dombey was saying something to edith we have no faith in the dear old barons who were the most delightful creaturesor in the dear old priests who were the most warlike of menor even in the days of that inestimable queen bess upon the wall there which were so extremely golden dear creature she was all heart and that charming father of hers i hope you dote on harry the eighth  i admire him very much said carker  so bluff cried mrs skewton wasnt he so burly so truly english such a picture too he makes with his dear little peepy eyes and his benevolent chin  ah maam said carker stopping short but if you speak of pictures theres a composition what gallery in the world can produce the counterpart of that  as the smiling gentleman thus spake he pointed through a doorway to where mr dombey and edith were standing alone in the centre of another room  they were not interchanging a word or a look standing together arm in arm they had the appearance of being more divided than if seas had rolled between them there was a difference even in the pride of the two that removed them farther from each other than if one had been the proudest and the other the humblest specimen of humanity in all creation he selfimportant unbending formal austere she lovely and graceful in an uncommon degree but totally regardless of herself and him and everything around and spurning her own attractions with her haughty brow and lip as if they were a badge or livery she hated so unmatched were they and opposed so forced and linked together by a chain which adverse hazard and mischance had forged that fancy might have imagined the pictures on the walls around them startled by the unnatural conjunction and observant of it in their several expressions grim knights and warriors looked scowling on them a churchman with his hand upraised denounced the mockery of such a couple coming to gods altar quiet waters in landscapes with the sun reflected in their depths asked if better means of escape were not at hand was there no drowning left ruins cried look here and see what we are wedded to uncongenial time animals opposed by nature worried one another as a moral to them loves and cupids took to flight afraid and martyrdom had no such torment in its painted history of suffering  nevertheless mrs skewton was so charmed by the sight to which mr carker invoked her attention that she could not refrain from saying half aloud how sweet how very full of soul it was edith overhearing looked round and flushed indignant scarlet to her hair  my dearest edith knows i was admiring her said cleopatra tapping her almost timidly on the back with her parasol sweet pet  again mr carker saw the strife he had witnessed so unexpectedly among the trees again he saw the haughty languor and indifference come over it and hide it like a cloud  she did not raise her eyes to him but with a slight peremptory motion of them seemed to bid her mother come near mrs skewton thought it expedient to understand the hint and advancing quickly with her two cavaliers kept near her daughter from that time  mr carker now having nothing to distract his attention began to discourse upon the pictures and to select the best and point them out to mr dombey speaking with his usual familiar recognition of mr dombeys greatness and rendering homage by adjusting his eyeglass for him or finding out the right place in his catalogue or holding his stick or the like these services did not so much originate with mr carker in truth as with mr dombey himself who was apt to assert his chieftainship by saying with subdued authority and in an easy wayfor himhere carker have the goodness to assist me will you which the smiling gentleman always did with pleasure  they made the tour of the pictures the walls crows nest and so forth and as they were still one little party and the major was rather in the shade being sleepy during the process of digestion mr carker became communicative and agreeable at first he addressed himself for the most part to mrs skewton but as that sensitive lady was in such ecstasies with the works of art after the first quarter of an hour that she could do nothing but yawn they were such perfect inspirations she observed as a reason for that mark of rapture he transferred his attentions to mr dombey mr dombey said little beyond an occasional very true carker or indeed carker but he tacitly encouraged carker to proceed and inwardly approved of his behaviour very much deeming it as well that somebody should talk and thinking that his remarks which were as one might say a branch of the parent establishment might amuse mrs granger mr carker who possessed an excellent discretion never took the liberty of addressing that lady direct but she seemed to listen though she never looked at him and once or twice when he was emphatic in his peculiar humility the twilight smile stole over her face not as a light but as a deep black shadow  warwick castle being at length pretty well exhausted and the major very much so to say nothing of mrs skewton whose peculiar demonstrations of delight had become very frequent indeed the carriage was again put in requisition and they rode to several admired points of view in the neighbourhood mr dombey ceremoniously observed of one of these that a sketch however slight from the fair hand of mrs granger would be a remembrance to him of that agreeable day though he wanted no artificial remembrance he was sure here mr dombey made another of his bows which he must always highly value withers the lean having ediths sketchbook under his arm was immediately called upon by mrs skewton to produce the same and the carriage stopped that edith might make the drawing which mr dombey was to put away among his treasures  but i am afraid i trouble you too much said mr dombey  by no means where would you wish it taken from she answered turning to him with the same enforced attention as before  mr dombey with another bow which cracked the starch in his cravat would beg to leave that to the artist  i would rather you chose for yourself said edith  suppose then said mr dombey we say from here it appears a good spot for the purpose orcarker what do you think  there happened to be in the foreground at some little distance a grove of trees not unlike that in which mr carker had made his chain of footsteps in the morning and with a seat under one tree greatly resembling in the general character of its situation the point where his chain had broken  might i venture to suggest to mrs granger said carker that that is an interestingalmost a curiouspoint of view  she followed the direction of his ridingwhip with her eyes and raised them quickly to his face it was the second glance they had exchanged since their introduction and would have been exactly like the first but that its expression was plainer  will you like that said edith to mr dombey  i shall be charmed said mr dombey to edith  therefore the carriage was driven to the spot where mr dombey was to be charmed and edith without moving from her seat and opening her sketchbook with her usual proud indifference began to sketch  my pencils are all pointless she said stopping and turning them over  pray allow me said mr dombey or carker will do it better as he understands these things carker have the goodness to see to these pencils for mrs granger  mr carker rode up close to the carriagedoor on mrs grangers side and letting the rein fall on his horses neck took the pencils from her hand with a smile and a bow and sat in the saddle leisurely mending them having done so he begged to be allowed to hold them and to hand them to her as they were required and thus mr carker with many commendations of mrs grangers extraordinary skillespecially in treesremainedclose at her side looking over the drawing as she made it mr dombey in the meantime stood bolt upright in the carriage like a highly respectable ghost looking on too while cleopatra and the major dallied as two ancient doves might do  are you satisfied with that or shall i finish it a little more said edith showing the sketch to mr dombey  mr dombey begged that it might not be touched it was perfection  it is most extraordinary said carker bringing every one of his red gums to bear upon his praise i was not prepared for anything so beautiful and so unusual altogether  this might have applied to the sketcher no less than to the sketch but mr carkers manner was openness itselfnot as to his mouth alone but as to his whole spirit so it continued to be while the drawing was laid aside for mr dombey and while the sketching materials were put up then he handed in the pencils which were received with a distant acknowledgment of his help but without a look and tightening his rein fell back and followed the carriage again  thinking perhaps as he rode that even this trivial sketch had been made and delivered to its owner as if it had been bargained for and bought thinking perhaps that although she had assented with such perfect readiness to his request her haughty face bent over the drawing or glancing at the distant objects represented in it had been the face of a proud woman engaged in a sordid and miserable transaction thinking perhaps of such things but smiling certainly and while he seemed to look about him freely in enjoyment of the air and exercise keeping always that sharp corner of his eye upon the carriage  a stroll among the haunted ruins of kenilworth and more rides to more points of view most of which mrs skewton reminded mr dombey edith had already sketched as he had seen in looking over her drawings brought the days expedition to a close mrs skewton and edith were driven to their own lodgings mr carker was graciously invited by cleopatra to return thither with mr dombey and the major in the evening to hear some of ediths music and the three gentlemen repaired to their hotel to dinner  the dinner was the counterpart of yesterdays except that the major was twentyfour hours more triumphant and less mysterious edith was toasted again mr dombey was again agreeably embarrassed and mr carker was full of interest and praise  there were no other visitors at mrs skewtons ediths drawings were strewn about the room a little more abundantly than usual perhaps and withers the wan page handed round a little stronger tea the harp was there the piano was there and edith sang and played but even the music was played by edith to mr dombeys order as it were in the same uncompromising way as thus  edith my dearest love said mrs skewton half an hour after tea mr dombey is dying to hear you i know  mr dombey has life enough left to say so for himself mama i have no doubt  i shall be immensely obliged said mr dombey  what do you wish  piano hesitated mr dombey  whatever you please you have only to choose  accordingly she began with the piano it was the same with the harp the same with her singing the same with the selection of the pieces that she sang and played such frigid and constrained yet prompt and pointed acquiescence with the wishes he imposed upon her and on no one else was sufficiently remarkable to penetrate through all the mysteries of picquet and impress itself on mr carkers keen attention nor did he lose sight of the fact that mr dombey was evidently proud of his power and liked to show it  nevertheless mr carker played so wellsome games with the major and some with cleopatra whose vigilance of eye in respect of mr dombey and edith no lynx could have surpassedthat he even heightened his position in the ladymothers good graces and when on taking leave he regretted that he would be obliged to return to london next morning cleopatra trusted community of feeling not being met with every day that it was far from being the last time they would meet  i hope so said mr carker with an expressive look at the couple in the distance as he drew towards the door following the major i think so  mr dombey who had taken a stately leave of edith bent or made some approach to a bend over cleopatras couch and said in a low voice  i have requested mrs grangers permission to call on her tomorrow morningfor a purposeand she has appointed twelve oclock may i hope to have the pleasure of finding you at home madam afterwards  cleopatra was so much fluttered and moved by hearing this of course incomprehensible speech that she could only shut her eyes and shake her head and give mr dombey her hand which mr dombey not exactly knowing what to do with dropped  dombey come along cried the major looking in at the door damme sir old joe has a great mind to propose an alteration in the name of the royal hotel and that it should be called the three jolly bachelors in honour of ourselves and carker with this the major slapped mr dombey on the back and winking over his shoulder at the ladies with a frightful tendency of blood to the head carried him off  mrs skewton reposed on her sofa and edith sat apart by her harp in silence the mother trifling with her fan looked stealthily at the daughter more than once but the daughter brooding gloomily with downcast eyes was not to be disturbed  thus they remained for a long hour without a word until mrs skewtons maid appeared according to custom to prepare her gradually for night at night she should have been a skeleton with dart and hourglass rather than a woman this attendant for her touch was as the touch of death the painted object shrivelled underneath her hand the form collapsed the hair dropped off the arched dark eyebrows changed to scanty tufts of grey the pale lips shrunk the skin became cadaverous and loose an old worn yellow nodding woman with red eyes alone remained in cleopatras place huddled up like a slovenly bundle in a greasy flannel gown  the very voice was changed as it addressed edith when they were alone again  why dont you tell me it said sharply that he is coming here tomorrow by appointment  because you know it returned edith mother  the mocking emphasis she laid on that one word  you know he has bought me she resumed or that he will tomorrow he has considered of his bargain he has shown it to his friend he is even rather proud of it he thinks that it will suit him and may be had sufficiently cheap and he will buy tomorrow god that i have lived for this and that i feel it  compress into one handsome face the conscious selfabasement and the burning indignation of a hundred women strong in passion and in pride and there it hid itself with two white shuddering arms  what do you mean returned the angry mother havent you from a child  a child said edith looking at her when was i a child what childhood did you ever leave to me i was a womanartful designing mercenary laying snares for menbefore i knew myself or you or even understood the base and wretched aim of every new display i learnt you gave birth to a woman look upon her she is in her pride tonight  and as she spoke she struck her hand upon her beautiful bosom as though she would have beaten down herself  look at me she said who have never known what it is to have an honest heart and love look at me taught to scheme and plot when children play and married in my youthan old age of designto one for whom i had no feeling but indifference look at me whom he left a widow dying before his inheritance descended to hima judgment on you well deservedand tell me what has been my life for ten years since  we have been making every effort to endeavour to secure to you a good establishment rejoined her mother that has been your life and now you have got it  there is no slave in a market there is no horse in a fair so shown and offered and examined and paraded mother as i have been for ten shameful years cried edith with a burning brow and the same bitter emphasis on the one word is it not so have i been made the byeword of all kinds of men have fools have profligates have boys have dotards dangled after me and one by one rejected me and fallen off because you were too plain with all your cunning yes and too true with all those false pretences until we have almost come to be notorious the licence of look and touch she said with flashing eyes have i submitted to it in half the places of resort upon the map of england have i been hawked and vended here and there until the last grain of selfrespect is dead within me and i loathe myself has been my late childhood i had none before do not tell me that i had tonight of all nights in my life  you might have been well married said her mother twenty times at least edith if you had given encouragement enough  no who takes me refuse that i am and as i well deserve to be she answered raising her head and trembling in her energy of shame and stormy pride shall take me as this man does with no art of mine put forth to lure him he sees me at the auction and he thinks it well to buy me let him when he came to view meperhaps to bidhe required to see the roll of my accomplishments i gave it to him when he would have me show one of them to justify his purchase to his men i require of him to say which he demands and i exhibit it i will do no more he makes the purchase of his own will and with his own sense of its worth and the power of his money and i hope it may never disappoint him i have not vaunted and pressed the bargain neither have you so far as i have been able to prevent you  you talk strangely tonight edith to your own mother  it seems so to me stranger to me than you said edith but my education was completed long ago i am too old now and have fallen too low by degrees to take a new course and to stop yours and to help myself the germ of all that purifies a womans breast and makes it true and good has never stirred in mine and i have nothing else to sustain me when i despise myself there had been a touching sadness in her voice but it was gone when she went on to say with a curled lip so as we are genteel and poor i am content that we should be made rich by these means all i say is i have kept the only purpose i have had the strength to formi had almost said the power with you at my side motherand have not tempted this man on  this man you speak said her mother as if you hated him  and you thought i loved him did you not she answered stopping on her way across the room and looking round shall i tell you she continued with her eyes fixed on her mother who already knows us thoroughly and reads us right and before whom i have even less of selfrespect or confidence than before my own inward self being so much degraded by his knowledge of me  this is an attack i suppose returned her mother coldly on poor unfortunate whatshisnamemr carker your want of selfrespect and confidence my dear in reference to that person who is very agreeable it strikes me is not likely to have much effect on your establishment why do you look at me so hard are you ill  edith suddenly let fall her face as if it had been stung and while she pressed her hands upon it a terrible tremble crept over her whole frame it was quickly gone and with her usual step she passed out of the room  the maid who should have been a skeleton then reappeared and giving one arm to her mistress who appeared to have taken off her manner with her charms and to have put on paralysis with her flannel gown collected the ashes of cleopatra and carried them away in the other ready for tomorrows revivification    chapter 28 alterations   so the day has come at length susan said florence to the excellent nipper when we are going back to our quiet home  susan drew in her breath with an amount of expression not easily described further relieving her feelings with a smart cough answered very quiet indeed miss floy no doubt excessive so  when i was a

the young gentleman and two evenings since then  when i was a child and when company used to come to visit papa did you ever see that gentleman at home susan asked florence  well miss returned her maid after considering i really couldnt say i ever did when your poor dear ma died miss floy i was very new in the family you see and my element the nipper bridled as opining that her merits had been always designedly extinguished by mr dombey was the floor below the attics  to be sure said florence still thoughtfully you are not likely to have known who came to the house i quite forgot  not miss but what we talked about the family and visitors said susan and but what i heard much said although the nurse before mrs richards make unpleasant remarks when i was in company and hint at little pitchers but that could only be attributed poor thing observed susan with composed forbearance to habits of intoxication for which she was required to leave and did  florence who was seated at her chamber window with her face resting on her hand sat looking out and hardly seemed to hear what susan said she was so lost in thought  at all events miss said susan i remember very well that this same gentleman mr carker was almost if not quite as great a gentleman with your papa then as he is now it used to be said in the house then miss that he was at the head of all your pas affairs in the city and managed the whole and that your pa minded him more than anybody which begging your pardon miss floy he might easy do for he never minded anybody else i knew that pitcher as i might have been  susan nipper with an injured remembrance of the nurse before mrs richards emphasised pitcher strongly  and that mr carker has not fallen off miss she pursued but has stood his ground and kept his credit with your pa i know from what is always said among our people by that perch whenever he comes to the house and though hes the weakest weed in the world miss floy and no one can have a moments patience with the man he knows what goes on in the city tolerable well and says that your pa does nothing without mr carker and leaves all to mr carker and acts according to mr carker and has mr carker always at his elbow and i do believe that he believes that washiest of perches that after your pa the emperor of india is the child unborn to mr carker  not a word of this was lost on florence who with an awakened interest in susans speech no longer gazed abstractedly on the prospect without but looked at her and listened with attention  yes susan she said when that young lady had concluded he is in papas confidence and is his friend i am sure  florences mind ran high on this theme and had done for some days mr carker in the two visits with which he had followed up his first one had assumed a confidence between himself and hera right on his part to be mysterious and stealthy in telling her that the ship was still unheard ofa kind of mildly restrained power and authority over herthat made her wonder and caused her great uneasiness she had no means of repelling it or of freeing herself from the web he was gradually winding about her for that would have required some art and knowledge of the world opposed to such address as his and florence had none true he had said no more to her than that there was no news of the ship and that he feared the worst but how he came to know that she was interested in the ship and why he had the right to signify his knowledge to her so insidiously and darkly troubled florence very much  this conduct on the part of mr carker and her habit of often considering it with wonder and uneasiness began to invest him with an uncomfortable fascination in florences thoughts a more distinct remembrance of his features voice and manner which she sometimes courted as a means of reducing him to the level of a real personage capable of exerting no greater charm over her than another did not remove the vague impression and yet he never frowned or looked upon her with an air of dislike or animosity but was always smiling and serene  again florence in pursuit of her strong purpose with reference to her father and her steady resolution to believe that she was herself unwittingly to blame for their so cold and distant relations would recall to mind that this gentleman was his confidential friend and would think with an anxious heart could her struggling tendency to dislike and fear him be a part of that misfortune in her which had turned her fathers love adrift and left her so alone she dreaded that it might be sometimes believed it was then she resolved that she would try to conquer this wrong feeling persuaded herself that she was honoured and encouraged by the notice of her fathers friend and hoped that patient observation of him and trust in him would lead her bleeding feet along that stony road which ended in her fathers heart  thus with no one to advise herfor she could advise with no one without seeming to complain against himgentle florence tossed on an uneasy sea of doubt and hope and mr carker like a scaly monster of the deep swam down below and kept his shining eye upon her florence had a new reason in all this for wishing to be at home again her lonely life was better suited to her course of timid hope and doubt and she feared sometimes that in her absence she might miss some hopeful chance of testifying her affection for her father heaven knows she might have set her mind at rest poor child on this last point but her slighted love was fluttering within her and even in her sleep it flew away in dreams and nestled like a wandering bird come home upon her fathers neck  of walter she thought often ah how often when the night was gloomy and the wind was blowing round the house but hope was strong in her breast it is so difficult for the young and ardent even with such experience as hers to imagine youth and ardour quenched like a weak flame and the bright day of life merging into night at noon that hope was strong yet her tears fell frequently for walters sufferings but rarely for his supposed death and never long  she had written to the old instrumentmaker but had received no answer to her note which indeed required none thus matters stood with florence on the morning when she was going home gladly to her old secluded life  doctor and mrs blimber accompanied much against his will by their valued charge master barnet were already gone back to brighton where that young gentleman and his fellowpilgrims to parnassus were then no doubt in the continual resumption of their studies the holiday time was past and over most of the juvenile guests at the villa had taken their departure and florences long visit was come to an end  there was one guest however albeit not resident within the house who had been very constant in his attentions to the family and who still remained devoted to them this was mr toots who after renewing some weeks ago the acquaintance he had had the happiness of forming with skettles junior on the night when he burst the blimberian bonds and soared into freedom with his ring on called regularly every other day and left a perfect pack of cards at the halldoor so many indeed that the ceremony was quite a deal on the part of mr toots and a hand at whist on the part of the servant  mr toots likewise with the bold and happy idea of preventing the family from forgetting him but there is reason to suppose that this expedient originated in the teeming brain of the chicken had established a sixoared cutter manned by aquatic friends of the chickens and steered by that illustrious character in person who wore a bright red firemans coat for the purpose and concealed the perpetual black eye with which he was afflicted beneath a green shade previous to the institution of this equipage mr toots sounded the chicken on a hypothetical case as supposing the chicken to be enamoured of a young lady named mary and to have conceived the intention of starting a boat of his own what would he call that boat the chicken replied with divers strong asseverations that he would either christen it poll or the chickens delight improving on this idea mr toots after deep study and the exercise of much invention resolved to call his boat the tootss joy as a delicate compliment to florence of which no man knowing the parties could possibly miss the appreciation  stretched on a crimson cushion in his gallant bark with his shoes in the air mr toots in the exercise of his project had come up the river day after day and week after week and had flitted to and fro near sir barnets garden and had caused his crew to cut across and across the river at sharp angles for his better exhibition to any lookersout from sir barnets windows and had had such evolutions performed by the tootss joy as had filled all the neighbouring part of the waterside with astonishment but whenever he saw anyone in sir barnets garden on the brink of the river mr toots always feigned to be passing there by a combination of coincidences of the most singular and unlikely description  how are you toots sir barnet would say waving his hand from the lawn while the artful chicken steered close in shore  how de do sir barnet mr toots would answer what a surprising thing that i should see you here  mr toots in his sagacity always said this as if instead of that being sir barnets house it were some deserted edifice on the banks of the nile or ganges  i never was so surprised mr toots would exclaimis miss dombey there  whereupon florence would appear perhaps  oh diogenes is quite well miss dombey toots would cry i called to ask this morning  thank you very much the pleasant voice of florence would reply  wont you come ashore toots sir barnet would say then come youre in no hurry come and see us  oh its of no consequence thank you mr toots would blushingly rejoin i thought miss dombey might like to know thats all goodbye and poor mr toots who was dying to accept the invitation but hadnt the courage to do it signed to the chicken with an aching heart and away went the joy cleaving the water like an arrow  the joy was lying in a state of extraordinary splendour at the garden steps on the morning of florences departure when she went downstairs to take leave after her talk with susan she found mr toots awaiting her in the drawingroom  oh how de do miss dombey said the stricken toots always dreadfully disconcerted when the desire of his heart was gained and he was speaking to her thank you im very well indeed i hope youre the same so was diogenes yesterday  you are very kind said florence  thank you its of no consequence retorted mr toots i thought perhaps you wouldnt mind in this fine weather coming home by water miss dombey theres plenty of room in the boat for your maid  i am very much obliged to you said florence hesitating i really ambut i would rather not  oh its of no consequence retorted mr toots good morning  wont you wait and see lady skettles asked florence kindly  oh no thank you returned mr toots its of no consequence at all  so shy was mr toots on such occasions and so flurried but lady skettles entering at the moment mr toots was suddenly seized with a passion for asking her how she did and hoping she was very well nor could mr toots by any possibility leave off shaking hands with her until sir barnet appeared to whom he immediately clung with the tenacity of desperation  we are losing today toots said sir barnet turning towards florence the light of our house i assure you  oh its of no conseqi mean yes to be sure faltered the embarrassed mr toots good morning  notwithstanding the emphatic nature of this farewell mr toots instead of going away stood leering about him vacantly florence to relieve him bade adieu with many thanks to lady skettles and gave her arm to sir barnet  may i beg of you my dear miss dombey said her host as he conducted her to the carriage to present my best compliments to your dear papa  it was distressing to florence to receive the commission for she felt as if she were imposing on sir barnet by allowing him to believe that a kindness rendered to her was rendered to her father as she could not explain however she bowed her head and thanked him and again she thought that the dull home free from such embarrassments and such reminders of her sorrow was her natural and best retreat  such of her late friends and companions as were yet remaining at the villa came running from within and from the garden to say goodbye they were all attached to her and very earnest in taking leave of her even the household were sorry for her going and the servants came nodding and curtseying round the carriage door as florence looked round on the kind faces and saw among them those of sir barnet and his lady and of mr toots who was chuckling and staring at her from a distance she was reminded of the night when paul and she had come from doctor blimbers and when the carriage drove away her face was wet with tears  sorrowful tears but tears of consolation too for all the softer memories connected with the dull old house to which she was returning made it dear to her as they rose up how long it seemed since she had wandered through the silent rooms since she had last crept softly and afraid into those her father occupied since she had felt the solemn but yet soothing influence of the beloved dead in every action of her daily life this new farewell reminded her besides of her parting with poor walter of his looks and words that night and of the gracious blending she had noticed in him of tenderness for those he left behind with courage and high spirit his little history was associated with the old house too and gave it a new claim and hold upon her heart even susan nipper softened towards the home of so many years as they were on their way towards it gloomy as it was and rigid justice as she rendered to its gloom she forgave it a great deal i shall be glad to see it again i dont deny miss said the nipper there aint much in it to boast of but i wouldnt have it burnt or pulled down neither  youll be glad to go through the old rooms wont you susan said florence smiling  well miss returned the nipper softening more and more towards the house as they approached it nearer i wont deny but what i shall though i shall hate em again tomorrow very likely  florence felt that for her there was greater peace within it than elsewhere it was better and easier to keep her secret shut up there among the tall dark walls than to carry it abroad into the light and try to hide it from a crowd of happy eyes it was better to pursue the study of her loving heart alone and find no new discouragements in loving hearts about her it was easier to hope and pray and love on all uncared for yet with constancy and patience in the tranquil sanctuary of such remembrances although it mouldered rusted and decayed about her than in a new scene let its gaiety be what it would she welcomed back her old enchanted dream of life and longed for the old dark door to close upon her once again  full of such thoughts they turned into the long and sombre street florence was not on that side of the carriage which was nearest to her home and as the distance lessened between them and it she looked out of her window for the children over the way  she was thus engaged when an exclamation from susan caused her to turn quickly round  why gracious me cried susan breathless wheres our house  our house said florence  susan drawing in her head from the window thrust it out again drew it in again as the carriage stopped and stared at her mistress in amazement  there was a labyrinth of scaffolding raised all round the house from the basement to the roof loads of bricks and stones and heaps of mortar and piles of wood blocked up half the width and length of the broad street at the side ladders were raised against the walls labourers were climbing up and down men were at work upon the steps of the scaffolding painters and decorators were busy inside great rolls of ornamental paper were being delivered from a cart at the door an upholsterers waggon also stopped the way no furniture was to be seen through the gaping and broken windows in any of the rooms nothing but workmen and the implements of their several trades swarming from the kitchens to the garrets inside and outside alike bricklayers painters carpenters masons hammer hod brush pickaxe saw and trowel all at work together in full chorus  florence descended from the coach half doubting if it were or could be the right house until she recognised towlinson with a sunburnt face standing at the door to receive her  there is nothing the matter inquired florence  oh no miss  there are great alterations going on  yes miss great alterations said towlinson  florence passed him as if she were in a dream and hurried upstairs the garish light was in the longdarkened drawingroom and there were steps and platforms and men in paper caps in the high places her mothers picture was gone with the rest of the moveables and on the mark where it had been was scrawled in chalk this room in panel green and gold the staircase was a labyrinth of posts and planks like the outside of the house and a whole olympus of plumbers and glaziers was reclining in various attitudes on the skylight her own room was not yet touched within but there were beams and boards raised against it without baulking the daylight she went up swiftly to that other bedroom where the little bed was and a dark giant of a man with a pipe in his mouth and his head tied up in a pockethandkerchief was staring in at the window  it was here that susan nipper who had been in quest of florence found her and said would she go downstairs to her papa who wished to speak to her  at home and wishing to speak to me cried florence trembling  susan who was infinitely more distraught than florence herself repeated her errand and florence pale and agitated hurried down again without a moments hesitation she thought upon the way down would she dare to kiss him the longing of her heart resolved her and she thought she would  her father might have heard that heart beat when it came into his presence one instant and it would have beat against his breast  but he was not alone there were two ladies there and florence stopped striving so hard with her emotion that if her brute friend di had not burst in and overwhelmed her with his caresses as a welcome homeat which one of the ladies gave a little scream and that diverted her attention from herselfshe would have swooned upon the floor  florence said her father putting out his hand so stiffly that it held her off how do you do  florence took the hand between her own and putting it timidly to her lips yielded to its withdrawal it touched the door in shutting it with quite as much endearment as it had touched her  what dog is that said mr dombey displeased  it is a dog papafrom brighton  well said mr dombey and a cloud passed over his face for he understood her  he is very goodtempered said florence addressing herself with her natural grace and sweetness to the two lady strangers he is only glad to see me pray forgive him  she saw in the glance they interchanged that the lady who had screamed and who was seated was old and that the other lady who stood near her papa was very beautiful and of an elegant figure  mrs skewton said her father turning to the first and holding out his hand this is my daughter florence  charming i am sure observed the lady putting up her glass so natural my darling florence you must kiss me if you please  florence having done so turned towards the other lady by whom her father stood waiting  edith said mr dombey this is my daughter florence florence this lady will soon be your mama  florence started and looked up at the beautiful face in a conflict of emotions among which the tears that name awakened struggled for a moment with surprise interest admiration and an indefinable sort of fear then she cried out oh papa may you be happy may you be very very happy all your life and then fell weeping on the ladys bosom  there was a short silence the beautiful lady who at first had seemed to hesitate whether or no she should advance to florence held her to her breast and pressed the hand with which she clasped her close about her waist as if to reassure her and comfort her not one word passed the ladys lips she bent her head down over florence and she kissed her on the cheek but she said no word  shall we go on through the rooms said mr dombey and see how our workmen are doing pray allow me my dear madam  he said this in offering his arm to mrs skewton who had been looking at florence through her glass as though picturing to herself what she might be made by the infusionfrom her own copious storehouse no doubtof a little more heart and nature florence was still sobbing on the ladys breast and holding to her when mr dombey was heard to say from the conservatory  let us ask edith dear me where is she  edith my dear cried mrs skewton where are you looking for mr dombey somewhere i know we are here my love  the beautiful lady released her hold of florence and pressing her lips once more upon her face withdrew hurriedly and joined them florence remained standing in the same place happy sorry joyful and in tears she knew not how or how long but all at once when her new mama came back and took her in her arms again  florence said the lady hurriedly and looking into her face with great earnestness you will not begin by hating me  by hating you mama cried florence winding her arm round her neck and returning the look  hush begin by thinking well of me said the beautiful lady begin by believing that i will try to make you happy and that i am prepared to love you florence goodbye we shall meet again soon goodbye dont stay here now  again she pressed her to her breast she had spoken in a rapid manner but firmlyand florence saw her rejoin them in the other room and now florence began to hope that she would learn from her new and beautiful mama how to gain her fathers love and in her sleep that night in her lost old home her own mama smiled radiantly upon the hope and blessed it dreaming florence    chapter 29 the opening of the eyes of mrs chick   miss tox all unconscious of any such rare appearances in connexion with mr dombeys house as scaffoldings and ladders and men with their heads tied up in pockethandkerchiefs glaring in at the windows like flying genii or strange birdshaving breakfasted one morning at about this eventful period of time on her customary viands to wit one french roll rasped one egg new laid or warranted to be and one little pot of tea wherein was infused one little silver scoopful of that herb on behalf of miss tox and one little silver scoopful on behalf of the teapota flight of fancy in which good housekeepers delight went upstairs to set forth the bird waltz on the harpsichord to water and arrange the plants to dust the nicknacks and according to her daily custom to make her little drawingroom the garland of princesss place  miss tox endued herself with a pair of ancient gloves like dead leaves in which she was accustomed to perform these avocationshidden from human sight at other times in a table drawerand went methodically to work beginning with the bird waltz passing by a natural association of ideas to her birda very highshouldered canary stricken in years and much rumpled but a piercing singer as princesss place well knew taking next in order the little china ornaments paper flycages and so forth and coming round in good time to the plants which generally required to be snipped here and there with a pair of scissors for some botanical reason that was very powerful with miss tox miss tox was slow in coming to the plants this morning the weather was warm the wind southerly and there was a sigh of the summertime in princesss place that turned miss toxs thoughts upon the country the potboy attached to the princesss arms had come out with a can and trickled water in a flowering pattern all over princesss place and it gave the weedy ground a fresh scentquite a growing scent miss tox said there was a tiny blink of sun peeping in from the great street round the corner and the smoky sparrows hopped over it and back again brightening as they passed or bathed in it like a stream and became glorified sparrows unconnected with chimneys legends in praise of gingerbeer with pictorial representations of thirsty customers submerged in the effervescence or stunned by the flying corks were conspicuous in the window of the princesss arms they were making late hay somewhere out of town and though the fragrance had a long way to come and many counter fragrances to contend with among the dwellings of the poor may god reward the worthy gentlemen who stickle for the plague as part and parcel of the wisdom of our ancestors and who do their little best to keep those dwellings miserable yet it was wafted faintly into princesss place whispering of nature and her wholesome air as such things will even unto prisoners and captives and those who are desolate and oppressed in very spite of aldermen and knights to boot at whose sage nodand how they nodthe rolling world stands still  miss tox sat down upon the windowseat and thought of her good papa deceasedmr tox of the customs department of the public service and of her childhood passed at a seaport among a considerable quantity of cold tar and some rusticity she fell into a softened remembrance of meadows in old time gleaming with buttercups like so many inverted firmaments of golden stars and how she had made chains of dandelionstalks for youthful vowers of eternal constancy dressed chiefly in nankeen and how soon those fetters had withered and broken  sitting on the windowseat and looking out upon the sparrows and the blink of sun miss tox thought likewise of her good mama deceasedsister to the owner of the powdered head and pigtailof her virtues and her rheumatism and when a man with bulgy legs and a rough voice and a heavy basket on his head that crushed his hat into a mere black muffin came crying flowers down princesss place making his timid little roots of daisies shudder in the vibration of every yell he gave as though he had been an ogre hawking little children summer recollections were so strong upon miss tox that she shook her head and murmured she would be comparatively old before she knew itwhich seemed likely  in her pensive mood miss toxs thoughts went wandering on mr dombeys track probably because the major had returned home to his lodgings opposite and had just bowed to her from his window what other reason could miss tox have for connecting mr dombey with her summer days and dandelion fetters was he more cheerful thought miss tox was he reconciled to the decrees of fate would he ever marry again and if yes whom what sort of person now  a flushit was warm weatheroverspread miss toxs face as while entertaining these meditations she turned her head and was surprised by the reflection of her thoughtful image in the chimneyglass another flush succeeded when she saw a little carriage drive into princesss place and make straight for her own door miss tox arose took up her scissors hastily and so coming at last to the plants was very busy with them when mrs chick entered the room  how is my sweetest friend exclaimed miss tox with open arms  a little stateliness was mingled with miss toxs sweetest friends demeanour but she kissed miss tox and said lucretia thank you i am pretty well i hope you are the same hem  mrs chick was labouring under a peculiar little monosyllabic cough a sort of primer or easy introduction to the art of coughing  you call very early and how kind that is my dear pursued miss tox now have you breakfasted  thank you lucretia said mrs chick i have i took an early breakfastthe good lady seemed curious on the subject of princesss place and looked all round it as she spokewith my brother who has come home  he is better i trust my love faltered miss tox  he is greatly better thank you hem  my dear louisa must be careful of that cough remarked miss tox  its nothing returned mrs chic its merely change of weather we must expect change  of weather asked miss tox in her simplicity  of everything returned mrs chick of course we must its a world of change anyone would surprise me very much lucretia and would greatly alter my opinion of their understanding if they attempted to contradict or evade what is so perfectly evident change exclaimed mrs chick with severe philosophy why my gracious me what is there that does not change even the silkworm who i am sure might be supposed not to trouble itself about such subjects changes into all sorts of unexpected things continually  my louisa said the mild miss tox is ever happy in her illustrations  you are so kind lucretia returned mrs chick a little softened as to say so and to think so i believe i hope neither of us may ever have any cause to lessen our opinion of the other lucretia  i am sure of it returned miss tox  mrs chick coughed as before and drew lines on the carpet with the ivory end of her parasol miss tox who had experience of her fair friend and knew that under the pressure of any slight fatigue or vexation she was prone to a discursive kind of irritability availed herself of the pause to change the subject  pardon me my dear louisa said miss tox but have i caught sight of the manly form of mr chick in the carriage  he is there said mrs chick but pray leave him there he has his newspaper and would be quite contented for the next two hours go on with your flowers lucretia and allow me to sit here and rest  my louisa knows observed miss tox that between friends like ourselves any approach to ceremony would be out of the question therefore therefore miss tox finished the sentence not in words but action and putting on her gloves again which she had taken off and arming herself once more with her scissors began to snip and clip among the leaves with microscopic industry  florence has returned home also said mrs chick after sitting silent for some time with her head on one side and her parasol sketching on the floor and really florence is a great deal too old now to continue to lead that solitary life to which she has been accustomed of course she is there can be no doubt about it i should have very little respect indeed for anybody who could advocate a different opinion whatever my wishes might be i could not respect them we cannot command our feelings to such an extent as that  miss tox assented without being particular as to the intelligibility of the proposition  if shes a strange girl said mrs chick and if my brother paul cannot feel perfectly comfortable in her society after all the sad things that have happened and all the terrible disappointments that have been undergone then what is the reply that he must make an effort that he is bound to make an effort we have always been a family remarkable for effort paul is at the head of the family almost the only representative of it leftfor what am ii am of no consequence  my dearest love remonstrated miss tox  mrs chick dried her eyes which were for the moment overflowing and proceeded  and consequently he is more than ever bound to make an effort and though his having done so comes upon me with a sort of shockfor mine is a very weak and foolish nature which is anything but a blessing i am sure i often wish my heart was a marble slab or a pavingstone  my sweet louisa remonstrated miss tox again  still it is a triumph to me to know that he is so true to himself and to his name of dombey although of course i always knew he would be i only hope said mrs chick after a pause that she may be worthy of the name too  miss tox filled a little green wateringpot from a jug and happening to look up when she had done so was so surprised by the amount of expression mrs chick had conveyed into her face and was bestowing upon her that she put the little wateringpot on the table for the present and sat down near it  my dear louisa said miss tox will it be the least satisfaction to you if i venture to observe in reference to that remark that i as a humble individual think your sweet niece in every way most promising what do you mean lucretia returned mrs chick with increased stateliness of manner to what remark of mine my dear do you refer  her being worthy of her name my love replied miss tox  if said mrs chick with solemn patience i have not expressed myself with clearness lucretia the fault of course is mine there is perhaps no reason why i should express myself at all except the intimacy that has subsisted between us and which i very much hope lucretiaconfidently hopenothing will occur to disturb because why should i do anything else there is no reason it would be absurd but i wish to express myself clearly lucretia and therefore to go back to that remark i must beg to say that it was not intended to relate to florence in any way  indeed returned miss tox  no said mrs chick shortly and decisively  pardon me my dear rejoined her meek friend but i cannot have understood it i fear i am dull  mrs chick looked round the room and over the way at the plants at the bird at the wateringpot at almost everything within view except miss tox and finally dropping her glance upon miss tox for a moment on its way to the ground said looking meanwhile with elevated eyebrows at the carpet  when i speak lucretia of her being worthy of the name i speak of my brother pauls second wife i believe i have already said in effect if not in the very words i now use that it is his intention to marry a second wife  miss tox left her seat in a hurry and returned to her plants clipping among the stems and leaves with as little favour as a barber working at so many pauper heads of hair  whether she will be fully sensible of the distinction conferred upon her said mrs chick in a lofty tone is quite another question i hope she may be we are bound to think well of one another in this world and i hope she may be i have not been advised with myself if i had been advised with i have no doubt my advice would have been cavalierly received and therefore it is infinitely better as it is i much prefer it as it is  miss tox with head bent down still clipped among the plants mrs chick with energetic shakings of her own head from time to time continued to hold forth as if in defiance of somebody if my brother paul had consulted with me which he sometimes doesor rather sometimes used to do for he will naturally do that no more now and this is a circumstance which i regard as a relief from responsibility said mrs chick hysterically for i thank heaven i am not jealous here mrs chick again shed tears if my brother paul had come to me and had said louisa what kind of qualities would you advise me to look out for in a wife i should certainly have answered paul you must have family you must have beauty you must have dignity you must have connexion those are the words i should have used you might have led me to the block immediately afterwards said mrs chick as if that consequence were highly probable but i should have used them i should have said paul you to marry a second time without family you to marry without beauty you to marry without dignity you to marry without connexion there is nobody in the world not mad who could dream of daring to entertain such a preposterous idea  miss tox stopped clipping and with her head among the plants listened attentively perhaps miss tox thought there was hope in this exordium and the warmth of mrs chick  i should have adopted this course of argument pursued the discreet lady because i trust i am not a fool i make no claim to be considered a person of superior intellectthough i believe some people have been extraordinary enough to consider me so one so little humoured as i am would very soon be disabused of any such notion but i trust i am not a downright fool and to tell me said mrs chick with ineffable disdain that my brother paul dombey could ever contemplate the possibility of uniting himself to anybodyi dont care whoshe was more sharp and emphatic in that short clause than in any other part of her discoursenot possessing these requisites would be to insult what understanding i have got as much as if i was to be told that i was born and bred an elephant which i may be told next said mrs chick with resignation it wouldnt surprise me at all i expect it  in the moments silence that ensued miss toxs scissors gave a feeble clip or two but miss toxs face was still invisible and miss toxs morning gown was agitated mrs chick looked sideways at her through the intervening plants and went on to say in a tone of bland conviction and as one dwelling on a point of fact that hardly required to be stated  therefore of course my brother paul has done what was to be expected of him and what anybody might have foreseen he would do if he entered the marriage state again i confess it takes me rather by surprise however gratifying because when paul went out of town i had no idea at all that he would form any attachment out of town and he certainly had no attachment when he left here however it seems to be extremely desirable in every point of view i have no doubt the mother is a most genteel and elegant creature and i have no right whatever to dispute the policy of her living with them which is pauls affair not mineand as to pauls choice herself i have only seen her picture yet but that is beautiful indeed her name is beautiful too said mrs chick shaking her head with energy and arranging herself in her chair edith is at once uncommon as it strikes me and distinguished consequently lucretia i have no doubt you will be happy to hear that the marriage is to take place immediatelyof course you will great emphasis again and that you are delighted with this change in the condition of my brother who has shown you a great deal of pleasant attention at various times  miss tox made no verbal answer but took up the little wateringpot with a trembling hand and looked vacantly round as if considering what article of furniture would be improved by the contents the room door opening at this crisis of miss toxs feelings she started laughed aloud and fell into the arms of the person entering happily insensible alike of mrs chicks indignant countenance and of the major at his window over the way who had his doublebarrelled eyeglass in full action and whose face and figure were dilated with mephistophelean joy  not so the expatriated native amazed supporter of miss toxs swooning form who coming straight upstairs with a polite inquiry touching miss toxs health in exact pursuance of the majors malicious instructions had accidentally arrived in the very nick of time to catch the delicate burden in his arms and to receive the content of the little wateringpot in his shoe both of which circumstances coupled with his consciousness of being closely watched by the wrathful major who had threatened the usual penalty in regard of every bone in his skin in case of any failure combined to render him a moving spectacle of mental and bodily distress  for some moments this afflicted foreigner remained clasping miss tox to his heart with an energy of action in remarkable opposition to his disconcerted face while that poor lady trickled slowly down upon him the very last sprinklings of the little wateringpot as if he were a delicate exotic which indeed he was and might be almost expected to blow while the gentle rain descended mrs chick at length recovering sufficient presence of mind to interpose commanded him to drop miss tox upon the sofa and withdraw and the exile promptly obeying she applied herself to promote miss toxs recovery  but none of that gentle concern which usually characterises the daughters of eve in their tending of each other none of that freemasonry in fainting by which they are generally bound together in a mysterious bond of sisterhood was visible in mrs chicks demeanour rather like the executioner who restores the victim to sensation previous to proceeding with the torture or was wont to do so in the good old times for which all true men wear perpetual mourning did mrs chick administer the smellingbottle the slapping on the hands the dashing of cold water on the face and the other proved remedies and when at length miss tox opened her eyes and gradually became restored to animation and consciousness mrs chick drew off as from a criminal and reversing the precedent of the murdered king of denmark regarded her more in anger than in sorrow  lucretia said mrs chick i will not attempt to disguise what i feel my eyes are opened all at once i wouldnt have believed this if a saint had told it to me  i am foolish to give way to faintness miss tox faltered i shall be better presently  you will be better presently lucretia repeated mrs chick with exceeding scorn do you suppose i am blind do you imagine i am in my second childhood no lucretia i am obliged to you  miss tox directed an imploring helpless kind of look towards her friend and put her handkerchief before her face  if anyone had told me this yesterday said mrs chick with majesty or even halfanhour ago i should have been tempted i almost believe to strike them to the earth lucretia tox my eyes are opened to you all at once the scales here mrs chick cast down an imaginary pair such as are commonly used in grocers shops have fallen from my sight the blindness of my confidence is past lucretia it has been abused and played upon and evasion is quite out of the question now i assure you  oh to what do you allude so cruelly my love asked miss tox through her tears  lucretia said mrs chick ask your own heart i must entreat you not to address me by any such familiar term as you have just used if you please i have some selfrespect left though you may think otherwise  oh louisa cried miss tox how can you speak to me like that  how can i speak to you like that retorted mrs chick who in default of having any particular argument to sustain herself upon relied principally on such repetitions for her most withering effects like that you may well say like that indeed  miss tox sobbed pitifully  the idea said mrs chick of your having basked at my brothers fireside like a serpent and wound yourself through me almost into his confidence lucretia that you might in secret entertain designs upon him and dare to aspire to contemplate the possibility of his uniting himself to you why it is an idea said mrs chick with sarcastic dignity the absurdity of which almost relieves its treachery  pray louisa urged miss tox do not say such dreadful things  dreadful things repeated mrs chick dreadful things is it not a fact lucretia that you have just now been unable to command your feelings even before me whose eyes you had so completely closed  i have made no complaint sobbed miss tox i have said nothing if i have been a little overpowered by your news louisa and have ever had any lingering thought that mr dombey was inclined to be particular towards me surely you will not condemn me  she is going to say said mrs chick addressing herself to the whole of the furniture in a comprehensive glance of resignation and appeal she is going to sayi know itthat i have encouraged her  i dont wish to exchange reproaches dear louisa sobbed miss tox nor do i wish to complain but in my own defence  yes cried mrs chick looking round the room with a prophetic smile thats what shes going to say i knew it you had better say it say it openly be open lucretia tox said mrs chick with desperate sternness whatever you are  in my own defence faltered miss tox and only in my own defence against your unkind words my dear louisa i would merely ask you if you havent often favoured such a fancy and even said it might happen for anything we could tell  there is a point said mrs chick rising not as if she were going to stop at the floor but as if she were about to soar up high into her native skies beyond which endurance becomes ridiculous if not culpable i can bear much but not too much what spell was on me when i came into this house this day i dont know but i had a presentimenta dark presentiment said mrs chick with a shiver that something was going to happen well may i have had that foreboding lucretia when my confidence of many years is destroyed in an instant when my eyes are opened all at once and when i find you revealed in your true colours lucretia i have been mistaken in you it is better for us both that this subject should end here i wish you well and i shall ever wish you well but as an individual who desires to be true to herself in her own poor position whatever that position may be or may not beand as the sister of my brotherand as the sisterinlaw of my brothers wifeand as a connexion by marriage of my brothers wifes mothermay i be permitted to add as a dombeyi can wish you nothing else but good morning  these words delivered with cutting suavity tempered and chastened by a lofty air of moral rectitude carried the speaker to the door there she inclined her head in a ghostly and statuelike manner and so withdrew to her carriage to seek comfort and consolation in the arms of mr chick her lord  figuratively speaking that is to say for the arms of mr chick were full of his newspaper neither did that gentleman address his eyes towards his wife otherwise than by stealth neither did he offer any consolation whatever in short he sat reading and humming fag ends of tunes and sometimes glancing furtively at her without delivering himself of a word good bad or indifferent  in the meantime mrs chick sat swelling and bridling and tossing her head as if she were still repeating that solemn formula of farewell to lucretia tox at length she said aloud oh the extent to which her eyes had been opened that day  to which your eyes have been opened my dear repeated mr chick  oh dont talk to me said mrs chic if you can bear to see me in this state and not ask me what the matter is you had better hold your tongue for ever  what is the matter my dear asked mr chick  to think said mrs chick in a state of soliloquy that she should ever have conceived the base idea of connecting herself with our family by a marriage with paul to think that when she was playing at horses with that dear child who is now in his gravei never liked it at the timeshe should have been hiding such a doublefaced design i wonder she was never afraid that something would happen to her she is fortunate if nothing does  i really thought my dear said mr chick slowly after rubbing the bridge of his nose for some time with his newspaper that you had gone on the same tack yourself all along until this morning and had thought it would be a convenient thing enough if it could have been brought about  mrs chick instantly burst into tears and told mr chick that if he wished to trample upon her with his boots he had better do it  but with lucretia tox i have done said mrs chick after abandoning herself to her feelings for some minutes to mr chicks great terror i can bear to resign pauls confidence in favour of one who i hope and trust may be deserving of it and with whom he has a perfect right to replace poor fanny if he chooses i can bear to be informed in pauls cool manner of such a change in his plans and never to be consulted until all is settled and determined but deceit i can not bear and with lucretia tox i have done it is better as it is said mrs chick piously much better it would have been a long time before i could have accommodated myself comfortably with her after this and i really dont know as paul is going to be very grand and these are people of condition that she would have been quite presentable and might not have compromised myself theres a providence in everything everything works for the best i have been tried today but on the whole i do not regret it  in which christian spirit mrs chick dried her eyes and smoothed her lap and sat as became a person calm under a great wrong mr chick feeling his unworthiness no doubt took an early opportunity of being set down at a street corner and walking away whistling with his shoulders very much raised and his hands in his pockets  while poor excommunicated miss tox who if she were a fawner and toadeater was at least an honest and a constant one and had ever borne a faithful friendship towards her impeacher and had been truly absorbed and swallowed up in devotion to the magnificence of mr dombeywhile poor excommunicated miss tox watered her plants with her tears and felt that it was winter in princesss place    chapter 30 the interval before the marriage   although the enchanted house was no more and the working world had broken into it and was hammering and crashing and tramping up and down stairs all day long keeping diogenes in an incessant paroxysm of barking from sunrise to sunsetevidently convinced that his enemy had got the better of him at last and was then sacking the premises in triumphant defiancethere was at first no other great change in the method of florences life at night when the workpeople went away the house was dreary and deserted again and florence listening to their voices echoing through the hall and staircase as they departed pictured to herself the cheerful homes to which the were returning and the children who were waiting for them and was glad to think that they were merry and well pleased to go  she welcomed back the evening silence as an old friend but it came now with an altered face and looked more kindly on her fresh hope was in it the beautiful lady who had soothed and carressed her in the very room in which her heart had been so wrung was a spirit of promise to her soft shadows of the bright life dawning when her fathers affection should be gradually won and all or much should be restored of what she had lost on the dark day when a mothers love had faded with a mothers last breath on her cheek moved about her in the twilight and were welcome company peeping at the rosy children her neighbours it was a new and precious sensation to think that they might soon speak together and know each other when she would not fear as of old to show herself before them lest they should be grieved to see her in her black dress sitting there alone  in her thoughts of her new mother and in the love and trust overflowing her pure heart towards her florence loved her own dead mother more and more she had no fear of setting up a rival in her breast the new flower sprang from the deepplanted and longcherished root she knew every gentle word that had fallen from the lips of the beautiful lady sounded to florence like an echo of the voice long hushed and silent how could she love that memory less for living tenderness when it was her memory of all parental tenderness and love  florence was one day sitting reading in her room and thinking of the lady and her promised visit soonfor her book turned on a kindred subjectwhen raising her eyes she saw her standing in the doorway  mama cried florence joyfully meeting her come again  not mama yet returned the lady with a serious smile as she encircled florences neck with her arm  but very soon to be cried florence  very soon now florence very soon  edith bent her head a little so as to press the blooming cheek of florence against her own and for some few moments remained thus silent there was something so very tender in her manner that florence was even more sensible of it than on the first occasion of their meeting  she led florence to a chair beside her and sat down florence looking in her face quite wondering at its beauty and willingly leaving her hand in hers  have you been alone florence since i was here last  oh yes smiled florence hastily  she hesitated and cast down her eyes for her new mama was very earnest in her look and the look was intently and thoughtfully fixed upon her face  iiam used to be alone said florence i dont mind it at all di and i pass whole days together sometimes florence might have said whole weeks and months  is di your maid love  my dog mama said florence laughing susan is my maid  and these are your rooms said edith looking round i was not shown these rooms the other day we must have them improved florence they shall be made the prettiest in the house  if i might change them mama returned florence there is one upstairs i should like much better  is this not high enough dear girl asked edith smiling  the other was my brothers room said florence and i am very fond of it i would have spoken to papa about it when i came home and found the workmen here and everything changing but  florence dropped her eyes lest the same look should make her falter again  but i was afraid it might distress him and as you said you would be here again soon mama and are the mistress of everything i determined to take courage and ask you  edith sat looking at her with her brilliant eyes intent upon her face until florence raising her own she in her turn withdrew her gaze and turned it on the ground it was then that florence thought how different this ladys beauty was from what she had supposed she had thought it of a proud and lofty kind yet her manner was so subdued and gentle that if she had been of florences own age and character it scarcely could have invited confidence more  except when a constrained and singular reserve crept over her and then she seemed but florence hardly understood this though she could not choose but notice it and think about it as if she were humbled before florence and ill at ease when she had said that she was not her mama yet and when florence had called her the mistress of everything there this change in her was quick and startling and now while the eyes of florence rested on her face she sat as though she would have shrunk and hidden from her rather than as one about to love and cherish her in right of such a near connexion  she gave florence her ready promise about her new room and said she would give directions about it herself she then asked some questions concerning poor paul and when they had sat in conversation for some time told florence she had come to take her to her own home  we have come to london now my mother and i said edith and you shall stay with us until i am married i wish that we should know and trust each other florence  you are very kind to me said florence dear mama how much i thank you  let me say now for it may be the best opportunity continued edith looking round to see that they were quite alone and speaking in a lower voice that when i am married and have gone away for some weeks i shall be easier at heart if you will come home here no matter who invites you to stay elsewhere come home here it is better to be alone thanwhat i would say is she added checking herself that i know well you are best at home dear florence  i will come home on the very day mama  do so i rely on that promise now prepare to come with me dear girl you will find me downstairs when you are ready  slowly and thoughtfully did edith wander alone through the mansion of which she was so soon to be the lady and little heed took she of all the elegance and splendour it began to display the same indomitable haughtiness of soul the same proud scorn expressed in eye and lip the same fierce beauty only tamed by a sense of its own little worth and of the little worth of everything around it went through the grand saloons and halls that had got loose among the shady trees and raged and rent themselves the mimic roses on the walls and floors were set round with sharp thorns that tore her breast in every scrap of gold so dazzling to the eye she saw some hateful atom of her purchasemoney the broad high mirrors showed her at full length a woman with a noble quality yet dwelling in her nature who was too false to her better self and too debased and lost to save herself she believed that all this was so plain more or less to all eyes that she had no resource or power of selfassertion but in pride and with this pride which tortured her own heart night and day she fought her fate out braved it and defied it  was this the woman whom florencean innocent girl strong only in her earnestness and simple truthcould so impress and quell that by her side she was another creature with her tempest of passion hushed and her very pride itself subdued was this the woman who now sat beside her in a carriage with her arms entwined and who while she courted and entreated her to love and trust her drew her fair head to nestle on her breast and would have laid down life to shield it from wrong or harm  oh edith it were well to die indeed at such a time better and happier far perhaps to die so edith than to live on to the end  the honourable mrs skewton who was thinking of anything rather than of such sentimentsfor like many genteel persons who have existed at various times she set her face against death altogether and objected to the mention of any such low and levelling upstarthad borrowed a house in brook street grosvenor square from a stately relative one of the feenix brood who was out of town and who did not object to lending it in the handsomest manner for nuptial purposes as the loan implied his final release and acquittance from all further loans and gifts to mrs skewton and her daughter it being necessary for the credit of the family to make a handsome appearance at such a time mrs skewton with the assistance of an accommodating tradesman resident in the parish of marylebone who lent out all sorts of articles to the nobility and gentry from a service of plate to an army of footmen clapped into this house a silverheaded butler who was charged extra on that account as having the appearance of an ancient family retainer two very tall young men in livery and a select staff of kitchenservants so that a legend arose downstairs that withers the page released at once from his numerous household duties and from the propulsion of the wheeledchair inconsistent with the metropolis had been several times observed to rub his eyes and pinch his limbs as if he misdoubted his having overslept himself at the leamington milkmans and being still in a celestial dream a variety of requisites in plate and china being also conveyed to the same establishment from the same convenient source with several miscellaneous articles including a neat chariot and a pair of bays mrs skewton cushioned herself on the principal sofa in the cleopatra attitude and held her court in fair state  and how said mrs skewton on the entrance of her daughter and her charge is my charming florence you must come and kiss me florence if you please my love  florence was timidly stooping to pick out a place in the white part of mrs skewtons face when that lady presented her ear and relieved her of her difficulty  edith my dear said mrs skewton positively istand a little more in the light my sweetest florence for a moment  florence blushingly complied  you dont remember dearest edith said her mother what you were when you were about the same age as our exceedingly precious florence or a few years younger  i have long forgotten mother  for positively my dear said mrs skewton i do think that i see a decided resemblance to what you were then in our extremely fascinating young friend and it shows said mrs skewton in a lower voice which conveyed her opinion that florence was in a very unfinished state what cultivation will do  it does indeed was ediths stern reply  her mother eyed her sharply for a moment and feeling herself on unsafe ground said as a diversion  my charming florence you must come and kiss me once more if you please my love  florence complied of course and again imprinted her lips on mrs skewtons ear  and you have heard no doubt my darling pet said mrs skewton detaining her hand that your papa whom we all perfectly adore and dote upon is to be married to my dearest edith this day week  i knew it would be very soon returned florence but not exactly when  my darling edith urged her mother gaily is it possible you have not told florence  why should i tell florence she returned so suddenly and harshly that florence could scarcely believe it was the same voice  mrs skewton then told florence as another and safer diversion that her father was coming to dinner and that he would no doubt be charmingly surprised to see her as he had spoken last night of dressing in the city and had known nothing of ediths design the execution of which according to mrs skewtons expectation would throw him into a perfect ecstasy florence was troubled to hear this and her distress became so keen as the dinnerhour approached that if she had known how to frame an entreaty to be suffered to return home without involving her father in her explanation she would have hurried back on foot bareheaded breathless and alone rather than incur the risk of meeting his displeasure  as the time drew nearer she could hardly breathe she dared not approach a window lest he should see her from the street she dared not go upstairs to hide her emotion lest in passing out at the door she should meet him unexpectedly besides which dread she felt as though she never could come back again if she were summoned to his presence in this conflict of fears she was sitting by cleopatras couch endeavouring to understand and to reply to the bald discourse of that lady when she heard his foot upon the stair  i hear him now cried florence starting he is coming  cleopatra who in her juvenility was always playfully disposed and who in her selfengrossment did not trouble herself about the nature of this agitation pushed florence behind her couch and dropped a shawl over her preparatory to giving mr dombey a rapture of surprise it was so quickly done that in a moment florence heard his awful step in the room  he saluted his intended motherinlaw and his intended bride the strange sound of his voice thrilled through the whole frame of his child  my dear dombey said cleopatra come here and tell me how your pretty florence is  florence is very well said mr dombey advancing towards the couch  at home  at home said mr dombey  my dear dombey returned cleopatra with bewitching vivacity now are you sure you are not deceiving me i dont know what my dearest edith will say to me when i make such a declaration but upon my honour i am afraid you are the falsest of men my dear dombey  though he had been and had been detected on the spot in the most enormous falsehood that was ever said or done he could hardly have been more disconcerted than he was when mrs skewton plucked the shawl away and florence pale and trembling rose before him like a ghost he had not yet recovered his presence of mind when florence had run up to him clasped her hands round his neck kissed his face and hurried out of the room he looked round as if to refer the matter to somebody else but edith had gone after florence instantly  now confess my dear dombey said mrs skewton giving him her hand that you never were more surprised and pleased in your life  i never was more surprised said mr dombey  nor pleased my dearest dombey returned mrs skewton holding up her fan  iyes i am exceedingly glad to meet florence here said mr dombey he appeared to consider gravely about it for a moment and then said more decidedly yes i really am very glad indeed to meet florence here  you wonder how she comes here said mrs skewton dont you  edith perhaps suggested mr dombey  ah wicked guesser replied cleopatra shaking her head ah cunning cunning man one shouldnt tell these things your sex my dear dombey are so vain and so apt to abuse our weakness but you know my open soulvery well immediately  this was addressed to one of the very tall young men who announced dinner  but edith my dear dombey she continued in a whisper when she cannot have you near herand as i tell her she cannot expect that alwayswill at least have near her something or somebody belonging to you well how extremely natural that is and in this spirit nothing would keep her from riding off today to fetch our darling florence well how excessively charming that is  as she waited for an answer mr dombey answered eminently so  bless you my dear dombey for that proof of heart cried cleopatra squeezing his hand but i am growing too serious take me downstairs like an angel and let us see what these people intend to give us for dinner bless you dear dombey  cleopatra skipping off her couch with tolerable briskness after the last benediction mr dombey took her arm in his and led her ceremoniously downstairs one of the very tall young men on hire whose organ of veneration was imperfectly developed thrusting his tongue into his cheek for the entertainment of the other very tall young man on hire as the couple turned into the diningroom  florence and edith were already there and sitting side by side florence would have risen when her father entered to resign her chair to him but edith openly put her hand upon her arm and mr dombey took an opposite place at the round table  the conversation was almost entirely sustained by mrs skewton florence hardly dared to raise her eyes lest they should reveal the traces of tears far less dared to speak and edith never uttered one word unless in answer to a question verily cleopatra worked hard for the establishment that was so nearly clutched and verily it should have been a rich one to reward her  and so your preparations are nearly finished at last my dear dombey said cleopatra when the dessert was put upon the table and the silverheaded butler had withdrawn even the lawyers preparations  yes madam replied mr dombey the deed of settlement the professional gentlemen inform me is now ready and as i was mentioning to you edith has only to do us the favour to suggest her own time for its execution  edith sat like a handsome statue as cold as silent and as still  my dearest love said cleopatra do you hear what mr dombey says ah my dear dombey aside to that gentleman how her absence as the time approaches reminds me of the days when that most agreeable of creatures her papa was in your situation  i have nothing to suggest it shall be when you please said edith scarcely looking over the table at mr dombey  tomorrow suggested mr dombey  if you please  or would next day said mr dombey suit your engagements better  i have no engagements i am always at your disposal let it be when you like  no engagements my dear edith remonstrated her mother when you are in a most terrible state of flurry all day long and have a thousand and one appointments with all sorts of tradespeople  they are of your making returned edith turning on her with a slight contraction of her brow you and mr dombey can arrange between you  very true indeed my love and most considerate of you said cleopatra my darling florence you must really come and kiss me once more if you please my dear  singular coincidence that these gushes of interest in florence hurried cleopatra away from almost every dialogue in which edith had a share however trifling florence had certainly never undergone so much embracing and perhaps had never been unconsciously so useful in her life  mr dombey was far from quarrelling in his own breast with the manner of his beautiful betrothed he had that good reason for sympathy with haughtiness and coldness which is found in a fellowfeeling it flattered him to think how these deferred to him in ediths case and seemed to have no will apart from his it flattered him to picture to himself this proud and stately woman doing the honours of his house and chilling his guests after his own manner the dignity of dombey and son would be heightened and maintained indeed in such hands  so thought mr dombey when he was left alone at the diningtable and mused upon his past and future fortunes finding no uncongeniality in an air of scant and gloomy state that pervaded the room in colour a dark brown with black hatchments of pictures blotching the walls and twentyfour black chairs with almost as many nails in them as so many coffins waiting like mutes upon the threshold of the turkey carpet and two exhausted negroes holding up two withered branches of candelabra on the sideboard and a musty smell prevailing as if the ashes of ten thousand dinners were entombed in the sarcophagus below it the owner of the house lived much abroad the air of england seldom agreed long with a member of the feenix family and the room had gradually put itself into deeper and still deeper mourning for him until it was become so funereal as to want nothing but a body in it to be quite complete  no bad representation of the body for the nonce in his unbending form if not in his attitude mr dombey looked down into the cold depths of the dead sea of mahogany on which the fruit dishes and decanters lay at anchor as if the subjects of his thoughts were rising towards the surface one by one and plunging down again edith was there in all her majesty of brow and figure and close to her came florence with her timid head turned to him as it had been for an instant when she left the room and ediths eyes upon her and ediths hand put out protectingly a little figure in a low armchair came springing next into the light and looked upon him wonderingly with its bright eyes and its oldyoung face gleaming as in the flickering of an evening fire again came florence close upon it and absorbed his whole attention whether as a foredoomed difficulty and disappointment to him whether as a rival who had crossed him in his way and might again whether as his child of whom in his successful wooing he could stoop to think as claiming at such a time to be no more estranged or whether as a hint to him that the mere appearance of caring for his own blood should be maintained in his new relations he best knew indifferently well perhaps at best for marriage company and marriage altars and ambitious scenesstill blotted here and there with florencealways florenceturned up so fast and so confusedly that he rose and went upstairs to escape them  it was quite late at night before candles were brought for at present they made mrs skewtons head ache she complained and in the meantime florence and mrs skewton talked together cleopatra being very anxious to keep her close to herself or florence touched the piano softly for mrs skewtons delight to make no mention of a few occasions in the course of the evening when that affectionate lady was impelled to solicit another kiss and which always happened after edith had said anything they were not many however for edith sat apart by an open window during the whole time in spite of her mothers fears that she would take cold and remained there until mr dombey took leave he was serenely gracious to florence when he did so and florence went to bed in a room within ediths so happy and hopeful that she thought of her late self as if it were some other poor deserted girl who was to be pitied for her sorrow and in her pity sobbed herself to sleep  the week fled fast there were drives to milliners dressmakers jewellers lawyers florists pastrycooks and florence was always of the party florence was to go to the wedding florence was to cast off her mourning and to wear a brilliant dress on the occasion the milliners intentions on the subject of this dressthe milliner was a frenchwoman and greatly resembled mrs skewtonwere so chaste and elegant that mrs skewton bespoke one like it for herself the milliner said it would become her to admiration and that all the world would take her for the young ladys sister  the week fled faster edith looked at nothing and cared for nothing her rich dresses came home and were tried on and were loudly commended by mrs skewton and the milliners and were put away without a word from her mrs skewton made their plans for every day and executed them sometimes edith sat in the carriage when they went to make purchases sometimes when it was absolutely necessary she went into the shops but mrs skewton conducted the whole business whatever it happened to be and edith looked on as uninterested and with as much apparent indifference as if she had no concern in it florence might perhaps have thought she was haughty and listless but that she was never so to her so florence quenched her wonder in her gratitude whenever it broke out and soon subdued it  the week fled faster it had nearly winged its flight away the last night of the week the night before the marriage was come in the dark roomfor mrs skewtons head was no better yet though she expected to recover permanently tomorrowwere that lady edith and mr dombey edith was at her open window looking out into the street mr dombey and cleopatra were talking softly on the sofa it was growing late and florence being fatigued had gone to bed  my dear dombey said cleopatra you will leave me florence tomorrow when you deprive me of my sweetest edith  mr dombey said he would with pleasure  to have her about me here while you are both at paris and to think at her age i am assisting in the formation of her mind my dear dombey said cleopatra will be a perfect balm to me in the extremely shattered state to which i shall be reduced  edith turned her head suddenly her listless manner was exchanged in a moment to one of burning interest and unseen in the darkness she attended closely to their conversation  mr dombey would be delighted to leave florence in such admirable guardianship  my dear dombey returned cleopatra a thousand thanks for your good opinion i feared you were going with malice aforethought as the dreadful lawyers saythose horrid prosesto condemn me to utter solitude  why do me so great an injustice my dear madam said mr dombey  because my charming florence tells me so positively she must go home tomorrow returned cleopatra that i began to be afraid my dearest dombey you were quite a bashaw  i assure you madam said mr dombey i have laid no commands on florence and if i had there are no commands like your wish  my dear dombey replied cleopatra what a courtier you are though ill not say so either for courtiers have no heart and yours pervades your farming life and character and are you really going so early my dear dombey  oh indeed it was late and mr dombey feared he must  is this a fact or is it all a dream lisped cleopatra can i believe my dearest dombey that you are coming back tomorrow morning to deprive me of my sweet companion my own edith  mr dombey who was accustomed to take things literally reminded mrs skewton that they were to meet first at the church  the pang said mrs skewton of consigning a child even to you my dear dombey is one of the most excruciating imaginable and combined with a naturally delicate constitution and the extreme stupidity of the pastrycook who has undertaken the breakfast is almost too much for my poor strength but i shall rally my dear dombey in the morning do not fear for me or be uneasy on my account heaven bless you my dearest edith she cried archly somebody is going pet  edith who had turned her head again towards the window and whose interest in their conversation had ceased rose up in her place but made no advance towards him and said nothing mr dombey with a lofty gallantry adapted to his dignity and the occasion betook his creaking boots towards her put her hand to his lips said tomorrow morning i shall have the happiness of claiming this hand as mrs dombeys and bowed himself solemnly out  mrs skewton rang for candles as soon as the housedoor had closed upon him with the candles appeared her maid with the juvenile dress that was to delude the world tomorrow the dress had savage retribution in it as such dresses ever have and made her infinitely older and more hideous than her greasy flannel gown but mrs skewton tried it on with mincing satisfaction smirked at her cadaverous self in the glass as she thought of its killing effect upon the major and suffering her maid to take it off again and to prepare her for repose tumbled into ruins like a house of painted cards  all this time edith remained at the dark window looking out into the street when she and her mother were at last left alone she moved from it for the first time that evening and came opposite to her the yawning shaking peevish figure of the mother with her eyes raised to confront the proud erect form of the daughter whose glance of fire was bent downward upon her had a conscious air upon it that no levity or temper could conceal  i am tired to death said she you cant be trusted for a moment you are worse than a child child no child would be half so obstinate and undutiful  listen to me mother returned edith passing these words by with a scorn that would not descend to trifle with them you must remain alone here until i return  must remain alone here edith until you return repeated her mother  or in that name upon which i shall call tomorrow to witness what i do so falsely and so shamefully i swear i will refuse the hand of this man in the church if i do not may i fall dead upon the pavement  the mother answered with a look of quick alarm in no degree diminished by the look she met  it is enough said edith steadily that we are what we are i will have no youth and truth dragged down to my level i will have no guileless nature undermined corrupted and perverted to amuse the leisure of a world of mothers you know my meaning florence must go home  you are an idiot edith cried her angry mother do you expect there can ever be peace for you in that house till she is married and away  ask me or ask yourself if i ever expect peace in that house said her daughter and you know the answer  and am i to be told tonight after all my pains and labour and when you are going through me to be rendered independent her mother almost shrieked in her passion while her palsied head shook like a leaf that there is corruption and contagion in me and that i am not fit company for a girl what are you pray what are you  i have put the question to myself said edith ashy pale and pointing to the window more than once when i have been sitting there and something in the faded likeness of my sex has wandered past outside and god knows i have met with my reply oh mother mother if you had but left me to my natural heart when i too was a girla younger girl than florencehow different i might have been  sensible that any show of anger was useless here her mother restrained herself and fell a whimpering and bewailed that she had lived too long and that her only child had cast her off and that duty towards parents was forgotten in these evil days and that she had heard unnatural taunts and cared for life no longer  if one is to go on living through continual scenes like this she whinedi am sure it would be much better for me to think of some means of putting an end to my existence oh the idea of your being my daughter edith and addressing me in such a strain  between us mother returned edith mournfully the time for mutual reproaches is past  then why do you revive it whimpered her mother you know that you are lacerating me in the cruellest manner you know how sensitive i am to unkindness at such a moment too when i have so much to think of and am naturally anxious to appear to the best advantage i wonder at you edith to make your mother a fright upon your weddingday  edith bent the same fixed look upon her as she sobbed and rubbed her eyes and said in the same low steady voice which had neither risen nor fallen since she first addressed her i have said that florence must go home  let her go cried the afflicted and affrighted parent hastily i am sure i am willing she should go what is the girl to me  she is so much to me that rather than communicate or suffer to be communicated to her one grain of the evil that is in my breast mother i would renounce you as i would if you gave me cause renounce him in the church tomorrow replied edith leave her alone she shall not while i can interpose be tampered with and tainted by the lessons i have learned this is no hard condition on this bitter night  if you had proposed it in a filial manner edith whined her mother perhaps not very likely not but such extremely cutting words  they are past and at an end between us now said edith take your own way mother share as you please in what you have gained spend enjoy make much of it and be as happy as you will the object of our lives is won henceforth let us wear it silently my lips are closed upon the past from this hour i forgive you your part in tomorrows wickedness may god forgive my own  without a tremor in her voice or frame and passing onward with a foot that set itself upon the neck of every soft emotion she bade her mother goodnight and repaired to her own room  but not to rest for there was no rest in the tumult of her agitation when alone to and fro and to and fro and to and fro again five hundred times among the splendid preparations for her adornment on the morrow with her dark hair shaken down her dark eyes flashing with a raging light her broad white bosom red with the cruel grasp of the relentless hand with which she spurned it from her pacing up and down with an averted head as if she would avoid the sight of her own fair person and divorce herself from its companionship thus in the dead time of the night before her bridal edith granger wrestled with her unquiet spirit tearless friendless silent proud and uncomplaining  at length it happened that she touched the open door which led into the room where florence lay  she started stopped and looked in  a light was burning there and showed her florence in her bloom of innocence and beauty fast asleep edith held her breath and felt herself drawn on towards her  drawn nearer nearer nearer yet at last drawn so near that stooping down she pressed her lips to the gentle hand that lay outside the bed and put it softly to her neck its touch was like the prophets rod of old upon the rock her tears sprung forth beneath it as she sunk upon her knees and laid her aching head and streaming hair upon the pillow by its side  thus edith granger passed the night before her bridal thus the sun found her on her bridal morning    chapter 31 the wedding   dawn with its passionless blank face steals shivering to the church beneath which lies the dust of little paul and his mother and looks in at the windows it is cold and dark night crouches yet upon the pavement and broods sombre and heavy in nooks and corners of the building the steepleclock perched up above the houses emerging from beneath another of the countless ripples in the tide of time that regularly roll and break on the eternal shore is greyly visible like a stone beacon recording how the sea flows on but within doors dawn at first can only peep at night and see that it is there  hovering feebly round the church and looking in dawn moans and weeps for its short reign and its tears trickle on the windowglass and the trees against the churchwall bow their heads and wring their many hands in sympathy night growing pale before it gradually fades out of the church but lingers in the vaults below and sits upon the coffins and now comes bright day burnishing the steepleclock and reddening the spire and drying up the tears of dawn and stifling its complaining and the dawn following the night and chasing it from its last refuge shrinks into the vaults itself and hides with a frightened face among the dead until night returns refreshed to drive it out  and now the mice who have been busier with the prayerbooks than their proper owners and with the hassocks more worn by their little teeth than by human knees hide their bright eyes in their holes and gather close together in affright at the resounding clashing of the churchdoor for the beadle that man of power comes early this morning with the sexton and mrs miff the wheezy little pewopenera mighty dry old lady sparely dressed with not an inch of fulness anywhere about heris also here and has been waiting at the churchgate halfanhour as her place is for the beadle  a vinegary face has mrs miff and a mortified bonnet and eke a thirsty soul for sixpences and shillings beckoning to stray people to come into pews has given mrs miff an air of mystery and there is reservation in the eye of mrs miff as always knowing of a softer seat but having her suspicions of the fee there is no such fact as mr miff nor has there been these twenty years and mrs miff would rather not allude to him he held some bad opinions it would seem about free seats and though mrs miff hopes he may be gone upwards she couldnt positively undertake to say so  busy is mrs miff this morning at the churchdoor beating and dusting the altarcloth the carpet and the cushions and much has mrs miff to say about the wedding they are going to have mrs miff is told that the new furniture and alterations in the house cost full five thousand pound if they cost a penny and mrs miff has heard upon the best authority that the lady hasnt got a sixpence wherewithal to bless herself mrs miff remembers like wise as if it had happened yesterday the first wifes funeral and then the christening and then the other funeral and mrs miff says bythebye shell soapandwater that ere tablet presently against the company arrive mr sownds the beadle who is sitting in the sun upon the church steps all this time and seldom does anything else except in cold weather sitting by the fire approves of mrs miffs discourse and asks if mrs miff has heard it said that the lady is uncommon handsome the information mrs miff has received being of this nature mr sownds the beadle who though orthodox and corpulent is still an admirer of female beauty observes with unction yes he hears she is a spankeran expression that seems somewhat forcible to mrs miff or would from any lips but those of mr sownds the beadle  in mr dombeys house at this same time there is great stir and bustle more especially among the women not one of whom has had a wink of sleep since four oclock and all of whom were fully dressed before six mr towlinson is an object of greater consideration than usual to the housemaid and the cook says at breakfast time that one wedding makes many which the housemaid cant believe and dont think true at all mr towlinson reserves his sentiments on this question being rendered something gloomy by the engagement of a foreigner with whiskers mr towlinson is whiskerless himself who has been hired to accompany the happy pair to paris and who is busy packing the new chariot in respect of this personage mr towlinson admits presently that he never knew of any good that ever come of foreigners and being charged by the ladies with prejudice says look at bonaparte who was at the head of em and see what he was always up to which the housemaid says is very true  the pastrycook is hard at work in the funereal room in brook street and the very tall young men are busy looking on one of the very tall young men already smells of sherry and his eyes have a tendency to become fixed in his head and to stare at objects without seeing them the very tall young man is conscious of this failing in himself and informs his comrade that its his exciseman the very tall young man would say excitement but his speech is hazy  the men who play the bells have got scent of the marriage and the marrowbones and cleavers too and a brass band too the first are practising in a back settlement near battlebridge the second put themselves in communication through their chief with mr towlinson to whom they offer terms to be bought off and the third in the person of an artful trombone lurks and dodges round the corner waiting for some traitor tradesman to reveal the place and hour of breakfast for a bribe expectation and excitement extend further yet and take a wider range from balls pond mr perch brings mrs perch to spend the day with mr dombeys servants and accompany them surreptitiously to see the wedding in mr tootss lodgings mr toots attires himself as if he were at least the bridegroom determined to behold the spectacle in splendour from a secret corner of the gallery and thither to convey the chicken for it is mr tootss desperate intent to point out florence to the chicken then and there and openly to say now chicken i will not deceive you any longer the friend i have sometimes mentioned to you is myself miss dombey is the object of my passion what are your opinions chicken in this state of things and what on the spot do you advise the somuchtobeastonished chicken in the meanwhile dips his beak into a tankard of strong beer in mr tootss kitchen and pecks up two pounds of beefsteaks in princesss place miss tox is up and doing for she too though in sore distress is resolved to put a shilling in the hands of mrs miff and see the ceremony which has a cruel fascination for her from some lonely corner the quarters of the wooden midshipman are all alive for captain cuttle in his anklejacks and with a huge shirtcollar is seated at his breakfast listening to rob the grinder as he reads the marriage service to him beforehand under orders to the end that the captain may perfectly understand the solemnity he is about to witness for which purpose the captain gravely lays injunctions on his chaplain from time to time to put about or to overhaul that ere article again or to stick to his own duty and leave the amens to him the captain one of which he repeats whenever a pause is made by rob the grinder with sonorous satisfaction  besides all this and much more twenty nurserymaids in mr dombeys street alone have promised twenty families of little women whose instinctive interest in nuptials dates from their cradles that they shall go and see the marriage truly mr sownds the beadle has good reason to feel himself in office as he suns his portly figure on the church steps waiting for the marriage hour truly mrs miff has cause to pounce on an unlucky dwarf child with a giant baby who peeps in at the porch and drive her forth with indignation  cousin feenix has come over from abroad expressly to attend the marriage cousin feenix was a man about town forty years ago but he is still so juvenile in figure and in manner and so well got up that strangers are amazed when they discover latent wrinkles in his lordships face and crows feet in his eyes and first observe him not exactly certain when he walks across a room of going quite straight to where he wants to go but cousin feenix getting up at halfpast seven oclock or so is quite another thing from cousin feenix got up and very dim indeed he looks while being shaved at longs hotel in bond street  mr dombey leaves his dressingroom amidst a general whisking away of the women on the staircase who disperse in all directions with a great rustling of skirts except mrs perch who being but that she always is in an interesting situation is not nimble and is obliged to face him and is ready to sink with confusion as she curtesysmay heaven avert all evil consequences from the house of perch mr dombey walks up to the drawingroom to bide his time gorgeous are mr dombeys new blue coat fawncoloured pantaloons and lilac waistcoat and a whisper goes about the house that mr dombeys hair is curled  a double knock announces the arrival of the major who is gorgeous too and wears a whole geranium in his buttonhole and has his hair curled tight and crisp as well the native knows  dombey says the major putting out both hands how are you  major says mr dombey how are you  by jove sir says the major joey b is in such case this morning sirand here he hits himself hard upon the breastin such case this morning sir that damme dombey he has half a mind to make a double marriage of it sir and take the mother  mr dombey smiles but faintly even for him for mr dombey feels that he is going to be related to the mother and that under those circumstances she is not to be joked about  dombey says the major seeing this i give you joy i congratulate you dombey by the lord sir says the major you are more to be envied this day than any man in england  here again mr dombeys assent is qualified because he is going to confer a great distinction on a lady and no doubt she is to be envied most  as to edith granger sir pursues the major there is not a woman in all europe but mightand would sir you will allow bagstock to addand wouldgive her ears and her earrings too to be in edith grangers place  you are good enough to say so major says mr dombey  dombey returns the major you know it let us have no false delicacy you know it do you know it or do you not dombey says the major almost in a passion  oh really major  damme sir retorts the major do you know that fact or do you not dombey is old joe your friend are we on that footing of unreserved intimacy dombey that may justify a mana blunt old joseph b sirin speaking out or am i to take open order dombey and to keep my distance and to stand on forms  my dear major bagstock says mr dombey with a gratified air you are quite warm  by gad sir says the major i am warm joseph b does not deny it dombey he is warm this is an occasion sir that calls forth all the honest sympathies remaining in an old infernal battered usedup invalided j b carcase and i tell you what dombeyat such a time a man must blurt out what he feels or put a muzzle on and joseph bagstock tells you to your face dombey as he tells his club behind your back that he never will be muzzled when paul dombey is in question now damme sir concludes the major with great firmness what do you make of that  major says mr dombey i assure you that i am really obliged to you i had no idea of checking your too partial friendship  not too partial sir exclaims the choleric major dombey i deny it  your friendship i will say then pursues mr dombey on any account nor can i forget major on such an occasion as the present how much i am indebted to it  dombey says the major with appropriate action that is the hand of joseph bagstock of plain old joey b sir if you like that better that is the hand of which his royal highness the late duke of york did me the honour to observe sir to his royal highness the late duke of kent that it was the hand of josh a rough and tough and possibly an uptosnuff old vagabond dombey may the present moment be the least unhappy of our lives god bless you  now enters mr carker gorgeous likewise and smiling like a weddingguest indeed he can scarcely let mr dombeys hand go he is so congratulatory and he shakes the majors hand so heartily at the same time that his voice shakes too in accord with his arms as it comes sliding from between his teeth  the very day is auspicious says mr carker the brightest and most genial weather i hope i am not a moment late  punctual to your time sir says the major  i am rejoiced i am sure says mr carker i was afraid i might be a few seconds after the appointed time for i was delayed by a procession of waggons and i took the liberty of riding round to brook streetthis to mr dombeyto leave a few poor rarities of flowers for mrs dombey a man in my position and so distinguished as to be invited here is proud to offer some homage in acknowledgment of his vassalage and as i have no doubt mrs dombey is overwhelmed with what is costly and magnificent with a strange glance at his patron i hope the very poverty of my offering may find favour for it  mrs dombey that is to be returns mr dombey condescendingly will be very sensible of your attention carker i am sure  and if she is to be mrs dombey this morning sir says the major putting down his coffeecup and looking at his watch its high time we were off  forth in a barouche ride mr dombey major bagstock and mr carker to the church mr sownds the beadle has long risen from the steps and is in waiting with his cocked hat in his hand mrs miff curtseys and proposes chairs in the vestry mr dombey prefers remaining in the church as he looks up at the organ miss tox in the gallery shrinks behind the fat leg of a cherubim on a monument with cheeks like a young wind captain cuttle on the contrary stands up and waves his hook in token of welcome and encouragement mr toots informs the chicken behind his hand that the middle gentleman he in the fawncoloured pantaloons is the father of his love the chicken hoarsely whispers mr toots that hes as stiff a cove as ever he see but that it is within the resources of science to double him up with one blow in the waistcoat  mr sownds and mrs miff are eyeing mr dombey from a little distance when the noise of approaching wheels is heard and mr sownds goes out mrs miff meeting mr dombeys eye as it is withdrawn from the presumptuous maniac upstairs who salutes him with so much urbanity drops a curtsey and informs him that she believes his good lady is come then there is a crowding and a whispering at the door and the good lady enters with a haughty step  there is no sign upon her face of last nights suffering there is no trace in her manner of the woman on the bended knees reposing her wild head in beautiful abandonment upon the pillow of the sleeping girl that girl all gentle and lovely is at her sidea striking contrast to her own disdainful and defiant figure standing there composed erect inscrutable of will resplendent and majestic in the zenith of its charms yet beating down and treading on the admiration that it challenges  there is a pause while mr sownds the beadle glides into the vestry for the clergyman and clerk at this juncture mrs skewton speaks to mr dombey more distinctly and emphatically than her custom is and moving at the same time close to edith  my dear dombey said the good mama i fear i must relinquish darling florence after all and suffer her to go home as she herself proposed after my loss of today my dear dombey i feel i shall not have spirits even for her society  had she not better stay with you returns the bridegroom  i think not my dear dombey no i think not i shall be better alone besides my dearest edith will be her natural and constant guardian when you return and i had better not encroach upon her trust perhaps she might be jealous eh dear edith  the affectionate mama presses her daughters arm as she says this perhaps entreating her attention earnestly  to be serious my dear dombey she resumes i will relinquish our dear child and not inflict my gloom upon her we have settled that just now she fully understands dear dombey edith my dearshe fully understands  again the good mother presses her daughters arm mr dombey offers no additional remonstrance for the clergyman and clerk appear and mrs miff and mr sownds the beadle group the party in their proper places at the altar rails  the sun is shining down upon the golden letters of the ten commandments why does the brides eye read them one by one which one of all the ten appears the plainest to her in the glare of light false gods murder theft the honour that she owes her motherwhich is it that appears to leave the wall and printing itself in glowing letters on her book  who giveth this woman to be married to this man  cousin feenix does that he has come from badenbaden on purpose confound it cousin feenix saysgoodnatured creature cousin feenixwhen we do get a rich city fellow into the family let us show him some attention let us do something for him i give this woman to be married to this man saith cousin feenix therefore cousin feenix meaning to go in a straight line but turning off sideways by reason of his wilful legs gives the wrong woman to be married to this man at firstto wit a bridesmaid of some condition distantly connected with the family and ten years mrs skewtons juniorbut mrs miff interposing her mortified bonnet dexterously turns him back and runs him as on castors full at the good lady whom cousin feenix giveth to married to this man accordingly and will they in the sight of heaven ay that they will mr dombey says he will and what says edith she will so from that day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till death do them part they plight their troth to one another and are married in a firm free hand the bride subscribes her name in the register when they adjourn to the vestry there aint a many ladies come here mrs miff says with a curtseyto look at mrs miff at such a season is to make her mortified bonnet go down with a dipwrites their names like this good lady mr sownds the beadle thinks it is a truly spanking signature and worthy of the writerthis however between himself and conscience florence signs too but unapplauded for her hand shakes all the party sign cousin feenix last who puts his noble name into a wrong place and enrols himself as having been born that morning the major now salutes the bride right gallantly and carries out that branch of military tactics in reference to all the ladies notwithstanding mrs skewtons being extremely hard to kiss and squeaking shrilly in the sacred edifice the example is followed by cousin feenix and even by mr dombey lastly mr carker with his white teeth glistening approaches edith more as if he meant to bite her than to taste the sweets that linger on her lips  there is a glow upon her proud cheek and a flashing in her eyes that may be meant to stay him but it does not for he salutes her as the rest have done and wishes her all happiness  if wishes says he in a low voice are not superfluous applied to such a union  i thank you sir she answers with a curled lip and a heaving bosom  but does edith feel still as on the night when she knew that mr dombey would return to offer his alliance that carker knows her thoroughly and reads her right and that she is more degraded by his knowledge of her than by aught else is it for this reason that her haughtiness shrinks beneath his smile like snow within the hands that grasps it firmly and that her imperious glance droops in meeting his and seeks the ground  i am proud to see said mr carker with a servile stooping of his neck which the revelations making by his eyes and teeth proclaim to be a lie i am proud to see that my humble offering is graced by mrs dombeys hand and permitted to hold so favoured a place in so joyful an occasion  though she bends her head in answer there is something in the momentary action of her hand as if she would crush the flowers it holds and fling them with contempt upon the ground but she puts the hand through the arm of her new husband who has been standing near conversing with the major and is proud again and motionless and silent  the carriages are once more at the church door mr dombey with his bride upon his arm conducts her through the twenty families of little women who are on the steps and every one of whom remembers the fashion and the colour of her every article of dress from that moment and reproduces it on her doll who is for ever being married cleopatra and cousin feenix enter the same carriage the major hands into a second carriage florence and the bridesmaid who so narrowly escaped being given away by mistake and then enters it himself and is followed by mr carker horses prance and caper coachmen and footmen shine in fluttering favours flowers and newmade liveries away they dash and rattle through the streets and as they pass along a thousand heads are turned to look at them and a thousand sober moralists revenge themselves for not being married too that morning by reflecting that these people little think such happiness cant last  miss tox emerges from behind the cherubims leg when all is quiet and comes slowly down from the gallery miss toxs eyes are red and her pockethandkerchief is damp she is wounded but not exasperated and she hopes they may be happy she quite admits to herself the beauty of the bride and her own comparatively feeble and faded attractions but the stately image of mr dombey in his lilac waistcoat and his fawncoloured pantaloons is present to her mind and miss tox weeps afresh behind her veil on her way home to princesss place captain cuttle having joined in all the amens and responses with a devout growl feels much improved by his religious exercises and in a peaceful frame of mind pervades the body of the church glazed hat in hand and reads the tablet to the memory of little paul the gallant mr toots attended by the faithful chicken leaves the building in torments of love the chicken is as yet unable to elaborate a scheme for winning florence but his first idea has gained possession of him and he thinks the doubling up of mr dombey would be a move in the right direction mr dombeys servants come out of their hidingplaces and prepare to rush to brook street when they are delayed by symptoms of indisposition on the part of mrs perch who entreats a glass of water and becomes alarming mrs perch gets better soon however and is borne away and mrs miff and mr sownds the beadle sit upon the steps to count what they have gained by the affair and talk it over while the sexton tolls a funeral  now the carriages arrive at the brides residence and the players on the bells begin to jingle and the band strikes up and mr punch that model of connubial bliss salutes his wife now the people run and push and press round in a gaping throng while mr dombey leading mrs dombey by the hand advances solemnly into the feenix halls now the rest of the wedding party alight and enter after them and why does mr carker passing through the people to the halldoor think of the old woman who called to him in the grove that morning or why does florence as she passes think with a tremble of her childhood when she was lost and of the visage of good mrs brown  now there are more congratulations on this happiest of days and more company though not much and now they leave the drawingroom and range themselves at table in the darkbrown diningroom which no confectioner can brighten up let him garnish the exhausted negroes with as many flowers and loveknots as he will  the pastrycook has done his duty like a man though and a rich breakfast is set forth mr and mrs chick have joined the party among others mrs chick admires that edith should be by nature such a perfect dombey and is affable and confidential to mrs skewton whose mind is relieved of a great load and who takes her share of the champagne the very tall young man who suffered from excitement early is better but a vague sentiment of repentance has seized upon him and he hates the other very tall young man and wrests dishes from him by violence and takes a grim delight in disobliging the company the company are cool and calm and do not outrage the black hatchments of pictures looking down upon them by any excess of mirth cousin feenix and the major are the gayest there but mr carker has a smile for the whole table he has an especial smile for the bride who very very seldom meets it  cousin feenix rises when the company have breakfasted and the servants have left the room and wonderfully young he looks with his white wristbands almost covering his hands otherwise rather bony and the bloom of the champagne in his cheeks  upon my honour says cousin feenix although its an unusual sort of thing in a private gentlemans house i must beg leave to call upon you to drink what is usually called ain fact a toast  the major very hoarsely indicates his approval mr carker bending his head forward over the table in the direction of cousin feenix smiles and nods a great many times  ain fact its not a cousin feenix beginning again thus comes to a dead stop  hear hear says the major in a tone of conviction  mr carker softly claps his hands and bending forward over the table again smiles and nods a great many more times than before as if he were particularly struck by this last observation and desired personally to express his sense of the good it has done  it is says cousin feenix an occasion in fact when the general usages of life may be a little departed from without impropriety and although i never was an orator in my life and when i was in the house of commons and had the honour of seconding the address wasin fact was laid up for a fortnight with the consciousness of failure  the major and mr carker are so much delighted by this fragment of personal history that cousin feenix laughs and addressing them individually goes on to say  and in point of fact when i was devilish illstill you know i feel that a duty devolves upon me and when a duty devolves upon an englishman he is bound to get out of it in my opinion in the best way he can well our family has had the gratification today of connecting itself in the person of my lovely and accomplished relative whom i now seein point of fact present  here there is general applause  present repeats cousin feenix feeling that it is a neat point which will bear repetitionwith one whothat is to say with a man at whom the finger of scorn can neverin fact with my honourable friend dombey if he will allow me to call him so  cousin feenix bows to mr dombey mr dombey solemnly returns the bow everybody is more or less gratified and affected by this extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented appeal to the feelings  i have not says cousin feenix enjoyed those opportunities which i could have desired of cultivating the acquaintance of my friend dombey and studying those qualities which do equal honour to his head and in point of fact to his heart for it has been my misfortune to be as we used to say in my time in the house of commons when it was not the custom to allude to the lords and when the order of parliamentary proceedings was perhaps better observed than it is nowto be inin point of fact says cousin feenix cherishing his joke with great slyness and finally bringing it out with a jerk in another place  the major falls into convulsions and is recovered with difficulty  but i know sufficient of my friend dombey resumes cousin feenix in a graver tone as if he had suddenly become a sadder and wiser man to know that he is in point of fact what may be emphatically called aa merchanta british merchantand aand a man and although i have been resident abroad for some years it would give me great pleasure to receive my friend dombey and everybody here at badenbaden and to have an opportunity of making em known to the grand duke still i know enough i flatter myself of my lovely and accomplished relative to know that she possesses every requisite to make a man happy and that her marriage with my friend dombey is one of inclination and affection on both sides  many smiles and nods from mr carker  therefore says cousin feenix i congratulate the family of which i am a member on the acquisition of my friend dombey i congratulate my friend dombey on his union with my lovely and accomplished relative who possesses every requisite to make a man happy and i take the liberty of calling on you all in point of fact to congratulate both my friend dombey and my lovely and accomplished relative on the present occasion  the speech of cousin feenix is received with great applause and mr dombey returns thanks on behalf of himself and mrs dombey j b shortly afterwards proposes mrs skewton the breakfast languishes when that is done the violated hatchments are avenged and edith rises to assume her travelling dress  all the servants in the meantime have been breakfasting below champagne has grown too common among them to be mentioned and roast fowls raised pies and lobstersalad have become mere drugs the very tall young man has recovered his spirits and again alludes to the exciseman his comrades eye begins to emulate his own and he too stares at objects without taking cognizance thereof there is a general redness in the faces of the ladies in the face of mrs perch particularly who is joyous and beaming and lifted so far above the cares of life that if she were asked just now to direct a wayfarer to balls pond where her own cares lodge she would have some difficulty in recalling the way mr towlinson has proposed the happy pair to which the silverheaded butler has responded neatly and with emotion for he half begins to think he is an old retainer of the family and that he is bound to be affected by these changes the whole party and especially the ladies are very frolicsome mr dombeys cook who generally takes the lead in society has said it is impossible to settle down after this and why not go in a party to the play everybody mrs perch included has agreed to this even the native who is tigerish in his drink and who alarms the ladies mrs perch particularly by the rolling of his eyes one of the very tall young men has even proposed a ball after the play and it presents itself to no one mrs perch included in the light of an impossibility words have arisen between the housemaid and mr towlinson she on the authority of an old saw asserting marriages to be made in heaven he affecting to trace the manufacture elsewhere he supposing that she says so because she thinks of being married her own self she saying lord forbid at any rate that she should ever marry him to calm these flying taunts the silverheaded butler rises to propose the health of mr towlinson whom to know is to esteem and to esteem is to wish well settled in life with the object of his choice wherever here the silverheaded butler eyes the housemaid she may be mr towlinson returns thanks in a speech replete with feeling of which the peroration turns on foreigners regarding whom he says they may find favour sometimes with weak and inconstant intellects that can be led away by hair but all he hopes is he may never hear of no foreigner never boning nothing out of no travelling chariot the eye of mr towlinson is so severe and so expressive here that the housemaid is turning hysterical when she and all the rest roused by the intelligence that the bride is going away hurry upstairs to witness her departure  the chariot is at the door the bride is descending to the hall where mr dombey waits for her florence is ready on the staircase to depart too and miss nipper who has held a middle state between the parlour and the kitchen is prepared to accompany her as edith appears florence hastens towards her to bid her farewell  is edith cold that she should tremble is there anything unnatural or unwholesome in the touch of florence that the beautiful form recedes and contracts as if it could not bear it is there so much hurry in this going away that edith with a wave of her hand sweeps on and is gone  mrs skewton overpowered by her feelings as a mother sinks on her sofa in the cleopatra attitude when the clatter of the chariot wheels is lost and sheds several tears the major coming with the rest of the company from table endeavours to comfort her but she will not be comforted on any terms and so the major takes his leave cousin feenix takes his leave and mr carker takes his leave the guests all go away cleopatra left alone feels a little giddy from her strong emotion and falls asleep  giddiness prevails below stairs too the very tall young man whose excitement came on so soon appears to have his head glued to the table in the pantry and cannot be detached fromit a violent revulsion has taken place in the spirits of mrs perch who is low on account of mr perch and tells cook that she fears he is not so much attached to his home as he used to be when they were only nine in family mr towlinson has a singing in his ears and a large wheel going round and round inside his head the housemaid wishes it wasnt wicked to wish that one was dead  there is a general delusion likewise in these lower regions on the subject of time everybody conceiving that it ought to be at the earliest ten oclock at night whereas it is not yet three in the afternoon a shadowy idea of wickedness committed haunts every individual in the party and each one secretly thinks the other a companion in guilt whom it would be agreeable to avoid no man or woman has the hardihood to hint at the projected visit to the play anyone reviving the notion of the ball would be scouted as a malignant idiot  mrs skewton sleeps upstairs two hours afterwards and naps are not yet over in the kitchen the hatchments in the diningroom look down on crumbs dirty plates spillings of wine halfthawed ice stale discoloured heeltaps scraps of lobster drumsticks of fowls and pensive jellies gradually resolving themselves into a lukewarm gummy soup the marriage is by this time almost as denuded of its show and garnish as the breakfast mr dombeys servants moralise so much about it and are so repentant over their early tea at home that by eight oclock or so they settle down into confirmed seriousness and mr perch arriving at that time from the city fresh and jocular with a white waistcoat and a comic song ready to spend the evening and prepared for any amount of dissipation is amazed to find himself coldly received and mrs perch but poorly and to have the pleasing duty of escorting that lady home by the next omnibus  night closes in florence having rambled through the handsome house from room to room seeks her own chamber where the care of edith has surrounded her with luxuries and comforts and divesting herself of her handsome dress puts on her old simple mourning for dear paul and sits down to read with diogenes winking and blinking on the ground beside her but florence cannot read tonight the house seems strange and new and there are loud echoes in it there is a shadow on her heart she knows not why or what but it is heavy florence shuts her book and gruff diogenes who takes that for a signal puts his paws upon her lap and rubs his ears against her caressing hands but florence cannot see him plainly in a little time for there is a mist between her eyes and him and her dead brother and dead mother shine in it like angels walter too poor wandering shipwrecked boy oh where is he  the major dont know thats for certain and dont care the major having choked and slumbered all the afternoon has taken a late dinner at his club and now sits over his pint of wine driving a modest young man with a freshcoloured face at the next table who would give a handsome sum to be able to rise and go away but cannot do it to the verge of madness by anecdotes of bagstock sir at dombeys wedding and old joes devilish gentle manly friend lord feenix while cousin feenix who ought to be at longs and in bed finds himself instead at a gamingtable where his wilful legs have taken him perhaps in his own despite  night like a giant fills the church from pavement to roof and holds dominion through the silent hours pale dawn again comes peeping through the windows and giving place to day sees night withdraw into the vaults and follows it and drives it out and hides among the dead the timid mice again cower close together when the great door clashes and mr sownds and mrs miff treading the circle of their daily lives unbroken as a marriage ring come in again the cocked hat and the mortified bonnet stand in the background at the marriage hour and again this man taketh this woman and this woman taketh this man on the solemn terms  to have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish until death do them part  the very words that mr carker rides into town repeating with his mouth stretched to the utmost as he picks his dainty way    chapter 32 the wooden midshipman goes to pieces   honest captain cuttle as the weeks flew over him in his fortified retreat by no means abated any of his prudent provisions against surprise because of the nonappearance of the enemy the captain argued that his present security was too profound and wonderful to endure much longer he knew that when the wind stood in a fair quarter the weathercock was seldom nailed there and he was too well acquainted with the determined and dauntless character of mrs macstinger to doubt that that heroic woman had devoted herself to the task of his discovery and capture trembling beneath the weight of these reasons captain cuttle lived a very close and retired life seldom stirring abroad until after dark venturing even then only into the obscurest streets never going forth at all on sundays and both within and without the walls of his retreat avoiding bonnets as if they were worn by raging lions  the captain never dreamed that in the event of his being pounced upon by mrs macstinger in his walks it would be possible to offer resistance he felt that it could not be done he saw himself in his minds eye put meekly in a hackneycoach and carried off to his old lodgings he foresaw that once immured there he was a lost man his hat gone mrs macstinger watchful of him day and night reproaches heaped upon his head before the infant family himself the guilty object of suspicion and distrust an ogre in the childrens eyes and in their mothers a detected traitor  a violent perspiration and a lowness of spirits always came over the captain as this gloomy picture presented itself to his imagination it generally did so previous to his stealing out of doors at night for air and exercise sensible of the risk he ran the captain took leave of rob at those times with the solemnity which became a man who might never return exhorting him in the event of his the captains being lost sight of for a time to tread in the paths of virtue and keep the brazen instruments well polished  but not to throw away a chance and to secure to himself a means in case of the worst of holding communication with the external world captain cuttle soon conceived the happy idea of teaching rob the grinder some secret signal by which that adherent might make his presence and fidelity known to his commander in the hour of adversity after much cogitation the captain decided in favour of instructing him to whistle the marine melody oh cheerily cheerily and rob the grinder attaining a point as near perfection in that accomplishment as a landsman could hope to reach the captain impressed these mysterious instructions on his mind  now my lad stand by if ever im took  took captain interposed rob with his round eyes wide open  ah said captain cuttle darkly if ever i goes away meaning to come back to supper and dont come within hail again twentyfour hours arter my loss go you to brig place and whistle that ere tune near my old mooringsnot as if you was a meaning of it you understand but as if youd drifted there promiscuous if i answer in that tune you sheer off my lad and come back fourandtwenty hours arterwards if i answer in another tune do you stand off and on and wait till i throw out further signals do you understand them orders now  what am i to stand off and on of captain inquired rob the horseroad  heres a smart lad for you cried the captain eyeing him sternly as dont know his own native alphabet go away a bit and come back again alternatedye understand that  yes captain said rob  very good my lad then said the captain relenting do it  that he might do it the better captain cuttle sometimes condescended of an evening after the shop was shut to rehearse this scene retiring into the parlour for the purpose as into the lodgings of a supposititious macstinger and carefully observing the behaviour of his ally from the hole of espial he had cut in the wall rob the grinder discharged himself of his duty with so much exactness and judgment when thus put to the proof that the captain presented him at divers times with seven sixpences in token of satisfaction and gradually felt stealing over his spirit the resignation of a man who had made provision for the worst and taken every reasonable precaution against an unrelenting fate  nevertheless the captain did not tempt illfortune by being a whit more venturesome than before though he considered it a point of good breeding in himself as a general friend of the family to attend mr dombeys wedding of which he had heard from mr perch and to show that gentleman a pleasant and approving countenance from the gallery he had repaired to the church in a hackney cabriolet with both windows up and might have scrupled even to make that venture in his dread of mrs macstinger but that the ladys attendance on the ministry of the reverend melchisedech rendered it peculiarly unlikely that she would be found in communion with the establishment  the captain got safe home again and fell into the ordinary routine of his new life without encountering any more direct alarm from the enemy than was suggested to him by the daily bonnets in the street but other subjects began to lay heavy on the captains mind walters ship was still unheard of no news came of old sol gills florence did not even know of the old mans disappearance and captain cuttle had not the heart to tell her indeed the captain as his own hopes of the generous handsome gallanthearted youth whom he had loved according to his rough manner from a child began to fade and faded more and more from day to day shrunk with instinctive pain from the thought of exchanging a word with florence if he had had good news to carry to her the honest captain would have braved the newly decorated house and splendid furniturethough these connected with the lady he had seen at church were awful to himand made his way into her presence with a dark horizon gathering around their common hopes however that darkened every hour the captain almost felt as if he were a new misfortune and affliction to her and was scarcely less afraid of a visit from florence than from mrs macstinger herself  it was a chill dark autumn evening and captain cuttle had ordered a fire to be kindled in the little back parlour now more than ever like the cabin of a ship the rain fell fast and the wind blew hard and straying out on the housetop by that stormy bedroom of his old friend to take an observation of the weather the captains heart died within him when he saw how wild and desolate it was not that he associated the weather of that time with poor walters destiny or doubted that if providence had doomed him to be lost and shipwrecked it was over long ago but that beneath an outward influence quite distinct from the subjectmatter of his thoughts the captains spirits sank and his hopes turned pale as those of wiser men had often done before him and will often do again  captain cuttle addressing his face to the sharp wind and slanting rain looked up at the heavy scud that was flying fast over the wilderness of housetops and looked for something cheery there in vain the prospect near at hand was no better in sundry teachests and other rough boxes at his feet the pigeons of rob the grinder were cooing like so many dismal breezes getting up a crazy weathercock of a midshipman with a telescope at his eye once visible from the street but long bricked out creaked and complained upon his rusty pivot as the shrill blast spun him round and round and sported with him cruelly upon the captains coarse blue vest the cold raindrops started like steel beads and he could hardly maintain himself aslant against the stiff norwester that came pressing against him importunate to topple him over the parapet and throw him on the pavement below if there were any hope alive that evening the captain thought as he held his hat on it certainly kept house and wasnt out of doors so the captain shaking his head in a despondent manner went in to look for it  captain cuttle descended slowly to the little back parlour and seated in his accustomed chair looked for it in the fire but it was not there though the fire was bright he took out his tobaccobox and pipe and composing himself to smoke looked for it in the red glow from the bowl and in the wreaths of vapour that curled upward from his lips but there was not so much as an atom of the rust of hopes anchor in either he tried a glass of grog but melancholy truth was at the bottom of that well and he couldnt finish it he made a turn or two in the shop and looked for hope among the instruments but they obstinately worked out reckonings for the missing ship in spite of any opposition he could offer that ended at the bottom of the lone sea  the wind still rushing and the rain still pattering against the closed shutters the captain brought to before the wooden midshipman upon the counter and thought as he dried the little officers uniform with his sleeve how many years the midshipman had seen during which few changeshardly anyhad transpired among his ships company how the changes had come all together one day as it might be and of what a sweeping kind they web here was the little society of the back parlour broken up and scattered far and wide here was no audience for lovely peg even if there had been anybody to sing it which there was not for the captain was as morally certain that nobody but he could execute that ballad he was that he had not the spirit under existing circumstances to attempt it there was no bright face of walr in the househere the captain transferred his sleeve for a moment from the midshipmans uniform to his own cheekthe familiar wig and buttons of sol gills were a vision of the past richard whittington was knocked on the head and every plan and project in connexion with the midshipman lay drifting without mast or rudder on the waste of waters  as the captain with a dejected face stood revolving these thoughts and polishing the midshipman partly in the tenderness of old acquaintance and partly in the absence of his mind a knocking at the shopdoor communicated a frightful start to the frame of rob the grinder seated on the counter whose large eyes had been intently fixed on the captains face and who had been debating within himself for the five hundredth time whether the captain could have done a murder that he had such an evil conscience and was always running away  whats that said captain cuttle softly  somebodys knuckles captain answered rob the grinder  the captain with an abashed and guilty air immediately walked on tiptoe to the little parlour and locked himself in rob opening the door would have parleyed with the visitor on the threshold if the visitor had come in female guise but the figure being of the male sex and robs orders only applying to women rob held the door open and allowed it to enter which it did very quickly glad to get out of the driving rain  a job for burgess and co at any rate said the visitor looking over his shoulder compassionately at his own legs which were very wet and covered with splashes oh howdedo mr gills  the salutation was addressed to the captain now emerging from the back parlour with a most transparent and utterly futile affectation of coming out by accidence  thankee the gentleman went on to say in the same breath im very well indeed myself im much obliged to you my name is tootsmister toots  the captain remembered to have seen this young gentleman at the wedding and made him a bow mr toots replied with a chuckle and being embarrassed as he generally was breathed hard shook hands with the captain for a long time and then falling on rob the grinder in the absence of any other resource shook hands with him in a most affectionate and cordial manner  i say i should like to speak a word to you mr gills if you please said toots at length with surprising presence of mind i say miss dom you know  the captain with responsive gravity and mystery immediately waved his hook towards the little parlour whither mr toots followed him  oh i beg your pardon though said mr toots looking up in the captains face as he sat down in a chair by the fire which the captain placed for him you dont happen to know the chicken at all do you mr gills  the chicken said the captain  the game chicken said mr toots  the captain shaking his head mr toots explained that the man alluded to was the celebrated public character who had covered himself and his country with glory in his contest with the nobby shropshire one but this piece of information did not appear to enlighten the captain very much  because hes outside thats all said mr toots but its of no consequence he wont get very wet perhaps  i can pass the word for him in a moment said the captain  well if you would have the goodness to let him sit in the shop with your young man chuckled mr toots i should be glad because you know hes easily offended and the damps rather bad for his stamina ill call him in mr gills  with that mr toots repairing to the shopdoor sent a peculiar whistle into the night which produced a stoical gentleman in a shaggy white greatcoat and a flatbrimmed hat with very short hair a broken nose and a considerable tract of bare and sterile country behind each ear  sit down chicken said mr toots  the compliant chicken spat out some small pieces of straw on which he was regaling himself and took in a fresh supply from a reserve he carried in his hand  there aint no drain of nothing short handy is there said the chicken generally this here sluicing night is hard lines to a man as lives on his condition  captain cuttle proffered a glass of rum which the chicken throwing back his head emptied into himself as into a cask after proposing the brief sentiment towards us mr toots and the captain returning then to the parlour and taking their seats before the fire mr toots began  mr gills  awast said the captain my names cuttle  mr toots looked greatly disconcerted while the captain proceeded gravely  capen cuttle is my name and england is my nation this here is my dwellingplace and blessed be creationjob said the captain as an index to his authority  oh i couldnt see mr gills could i said mr toots because  if you could see sol gills young genlmn said the captain impressively and laying his heavy hand on mr tootss knee old sol mind youwith your own eyesas you sit thereyoud be welcomer to me than a wind astern to a ship becalmed but you cant see sol gills and why cant you see sol gills said the captain apprised by the face of mr toots that he was making a profound impression on that gentlemans mind because hes inwisible  mr toots in his agitation was going to reply that it was of no consequence at all but he corrected himself and said lor bless me  that there man said the captain has left me in charge here by a piece of writing but though he was amost as good as my sworn brother i know no more where hes gone or why hes gone if so be to seek his nevy or if so be along of being not quite settled in his mind than you do one morning at daybreak he went over the side said the captain without a splash without a ripple i have looked for that man high and low and never set eyes nor ears nor nothing else upon him from that hour  but good gracious miss dombey dont know mr toots began  why i ask you as a feeling heart said the captain dropping his voice why should she know why should she be made to know until such time as there wamt any help for it she took to old sol gills did that sweet creetur with a kindness with a affability with awhats the good of saying so you know her  i should hope so chuckled mr toots with a conscious blush that suffused his whole countenance  and you come here from her said the captain  i should think so chuckled mr toots  then all i need observe is said the captain that you know a angel and are chartered a angel  mr toots instantly seized the captains hand and requested the favour of his friendship  upon my word and honour said mr toots earnestly i should be very much obliged to you if youd improve my acquaintance i should like to know you captain very much i really am in want of a friend i am little dombey was my friend at old blimbers and would have been now if hed have lived the chicken said mr toots in a forlorn whisper is very welladmirable in his waythe sharpest man perhaps in the world theres not a move he isnt up to everybody says sobut i dont knowhes not everything so she is an angel captain if there is an angel anywhere its miss dombey thats what ive always said really though you know said mr toots i should be very much obliged to you if youd cultivate my acquaintance  captain cuttle received this proposal in a polite manner but still without committing himself to its acceptance merely observing ay ay my lad we shall see we shall see and reminding mr toots of his immediate mission by inquiring to what he was indebted for the honour of that visit  why the fact is replied mr toots that its the young woman i come from not miss dombeysusan you know  the captain nodded his head once with a grave expression of face indicative of his regarding that young woman with serious respect  and ill tell you how it happens said mr toots you know i go and call sometimes on miss dombey i dont go there on purpose you know but i happen to be in the neighbourhood very often and when i find myself there whywhy i call  natrally observed the captain  yes said mr toots i called this afternoon upon my word and honour i dont think its possible to form an idea of the angel miss dombey was this afternoon  the captain answered with a jerk of his head implying that it might not be easy to some people but was quite so to him  as i was coming out said mr toots the young woman in the most unexpected manner took me into the pantry  the captain seemed for the moment to object to this proceeding and leaning back in his chair looked at mr toots with a distrustful if not threatening visage  where she brought out said mr toots this newspaper she told me that she had kept it from miss dombey all day on account of something that was in it about somebody that she and dombey used to know and then she read the passage to me very well then she saidwait a minute what was it she said though  mr toots endeavouring to concentrate his mental powers on this question unintentionally fixed the captains eye and was so much discomposed by its stern expression that his difficulty in resuming the thread of his subject was enhanced to a painful extent  oh said mr toots after long consideration oh ah yes she said that she hoped there was a bare possibility that it mightnt be true and that as she couldnt very well come out herself without surprising miss dombey would i go down to mr solomon gills the instrumentmakers in this street who was the partys uncle and ask whether he believed it was true or had heard anything else in the city she said if he couldnt speak to me no doubt captain cuttle could by the bye said mr toots as the discovery flashed upon him you you know  the captain glanced at the newspaper in mr tootss hand and breathed short and hurriedly  well pursued mr toots the reason why im rather late is because i went up as far as finchley first to get some uncommonly fine chickweed that grows there for miss dombeys bird but i came on here directly afterwards youve seen the paper i suppose  the captain who had become cautious of reading the news lest he should find himself advertised at full length by mrs macstinger shook his head  shall i read the passage to you inquired mr toots  the captain making a sign in the affirmative mr toots read as follows from the shipping intelligence  southampton the barque defiance henry james commander arrived in this port today with a cargo of sugar coffee and rum reports that being becalmed on the sixth day of her passage home from jamaica inin such and such a latitude you know said mr toots after making a feeble dash at the figures and tumbling over them  ay cried the captain striking his clenched hand on the table heave ahead my lad  latitude repeated mr toots with a startled glance at the captain and longitude soandsothe lookout observed half an hour before sunset some fragments of a wreck drifting at about the distance of a mile the weather being clear and the barque making no way a boat was hoisted out with orders to inspect the same when they were found to consist of sundry large spars and a part of the main rigging of an english brig of about five hundred tons burden together with a portion of the stem on which the words and letters son and h were yet plainly legible no vestige of any dead body was to be seen upon the floating fragments log of the defiance states that a breeze springing up in the night the wreck was seen no more there can be no doubt that all surmises as to the fate of the missing vessel the son and heir port of london bound for barbados are now set at rest for ever that she broke up in the last hurricane and that every soul on board perished  captain cuttle like all mankind little knew how much hope had survived within him under discouragement until he felt its deathshock during the reading of the paragraph and for a minute or two afterwards he sat with his gaze fixed on the modest mr toots like a man entranced then suddenly rising and putting on his glazed hat which in his visitors honour he had laid upon the table the captain turned his back and bent his head down on the little chimneypiece  oh upon my word and honour cried mr toots whose tender heart was moved by the captains unexpected distress this is a most wretched sort of affair this world is somebodys always dying or going and doing something uncomfortable in it im sure i never should have looked forward so much to coming into my property if i had known this i never saw such a world its a great deal worse than blimbers  captain cuttle without altering his position signed to mr toots not to mind him and presently turned round with his glazed hat thrust back upon his ears and his hand composing and smoothing his brown face  walr my dear lad said the captain farewell walr my child my boy and man i loved you he warnt my flesh and blood said the captain looking at the firei aint got nonebut something of what a father feels when he loses a son i feel in losing walr for why said the captain because it aint one loss but a round dozen wheres that there young schoolboy with the rosy face and curly hair that used to be as merry in this here parlour come round every week as a piece of music gone down with walr wheres that there fresh lad that nothing couldnt tire nor put out and that sparkled up and blushed so when we joked him about hearts delight that he was beautiful to look at gone down with walr wheres that there mans spirit all afire that wouldnt see the old man hove down for a minute and cared nothing for itself gone down with walr it aint one walr there was a dozen walrs that i knowd and loved all holding round his neck when he went down and theyre aholding round mine now  mr toots sat silent folding and refolding the newspaper as small as possible upon his knee  and sol gills said the captain gazing at the fire poor nevyless old sol where are you got to you was left in charge of me his last words was take care of my uncle what came over you sol when you went and gave the gobye to ned cuttle and what am i to put in my accounts that hes a looking down upon respecting you sol gills sol gills said the captain shaking his head slowly catch sight of that there newspaper away from home with no one as knowd walr by to say a word and broadside to you broach and down you pitch head foremost  drawing a heavy sigh the captain turned to mr toots and roused himself to a sustained consciousness of that gentlemans presence  my lad said the captain you must tell the young woman honestly that this here fatal news is too correct they dont romance you see on such pints its entered on the ships log and thats the truest book as a man can write tomorrow morning said the captain ill step out and make inquiries but theyll lead to no good they cant do it if youll give me a lookin in the forenoon you shall know what i have heerd but tell the young woman from capen cuttle that its over over and the captain hooking off his glazed hat pulled his handkerchief out of the crown wiped his grizzled head despairingly and tossed the handkerchief in again with the indifference of deep dejection  oh i assure you said mr toots really i am dreadfully sorry upon my word i am though i wasnt acquainted with the party do you think miss dombey will be very much affected captain gillsi mean mr cuttle  why lord love you returned the captain with something of compassion for mr tootss innocence when she warnt no higher than that they were as fond of one another as two young doves  were they though said mr toots with a considerably lengthened face  they were made for one another said the captain mournfully but what signifies that now  upon my word and honour cried mr toots blurting out his words through a singular combination of awkward chuckles and emotion im even more sorry than i was before you know captain gills ii positively adore miss dombeyii am perfectly sore with loving her the burst with which this confession forced itself out of the unhappy mr toots bespoke the vehemence of his feelings but what would be the good of my regarding her in this manner if i wasnt truly sorry for her feeling pain whatever was the cause of it mine aint a selfish affection you know said mr toots in the confidence engendered by his having been a witness of the captains tenderness its the sort of thing with me captain gills that if i could be run overoror trampled uponoror thrown off a very high placeor anything of that sortfor miss dombeys sake it would be the most delightful thing that could happen to me  all this mr toots said in a suppressed voice to prevent its reaching the jealous ears of the chicken who objected to the softer emotions which effort of restraint coupled with the intensity of his feelings made him red to the tips of his ears and caused him to present such an affecting spectacle of disinterested love to the eyes of captain cuttle that the good captain patted him consolingly on the back and bade him cheer up  thankee captain gills said mr toots its kind of you in the midst of your own troubles to say so im very much obliged to you as i said before i really want a friend and should be glad to have your acquaintance although i am very well off said mr toots with energy you cant think what a miserable beast i am the hollow crowd you know when they see me with the chicken and characters of distinction like that suppose me to be happy but im wretched i suffer for miss dombey captain gills i cant get through my meals i have no pleasure in my tailor i often cry when im alone i assure you itll be a satisfaction to me to come back tomorrow or to come back fifty times  mr toots with these words shook the captains hand and disguising such traces of his agitation as could be disguised on so short a notice before the chickens penetrating glance rejoined that eminent gentleman in the shop the chicken who was apt to be jealous of his ascendancy eyed captain cuttle with anything but favour as he took leave of mr toots but followed his patron without being otherwise demonstrative of his illwill leaving the captain oppressed with sorrow and rob the grinder elevated with joy on account of having had the honour of staring for nearly half an hour at the conqueror of the nobby shropshire one  long after rob was fast asleep in his bed under the counter the captain sat looking at the fire and long after there was no fire to look at the captain sat gazing on the rusty bars with unavailing thoughts of walter and old sol crowding through his mind retirement to the stormy chamber at the top of the house brought no rest with it and the captain rose up in the morning sorrowful and unrefreshed  as soon as the city offices were opened the captain issued forth to the countinghouse of dombey and son but there was no opening of the midshipmans windows that morning rob the grinder by the captains orders left the shutters closed and the house was as a house of death  it chanced that mr carker was entering the office as captain cuttle arrived at the door receiving the managers benison gravely and silently captain cuttle made bold to accompany him into his own room  well captain cuttle said mr carker taking up his usual position before the fireplace and keeping on his hat this is a bad business  you have received the news as was in print yesterday sir said the captain  yes said mr carker we have received it it was accurately stated the underwriters suffer a considerable loss we are very sorry no help such is life  mr carker pared his nails delicately with a penknife and smiled at the captain who was standing by the door looking at him  i excessively regret poor gay said carker and the crew i understand there were some of our very best men among em it always happens so many men with families too a comfort to reflect that poor gay had no family captain cuttle  the captain stood rubbing his chin and looking at the manager the manager glanced at the unopened letters lying on his desk and took up the newspaper  is there anything i can do for you captain cuttle he asked looking off it with a smiling and expressive glance at the door  i wish you could set my mind at rest sir on something its uneasy about returned the captain  ay exclaimed the manager whats that come captain cuttle i must trouble you to be quick if you please i am much engaged  lookee here sir said the captain advancing a step afore my friend walr went on this here disastrous voyage  come come captain cuttle interposed the smiling manager dont talk about disastrous voyages in that way we have nothing to do with disastrous voyages here my good fellow you must have begun very early on your days allowance captain if you dont remember that there are hazards in all voyages whether by sea or land you are not made uneasy by the supposition that young whatshisname was lost in bad weather that was got up against him in these officesare you fie captain sleep and sodawater are the best cures for such uneasiness as that  my lad returned the captain slowlyyou are amost a lad to me and so i dont ask your pardon for that slip of a wordif you find any pleasure in this here sport you aint the gentleman i took you for and if you aint the gentleman i took you for may be my mind has call to be uneasy now this is what it is mr carkerafore that poor lad went away according to orders he told me that he warnt a going away for his own good or for promotion he knowd it was my belief that he was wrong and i told him so and i come here your head governor being absent to ask a question or two of you in a civil way for my own satisfaction them questions you answeredfree now itll ease my mind to know when all is over as it is and when what cant be cured must be endooredfor which as a scholar youll overhaul the book its in and thereof make a noteto know once more in a word that i warnt mistaken that i warnt backard in my duty when i didnt tell the old man what walr told me and that the wind was truly in his sail when he highsted of it for barbados harbour mr carker said the captain in the goodness of his nature when i was here last we was very pleasant together if i aint been altogether so pleasant myself this morning on account of this poor lad and if i have chafed again any observation of yours that i might have fended off my name is edard cuttle and i ask your pardon  captain cuttle returned the manager with all possible politeness i must ask you to do me a favour  and what is it sir inquired the captain  to have the goodness to walk off if you please rejoined the manager stretching forth his arm and to carry your jargon somewhere else  every knob in the captains face turned white with astonishment and indignation even the red rim on his forehead faded like a rainbow among the gathering clouds  i tell you what captain cuttle said the manager shaking his forefinger at him and showing him all his teeth but still amiably smiling i was much too lenient with you when you came here before you belong to an artful and audacious set of people in my desire to save young whatshisname from being kicked out of this place neck and crop my good captain i tolerated you but for once and only once now go my friend  the captain was absolutely rooted to the ground and speechless  go said the goodhumoured manager gathering up his skirts and standing astride upon the hearthrug like a sensible fellow and let us have no turning out or any such violent measures if mr dombey were here captain you might be obliged to leave in a more ignominious manner possibly i merely say go  the captain laying his ponderous hand upon his chest to assist himself in fetching a deep breath looked at mr carker from head to foot and looked round the little room as if he did not clearly understand where he was or in what company  you are deep captain cuttle pursued carker with the easy and vivacious frankness of a man of the world who knew the world too well to be ruffled by any discovery of misdoing when it did not immediately concern himself but you are not quite out of soundings eitherneither you nor your absent friend captain what have you done with your absent friend hey  again the captain laid his hand upon his chest after drawing another deep breath he conjured himself to stand by but in a whisper  you hatch nice little plots and hold nice little councils and make nice little appointments and receive nice little visitors too captain hey said carker bending his brows upon him without showing his teeth any the less but its a bold measure to come here afterwards not like your discretion you conspirators and hiders and runnersaway should know better than that will you oblige me by going  my lad gasped the captain in a choked and trembling voice and with a curious action going on in the ponderous fist theres a many words i could wish to say to you but i dont rightly know where theyre stowed just at present my young friend walr was drownded only last night according to my reckoning and it puts me out you see but you and me will come alongside oone another again my lad said the captain holding up his hook if we live  it will be anything but shrewd in you my good fellow if we do returned the manager with the same frankness for you may rely i give you fair warning upon my detecting and exposing you i dont pretend to be a more moral man than my neighbours my good captain but the confidence of this house or of any member of this house is not to be abused and undermined while i have eyes and ears good day said mr carker nodding his head  captain cuttle looking at him steadily mr carker looked full as steadily at the captain went out of the office and left him standing astride before the fire as calm and pleasant as if there were no more spots upon his soul than on his pure white linen and his smooth sleek skin  the captain glanced in passing through the outer countinghouse at the desk where he knew poor walter had been used to sit now occupied by another young boy with a face almost as fresh and hopeful as his on the day when they tapped the famous last bottle but one of the old madeira in the little back parlour the nation of ideas thus awakened did the captain a great deal of good it softened him in the very height of his anger and brought the tears into his eyes  arrived at the wooden midshipmans again and sitting down in a corner of the dark shop the captains indignation strong as it was could make no head against his grief passion seemed not only to do wrong and violence to the memory of the dead but to be infected by death and to droop and decline beside it all the living knaves and liars in the world were nothing to the honesty and truth of one dead friend  the only thing the honest captain made out clearly in this state of mind besides the loss of walter was that with him almost the whole world of captain cuttle had been drowned if he reproached himself sometimes and keenly too for having ever connived at walters innocent deceit he thought at least as often of the mr carker whom no sea could ever render up and the mr dombey whom he now began to perceive was as far beyond human recall and the hearts delight with whom he must never foregather again and the lovely peg that teakbuilt and trim ballad that had gone ashore upon a rock and split into mere planks and beams of rhyme the captain sat in the dark shop thinking of these things to the entire exclusion of his own injury and looking with as sad an eye upon the ground as if in contemplation of their actual fragments as they floated past  but the captain was not unmindful for all that of such decent and rest observances in memory of poor walter as he felt within his power rousing himself and rousing rob the grinder who in the unnatural twilight was fast asleep the captain sallied forth with his attendant at his heels and the doorkey in his pocket and repairing to one of those convenient slopselling establishments of which there is abundant choice at the eastern end of london purchased on the spot two suits of mourningone for rob the grinder which was immensely too small and one for himself which was immensely too large he also provided rob with a species of hat greatly to be admired for its symmetry and usefulness as well as for a happy blending of the mariner with the coalheaver which is usually termed a souwester and which was something of a novelty in connexion with the instrument business in their several garments which the vendor declared to be such a miracle in point of fit as nothing but a rare combination of fortuitous circumstances ever brought about and the fashion of which was unparalleled within the memory of the oldest inhabitant the captain and grinder immediately arrayed themselves presenting a spectacle fraught with wonder to all who beheld it  in this altered form the captain received mr toots im took aback my lad at present said the captain and will only confirm that there ill news tell the young woman to break it gentle to the young lady and for neither of em never to think of me no morespecial mind you that isthough i will think of them when night comes on a hurricane and seas is mountains rowling for which overhaul your doctor watts brother and when found make a note on  the captain reserved until some fitter time the consideration of mr tootss offer of friendship and thus dismissed him captain cuttles spirits were so low in truth that he half determined that day to take no further precautions against surprise from mrs macstinger but to abandon himself recklessly to chance and be indifferent to what might happen as evening came on he fell into a better frame of mind however and spoke much of walter to rob the grinder whose attention and fidelity he likewise incidentally commended rob did not blush to hear the captain earnest in his praises but sat staring at him and affecting to snivel with sympathy and making a feint of being virtuous and treasuring up every word he said like a young spy as he was with very promising deceit  when rob had turned in and was fast asleep the captain trimmed the candle put on his spectacleshe had felt it appropriate to take to spectacles on entering into the instrument trade though his eyes were like a hawksand opened the prayerbook at the burial service and reading softly to himself in the little back parlour and stopping now and then to wipe his eyes the captain in a true and simple spirit committed walters body to the deep    chapter 33 contrasts   turn we our eyes upon two homes not lying side by side but wide apart though both within easy range and reach of the great city of london  the first is situated in the green and wooded country near norwood it is not a mansion it is of no pretensions as to size but it is beautifully arranged and tastefully kept the lawn the soft smooth slope the flowergarden the clumps of trees where graceful forms of ash and willow are not wanting the conservatory the rustic verandah with sweetsmelling creeping plants entwined about the pillars the simple exterior of the house the wellordered offices though all upon the diminutive scale proper to a mere cottage bespeak an amount of elegant comfort within that might serve for a palace this indication is not without warrant for within it is a house of refinement and luxury rich colours excellently blended meet the eye at every turn in the furnitureits proportions admirably devised to suit the shapes and sizes of the small rooms on the walls upon the floors tingeing and subduing the light that comes in through the odd glass doors and windows here and there there are a few choice prints and pictures too in quaint nooks and recesses there is no want of books and there are games of skill and chance set forth on tablesfantastic chessmen dice backgammon cards and billiards  and yet amidst this opulence of comfort there is something in the general air that is not well is it that the carpets and the cushions are too soft and noiseless so that those who move or repose among them seem to act by stealth is it that the prints and pictures do not commemorate great thoughts or deeds or render nature in the poetry of landscape hall or hut but are of one voluptuous castmere shows of form and colourand no more is it that the books have all their gold outside and that the titles of the greater part qualify them to be companions of the prints and pictures is it that the completeness and the beauty of the place are here and there belied by an affectation of humility in some unimportant and inexpensive regard which is as false as the face of the too truly painted portrait hanging yonder or its original at breakfast in his easy chair below it or is it that with the daily breath of that original and master of all here there issues forth some subtle portion of himself which gives a vague expression of himself to everything about him  it is mr carker the manager who sits in the easy chair a gaudy parrot in a burnished cage upon the table tears at the wires with her beak and goes walking upside down in its dometop shaking her house and screeching but mr carker is indifferent to the bird and looks with a musing smile at a picture on the opposite wall  a most extraordinary accidental likeness certainly says he  perhaps it is a juno perhaps a potiphars wife perhaps some scornful nymphaccording as the picture dealers found the market when they christened it it is the figure of a woman supremely handsome who turning away but with her face addressed to the spectator flashes her proud glance upon him  it is like edith  with a passing gesture of his hand at the picturewhat a menace no yet something like it a wave as of triumph no yet more like that an insolent salute wafted from his lips no yet like that toohe resumes his breakfast and calls to the chafing and imprisoned bird who coming down into a pendant gilded hoop within the cage like a great weddingring swings in it for his delight  the second home is on the other side of london near to where the busy great north road of bygone days is silent and almost deserted except by wayfarers who toil along on foot it is a poor small house barely and sparely furnished but very clean and there is even an attempt to decorate it shown in the homely flowers trained about the porch and in the narrow garden the neighbourhood in which it stands has as little of the country to recommend it as it has of the town it is neither of the town nor country the former like the giant in his travelling boots has made a stride and passed it and has set his brickandmortar heel a long way in advance but the intermediate space between the giants feet as yet is only blighted country and not town and here among a few tall chimneys belching smoke all day and night and among the brickfields and the lanes where turf is cut and where the fences tumble down and where the dusty nettles grow and where a scrap or two of hedge may yet be seen and where the birdcatcher still comes occasionally though he swears every time to come no morethis second home is to be found  she who inhabits it is she who left the first in her devotion to an outcast brother she withdrew from that home its redeeming spirit and from its masters breast his solitary angel but though his liking for her is gone after this ungrateful slight as he considers it and though he abandons her altogether in return an old idea of her is not quite forgotten even by him let her flowergarden in which he never sets his foot but which is yet maintained among all his costly alterations as if she had quitted it but yesterday bear witness  harriet carker has changed since then and on her beauty there has fallen a heavier shade than time of his unassisted self can cast allpotent as he isthe shadow of anxiety and sorrow and the daily struggle of a poor existence but it is beauty still and still a gentle quiet and retiring beauty that must be sought out for it cannot vaunt itself if it could it would be what it is no more  yes this slight small patient figure neatly dressed in homely stuffs and indicating nothing but the dull household virtues that have so little in common with the received idea of heroism and greatness unless indeed any ray of them should shine through the lives of the great ones of the earth when it becomes a constellation and is tracked in heaven straightwaythis slight small patient figure leaning on the man still young but worn and grey is she his sister who of all the world went over to him in his shame and put her hand in his and with a sweet composure and determination led him hopefully upon his barren way  it is early john she said why do you go so early  not many minutes earlier than usual harriet if i have the time to spare i should like i thinkits a fancyto walk once by the house where i took leave of him  i wish i had ever seen or known him john  it is better as it is my dear remembering his fate  but i could not regret it more though i had known him is not your sorrow mine and if i had perhaps you would feel that i was a better companion to you in speaking about him than i may seem now  my dearest sister is there anything within the range of rejoicing or regret in which i am not sure of your companionship  i hope you think not john for surely there is nothing  how could you be better to me or nearer to me then than you are in this or anything said her brother i feel that you did know him harriet and that you shared my feelings towards him  she drew the hand which had been resting on his shoulder round his neck and answered with some hesitation  no not quite  true true he said you think i might have done him no harm if i had allowed myself to know him better  think i know it  designedly heaven knows i would not he replied shaking his head mournfully but his reputation was too precious to be perilled by such association whether you share that knowledge or do not my dear  i do not she said quietly  it is still the truth harriet and my mind is lighter when i think of him for that which made it so much heavier then he checked himself in his tone of melancholy and smiled upon her as he said goodbye  goodbye dear john in the evening at the old time and place i shall meet you as usual on your way home goodbye  the cordial face she lifted up to his to kiss him was his home his life his universe and yet it was a portion of his punishment and grief for in the cloud he saw upon itthough serene and calm as any radiant cloud at sunsetand in the constancy and devotion of her life and in the sacrifice she had made of ease enjoyment and hope he saw the bitter fruits of his old crime for ever ripe and fresh  she stood at the door looking after him with her hands loosely clasped in each other as he made his way over the frowzy and uneven patch of ground which lay before their house which had once and not long ago been a pleasant meadow and was now a very waste with a disorderly crop of beginnings of mean houses rising out of the rubbish as if they had been unskilfully sown there whenever he looked backas once or twice he didher cordial face shone like a light upon his heart but when he plodded on his way and saw her not the tears were in her eyes as she stood watching him  her pensive form was not long idle at the door there was daily duty to discharge and daily work to dofor such commonplace spirits that are not heroic often work hard with their handsand harriet was soon busy with her household tasks these discharged and the poor house made quite neat and orderly she counted her little stock of money with an anxious face and went out thoughtfully to buy some necessaries for their table planning and conniving as she went how to save so sordid are the lives of such lo natures who are not only not heroic to their valets and waitingwomen but have neither valets nor waitingwomen to be heroic to withal  while she was absent and there was no one in the house there approached it by a different way from that the brother had taken a gentleman a very little past his prime of life perhaps but of a healthy florid hue an upright presence and a bright clear aspect that was gracious and goodhumoured his eyebrows were still black and so was much of his hair the sprinkling of grey observable among the latter graced the former very much and showed his broad frank brow and honest eyes to great advantage  after knocking once at the door and obtaining no response this gentleman sat down on a bench in the little porch to wait a certain skilful action of his fingers as he hummed some bars and beat time on the seat beside him seemed to denote the musician and the extraordinary satisfaction he derived from humming something very slow and long which had no recognisable tune seemed to denote that he was a scientific one  the gentleman was still twirling a theme which seemed to go round and round and round and in and in and in and to involve itself like a corkscrew twirled upon a table without getting any nearer to anything when harriet appeared returning he rose up as she advanced and stood with his head uncovered  you are come again sir she said faltering  i take that liberty he answered may i ask for five minutes of your leisure  after a moments hesitation she opened the door and gave him admission to the little parlour the gentleman sat down there drew his chair to the table over against her and said in a voice that perfectly corresponded to his appearance and with a simplicity that was very engaging  miss harriet you cannot be proud you signified to me when i called tother morning that you were pardon me if i say that i looked into your face while you spoke and that it contradicted you i look into it again he added laying his hand gently on her arm for an instant and it contradicts you more and more  she was somewhat confused and agitated and could make no ready answer  it is the mirror of truth said her visitor and gentleness excuse my trusting to it and returning  his manner of saying these words divested them entirely of the character of compliments it was so plain grave unaffected and sincere that she bent her head as if at once to thank him and acknowledge his sincerity  the disparity between our ages said the gentleman and the plainness of my purpose empower me i am glad to think to speak my mind that is my mind and so you see me for the second time  there is a kind of pride sir she returned after a moments silence or what may be supposed to be pride which is mere duty i hope i cherish no other  for yourself he said  for myself  butpardon me suggested the gentleman for your brother john  proud of his love i am said harriet looking full upon her visitor and changing her manner on the instantnot that it was less composed and quiet but that there was a deep impassioned earnestness in it that made the very tremble in her voice a part of her firmness and proud of him sir you who strangely know the story of his life and repeated it to me when you were here last  merely to make my way into your confidence interposed the gentleman for heavens sake dont suppose  i am sure she said you revived it in my hearing with a kind and good purpose i am quite sure of it  i thank you returned her visitor pressing her hand hastily i am much obliged to you you do me justice i assure you you were going to say that i who know the story of john carkers life  may think it pride in me she continued when i say that i am proud of him i am you know the time was when i was notwhen i could not bebut that is past the humility of many years the uncomplaining expiation the true repentance the terrible regret the pain i know he has even in my affection which he thinks has cost me dear though heaven knows i am happy but for his sorrow ioh sir after what i have seen let me conjure you if you are in any place of power and are ever wronged never for any wrong inflict a punishment that cannot be recalled while there is a god above us to work changes in the hearts he made  your brother is an altered man returned the gentleman compassionately i assure you i dont doubt it  he was an altered man when he did wrong said harriet he is an altered man again and is his true self now believe me sir  but we go on said her visitor rubbing his forehead in an absent manner with his hand and then drumming thoughtfully on the table we go on in our clockwork routine from day to day and cant make out or follow these changes theytheyre a metaphysical sort of thing wewe havent leisure for it wewe havent courage theyre not taught at schools or colleges and we dont know how to set about it in short we are so dd businesslike said the gentleman walking to the window and back and sitting down again in a state of extreme dissatisfaction and vexation  i am sure said the gentleman rubbing his forehead again and drumming on the table as before i have good reason to believe that a jogtrot life the same from day to day would reconcile one to anything one dont see anything one dont hear anything one dont know anything thats the fact we go on taking everything for granted and so we go on until whatever we do good bad or indifferent we do from habit habit is all i shall have to report when i am called upon to plead to my conscience on my deathbed habit says i i was deaf dumb blind and paralytic to a million things from habit very businesslike indeed mr whatsyourname says conscience but it wont do here  the gentleman got up and walked to the window again and back seriously uneasy though giving his uneasiness this peculiar expression  miss harriet he said resuming his chair i wish you would let me serve you look at me i ought to look honest for i know i am so at present do i  yes she answered with a smile  i believe every word you have said he returned i am full of selfreproach that i might have known this and seen this and known you and seen you any time these dozen years and that i never have i hardly know how i ever got herecreature that i am not only of my own habit but of other peoples but having done so let me do something i ask it in all honour and respect you inspire me with both in the highest degree let me do something  we are contented sir  no no not quite returned the gentleman i think not quite there are some little comforts that might smooth your life and his and his he repeated fancying that had made some impression on her i have been in the habit of thinking that there was nothing wanting to be done for him that it was all settled and over in short of not thinking at all about it i am different now let me do something for him you too said the visitor with careful delicacy have need to watch your health closely for his sake and i fear it fails  whoever you may be sir answered harriet raising her eyes to his face i am deeply grateful to you i feel certain that in all you say you have no object in the world but kindness to us but years have passed since we began this life and to take from my brother any part of what has so endeared him to me and so proved his better resolutionany fragment of the merit of his unassisted obscure and forgotten reparationwould be to diminish the comfort it will be to him and me when that time comes to each of us of which you spoke just now i thank you better with these tears than any words believe it pray  the gentleman was moved and put the hand she held out to his lips much as a tender father might kiss the hand of a dutiful child but more reverently  if the day should ever come said harriet when he is restored in part to the position he lost  restored cried the gentleman quickly how can that be hoped for in whose hands does the power of any restoration lie it is no mistake of mine surely to suppose that his having gained the priceless blessing of his life is one cause of the animosity shown to him by his brother  you touch upon a subject that is never breathed between us not even between us said harriet  i beg your forgiveness said the visitor i should have known it i entreat you to forget that i have done so inadvertently and now as i dare urge no moreas i am not sure that i have a right to do sothough heaven knows even that doubt may be habit said the gentleman rubbing his head as despondently as before let me though a stranger yet no stranger ask two favours  what are they she inquired  the first that if you should see cause to change your resolution you will suffer me to be as your right hand my name shall then be at your service it is useless now and always insignificant  our choice of friends she answered smiling faintly is not so great that i need any time for consideration i can promise that  the second that you will allow me sometimes say every monday morning at nine oclockhabit againi must be businesslike said the gentleman with a whimsical inclination to quarrel with himself on that head in walking past to see you at the door or window i dont ask to come in as your brother will be gone out at that hour i dont ask to speak to you i merely ask to see for the satisfaction of my own mind that you are well and without intrusion to remind you by the sight of me that you have a friendan elderly friend greyhaired already and fast growing greyerwhom you may ever command  the cordial face looked up in his confided in it and promised  i understand as before said the gentleman rising that you purpose not to mention my visit to john carker lest he should be at all distressed by my acquaintance with his history i am glad of it for it is out of the ordinary course of things andhabit again said the gentleman checking himself impatiently as if there were no better course than the ordinary course  with that he turned to go and walking bareheaded to the outside of the little porch took leave of her with such a happy mixture of unconstrained respect and unaffected interest as no breeding could have taught no truth mistrusted and nothing but a pure and single heart expressed  many halfforgotten emotions were awakened in the sisters mind by this visit it was so very long since any other visitor had crossed their threshold it was so very long since any voice of apathy had made sad music in her ears that the strangers figure remained present to her hours afterwards when she sat at the window plying her needle and his words seemed newly spoken again and again he had touched the spring that opened her whole life and if she lost him for a short space it was only among the many shapes of the one great recollection of which that life was made  musing and working by turns now constraining herself to be steady at her needle for a long time together and now letting her work fall unregarded on her lap and straying wheresoever her busier thoughts led harriet carker found the hours glide by her and the day steal on the morning which had been bright and clear gradually became overcast a sharp wind set in the rain fell heavily and a dark mist drooping over the distant town hid it from the view  she often looked with compassion at such a time upon the stragglers who came wandering into london by the great highway hard by and who footsore and weary and gazing fearfully at the huge town before them as if foreboding that their misery there would be but as a drop of water in the sea or as a grain of seasand on the shore went shrinking on cowering before the angry weather and looking as if the very elements rejected them day after day such travellers crept past but always as she thought in one directionalways towards the town swallowed up in one phase or other of its immensity towards which they seemed impelled by a desperate fascination they never returned food for the hospitals the churchyards the prisons the river fever madness vice and deaththey passed on to the monster roaring in the distance and were lost  the chill wind was howling and the rain was falling and the day was darkening moodily when harriet raising her eyes from the work on which she had long since been engaged with unremitting constancy saw one of these travellers approaching  a woman a solitary woman of some thirty years of age tall wellformed handsome miserably dressed the soil of many country roads in varied weatherdust chalk clay gravelclotted on her grey cloak by the streaming wet no bonnet on her head nothing to defend her rich black hair from the rain but a torn handkerchief with the fluttering ends of which and with her hair the wind blinded her so that she often stopped to push them back and look upon the way she was going  she was in the act of doing so when harriet observed her as her hands parting on her sunburnt forehead swept across her face and threw aside the hindrances that encroached upon it there was a reckless and regardless beauty in it a dauntless and depraved indifference to more than weather a carelessness of what was cast upon her bare head from heaven or earth that coupled with her misery and loneliness touched the heart of her fellowwoman she thought of all that was perverted and debased within her no less than without of modest graces of the mind hardened and steeled like these attractions of the person of the many gifts of the creator flung to the winds like the wild hair of all the beautiful ruin upon which the storm was beating and the night was coming  thinking of this she did not turn away with a delicate indignationtoo many of her own compassionate and tender sex too often dobut pitied her  her fallen sister came on looking far before her trying with her eager eyes to pierce the mist in which the city was enshrouded and glancing now and then from side to side with the bewilderedand uncertain aspect of a stranger though her tread was bold and courageous she was fatigued and after a moment of irresolutionsat down upon a heap of stones seeking no shelter from the rain but letting it rain on her as it would  she was now opposite the house raising her head after resting it for a moment on both hands her eyes met those of harriet  in a moment harriet was at the door and the other rising from her seat at her beck came slowly and with no conciliatory look towards her  why do you rest in the rain said harriet gently  because i have no other restingplace was the reply  but there are many places of shelter near here this referring to the little porch is better than where you were you are very welcome to rest here  the wanderer looked at her in doubt and surprise but without any expression of thankfulness and sitting down and taking off one of her worn shoes to beat out the fragments of stone and dust that were inside showed that her foot was cut and bleeding  harriet uttering an expression of pity the traveller looked up with a contemptuous and incredulous smile  why whats a torn foot to such as me she said and whats a torn foot in such as me to such as you  come in and wash it answered harriet mildly and let me give you something to bind it up  the woman caught her arm and drawing it before her own eyes hid them against it and wept not like a woman but like a stern man surprised into that weakness with a violent heaving of her breast and struggle for recovery that showed how unusual the emotion was with her  she submitted to be led into the house and evidently more in gratitude than in any care for herself washed and bound the injured place harriet then put before her fragments of her own frugal dinner and when she had eaten of them though sparingly besought her before resuming her road which she showed her anxiety to do to dry her clothes before the fire again more in gratitude than with any evidence of concern in her own behalf she sat down in front of it and unbinding the handkerchief about her head and letting her thick wet hair fall down below her waist sat drying it with the palms of her hands and looking at the blaze  i daresay you are thinking she said lifting her head suddenly that i used to be handsome once i believe i wasi know i waslook here she held up her hair roughly with both hands seizing it as if she would have torn it out then threw it down again and flung it back as though it were a heap of serpents  are you a stranger in this place asked harriet  a stranger she returned stopping between each short reply and looking at the fire yes ten or a dozen years a stranger i have had no almanack where i have been ten or a dozen years i dont know this part its much altered since i went away  have you been far  very far months upon months over the sea and far away even then i have been where convicts go she added looking full upon her entertainer i have been one myself  heaven help you and forgive you was the gentle answer  ah heaven help me and forgive me she returned nodding her head at the fire if man would help some of us a little more god would forgive us all the sooner perhaps  but she was softened by the earnest manner and the cordial face so full of mildness and so free from judgment of her and said less hardily  we may be about the same age you and me if i am older it is not above a year or two oh think of that  she opened her arms as though the exhibition of her outward form would show the moral wretch she was and letting them drop at her sides hung down her head  there is nothing we may not hope to repair it is never too late to amend said harriet you are penitent  no she answered i am not i cant be i am no such thing why should i be penitent and all the world go free they talk to me of my penitence whos penitent for the wrongs that have been done to me  she rose up bound her handkerchief about her head and turned to move away  where are you going said harriet  yonder she answered pointing with her hand to london  have you any home to go to  i think i have a mother shes as much a mother as her dwelling is a home she answered with a bitter laugh  take this cried harriet putting money in her hand try to do well it is very little but for one day it may keep you from harm  are you married said the other faintly as she took it  no i live here with my brother we have not much to spare or i would give you more  will you let me kiss you  seeing no scorn or repugnance in her face the object of her charity bent over her as she asked the question and pressed her lips against her cheek once more she caught her arm and covered her eyes with it and then was gone  gone into the deepening night and howling wind and pelting rain urging her way on towards the mistenshrouded city where the blurred lights gleamed and with her black hair and disordered headgear fluttering round her reckless face    chapter 34 another mother and daughter   in an ugly and dark room an old woman ugly and dark too sat listening to the wind and rain and crouching over a meagre fire more constant to the lastnamed occupation than the first she never changed her attitude unless when any stray drops of rain fell hissing on the smouldering embers to raise her head with an awakened attention to the whistling and pattering outside and gradually to let it fall again lower and lower and lower as she sunk into a brooding state of thought in which the noises of the night were as indistinctly regarded as is the monotonous rolling of a sea by one who sits in contemplation on its shore  there was no light in the room save that which the fire afforded glaring sullenly from time to time like the eye of a fierce beast half asleep it revealed no objects that needed to be jealous of a better display a heap of rags a heap of bones a wretched bed two or three mutilated chairs or stools the black walls and blacker ceiling were all its winking brightness shone upon as the old woman with a gigantic and distorted image of herself thrown half upon the wall behind her half upon the roof above sat bending over the few loose bricks within which it was pent on the damp hearth of the chimneyfor there was no stoveshe looked as if she were watching at some witchs altar for a favourable token and but that the movement of her chattering jaws and trembling chin was too frequent and too fast for the slow flickering of the fire it would have seemed an illusion wrought by the light as it came and went upon a face as motionless as the form to which it belonged  if florence could have stood within the room and looked upon the original of the shadow thrown upon the wall and roof as it cowered thus over the fire a glance might have sufficed to recall the figure of good mrs brown notwithstanding that her childish recollection of that terrible old woman was as grotesque and exaggerated a presentment of the truth perhaps as the shadow on the wall but florence was not there to look on and good mrs brown remained unrecognised and sat staring at her fire unobserved  attracted by a louder sputtering than usual as the rain came hissing down the chimney in a little stream the old woman raised her head impatiently to listen afresh and this time she did not drop it again for there was a hand upon the door and a footstep in the room  whos that she said looking over her shoulder  one who brings you news was the answer in a womans voice  news where from  from abroad  from beyond seas cried the old woman starting up  ay from beyond seas  the old woman raked the fire together hurriedly and going close to her visitor who had entered and shut the door and who now stood in the middle of the room put her hand upon the drenched cloak and turned the unresisting figure so as to have it in the full light of the fire she did not find what she had expected whatever that might be for she let the cloak go again and uttered a querulous cry of disappointment and misery  what is the matter asked her visitor  oho oho cried the old woman turning her face upward with a terrible howl  what is the matter asked the visitor again  its not my gal cried the old woman tossing up her arms and clasping her hands above her head wheres my alice wheres my handsome daughter theyve been the death of her  theyve not been the death of her yet if your names marwood said the visitor  have you seen my gal then cried the old woman has she wrote to me  she said you couldnt read returned the other  no more i can exclaimed the old woman wringing her hands  have you no light here said the other looking round the room  the old woman mumbling and shaking her head and muttering to herself about her handsome daughter brought a candle from a cupboard in the corner and thrusting it into the fire with a trembling hand lighted it with some difficulty and set it on the table its dirty wick burnt dimly at first being choked in its own grease and when the bleared eyes and failing sight of the old woman could distinguish anything by its light her visitor was sitting with her arms folded her eyes turned downwards and a handkerchief she had worn upon her head lying on the table by her side  she sent to me by word of mouth then my gal alice mumbled the old woman after waiting for some moments what did she say  look returned the visitor  the old woman repeated the word in a scared uncertain way and shading her eyes looked at the speaker round the room and at the speaker once again  alice said look again mother and the speaker fixed her eyes upon her  again the old woman looked round the room and at her visitor and round the room once more hastily seizing the candle and rising from her seat she held it to the visitors face uttered a loud cry set down the light and fell upon her neck  its my gal its my alice its my handsome daughter living and come back screamed the old woman rocking herself to and fro upon the breast that coldly suffered her embrace its my gal its my alice its my handsome daughter living and come back she screamed again dropping on the floor before her clasping her knees laying her head against them and still rocking herself to and fro with every frantic demonstration of which her vitality was capable  yes mother returned alice stooping forward for a moment and kissing her but endeavouring even in the act to disengage herself from her embrace i am here at last let go mother let go get up and sit in your chair what good does this do  shes come back harder than she went cried the mother looking up in her face and still holding to her knees she dont care for me after all these years and all the wretched life ive led  why mother said alice shaking her ragged skirts to detach the old woman from them there are two sides to that there have been years for me as well as you and there has been wretchedness for me as well as you get up get up  her mother rose and cried and wrung her hands and stood at a little distance gazing on her then she took the candle again and going round her surveyed her from head to foot making a low moaning all the time then she put the candle down resumed her chair and beating her hands together to a kind of weary tune and rolling herself from side to side continued moaning and wailing to herself  alice got up took off her wet cloak and laid it aside that done she sat down as before and with her arms folded and her eyes gazing at the fire remained silently listening with a contemptuous face to her old mothers inarticulate complainings  did you expect to see me return as youthful as i went away mother she said at length turning her eyes upon the old woman did you think a foreign life like mine was good for good looks one would believe so to hear you  it aint that cried the mother she knows it  what is it then returned the daughter it had best be something that dont last mother or my way out is easier than my way in  hear that exclaimed the mother after all these years she threatens to desert me in the moment of her coming back again  i tell you mother for the second time there have been years for me as well as you said alice come back harder of course i have come back harder what else did you expect  harder to me to her own dear mother cried the old woman  i dont know who began to harden me if my own dear mother didnt she returned sitting with her folded arms and knitted brows and compressed lips as if she were bent on excluding by force every softer feeling from her breast listen mother to a word or two if we understand each other now we shall not fall out any more perhaps i went away a girl and have come back a woman i went away undutiful enough and have come back no better you may swear but have you been very dutiful to me  i cried the old woman to my gal a mother dutiful to her own child  it sounds unnatural dont it returned the daughter looking coldly on her with her stern regardless hardy beautiful face but i have thought of it sometimes in the course of my lone years till i have got used to it i have heard some talk about duty first and last but it has always been of my duty to other people i have wondered now and thento pass away the timewhether no one ever owed any duty to me  her mother sat mowing and mumbling and shaking her head but whether angrily or remorsefully or in denial or only in her physical infirmity did not appear  there was a child called alice marwood said the daughter with a laugh and looking down at herself in terrible derision of herself born among poverty and neglect and nursed in it nobody taught her nobody stepped forward to help her nobody cared for her  nobody echoed the mother pointing to herself and striking her breast  the only care she knew returned the daughter was to be beaten and stinted and abused sometimes and she might have done better without that she lived in homes like this and in the streets with a crowd of little wretches like herself and yet she brought good looks out of this childhood so much the worse for her she had better have been hunted and worried to death for ugliness  go on go on exclaimed the mother  i am going on returned the daughter there was a girl called alice marwood she was handsome she was taught too late and taught all wrong she was too well cared for too well trained too well helped on too much looked after you were very fond of heryou were better off then what came to that girl comes to thousands every year it was only ruin and she was born to it  after all these years whined the old woman my gal begins with this  shell soon have ended said the daughter there was a criminal called alice marwooda girl still but deserted and an outcast and she was tried and she was sentenced and lord how the gentlemen in the court talked about it and how grave the judge was on her duty and on her having perverted the gifts of natureas if he didnt know better than anybody there that they had been made curses to herand how he preached about the strong arm of the lawso very strong to save her when she was an innocent and helpless little wretchand how solemn and religious it all was i have thought of that many times since to be sure  she folded her arms tightly on her breast and laughed in a tone that made the howl of the old woman musical  so alice marwood was transported mother she pursued and was sent to learn her duty where there was twenty times less duty and more wickedness and wrong and infamy than here and alice marwood is come back a woman such a woman as she ought to be after all this in good time there will be more solemnity and more fine talk and more strong arm most likely and there will be an end of her but the gentlemen neednt be afraid of being thrown out of work theres crowds of little wretches boy and girl growing up in any of the streets they live in thatll keep them to it till theyve made their fortunes  the old woman leaned her elbows on the table and resting her face upon her two hands made a show of being in great distressor really was perhaps  there i have done mother said the daughter with a motion of her head as if in dismissal of the subject i have said enough dont let you and i talk of being dutiful whatever we do your childhood was like mine i suppose so much the worse for both of us i dont want to blame you or to defend myself why should i thats all over long ago but i am a womannot a girl nowand you and i neednt make a show of our history like the gentlemen in the court we know all about it well enough  lost and degraded as she was there was a beauty in her both of face and form which even in its worst expression could not but be recognised as such by anyone regarding her with the least attention as she subsided into silence and her face which had been harshly agitated quieted down while her dark eyes fixed upon the fire exchanged the reckless light that had animated them for one that was softened by something like sorrow there shone through all her wayworn misery and fatigue a ray of the departed radiance of the fallen angel  her mother after watching her for some time without speaking ventured to steal her withered hand a little nearer to her across the table and finding that she permitted this to touch her face and smooth her hair with the feeling as it seemed that the old woman was at least sincere in this show of interest alice made no movement to check her so advancing by degrees she bound up her daughters hair afresh took off her wet shoes if they deserved the name spread something dry upon her shoulders and hovered humbly about her muttering to herself as she recognised her old features and expression more and more  you are very poor mother i see said alice looking round when she had sat thus for some time  bitter poor my deary replied the old woman  she admired her daughter and was afraid of her perhaps her admiration such as it was had originated long ago when she first found anything that was beautiful appearing in the midst of the squalid fight of her existence perhaps her fear was referable in some sort to the retrospect she had so lately heard be this as it might she stood submissively and deferentially before her child and inclined her head as if in a pitiful entreaty to be spared any further reproach  how have you lived  by begging my deary  and pilfering mother  sometimes allyin a very small way i am old and timid i have taken trifles from children now and then my deary but not often i have tramped about the country pet and i know what i know i have watched  watched returned the daughter looking at her  i have hung about a family my deary said the mother even more humbly and submissively than before  what family  hush darling dont be angry with me i did it for the love of you in memory of my poor gal beyond seas she put out her hand deprecatingly and drawing it back again laid it on her lips  years ago my deary she pursued glancing timidly at the attentive and stem face opposed to her i came across his little child by chance  whose child  not his alice deary dont look at me like that not his how could it be his you know he has none  whose then returned the daughter you said his  hush ally you frighten me deary mr dombeysonly mr dombeys since then darling i have seen them often i have seen him  in uttering this last word the old woman shrunk and recoiled as if with sudden fear that her daughter would strike her but though the daughters face was fixed upon her and expressed the most vehement passion she remained still except that she clenched her arms tighter and tighter within each other on her bosom as if to restrain them by that means from doing an injury to herself or someone else in the blind fury of the wrath that suddenly possessed her  little he thought who i was said the old woman shaking her clenched hand  and little he cared muttered her daughter between her teeth  but there we were said the old woman face to face i spoke to him and he spoke to me i sat and watched him as he went away down a long grove of trees and at every step he took i cursed him soul and body  he will thrive in spite of that returned the daughter disdainfully  ay he is thriving said the mother  she held her peace for the face and form before her were unshaped by rage it seemed as if the bosom would burst with the emotions that strove within it the effort that constrained and held it pent up was no less formidable than the rage itself no less bespeaking the violent and dangerous character of the woman who made it but it succeeded and she asked after a silence  is he married  no deary said the mother  going to be  not that i know of deary but his master and friend is married oh we may give him joy we may give em all joy cried the old woman hugging herself with her lean arms in her exultation nothing but joy to us will come of that marriage mind me  the daughter looked at her for an explanation  but you are wet and tired hungry and thirsty said the old woman hobbling to the cupboard and theres little here and littlediving down into her pocket and jingling a few halfpence on the tablelittle here have you any money alice deary  the covetous sharp eager face with which she asked the question and looked on as her daughter took out of her bosom the little gift she had so lately received told almost as much of the history of this parent and child as the child herself had told in words  is that all said the mother  i have no more i should not have this but for charity  but for charity eh deary said the old woman bending greedily over the table to look at the money which she appeared distrustful of her daughters still retaining in her hand and gazing on humph six and six is twelve and six eighteensowe must make the most of it ill go buy something to eat and drink  with greater alacrity than might have been expected in one of her appearancefor age and misery seemed to have made her as decrepit as uglyshe began to occupy her trembling hands in tying an old bonnet on her head and folding a torn shawl about herself still eyeing the money in her daughters hand with the same sharp desire  what joy is to come to us of this marriage mother asked the daughter you have not told me that  the joy she replied attiring herself with fumbling fingers of no love at all and much pride and hate my deary the joy of confusion and strife among em proud as they are and of dangerdanger alice  what danger  i have seen what i have seen i know what i know chuckled the mother let some look to it let some be upon their guard my gal may keep good company yet  then seeing that in the wondering earnestness with which her daughter regarded her her hand involuntarily closed upon the money the old woman made more speed to secure it and hurriedly added but ill go buy something ill go buy something  as she stood with her hand stretched out before her daughter her daughter glancing again at the money put it to her lips before parting with it  what ally do you kiss it chuckled the old woman thats like mei often do oh its so good to us squeezing her own tarnished halfpence up to her bag of a throat so good to us in everything but not coming in heaps  i kiss it mother said the daughter or i did theni dont know that i ever did beforefor the givers sake  the giver eh deary retorted the old woman whose dimmed eyes glistened as she took it ay ill kiss it for the givers sake too when the giver can make it go farther but ill go spend it deary ill be back directly  you seem to say you know a great deal mother said the daughter following her to the door with her eyes you have grown very wise since we parted  know croaked the old woman coming back a step or two i know more than you think i know more than he thinks deary as ill tell you by and bye i know all  the daughter smiled incredulously  i know of his brother alice said the old woman stretching out her neck with a leer of malice absolutely frightful who might have been where you have beenfor stealing moneyand who lives with his sister over yonder by the north road out of london  where  by the north road out of london deary you shall see the house if you like it aint much to boast of genteel as his own is no no no cried the old woman shaking her head and laughing for her daughter had started up not now its too far off its by the milestone where the stones are heapedtomorrow deary if its fine and you are in the humour but ill go spend  stop and the daughter flung herself upon her with her former passion raging like a fire the sister is a fairfaced devil with brown hair  the old woman amazed and terrified nodded her head  i see the shadow of him in her face its a red house standing by itself before the door there is a small green porch  again the old woman nodded  in which i sat today give me back the money  alice deary  give me back the money or youll be hurt  she forced it from the old womans hand as she spoke and utterly indifferent to her complainings and entreaties threw on the garments she had taken off and hurried out with headlong speed  the mother followed limping after her as she could and expostulating with no more effect upon her than upon the wind and rain and darkness that encompassed them obdurate and fierce in her own purpose and indifferent to all besides the daughter defied the weather and the distance as if she had known no travel or fatigue and made for the house where she had been relieved after some quarter of an hours walking the old woman spent and out of breath ventured to hold by her skirts but she ventured no more and they travelled on in silence through the wet and gloom if the mother now and then uttered a word of complaint she stifled it lest her daughter should break away from her and leave her behind and the daughter was dumb  it was within an hour or so of midnight when they left the regular streets behind them and entered on the deeper gloom of that neutral ground where the house was situated the town lay in the distance lurid and lowering the bleak wind howled over the open space all around was black wild desolate  this is a fit place for me said the daughter stopping to look back i thought so when i was here before today  alice my deary cried the mother pulling her gently by the skirt alice  what now mother  dont give the money back my darling please dont we cant afford it we want supper deary money is money whoever gives it say what you will but keep the money  see there was all the daughters answer that is the house i mean is that it  the old woman nodded in the affirmative and a few more paces brought them to the threshold there was the light of fire and candle in the room where alice had sat to dry her clothes and on her knocking at the door john carker appeared from that room  he was surprised to see such visitors at such an hour and asked alice what she wanted  i want your sister she said the woman who gave me money today  at the sound of her raised voice harriet came out  oh said alice you are here do you remember me  yes she answered wondering  the face that had humbled itself before her looked on her now with such invincible hatred and defiance and the hand that had gently touched her arm was clenched with such a show of evil purpose as if it would gladly strangle her that she drew close to her brother for protection  that i could speak with you and not know you that i could come near you and not feel what blood was running in your veins by the tingling of my own said alice with a menacing gesture  what do you mean what have i done  done returned the other you have sat me by your fire you have given me food and money you have bestowed your compassion on me you whose name i spit upon  the old woman with a malevolence that made her ugliness quite awful shook her withered hand at the brother and sister in confirmation of her daughter but plucked her by the skirts again nevertheless imploring her to keep the money  if i dropped a tear upon your hand may it wither it up if i spoke a gentle word in your hearing may it deafen you if i touched you with my lips may the touch be poison to you a curse upon this roof that gave me shelter sorrow and shame upon your head ruin upon all belonging to you  as she said the words she threw the money down upon the ground and spurned it with her foot  i tread it in the dust i wouldnt take it if it paved my way to heaven i would the bleeding foot that brought me here today had rotted off before it led me to your house  harriet pale and trembling restrained her brother and suffered her to go on uninterrupted  it was well that i should be pitied and forgiven by you or anyone of your name in the first hour of my return it was well that you should act the kind good lady to me ill thank you when i die ill pray for you and all your race you may be sure  with a fierce action of her hand as if she sprinkled hatred on the ground and with it devoted those who were standing there to destruction she looked up once at the black sky and strode out into the wild night  the mother who had plucked at her skirts again and again in vain and had eyed the money lying on the threshold with an absorbing greed that seemed to concentrate her faculties upon it would have prowled about until the house was dark and then groped in the mire on the chance of repossessing herself of it but the daughter drew her away and they set forth straight on their return to their dwelling the old woman whimpering and bemoaning their loss upon the road and fretfully bewailing as openly as she dared the undutiful conduct of her handsome girl in depriving her of a supper on the very first night of their reunion  supperless to bed she went saving for a few coarse fragments and those she sat mumbling and munching over a scrap of fire long after her undutiful daughter lay asleep  were this miserable mother and this miserable daughter only the reduction to their lowest grade of certain social vices sometimes prevailing higher up in this round world of many circles within circles do we make a weary journey from the high grade to the low to find at last that they lie close together that the two extremes touch and that our journeys end is but our startingplace allowing for great difference of stuff and texture was the pattern of this woof repeated among gentle blood at all  say edith dombey and cleopatra best of mothers let us have your testimony    chapter 35 the happy pair   the dark blot on the street is gone mr dombeys mansion if it be a gap among the other houses any longer is only so because it is not to be vied with in its brightness and haughtily casts them off the saying is that home is home be it never so homely if it hold good in the opposite contingency and home is home be it never so stately what an altar to the household gods is raised up here  lights are sparkling in the windows this evening and the ruddy glow of fires is warm and bright upon the hangings and soft carpets and the dinner waits to be served and the dinnertable is handsomely set forth though only for four persons and the side board is cumbrous with plate it is the first time that the house has been arranged for occupation since its late changes and the happy pair are looked for every minute  only second to the wedding morning in the interest and expectation it engenders among the household is this evening of the coming home mrs perch is in the kitchen taking tea and has made the tour of the establishment and priced the silks and damasks by the yard and exhausted every interjection in the dictionary and out of it expressive of admiration and wonder the upholsterers foreman who has left his hat with a pockethandkerchief in it both smelling strongly of varnish under a chair in the hall lurks about the house gazing upwards at the cornices and downward at the carpets and occasionally in a silent transport of enjoyment taking a rule out of his pocket and skirmishingly measuring expensive objects with unutterable feelings cook is in high spirits and says give her a place where theres plenty of company as shell bet you sixpence there will be now for she is of a lively disposition and she always was from a child and she dont mind who knows it which sentiment elicits from the breast of mrs perch a responsive murmur of support and approbation all the housemaid hopes is happiness for embut marriage is a lottery and the more she thinks about it the more she feels the independence and the safety of a single life mr towlinson is saturnine and grim and says thats his opinion too and give him war besides and down with the frenchfor this young man has a general impression that every foreigner is a frenchman and must be by the laws of nature  at each new sound of wheels they all stop whatever they are saying and listen and more than once there is a general starting up and a cry of here they are but here they are not yet and cook begins to mourn over the dinner which has been put back twice and the upholsterers foreman still goes lurking about the rooms undisturbed in his blissful reverie  florence is ready to receive her father and her new mama whether the emotions that are throbbing in her breast originate in pleasure or in pain she hardly knows but the fluttering heart sends added colour to her cheeks and brightness to her eyes and they say downstairs drawing their heads togetherfor they always speak softly when they speak of herhow beautiful miss florence looks tonight and what a sweet young lady she has grown poor dear a pause succeeds and then cook feeling as president that her sentiments are waited for wonders whetherand there stops the housemaid wonders too and so does mrs perch who has the happy social faculty of always wondering when other people wonder without being at all particular what she wonders at mr towlinson who now descries an opportunity of bringing down the spirits of the ladies to his own level says wait and see he wishes some people were well out of this cook leads a sigh then and a murmur of ah its a strange world it is indeed and when it has gone round the table adds persuasively but miss florence cant well be the worse for any change tom mr towlinsons rejoinder pregnant with frightful meaning is oh cant she though and sensible that a mere man can scarcely be more prophetic or improve upon that he holds his peace  mrs skewton prepared to greet her darling daughter and dear soninlaw with open arms is appropriately attired for that purpose in a very youthful costume with short sleeves at present however her ripe charms are blooming in the shade of her own apartments whence she had not emerged since she took possession of them a few hours ago and where she is fast growing fretful on account of the postponement of dinner the maid who ought to be a skeleton but is in truth a buxom damsel is on the other hand in a most amiable state considering her quarterly stipend much safer than heretofore and foreseeing a great improvement in her board and lodging  where are the happy pair for whom this brave home is waiting do steam tide wind and horses all abate their speed to linger on such happiness does the swarm of loves and graces hovering about them retard their progress by its numbers are there so many flowers in their happy path that they can scarcely move along without entanglement in thornless roses and sweetest briar  they are here at last the noise of wheels is heard grows louder and a carriage drives up to the door a thundering knock from the obnoxious foreigner anticipates the rush of mr towlinson and party to open it and mr dombey and his bride alight and walk in arm in arm  my sweetest edith cries an agitated voice upon the stairs my dearest dombey and the short sleeves wreath themselves about the happy couple in turn and embrace them  florence had come down to the hall too but did not advance reserving her timid welcome until these nearer and dearer transports should subside but the eyes of edith sought her out upon the threshold and dismissing her sensitive parent with a slight kiss on the cheek she hurried on to florence and embraced her  how do you do florence said mr dombey putting out his hand  as florence trembling raised it to her lips she met his glance the look was cold and distant enough but it stirred her heart to think that she observed in it something more of interest than he had ever shown before it even expressed a kind of faint surprise and not a disagreeable surprise at sight of her she dared not raise her eyes to his any more but she felt that he looked at her once again and not less favourably oh what a thrill of joy shot through her awakened by even this intangible and baseless confirmation of her hope that she would learn to win him through her new and beautiful mama  you will not be long dressing mrs dombey i presume said mr dombey  i shall be ready immediately  let them send up dinner in a quarter of an hour  with that mr dombey stalked away to his own dressingroom and mrs dombey went upstairs to hers mrs skewton and florence repaired to the drawingroom where that excellent mother considered it incumbent on her to shed a few irrepressible tears supposed to be forced from her by her daughters felicity and which she was still drying very gingerly with a laced corner of her pockethandkerchief when her soninlaw appeared  and how my dearest dombey did you find that delightfullest of cities paris she asked subduing her emotion  it was cold returned mr dombey  gay as ever said mrs skewton of course  not particularly i thought it dull said mr dombey  fie my dearest dombey archly dull  it made that impression upon me madam said mr dombey with grave politeness i believe mrs dombey found it dull too she mentioned once or twice that she thought it so  why you naughty girl cried mrs skewton rallying her dear child who now entered what dreadfully heretical things have you been saying about paris  edith raised her eyebrows with an air of weariness and passing the foldingdoors which were thrown open to display the suite of rooms in their new and handsome garniture and barely glancing at them as she passed sat down by florence  my dear dombey said mrs skewton how charmingly these people have carried out every idea that we hinted they have made a perfect palace of the house positively  it is handsome said mr dombey looking round i directed that no expense should be spared and all that money could do has been done i believe  and what can it not do dear dombey observed cleopatra  it is powerful madam said mr dombey  he looked in his solemn way towards his wife but not a word said she  i hope mrs dombey addressing her after a moments silence with especial distinctness that these alterations meet with your approval  they are as handsome as they can be she returned with haughty carelessness they should be so of course and i suppose they are  an expression of scorn was habitual to the proud face and seemed inseparable from it but the contempt with which it received any appeal to admiration respect or consideration on the ground of his riches no matter how slight or ordinary in itself was a new and different expression unequalled in intensity by any other of which it was capable whether mr dombey wrapped in his own greatness was at all aware of this or no there had not been wanting opportunities already for his complete enlightenment and at that moment it might have been effected by the one glance of the dark eye that lighted on him after it had rapidly and scornfully surveyed the theme of his selfglorification he might have read in that one glance that nothing that his wealth could do though it were increased ten thousand fold could win him for its own sake one look of softened recognition from the defiant woman linked to him but arrayed with her whole soul against him he might have read in that one glance that even for its sordid and mercenary influence upon herself she spurned it while she claimed its utmost power as her right her bargainas the base and worthless recompense for which she had become his wife he might have read in it that ever baring her own head for the lightning of her own contempt and pride to strike the most innocent allusion to the power of his riches degraded her anew sunk her deeper in her own respect and made the blight and waste within her more complete  but dinner was announced and mr dombey led down cleopatra edith and his daughter following sweeping past the gold and silver demonstration on the sideboard as if it were heapedup dirt and deigning to bestow no look upon the elegancies around her she took her place at his board for the first time and sat like a statue at the feast  mr dombey being a good deal in the statue way himself was well enough pleased to see his handsome wife immovable and proud and cold her deportment being always elegant and graceful this as a general behaviour was agreeable and congenial to him presiding therefore with his accustomed dignity and not at all reflecting on his wife by any warmth or hilarity of his own he performed his share of the honours of the table with a cool satisfaction and the installation dinner though not regarded downstairs as a great success or very promising beginning passed oil above in a sufficiently polite genteel and frosty manner  soon after tea mrs skewton who affected to be quite overcome and worn out by her emotions of happiness arising in the contemplation of her dear child united to the man of her heart but who there is reason to suppose found this family party somewhat dull as she yawned for one hour continually behind her fan retired to bed edith also silently withdrew and came back no more thus it happened that florence who had been upstairs to have some conversation with diogenes returning to the drawingroom with her little workbasket found no one there but her father who was walking to and fro in dreary magnificence  i beg your pardon shall i go away papa said florence faintly hesitating at the door  no returned mr dombey looking round over his shoulder you can come and go here florence as you please this is not my private room  florence entered and sat down at a distant little table with her work finding herself for the first time in her lifefor the very first time within her memory from her infancy to that houralone with her father as his companion she his natural companion his only child who in her lonely life and grief had known the suffering of a breaking heart who in her rejected love had never breathed his name to god at night but with a tearful blessing heavier on him than a curse who had prayed to die young so she might only die in his arms who had all through repaid the agony of slight and coldness and dislike with patient unexacting love excusing him and pleading for him like his better angel  she trembled and her eyes were dim his figure seemed to grow in height and bulk before her as he paced the room now it was all blurred and indistinct now clear again and plain and now she seemed to think that this had happened just the same a multitude of years ago she yearned towards him and yet shrunk from his approach unnatural emotion in a child innocent of wrong unnatural the hand that had directed the sharp plough which furrowed up her gentle nature for the sowing of its seeds  bent upon not distressing or offending him by her distress florence controlled herself and sat quietly at her work after a few more turns across and across the room he left off pacing it and withdrawing into a shadowy corner at some distance where there was an easy chair covered his head with a handkerchief and composed himself to sleep  it was enough for florence to sit there watching him turning her eyes towards his chair from time to time watching him with her thoughts when her face was intent upon her work and sorrowfully glad to think that he could sleep while she was there and that he was not made restless by her strange and longforbidden presence  what would have been her thoughts if she had known that he was steadily regarding her that the veil upon his face by accident or by design was so adjusted that his sight was free and that it never wandered from her face face an instant that when she looked towards him in the obscure dark corner her speaking eyes more earnest and pathetic in their voiceless speech than all the orators of all the world and impeaching him more nearly in their mute address met his and did not know it that when she bent her head again over her work he drew his breath more easily but with the same attention looked upon her stillupon her white brow and her falling hair and busy hands and once attracted seemed to have no power to turn his eyes away  and what were his thoughts meanwhile with what emotions did he prolong the attentive gaze covertly directed on his unknown daughter was there reproach to him in the quiet figure and the mild eyes had he begun to her disregarded claims and did they touch him home at last and waken him to some sense of his cruel injustice  there are yielding moments in the lives of the sternest and harshest men though such men often keep their secret well the sight of her in her beauty almost changed into a woman without his knowledge may have struck out some such moments even in his life of pride some passing thought that he had had a happy home within his reachhad had a household spirit bending at has feethad overlooked it in his stiffnecked sullen arrogance and wandered away and lost himself may have engendered them some simple eloquence distinctly heard though only uttered in her eyes unconscious that he read them as by the deathbeds i have tended by the childhood i have suffered by our meeting in this dreary house at midnight by the cry wrung from me in the anguish of my heart oh father turn to me and seek a refuge in my love before it is too late may have arrested them meaner and lower thoughts as that his dead boy was now superseded by new ties and he could forgive the having been supplanted in his affection may have occasioned them the mere association of her as an ornament with all the ornament and pomp about him may have been sufficient but as he looked he softened to her more and more as he looked she became blended with the child he had loved and he could hardly separate the two as he looked he saw her for an instant by a clearer and a brighter light not bending over that childs pillow as his rivalmonstrous thoughtbut as the spirit of his home and in the action tending himself no less as he sat once more with his boweddown head upon his hand at the foot of the little bed he felt inclined to speak to her and call her to him the words florence come here were rising to his lipsbut slowly and with difficulty they were so very strangewhen they were checked and stifled by a footstep on the stair  it was his wifes she had exchanged her dinner dress for a loose robe and unbound her hair which fell freely about her neck but this was not the change in her that startled him  florence dear she said i have been looking for you everywhere  as she sat down by the side of florence she stooped and kissed her hand he hardly knew his wife she was so changed it was not merely that her smile was new to himthough that he had never seen but her manner the tone of her voice the light of her eyes the interest and confidence and winning wish to please expressed in allthis was not edith  softly dear mama papa is asleep  it was edith now she looked towards the corner where he was and he knew that face and manner very well  i scarcely thought you could be here florence  again how altered and how softened in an instant  i left here early pursued edith purposely to sit upstairs and talk with you but going to your room i found my bird was flown and i have been waiting there ever since expecting its return  if it had been a bird indeed she could not have taken it more tenderly and gently to her breast than she did florence  come dear  papa will not expect to find me i suppose when he wakes hesitated florence  do you think he will florence said edith looking full upon her  florence drooped her head and rose and put up her workbasket edith drew her hand through her arm and they went out of the room like sisters her very step was different and new to him mr dombey thought as his eyes followed her to the door  he sat in his shadowy corner so long that the church clocks struck the hour three times before he moved that night all that while his face was still intent upon the spot where florence had been seated the room grew darker as the candles waned and went out but a darkness gathered on his face exceeding any that the night could cast and rested there  florence and edith seated before the fire in the remote room where little paul had died talked together for a long time diogenes who was of the party had at first objected to the admission of edith and even in deference to his mistresss wish had only permitted it under growling protest but emerging by little and little from the anteroom whither he had retired in dudgeon he soon appeared to comprehend that with the most amiable intentions he had made one of those mistakes which will occasionally arise in the bestregulated dogs minds as a friendly apology for which he stuck himself up on end between the two in a very hot place in front of the fire and sat panting at it with his tongue out and a most imbecile expression of countenance listening to the conversation  it turned at first on florences books and favourite pursuits and on the manner in which she had beguiled the interval since the marriage the last theme opened up to her a subject which lay very near her heart and she said with the tears starting to her eyes  oh mama i have had a great sorrow since that day  you a great sorrow florence  yes poor walter is drowned  florence spread her hands before her face and wept with all her heart many as were the secret tears which walters fate had cost her they flowed yet when she thought or spoke of him  but tell me dear said edith soothing her who was walter what was he to you  he was my brother mama after dear paul died we said we would be brother and sister i had known him a long timefrom a little child he knew paul who liked him very much paul said almost at the last take care of walter dear papa i was fond of him walter had been brought in to see him and was there thenin this room  and did he take care of walter inquired edith sternly  papa he appointed him to go abroad he was drowned in shipwreck on his voyage said florence sobbing  does he know that he is dead asked edith  i cannot tell mama i have no means of knowing dear mama cried florence clinging to her as for help and hiding her face upon her bosom i know that you have seen  stay stop florence edith turned so pale and spoke so earnestly that florence did not need her restraining hand upon her lips tell me all about walter first let me understand this history all through  florence related it and everything belonging to it even down to the friendship of mr toots of whom she could hardly speak in her distress without a tearful smile although she was deeply grateful to him when she had concluded her account to the whole of which edith holding her hand listened with close attention and when a silence had succeeded edith said  what is it that you know i have seen florence  that i am not said florence with the same mute appeal and the same quick concealment of her face as before that i am not a favourite child mama i never have been i have never known how to be i have missed the way and had no one to show it to me oh let me learn from you how to become dearer to papa teach me you who can so well and clinging closer to her with some broken fervent words of gratitude and endearment florence relieved of her sad secret wept long but not as painfully as of yore within the encircling arms of her new mother  pale even to her lips and with a face that strove for composure until its proud beauty was as fixed as death edith looked down upon the weeping girl and once kissed her then gradually disengaging herself and putting florence away she said stately and quiet as a marble image and in a voice that deepened as she spoke but had no other token of emotion in it  florence you do not know me heaven forbid that you should learn from me  not learn from you repeated florence in surprise  that i should teach you how to love or be loved heaven forbid said edith if you could teach me that were better but it is too late you are dear to me florence i did not think that anything could ever be so dear to me as you are in this little time  she saw that florence would have spoken here so checked her with her hand and went on  i will be your true friend always i will cherish you as much if not as well as anyone in this world could you may trust in mei know it and i say it dearwith the whole confidence even of your pure heart there are hosts of women whom he might have married better and truer in all other respects than i am florence but there is not one who could come here his wife whose heart could beat with greater truth to you than mine does  i know it dear mama cried florence from that first most happy day i have known it  most happy day edith seemed to repeat the words involuntarily and went on though the merit is not mine for i thought little of you until i saw you let the undeserved reward be mine in your trust and love and in thisin this florence on the first night of my taking up my abode here i am led on as it is best i should be to say it for the first and last time  florence without knowing why felt almost afraid to hear her proceed but kept her eyes riveted on the beautiful face so fixed upon her own  never seek to find in me said edith laying her hand upon her breast what is not here never if you can help it florence fall off from me because it is not here little by little you will know me better and the time will come when you will know me as i know myself then be as lenient to me as you can and do not turn to bitterness the only sweet remembrance i shall have  the tears that were visible in her eyes as she kept them fixed on florence showed that the composed face was but as a handsome mask but she preserved it and continued  i have seen what you say and know how true it is but believe meyou will soon if you cannot nowthere is no one on this earth less qualified to set it right or help you florence than i never ask me why or speak to me about it or of my husband more there should be so far a division and a silence between us two like the grave itself  she sat for some time silent florence scarcely venturing to breathe meanwhile as dim and imperfect shadows of the truth and all its daily consequences chased each other through her terrified yet incredulous imagination almost as soon as she had ceased to speak ediths face began to subside from its set composure to that quieter and more relenting aspect which it usually wore when she and florence were alone together she shaded it after this change with her hands and when she arose and with an affectionate embrace bade florence goodnight went quickly and without looking round  but when florence was in bed and the room was dark except for the glow of the fire edith returned and saying that she could not sleep and that her dressingroom was lonely drew a chair upon the hearth and watched the embers as they died away florence watched them too from her bed until they and the noble figure before them crowned with its flowing hair and in its thoughtful eyes reflecting back their light became confused and indistinct and finally were lost in slumber  in her sleep however florence could not lose an undefined impression of what had so recently passed it formed the subject of her dreams and haunted her now in one shape now in another but always oppressively and with a sense of fear she dreamed of seeking her father in wildernesses of following his track up fearful heights and down into deep mines and caverns of being charged with something that would release him from extraordinary sufferingshe knew not what or whyyet never being able to attain the goal and set him free then she saw him dead upon that very bed and in that very room and knew that he had never loved her to the last and fell upon his cold breast passionately weeping then a prospect opened and a river flowed and a plaintive voice she knew cried it is running on floy it has never stopped you are moving with it and she saw him at a distance stretching out his arms towards her while a figure such as walters used to be stood near him awfully serene and still in every vision edith came and went sometimes to her joy sometimes to her sorrow until they were alone upon the brink of a dark grave and edith pointing down she looked and sawwhatanother edith lying at the bottom  in the terror of this dream she cried out and awoke she thought a soft voice seemed to whisper in her ear florence dear florence it is nothing but a dream and stretching out her arms she returned the caress of her new mama who then went out at the door in the light of the grey morning in a moment florence sat up wondering whether this had really taken place or not but she was only certain that it was grey morning indeed and that the blackened ashes of the fire were on the hearth and that she was alone  so passed the night on which the happy pair came home    chapter 36 housewarming   many succeeding days passed in like manner except that there were numerous visits received and paid and that mrs skewton held little levees in her own apartments at which major bagstock was a frequent attendant and that florence encountered no second look from her father although she saw him every day nor had she much communication in words with her new mama who was imperious and proud to all the house but herflorence could not but observe thatand who although she always sent for her or went to her when she came home from visiting and would always go into her room at night before retiring to rest however late the hour and never lost an opportunity of being with her was often her silent and thoughtful companion for a long time together  florence who had hoped for so much from this marriage could not help sometimes comparing the bright house with the faded dreary place out of which it had arisen and wondering when in any shape it would begin to be a home for that it was no home then for anyone though everything went on luxuriously and regularly she had always a secret misgiving many an hour of sorrowful reflection by day and night and many a tear of blighted hope florence bestowed upon the assurance her new mama had given her so strongly that there was no one on the earth more powerless than herself to teach her how to win her fathers heart and soon florence began to thinkresolved to think would be the truer phrasethat as no one knew so well how hopeless of being subdued or changed her fathers coldness to her was so she had given her this warning and forbidden the subject in very compassion unselfish here as in her every act and fancy florence preferred to bear the pain of this new wound rather than encourage any faint foreshadowings of the truth as it concerned her father tender of him even in her wandering thoughts as for his home she hoped it would become a better one when its state of novelty and transition should be over and for herself thought little and lamented less  if none of the new family were particularly at home in private it was resolved that mrs dombey at least should be at home in public without delay a series of entertainments in celebration of the late nuptials and in cultivation of society were arranged chiefly by mr dombey and mrs skewton and it was settled that the festive proceedings should commence by mrs dombeys being at home upon a certain evening and by mr and mrs dombeys requesting the honour of the company of a great many incongruous people to dinner on the same day  accordingly mr dombey produced a list of sundry eastern magnates who were to be bidden to this feast on his behalf to which mrs skewton acting for her dearest child who was haughtily careless on the subject subjoined a western list comprising cousin feenix not yet returned to badenbaden greatly to the detriment of his personal estate and a variety of moths of various degrees and ages who had at various times fluttered round the light of her fair daughter or herself without any lasting injury to their wings florence was enrolled as a member of the dinnerparty by ediths commandelicited by a moments doubt and hesitation on the part of mrs skewton and florence with a wondering heart and with a quick instinctive sense of everything that grated on her father in the least took her silent share in the proceedings of the day  the proceedings commenced by mr dombey in a cravat of extraordinary height and stiffness walking restlessly about the drawingroom until the hour appointed for dinner punctual to which an east india director of immense wealth in a waistcoat apparently constructed in serviceable deal by some plain carpenter but really engendered in the tailors art and composed of the material called nankeen arrived and was received by mr dombey alone the next stage of the proceedings was mr dombeys sending his compliments to mrs dombey with a correct statement of the time and the next the east india directors falling prostrate in a conversational point of view and as mr dombey was not the man to pick him up staring at the fire until rescue appeared in the shape of mrs skewton whom the director as a pleasant start in life for the evening mistook for mrs dombey and greeted with enthusiasm  the next arrival was a bank director reputed to be able to buy up anythinghuman nature generally if he should take it in his head to influence the money market in that directionbut who was a wonderfully modestspoken man almost boastfully so and mentioned his little place at kingstonuponthames and its just being barely equal to giving dombey a bed and a chop if he would come and visit it ladies he said it was not for a man who lived in his quiet way to take upon himself to invitebut if mrs skewton and her daughter mrs dombey should ever find themselves in that direction and would do him the honour to look at a little bit of a shrubbery they would find there and a poor little flowerbed or so and a humble apology for a pinery and two or three little attempts of that sort without any pretension they would distinguish him very much carrying out his character this gentleman was very plainly dressed in a wisp of cambric for a neckcloth big shoes a coat that was too loose for him and a pair of trousers that were too spare and mention being made of the opera by mrs skewton he said he very seldom went there for he couldnt afford it it seemed greatly to delight and exhilarate him to say so and he beamed on his audience afterwards with his hands in his pockets and excessive satisfaction twinkling in his eyes  now mrs dombey appeared beautiful and proud and as disdainful and defiant of them all as if the bridal wreath upon her head had been a garland of steel spikes put on to force concession from her which she would die sooner than yield with her was florence when they entered together the shadow of the night of the return again darkened mr dombeys face but unobserved for florence did not venture to raise her eyes to his and ediths indifference was too supreme to take the least heed of him  the arrivals quickly became numerous more directors chairmen of public companies elderly ladies carrying burdens on their heads for full dress cousin feenix major bagstock friends of mrs skewton with the same bright bloom on their complexion and very precious necklaces on very withered necks among these a young lady of sixtyfive remarkably coolly dressed as to her back and shoulders who spoke with an engaging lisp and whose eyelids wouldnt keep up well without a great deal of trouble on her part and whose manners had that indefinable charm which so frequently attaches to the giddiness of youth as the greater part of mr dombeys list were disposed to be taciturn and the greater part of mrs dombeys list were disposed to be talkative and there was no sympathy between them mrs dombeys list by magnetic agreement entered into a bond of union against mr dombeys list who wandering about the rooms in a desolate manner or seeking refuge in corners entangled themselves with company coming in and became barricaded behind sofas and had doors opened smartly from without against their heads and underwent every sort of discomfiture  when dinner was announced mr dombey took down an old lady like a crimson velvet pincushion stuffed with bank notes who might have been the identical old lady of threadneedle street she was so rich and looked so unaccommodating cousin feenix took down mrs dombey major bagstock took down mrs skewton the young thing with the shoulders was bestowed as an extinguisher upon the east india director and the remaining ladies were left on view in the drawingroom by the remaining gentlemen until a forlorn hope volunteered to conduct them downstairs and those brave spirits with their captives blocked up the diningroom door shutting out seven mild men in the stonyhearted hall when all the rest were got in and were seated one of these mild men still appeared in smiling confusion totally destitute and unprovided for and escorted by the butler made the complete circuit of the table twice before his chair could be found which it finally was on mrs dombeys left hand after which the mild man never held up his head again  now the spacious diningroom with the company seated round the glittering table busy with their glittering spoons and knives and forks and plates might have been taken for a grownup exposition of tom tiddlers ground where children pick up gold and silver mr dombey as tiddler looked his character to admiration and the long plateau of precious metal frosted separating him from mrs dombey whereon frosted cupids offered scentless flowers to each of them was allegorical to see  cousin feenix was in great force and looked astonishingly young but he was sometimes thoughtless in his good humourhis memory occasionally wandering like his legsand on this occasion caused the company to shudder it happened thus the young lady with the back who regarded cousin feenix with sentiments of tenderness had entrapped the east india director into leading her to the chair next him in return for which good office she immediately abandoned the director who being shaded on the other side by a gloomy black velvet hat surmounting a bony and speechless female with a fan yielded to a depression of spirits and withdrew into himself cousin feenix and the young lady were very lively and humorous and the young lady laughed so much at something cousin feenix related to her that major bagstock begged leave to inquire on behalf of mrs skewton they were sitting opposite a little lower down whether that might not be considered public property  why upon my life said cousin feenix theres nothing in it it really is not worth repeating in point of fact its merely an anecdote of jack adams i dare say my friend dombey for the general attention was concentrated on cousin feenix may remember jack adams jack adams not joe that was his brother jacklittle jackman with a cast in his eye and slight impediment in his speechman who sat for somebodys borough we used to call him in my parliamentary time w p adams in consequence of his being warming pan for a young fellow who was in his minority perhaps my friend dombey may have known the man  mr dombey who was as likely to have known guy fawkes replied in the negative but one of the seven mild men unexpectedly leaped into distinction by saying he had known him and addingalways wore hessian boots  exactly said cousin feenix bending forward to see the mild man and smile encouragement at him down the table that was jack joe wore  tops cried the mild man rising in public estimation every instant  of course said cousin feenix you were intimate with em  i knew them both said the mild man with whom mr dombey immediately took wine  devilish good fellow jack said cousin feenix again bending forward and smiling  excellent returned the mild man becoming bold on his success one of the best fellows i ever knew  no doubt you have heard the story said cousin feenix  i shall know replied the bold mild man when i have heard your ludship tell it with that he leaned back in his chair and smiled at the ceiling as knowing it by heart and being already tickled  in point of fact its nothing of a story in itself said cousin feenix addressing the table with a smile and a gay shake of his head and not worth a word of preface but its illustrative of the neatness of jacks humour the fact is that jack was invited down to a marriagewhich i think took place in berkshire  shropshire said the bold mild man finding himself appealed to  was it well in point of fact it might have been in any shire said cousin feenix so my friend being invited down to this marriage in anyshire with a pleasant sense of the readiness of this joke goes just as some of us having had the honour of being invited to the marriage of my lovely and accomplished relative with my friend dombey didnt require to be asked twice and were devilish glad to be present on so interesting an occasiongoesjack goes now this marriage was in point of fact the marriage of an uncommonly fine girl with a man for whom she didnt care a button but whom she accepted on account of his property which was immense when jack returned to town after the nuptials a man he knew meeting him in the lobby of the house of commons says well jack how are the illmatched couple illmatched says jack not at all its a perfectly and equal transaction she is regularly bought and you may take your oath he is as regularly sold  in his full enjoyment of this culminating point of his story the shudder which had gone all round the table like an electric spark struck cousin feenix and he stopped not a smile occasioned by the only general topic of conversation broached that day appeared on any face a profound silence ensued and the wretched mild man who had been as innocent of any real foreknowledge of the story as the child unborn had the exquisite misery of reading in every eye that he was regarded as the prime mover of the mischief  mr dombeys face was not a changeful one and being cast in its mould of state that day showed little other apprehension of the story if any than that which he expressed when he said solemnly amidst the silence that it was very good there was a rapid glance from edith towards florence but otherwise she remained externally impassive and unconscious  through the various stages of rich meats and wines continual gold and silver dainties of earth air fire and water heapedup fruits and that unnecessary article in mr dombeys banquetsicethe dinner slowly made its way the later stages being achieved to the sonorous music of incessant double knocks announcing the arrival of visitors whose portion of the feast was limited to the smell thereof when mrs dombey rose it was a sight to see her lord with stiff throat and erect head hold the door open for the withdrawal of the ladies and to see how she swept past him with his daughter on her arm  mr dombey was a grave sight behind the decanters in a state of dignity and the east india director was a forlorn sight near the unoccupied end of the table in a state of solitude and the major was a military sight relating stories of the duke of york to six of the seven mild men the ambitious one was utterly quenched and the bank director was a lowly sight making a plan of his little attempt at a pinery with dessertknives for a group of admirers and cousin feenix was a thoughtful sight as he smoothed his long wristbands and stealthily adjusted his wig but all these sights were of short duration being speedily broken up by coffee and the desertion of the room  there was a throng in the staterooms upstairs increasing every minute but still mr dombeys list of visitors appeared to have some native impossibility of amalgamation with mrs dombeys list and no one could have doubted which was which the single exception to this rule perhaps was mr carker who now smiled among the company and who as he stood in the circle that was gathered about mrs dombeywatchful of her of them his chief cleopatra and the major florence and everything aroundappeared at ease with both divisions of guests and not marked as exclusively belonging to either  florence had a dread of him which made his presence in the room a nightmare to her she could not avoid the recollection of it for her eyes were drawn towards him every now and then by an attraction of dislike and distrust that she could not resist yet her thoughts were busy with other things for as she sat apartnot unadmired or unsought but in the gentleness of her quiet spiritshe felt how little part her father had in what was going on and saw with pain how ill at ease he seemed to be and how little regarded he was as he lingered about near the door for those visitors whom he wished to distinguish with particular attention and took them up to introduce them to his wife who received them with proud coldness but showed no interest or wish to please and never after the bare ceremony of reception in consultation of his wishes or in welcome of his friends opened her lips it was not the less perplexing or painful to florence that she who acted thus treated her so kindly and with such loving consideration that it almost seemed an ungrateful return on her part even to know of what was passing before her eyes  happy florence would have been might she have ventured to bear her father company by so much as a look and happy florence was in little suspecting the main cause of his uneasiness but afraid of seeming to know that he was placed at any did advantage lest he should be resentful of that knowledge and divided between her impulse towards him and her grateful affection for edith she scarcely dared to raise her eyes towards either anxious and unhappy for them both the thought stole on her through the crowd that it might have been better for them if this noise of tongues and tread of feet had never come thereif the old dulness and decay had never been replaced by novelty and splendourif the neglected child had found no friend in edith but had lived her solitary life unpitied and forgotten  mrs chick had some such thoughts too but they were not so quietly developed in her mind this good matron had been outraged in the first instance by not receiving an invitation to dinner that blow partially recovered she had gone to a vast expense to make such a figure before mrs dombey at home as should dazzle the senses of that lady and heap mortification mountains high on the head of mrs skewton  but i am made said mrs chick to mr chick of no more account than florence who takes the smallest notice of me no one  no one my dear assented mr chick who was seated by the side of mrs chick against the wall and could console himself even there by softly whistling  does it at all appear as if i was wanted here exclaimed mrs chick with flashing eyes  no my dear i dont think it does said mr chic  pauls mad said mrs chic  mr chick whistled  unless you are a monster which i sometimes think you are said mrs chick with candour dont sit there humming tunes how anyone with the most distant feelings of a man can see that motherinlaw of pauls dressed as she is going on like that with major bagstock for whom among other precious things we are indebted to your lucretia tox  my lucretia tox my dear said mr chick astounded  yes retorted mrs chick with great severity your lucretia toxi say how anybody can see that motherinlaw of pauls and that haughty wife of pauls and these indecent old frights with their backs and shoulders and in short this at home generally and hum on which word mrs chick laid a scornful emphasis that made mr chick start is i thank heaven a mystery to me  mr chick screwed his mouth into a form irreconcilable with humming or whistling and looked very contemplative  but i hope i know what is due to myself said mrs chick swelling with indignation though paul has forgotten what is due to me i am not going to sit here a member of this family to be taken no notice of i am not the dirt under mrs dombeys feet yetnot quite yet said mrs chick as if she expected to become so about the day after tomorrow and i shall go i will not say whatever i may think that this affair has been got up solely to degrade and insult me i shall merely go i shall not be missed  mrs chick rose erect with these words and took the arm of mr chick who escorted her from the room after half an hours shady sojourn there and it is due to her penetration to observe that she certainly was not missed at all  but she was not the only indignant guest for mr dombeys list still constantly in difficulties were as a body indignant with mrs dombeys list for looking at them through eyeglasses and audibly wondering who all those people were while mrs dombeys list complained of weariness and the young thing with the shoulders deprived of the attentions of that gay youth cousin feenix who went away from the dinnertable confidentially alleged to thirty or forty friends that she was bored to death all the old ladies with the burdens on their heads had greater or less cause of complaint against mr dombey and the directors and chairmen coincided in thinking that if dombey must marry he had better have married somebody nearer his own age not quite so handsome and a little better off the general opinion among this class of gentlemen was that it was a weak thing in dombey and hed live to repent it hardly anybody there except the mild men stayed or went away without considering himself or herself neglected and aggrieved by mr dombey or mrs dombey and the speechless female in the black velvet hat was found to have been stricken mute because the lady in the crimson velvet had been handed down before her the nature even of the mild men got corrupted either from their curdling it with too much lemonade or from the general inoculation that prevailed and they made sarcastic jokes to one another and whispered disparagement on stairs and in byeplaces the general dissatisfaction and discomfort so diffused itself that the assembled footmen in the hall were as well acquainted with it as the company above nay the very linkmen outside got hold of it and compared the party to a funeral out of mourning with none of the company remembered in the will at last the guests were all gone and the linkmen too and the street crowded so long with carriages was clear and the dying lights showed no one in the rooms but mr dombey and mr carker who were talking together apart and mrs dombey and her mother the former seated on an ottoman the latter reclining in the cleopatra attitude awaiting the arrival of her maid mr dombey having finished his communication to carker the latter advanced obsequiously to take leave  i trust he said that the fatigues of this delightful evening will not inconvenience mrs dombey tomorrow  mrs dombey said mr dombey advancing has sufficiently spared herself fatigue to relieve you from any anxiety of that kind i regret to say mrs dombey that i could have wished you had fatigued yourself a little more on this occasion  she looked at him with a supercilious glance that it seemed not worth her while to protract and turned away her eyes without speaking  i am sorry madam said mr dombey that you should not have thought it your duty  she looked at him again  your duty madam pursued mr dombey to have received my friends with a little more deference some of those whom you have been pleased to slight tonight in a very marked manner mrs dombey confer a distinction upon you i must tell you in any visit they pay you  do you know that there is someone here she returned now looking at him steadily  no carker i beg that you do not i insist that you do not cried mr dombey stopping that noiseless gentleman in his withdrawal mr carker madam as you know possesses my confidence he is as well acquainted as myself with the subject on which i speak i beg to tell you for your information mrs dombey that i consider these wealthy and important persons confer a distinction upon me and mr dombey drew himself up as having now rendered them of the highest possible importance  i ask you she repeated bending her disdainful steady gaze upon him do you know that there is someone here sir  i must entreat said mr carker stepping forward i must beg i must demand to be released slight and unimportant as this difference is  mrs skewton who had been intent upon her daughters face took him up here  my sweetest edith she said and my dearest dombey our excellent friend mr carker for so i am sure i ought to mention him  mr carker murmured too much honour  has used the very words that were in my mind and that i have been dying these ages for an opportunity of introducing slight and unimportant my sweetest edith and my dearest dombey do we not know that any difference between you twono flowers not now  flowers was the maid who finding gentlemen present retreated with precipitation  that any difference between you two resumed mrs skewton with the heart you possess in common and the excessively charming bond of feeling that there is between you must be slight and unimportant what words could better define the fact none therefore i am glad to take this slight occasionthis trifling occasion that is so replete with nature and your individual characters and all thatso truly calculated to bring the tears into a parents eyesto say that i attach no importance to them in the least except as developing these minor elements of soul and that unlike most mamasinlaw that odious phrase dear dombey as they have been represented to me to exist in this i fear too artificial world i never shall attempt to interpose between you at such a time and never can much regret after all such little flashes of the torch of whatshisnamenot cupid but the other delightful creature  there was a sharpness in the good mothers glance at both her children as she spoke that may have been expressive of a direct and wellconsidered purpose hidden between these rambling words that purpose providently to detach herself in the beginning from all the clankings of their chain that were to come and to shelter herself with the fiction of her innocent belief in their mutual affection and their adaptation to each other  i have pointed out to mrs dombey said mr dombey in his most stately manner that in her conduct thus early in our married life to which i object and which i request may be corrected carker with a nod of dismissal goodnight to you  mr carker bowed to the imperious form of the bride whose sparkling eye was fixed upon her husband and stopping at cleopatras couch on his way out raised to his lips the hand she graciously extended to him in lowly and admiring homage  if his handsome wife had reproached him or even changed countenance or broken the silence in which she remained by one word now that they were alone for cleopatra made off with all speed mr dombey would have been equal to some assertion of his case against her but the intense unutterable withering scorn with which after looking upon him she dropped her eyes as if he were too worthless and indifferent to her to be challenged with a syllablethe ineffable disdain and haughtiness in which she sat before himthe cold inflexible resolve with which her every feature seemed to bear him down and put him bythese he had no resource against and he left her with her whole overbearing beauty concentrated on despising him  was he coward enough to watch her an hour afterwards on the old well staircase where he had once seen florence in the moonlight toiling up with paul or was he in the dark by accident when looking up he saw her coming with a light from the room where florence lay and marked again the face so changed which he could not subdue  but it could never alter as his own did it never in its uttermost pride and passion knew the shadow that had fallen on his in the dark corner on the night of the return and often since and which deepened on it now as he looked up    chapter 37 more warnings than one   florence edith and mrs skewton were together next day and the carriage was waiting at the door to take them out for cleopatra had her galley again now and withers no longer thewan stood upright in a pigeonbreasted jacket and military trousers behind her wheelless chair at dinnertime and butted no more the hair of withers was radiant with pomatum in these days of down and he wore kid gloves and smelt of the water of cologne  they were assembled in cleopatras room the serpent of old nile not to mention her disrespectfully was reposing on her sofa sipping her morning chocolate at three oclock in the afternoon and flowers the maid was fastening on her youthful cuffs and frills and performing a kind of private coronation ceremony on her with a peachcoloured velvet bonnet the artificial roses in which nodded to uncommon advantage as the palsy trifled with them like a breeze  i think i am a little nervous this morning flowers said mrs skewton my hand quite shakes  you were the life of the party last night maam you know returned flowers and you suffer for it today you see  edith who had beckoned florence to the window and was looking out with her back turned on the toilet of her esteemed mother suddenly withdrew from it as if it had lightened  my darling child cried cleopatra languidly you are not nervous dont tell me my dear edith that you so enviably selfpossessed are beginning to be a martyr too like your unfortunately constituted mother withers someone at the door  card maam said withers taking it towards mrs dombey  i am going out she said without looking at it  my dear love drawled mrs skewton how very odd to send that message without seeing the name bring it here withers dear me my love mr carker too that very sensible person  i am going out repeated edith in so imperious a tone that withers going to the door imperiously informed the servant who was waiting mrs dombey is going out get along with you and shut it on him  but the servant came back after a short absence and whispered to withers again who once more and not very willingly presented himself before mrs dombey  if you please maam mr carker sends his respectful compliments and begs you would spare him one minute if you couldfor business maam if you please  really my love said mrs skewton in her mildest manner for her daughters face was threatening if you would allow me to offer a word i should recommend  show him this way said edith as withers disappeared to execute the command she added frowning on her mother as he comes at your recommendation let him come to your room  may ishall i go away asked florence hurriedly  edith nodded yes but on her way to the door florence met the visitor coming in with the same disagreeable mixture of familiarity and forbearance with which he had first addressed her he addressed her now in his softest mannerhoped she was quite wellneeded not to ask with such looks to anticipate the answerhad scarcely had the honour to know her last night she was so greatly changedand held the door open for her to pass out with a secret sense of power in her shrinking from him that all the deference and politeness of his manner could not quite conceal  he then bowed himself for a moment over mrs skewtons condescending hand and lastly bowed to edith coldly returning his salute without looking at him and neither seating herself nor inviting him to be seated she waited for him to speak  entrenched in her pride and power and with all the obduracy of her spirit summoned about her still her old conviction that she and her mother had been known by this man in their worst colours from their first acquaintance that every degradation she had suffered in her own eyes was as plain to him as to herself that he read her life as though it were a vile book and fluttered the leaves before her in slight looks and tones of voice which no one else could detect weakened and undermined her proudly as she opposed herself to him with her commanding face exacting his humility her disdainful lip repulsing him her bosom angry at his intrusion and the dark lashes of her eyes sullenly veiling their light that no ray of it might shine upon himand submissively as he stood before her with an entreating injured manner but with complete submission to her willshe knew in her own soul that the cases were reversed and that the triumph and superiority were his and that he knew it full well  i have presumed said mr carker to solicit an interview and i have ventured to describe it as being one of business because  perhaps you are charged by mr dombey with some message of reproof said edit you possess mr dombeys confidence in such an unusual degree sir that you would scarcely surprise me if that were your business  i have no message to the lady who sheds a lustre upon his name said mr carker but i entreat that lady on my own behalf to be just to a very humble claimant for justice at her handsa mere dependant of mr dombeyswhich is a position of humility and to reflect upon my perfect helplessness last night and the impossibility of my avoiding the share that was forced upon me in a very painful occasion  my dearest edith hinted cleopatra in a low voice as she held her eyeglass aside really very charming of mr whatshisname and full of heart  for i do said mr carker appealing to mrs skewton with a look of grateful deferencei do venture to call it a painful occasion though merely because it was so to me who had the misfortune to be present so slight a difference as between the principalsbetween those who love each other with disinterested devotion and would make any sacrifice of self in such a causeis nothing as mrs skewton herself expressed with so much truth and feeling last night it is nothing  edith could not look at him but she said after a few moments  and your business sir  edith my pet said mrs skewton all this time mr carker is standing my dear mr carker take a seat i beg  he offered no reply to the mother but fixed his eyes on the proud daughter as though he would only be bidden by her and was resolved to be bidden by her edith in spite of herself sat down and slightly motioned with her hand to him to be seated too no action could be colder haughtier more insolent in its air of supremacy and disrespect but she had struggled against even that concession ineffectually and it was wrested from her that was enough mr carker sat down  may i be allowed madam said carker turning his white teeth on mrs skewton like a lighta lady of your excellent sense and quick feeling will give me credit for good reason i am sureto address what i have to say to mrs dombey and to leave her to impart it to you who are her best and dearest friendnext to mr dombey  mrs skewton would have retired but edith stopped her edith would have stopped him too and indignantly ordered him to speak openly or not at all but that he said in a low voicemiss florencethe young lady who has just left the room  edith suffered him to proceed she looked at him now as he bent forward to be nearer with the utmost show of delicacy and respect and with his teeth persuasively arrayed in a selfdepreciating smile she felt as if she could have struck him dead  miss florences position he began has been an unfortunate one i have a difficulty in alluding to it to you whose attachment to her father is naturally watchful and jealous of every word that applies to him always distinct and soft in speech no language could describe the extent of his distinctness and softness when he said these words or came to any others of a similar import but as one who is devoted to mr dombey in his different way and whose life is passed in admiration of mr dombeys character may i say without offence to your tenderness as a wife that miss florence has unhappily been neglectedby her father may i say by her father  edith replied i know it  you know it said mr carker with a great appearance of relief it removes a mountain from my breast may i hope you know how the neglect originated in what an amiable phase of mr dombeys pridecharacter i mean  you may pass that by sir she returned and come the sooner to the end of what you have to say  indeed i am sensible madam replied carkertrust me i am deeply sensible that mr dombey can require no justification in anything to you but kindly judge of my breast by your own and you will forgive my interest in him if in its excess it goes at all astray  what a stab to her proud heart to sit there face to face with him and have him tendering her false oath at the altar again and again for her acceptance and pressing it upon her like the dregs of a sickening cup she could not own her loathing of or turn away from how shame remorse and passion raged within her when upright and majestic in her beauty before him she knew that in her spirit she was down at his feet  miss florence said carker left to the careif one may call it careof servants and mercenary people in every way her inferiors necessarily wanted some guide and compass in her younger days and naturally for want of them has been indiscreet and has in some degree forgotten her station there was some folly about one walter a common lad who is fortunately dead now and some very undesirable association i regret to say with certain coasting sailors of anything but good repute and a runaway old bankrupt  i have heard the circumstances sir said edith flashing her disdainful glance upon him and i know that you pervert them you may not know it i hope so  pardon me said mr carker i believe that nobody knows them so well as i your generous and ardent nature madamthe same nature which is so nobly imperative in vindication of your beloved and honoured husband and which has blessed him as even his merits deservei must respect defer to bow before but as regards the circumstances which is indeed the business i presumed to solicit your attention to i can have no doubt since in the execution of my trust as mr dombeys confidentiali presume to sayfriend i have fully ascertained them in my execution of that trust in my deep concern which you can so well understand for everything relating to him intensified if you will for i fear i labour under your displeasure by the lower motive of desire to prove my diligence and make myself the more acceptable i have long pursued these circumstances by myself and trustworthy instruments and have innumerable and most minute proofs  she raised her eyes no higher than his mouth but she saw the means of mischief vaunted in every tooth it contained  pardon me madam he continued if in my perplexity i presume to take counsel with you and to consult your pleasure i think i have observed that you are greatly interested in miss florence  what was there in her he had not observed and did not know humbled and yet maddened by the thought in every new presentment of it however faint she pressed her teeth upon her quivering lip to force composure on it and distantly inclined her head in reply  this interest madamso touching an evidence of everything associated with mr dombey being dear to youinduces me to pause before i make him acquainted with these circumstances which as yet he does not know it so shakes me if i may make the confession in my allegiance that on the intimation of the least desire to that effect from you i would suppress them  edith raised her head quickly and starting back bent her dark glance upon him he met it with his blandest and most deferential smile and went on  you say that as i describe them they are perverted i fear noti fear not but let us assume that they are the uneasiness i have for some time felt on the subject arises in this that the mere circumstance of such association often repeated on the part of miss florence however innocently and confidingly would be conclusive with mr dombey already predisposed against her and would lead him to take some step i know he has occasionally contemplated it of separation and alienation of her from his home madam bear with me and remember my intercourse with mr dombey and my knowledge of him and my reverence for him almost from childhood when i say that if he has a fault it is a lofty stubbornness rooted in that noble pride and sense of power which belong to him and which we must all defer to which is not assailable like the obstinacy of other characters and which grows upon itself from day to day and year to year  she bent her glance upon him still but look as steadfast as she would her haughty nostrils dilated and her breath came somewhat deeper and her lip would slightly curl as he described that in his patron to which they must all bow down he saw it and though his expression did not change she knew he saw it  even so slight an incident as last nights he said if i might refer to it once more would serve to illustrate my meaning better than a greater one dombey and son know neither time nor place nor season but bear them all down but i rejoice in its occurrence for it has opened the way for me to approach mrs dombey with this subject today even if it has entailed upon me the penalty of her temporary displeasure madam in the midst of my uneasiness and apprehension on this subject i was summoned by mr dombey to leamington there i saw you there i could not help knowing what relation you would shortly occupy towards himto his enduring happiness and yours there i resolved to await the time of your establishment at home here and to do as i have now done i have at heart no fear that i shall be wanting in my duty to mr dombey if i bury what i know in your breast for where there is but one heart and mind between two personsas in such a marriageone almost represents the other i can acquit my conscience therefore almost equally by confidence on such a theme in you or him for the reasons i have mentioned i would select you may i aspire to the distinction of believing that my confidence is accepted and that i am relieved from my responsibility  he long remembered the look she gave himwho could see it and forget itand the struggle that ensued within her at last she said  i accept it sir you will please to consider this matter at an end and that it goes no farther  he bowed low and rose she rose too and he took leave with all humility but withers meeting him on the stairs stood amazed at the beauty of his teeth and at his brilliant smile and as he rode away upon his whitelegged horse the people took him for a dentist such was the dazzling show he made the people took her when she rode out in her carriage presently for a great lady as happy as she was rich and fine but they had not seen her just before in her own room with no one by and they had not heard her utterance of the three words oh florence florence  mrs skewton reposing on her sofa and sipping her chocolate had heard nothing but the low word business for which she had a mortal aversion insomuch that she had long banished it from her vocabulary and had gone nigh in a charming manner and with an immense amount of heart to say nothing of soul to ruin divers milliners and others in consequence therefore mrs skewton asked no questions and showed no curiosity indeed the peachvelvet bonnet gave her sufficient occupation out of doors for being perched on the back of her head and the day being rather windy it was frantic to escape from mrs skewtons company and would be coaxed into no sort of compromise when the carriage was closed and the wind shut out the palsy played among the artificial roses again like an almshousefull of superannuated zephyrs and altogether mrs skewton had enough to do and got on but indifferently  she got on no better towards night for when mrs dombey in her dressingroom had been dressed and waiting for her half an hour and mr dombey in the drawingroom had paraded himself into a state of solemn fretfulness they were all three going out to dinner flowers the maid appeared with a pale face to mrs dombey saying  if you please maam i beg your pardon but i cant do nothing with missis  what do you mean asked edith  well maam replied the frightened maid i hardly know shes making faces  edith hurried with her to her mothers room cleopatra was arrayed in full dress with the diamonds short sleeves rouge curls teeth and other juvenility all complete but paralysis was not to be deceived had known her for the object of its errand and had struck her at her glass where she lay like a horrible doll that had tumbled down  they took her to pieces in very shame and put the little of her that was real on a bed doctors were sent for and soon came powerful remedies were resorted to opinions given that she would rally from this shock but would not survive another and there she lay speechless and staring at the ceiling for days sometimes making inarticulate sounds in answer to such questions as did she know who were present and the like sometimes giving no reply either by sign or gesture or in her unwinking eyes  at length she began to recover consciousness and in some degree the power of motion though not yet of speech one day the use of her right hand returned and showing it to her maid who was in attendance on her and appearing very uneasy in her mind she made signs for a pencil and some paper this the maid immediately provided thinking she was going to make a will or write some last request and mrs dombey being from home the maid awaited the result with solemn feelings  after much painful scrawling and erasing and putting in of wrong characters which seemed to tumble out of the pencil of their own accord the old woman produced this document                rosecoloured curtains  the maid being perfectly transfixed and with tolerable reason cleopatra amended the manuscript by adding two words more when it stood thus                rosecoloured curtains for doctors  the maid now perceived remotely that she wished these articles to be provided for the better presentation of her complexion to the faculty and as those in the house who knew her best had no doubt of the correctness of this opinion which she was soon able to establish for herself the rosecoloured curtains were added to her bed and she mended with increased rapidity from that hour she was soon able to sit up in curls and a laced cap and nightgown and to have a little artificial bloom dropped into the hollow caverns of her cheeks  it was a tremendous sight to see this old woman in her finery leering and mincing at death and playing off her youthful tricks upon him as if he had been the major but an alteration in her mind that ensued on the paralytic stroke was fraught with as much matter for reflection and was quite as ghastly  whether the weakening of her intellect made her more cunning and false than before or whether it confused her between what she had assumed to be and what she really had been or whether it had awakened any glimmering of remorse which could neither struggle into light nor get back into total darkness or whether in the jumble of her faculties a combination of these effects had been shaken up which is perhaps the more likely supposition the result was thisthat she became hugely exacting in respect of ediths affection and gratitude and attention to her highly laudatory of herself as a most inestimable parent and very jealous of having any rival in ediths regard further in place of remembering that compact made between them for an avoidance of the subject she constantly alluded to her daughters marriage as a proof of her being an incomparable mother and all this with the weakness and peevishness of such a state always serving for a sarcastic commentary on her levity and youthfulness  where is mrs dombey she would say to her maid  gone out maam  gone out does she go out to shun her mama flowers  la bless you no maam mrs dombey has only gone out for a ride with miss florence  miss florence whos miss florence dont tell me about miss florence whats miss florence to her compared to me  the apposite display of the diamonds or the peachvelvet bonnet she sat in the bonnet to receive visitors weeks before she could stir out of doors or the dressing of her up in some gaud or other usually stopped the tears that began to flow hereabouts and she would remain in a complacent state until edith came to see her when at a glance of the proud face she would relapse again  well i am sure edith she would cry shaking her head  what is the matter mother  matter i really dont know what is the matter the world is coming to such an artificial and ungrateful state that i begin to think theres no heartor anything of that sortleft in it positively withers is more a child to me than you are he attends to me much more than my own daughter i almost wish i didnt look so youngand all that kind of thingand then perhaps i should be more considered  what would you have mother  oh a great deal edith impatiently  is there anything you want that you have not it is your own fault if there be  my own fault beginning to whimper the parent i have been to you edith making you a companion from your cradle and when you neglect me and have no more natural affection for me than if i was a strangernot a twentieth part of the affection that you have for florencebut i am only your mother and should corrupt her in a dayyou reproach me with its being my own fault  mother mother i reproach you with nothing why will you always dwell on this  isnt it natural that i should dwell on this when i am all affection and sensitiveness and am wounded in the cruellest way whenever you look at me  i do not mean to wound you mother have you no remembrance of what has been said between us let the past rest  yes rest and let gratitude to me rest and let affection for me rest and let me rest in my outoftheway room with no society and no attention while you find new relations to make much of who have no earthly claim upon you good gracious edith do you know what an elegant establishment you are at the head of  yes hush  and that gentlemanly creature dombey do you know that you are married to him edith and that you have a settlement and a position and a carriage and i dont know what  indeed i know it mother well  as you would have had with that delightful good soulwhat did they call himgrangerif he hadnt died and who have you to thank for all this edith  you mother you  then put your arms round my neck and kiss me and show me edith that you know there never was a better mama than i have been to you and dont let me become a perfect fright with teasing and wearing myself at your ingratitude or when im out again in society no soul will know me not even that hateful animal the major  but sometimes when edith went nearer to her and bending down her stately head put her cold cheek to hers the mother would draw back as if she were afraid of her and would fall into a fit of trembling and cry out that there was a wandering in her wits and sometimes she would entreat her with humility to sit down on the chair beside her bed and would look at her as she sat there brooding with a face that even the rosecoloured curtains could not make otherwise than scared and wild  the rosecoloured curtains blushed in course of time on cleopatras bodily recovery and on her dressmore juvenile than ever to repair the ravages of illnessand on the rouge and on the teeth and on the curls and on the diamonds and the short sleeves and the whole wardrobe of the doll that had tumbled down before the mirror they blushed too now and then upon an indistinctness in her speech which she turned off with a girlish giggle and on an occasional failing in her memory that had no rule in it but came and went fantastically as if in mockery of her fantastic self  but they never blushed upon a change in the new manner of her thought and speech towards her daughter and though that daughter often came within their influence they never blushed upon her loveliness irradiated by a smile or softened by the light of filial love in its stem beauty    chapter 38 miss tox improves an old acquaintance   the forlorn miss tox abandoned by her friend louisa chick and bereft of mr dombeys countenancefor no delicate pair of wedding cards united by a silver thread graced the chimneyglass in princesss place or the harpsichord or any of those little posts of display which lucretia reserved for holiday occupationbecame depressed in her spirits and suffered much from melancholy for a time the bird waltz was unheard in princesss place the plants were neglected and dust collected on the miniature of miss toxs ancestor with the powdered head and pigtail   miss tox however was not of an age or of a disposition long to abandon herself to unavailing regrets only two notes of the harpsichord were dumb from disuse when the bird waltz again warbled and trilled in the crooked drawingroom only one slip of geranium fell a victim to imperfect nursing before she was gardening at her green baskets again regularly every morning the powderedheaded ancestor had not been under a cloud for more than six weeks when miss tox breathed on his benignant visage and polished him up with a piece of washleather  still miss tox was lonely and at a loss her attachments however ludicrously shown were real and strong and she was as she expressed it deeply hurt by the unmerited contumely she had met with from louisa but there was no such thing as anger in miss toxs composition if she had ambled on through life in her soft spoken way without any opinions she had at least got so far without any harsh passions the mere sight of louisa chick in the street one day at a considerable distance so overpowered her milky nature that she was fain to seek immediate refuge in a pastrycooks and there in a musty little back room usually devoted to the consumption of soups and pervaded by an oxtail atmosphere relieve her feelings by weeping plentifully  against mr dombey miss tox hardly felt that she had any reason of complaint her sense of that gentlemans magnificence was such that once removed from him she felt as if her distance always had been immeasurable and as if he had greatly condescended in tolerating her at all no wife could be too handsome or too stately for him according to miss toxs sincere opinion it was perfectly natural that in looking for one he should look high miss tox with tears laid down this proposition and fully admitted it twenty times a day she never recalled the lofty manner in which mr dombey had made her subservient to his convenience and caprices and had graciously permitted her to be one of the nurses of his little son she only thought in her own words that she had passed a great many happy hours in that house which she must ever remember with gratification and that she could never cease to regard mr dombey as one of the most impressive and dignified of men  cut off however from the implacable louisa and being shy of the major whom she viewed with some distrust now miss tox found it very irksome to know nothing of what was going on in mr dombeys establishment and as she really had got into the habit of considering dombey and son as the pivot on which the world in general turned she resolved rather than be ignorant of intelligence which so strongly interested her to cultivate her old acquaintance mrs richards who she knew since her last memorable appearance before mr dombey was in the habit of sometimes holding communication with his servants perhaps miss tox in seeking out the toodle family had the tender motive hidden in her breast of having somebody to whom she could talk about mr dombey no matter how humble that somebody might be  at all events towards the toodle habitation miss tox directed her steps one evening what time mr toodle cindery and swart was refreshing himself with tea in the bosom of his family mr toodle had only three stages of existence he was either taking refreshment in the bosom just mentioned or he was tearing through the country at from twentyfive to fifty miles an hour or he was sleeping after his fatigues he was always in a whirlwind or a calm and a peaceable contented easygoing man mr toodle was in either state who seemed to have made over all his own inheritance of fuming and fretting to the engines with which he was connected which panted and gasped and chafed and wore themselves out in a most unsparing manner while mr toodle led a mild and equable life  polly my gal said mr toodle with a young toodle on each knee and two more making tea for him and plenty more scattered aboutmr toodle was never out of children but always kept a good supply on handyou aint seen our biler lately have you  no replied polly but hes almost certain to look in tonight its his right evening and hes very regular  i suppose said mr toodle relishing his meal infinitely as our biler is a doin now about as well as a boy can do eh polly  oh hes a doing beautiful responded polly  he aint got to be at all secretlikehas he polly inquired mr toodle  no said mrs toodle plumply  im glad he aint got to be at all secretlike polly observed mr toodle in his slow and measured way and shovelling in his bread and butter with a clasp knife as if he were stoking himself because that dont look well do it polly  why of course it dont father how can you ask  you see my boys and gals said mr toodle looking round upon his family wotever youre up to in a honest way its my opinion as you cant do better than be open if you find yourselves in cuttings or in tunnels dont you play no secret games keep your whistles going and lets know where you are  the rising toodles set up a shrill murmur expressive of their resolution to profit by the paternal advice  but what makes you say this along of rob father asked his wife anxiously  polly old ooman said mr toodle i dont know as i said it partickler along o rob im sure i starts light with rob only i comes to a branch i takes on what i finds there and a whole train of ideas gets coupled on to him afore i knows where i am or where they comes from what a junction a mans thoughts is said mr toodle tobesure  this profound reflection mr toodle washed down with a pint mug of tea and proceeded to solidify with a great weight of bread and butter charging his young daughters meanwhile to keep plenty of hot water in the pot as he was uncommon dry and should take the indefinite quantity of a sight of mugs before his thirst was appeased  in satisfying himself however mr toodle was not regardless of the younger branches about him who although they had made their own evening repast were on the lookout for irregular morsels as possessing a relish these he distributed now and then to the expectant circle by holding out great wedges of bread and butter to be bitten at by the family in lawful succession and by serving out small doses of tea in like manner with a spoon which snacks had such a relish in the mouths of these young toodles that after partaking of the same they performed private dances of ecstasy among themselves and stood on one leg apiece and hopped and indulged in other saltatory tokens of gladness these vents for their excitement found they gradually closed about mr toodle again and eyed him hard as he got through more bread and butter and tea affecting however to have no further expectations of their own in reference to those viands but to be conversing on foreign subjects and whispering confidentially  mr toodle in the midst of this family group and setting an awful example to his children in the way of appetite was conveying the two young toodles on his knees to birmingham by special engine and was contemplating the rest over a barrier of bread and butter when rob the grinder in his souwester hat and mourning slops presented himself and was received with a general rush of brothers and sisters  well mother said rob dutifully kissing her how are you mother  theres my boy cried polly giving him a hug and a pat on the back secret bless you father not he  this was intended for mr toodles private edification but rob the grinder whose withers were not unwrung caught the words as they were spoken  what fathers been a saying something more again me has he cried the injured innocent oh what a hard thing it is that when a cove has once gone a little wrong a coves own father should be always a throwing it in his face behind his back its enough cried rob resorting to his coatcuff in anguish of spirit to make a cove go and do something out of spite  my poor boy cried polly father didnt mean anything  if father didnt mean anything blubbered the injured grinder why did he go and say anything mother nobody thinks half so bad of me as my own father does what a unnatural thing i wish somebodyd take and chop my head off father wouldnt mind doing it i believe and id much rather he did that than tother  at these desperate words all the young toodles shrieked a pathetic effect which the grinder improved by ironically adjuring them not to cry for him for they ought to hate him they ought if they was good boys and girls and this so touched the youngest toodle but one who was easily moved that it touched him not only in his spirit but in his wind too making him so purple that mr toodle in consternation carried him out to the waterbutt and would have put him under the tap but for his being recovered by the sight of that instrument  matters having reached this point mr toodle explained and the virtuous feelings of his son being thereby calmed they shook hands and harmony reigned again  will you do as i do biler my boy inquired his father returning to his tea with new strength  no thankee father master and i had tea together  and how is master rob said polly  well i dont know mother not much to boast on there aint no bisness done you see he dont know anything about itthe capen dont there was a man come into the shop this very day and says i want a soandso he sayssome hard name or another a which says the capen a soandso says the man brother says the capen will you take a observation round the shop well says the man ive done do you see wot you want says the capen no i dont says the man do you know it wen you do see it says the capen no i dont says the man why then i tell you wot my lad says the capen youd better go back and ask wot its like outside for no more dont i  that aint the way to make money though is it said polly  money mother hell never make money he has such ways as i never see he aint a bad master though ill say that for him but that aint much to me for i dont think i shall stop with him long  not stop in your place rob cried his mother while mr toodle opened his eyes  not in that place praps returned the grinder with a wink i shouldnt wonderfriends at court you knowbut never you mind mother just now im all right thats all  the indisputable proof afforded in these hints and in the grinders mysterious manner of his not being subject to that failing which mr toodle had by implication attributed to him might have led to a renewal of his wrongs and of the sensation in the family but for the opportune arrival of another visitor who to pollys great surprise appeared at the door smiling patronage and friendship on all there  how do you do mrs richards said miss tox i have come to see you may i come in  the cheery face of mrs richards shone with a hospitable reply and miss tox accepting the proffered chair and grab fully recognising mr toodle on her way to it untied her bonnet strings and said that in the first place she must beg the dear children one and all to come and kiss her  the illstarred youngest toodle but one who would appear from the frequency of his domestic troubles to have been born under an unlucky planet was prevented from performing his part in this general salutation by having fixed the souwester hat with which he had been previously trifling deep on his head hind side before and being unable to get it off again which accident presenting to his terrified imagination a dismal picture of his passing the rest of his days in darkness and in hopeless seclusion from his friends and family caused him to struggle with great violence and to utter suffocating cries being released his face was discovered to be very hot and red and damp and miss tox took him on her lap much exhausted  you have almost forgotten me sir i daresay said miss tox to mr toodle  no maam no said toodle but weve all on us got a little older since then  and how do you find yourself sir inquired miss tox blandly  hearty maam thankee replied toodle how do you find yourself maam do the rheumaticks keep off pretty well maam we must all expect to grow into em as we gets on  thank you said miss tox i have not felt any inconvenience from that disorder yet  youre wery fortunate maam returned mr toodle many people at your time of life maam is martyrs to it there was my mother but catching his wifes eye here mr toodle judiciously buried the rest in another mug of tea  you never mean to say mrs richards cried miss tox looking at rob that that is your  eldest maam said polly yes indeed it is thats the little fellow maam that was the innocent cause of so much  this here maam said toodle is him with the short legsand they was said mr toodle with a touch of poetry in his tone unusual short for leathersas mr dombey made a grinder on  the recollection almost overpowered miss tox the subject of it had a peculiar interest for her directly she asked him to shake hands and congratulated his mother on his frank ingenuous face rob overhearing her called up a look to justify the eulogium but it was hardly the right look  and now mrs richards said miss toxand you too sir addressing toodleill tell you plainly and truly what i have come here for you may be aware mrs richardsand possibly you may be aware too sirthat a little distance has interposed itself between me and some of my friends and that where i used to visit a good deal i do not visit now  polly who with a womans tact understood this at once expressed as much in a little look mr toodle who had not the faintest idea of what miss tox was talking about expressed that also in a stare  of course said miss tox how our little coolness has arisen is of no moment and does not require to be discussed it is sufficient for me to say that i have the greatest possible respect for and interest in mr dombey miss toxs voice faltered and everything that relates to him  mr toodle enlightened shook his head and said he had heerd it said and for his own part he did think as mr dombey was a difficult subject  pray dont say so sir if you please returned miss tox let me entreat you not to say so sir either now or at any future time such observations cannot but be very painful to me and to a gentleman whose mind is constituted as i am quite sure yours is can afford no permanent satisfaction  mr toodle who had not entertained the least doubt of offering a remark that would be received with acquiescence was greatly confounded  all that i wish to say mrs richards resumed miss toxand i address myself to you too siris this that any intelligence of the proceedings of the family of the welfare of the family of the health of the family that reaches you will be always most acceptable to me that i shall be always very glad to chat with mrs richards about the family and about old time and as mrs richards and i never had the least difference though i could wish now that we had been better acquainted but i have no one but myself to blame for that i hope she will not object to our being very good friends now and to my coming backwards and forwards here when i like without being a stranger now i really hope mrs richards said miss toxearnestly that you will take this as i mean it like a goodhumoured creature as you always were  polly was gratified and showed it mr toodle didnt know whether he was gratified or not and preserved a stolid calmness  you see mrs richards said miss toxand i hope you see too sirthere are many little ways in which i can be slightly useful to you if you will make no stranger of me and in which i shall be delighted to be so for instance i can teach your children something i shall bring a few little books if youll allow me and some work and of an evening now and then theyll learndear me theyll learn a great deal i trust and be a credit to their teacher  mr toodle who had a great respect for learning jerked his head approvingly at his wife and moistened his hands with dawning satisfaction  then not being a stranger i shall be in nobodys way said miss tox and everything will go on just as if i were not here mrs richards will do her mending or her ironing or her nursing whatever it is without minding me and youll smoke your pipe too if youre so disposed sir wont you  thankee mum said mr toodle yes ill take my bit of backer  very good of you to say so sir rejoined miss tox and i really do assure you now unfeignedly that it will be a great comfort to me and that whatever good i may be fortunate enough to do the children you will more than pay back to me if youll enter into this little bargain comfortably and easily and goodnaturedly without another word about it  the bargain was ratified on the spot and miss tox found herself so much at home already that without delay she instituted a preliminary examination of the children all roundwhich mr toodle much admiredand booked their ages names and acquirements on a piece of paper this ceremony and a little attendant gossip prolonged the time until after their usual hour of going to bed and detained miss tox at the toodle fireside until it was too late for her to walk home alone the gallant grinder however being still there politely offered to attend her to her own door and as it was something to miss tox to be seen home by a youth whom mr dombey had first inducted into those manly garments which are rarely mentioned by name she very readily accepted the proposal  after shaking hands with mr toodle and polly and kissing all the children miss tox left the house therefore with unlimited popularity and carrying away with her so light a heart that it might have given mrs chick offence if that good lady could have weighed it  rob the grinder in his modesty would have walked behind but miss tox desired him to keep beside her for conversational purposes and as she afterwards expressed it to his mother drew him out upon the road  he drew out so bright and clear and shining that miss tox was charmed with him the more miss tox drew him out the finer he camelike wire there never was a better or more promising youtha more affectionate steady prudent sober honest meek candid young manthan rob drew out that night  i am quite glad said miss tox arrived at her own door to know you i hope youll consider me your friend and that youll come and see me as often as you like do you keep a moneybox  yes maam returned rob im saving up against ive got enough to put in the bank maam  very laudable indeed said miss tox im glad to hear it put this halfcrown into it if you please  oh thank you maam replied rob but really i couldnt think of depriving you  i commend your independent spirit said miss tox but its no deprivation i assure you i shall be offended if you dont take it as a mark of my goodwill goodnight robin  goodnight maam said rob and thank you  who ran sniggering off to get change and tossed it away with a pieman but they never taught honour at the grinders school where the system that prevailed was particularly strong in the engendering of hypocrisy insomuch that many of the friends and masters of past grinders said if this were what came of education for the common people let us have none some more rational said let us have a better one but the governing powers of the grinders company were always ready for them by picking out a few boys who had turned out well in spite of the system and roundly asserting that they could have only turned out well because of it which settled the business of those objectors out of hand and established the glory of the grinders institution    chapter 39 further adventures of captain edward cuttle mariner   time sure of foot and strong of will had so pressed onward that the year enjoined by the old instrumentmaker as the term during which his friend should refrain from opening the sealed packet accompanying the letter he had left for him was now nearly expired and captain cuttle began to look at it of an evening with feelings of mystery and uneasiness  the captain in his honour would as soon have thought of opening the parcel one hour before the expiration of the term as he would have thought of opening himself to study his own anatomy he merely brought it out at a certain stage of his first evening pipe laid it on the table and sat gazing at the outside of it through the smoke in silent gravity for two or three hours at a spell sometimes when he had contemplated it thus for a pretty long while the captain would hitch his chair by degrees farther and farther off as if to get beyond the range of its fascination but if this were his design he never succeeded for even when he was brought up by the parlour wall the packet still attracted him or if his eyes in thoughtful wandering roved to the ceiling or the fire its image immediately followed and posted itself conspicuously among the coals or took up an advantageous position on the whitewash  in respect of hearts delight the captains parental and admiration knew no change but since his last interview with mr carker captain cuttle had come to entertain doubts whether his former intervention in behalf of that young lady and his dear boy walr had proved altogether so favourable as he could have wished and as he at the time believed the captain was troubled with a serious misgiving that he had done more harm than good in short and in his remorse and modesty he made the best atonement he could think of by putting himself out of the way of doing any harm to anyone and as it were throwing himself overboard for a dangerous person  selfburied therefore among the instruments the captain never went near mr dombeys house or reported himself in any way to florence or miss nipper he even severed himself from mr perch on the occasion of his next visit by dryly informing that gentleman that he thanked him for his company but had cut himself adrift from all such acquaintance as he didnt know what magazine he mightnt blow up without meaning of it in this selfimposed retirement the captain passed whole days and weeks without interchanging a word with anyone but rob the grinder whom he esteemed as a pattern of disinterested attachment and fidelity in this retirement the captain gazing at the packet of an evening would sit smoking and thinking of florence and poor walter until they both seemed to his homely fancy to be dead and to have passed away into eternal youth the beautiful and innocent children of his first remembrance  the captain did not however in his musings neglect his own improvement or the mental culture of rob the grinder that young man was generally required to read out of some book to the captain for one hour every evening and as the captain implicitly believed that all books were true he accumulated by this means many remarkable facts on sunday nights the captain always read for himself before going to bed a certain divine sermon once delivered on a mount and although he was accustomed to quote the text without book after his own manner he appeared to read it with as reverent an understanding of its heavenly spirit as if he had got it all by heart in greek and had been able to write any number of fierce theological disquisitions on its every phrase  rob the grinder whose reverence for the inspired writings under the admirable system of the grinders school had been developed by a perpetual bruising of his intellectual shins against all the proper names of all the tribes of judah and by the monotonous repetition of hard verses especially by way of punishment and by the parading of him at six years old in leather breeches three times a sunday very high up in a very hot church with a great organ buzzing against his drowsy head like an exceedingly busy beerob the grinder made a mighty show of being edified when the captain ceased to read and generally yawned and nodded while the reading was in progress the latter fact being never so much as suspected by the good captain  captain cuttle also as a man of business took to keeping books in these he entered observations on the weather and on the currents of the waggons and other vehicles which he observed in that quarter to set westward in the morning and during the greater part of the day and eastward towards the evening two or three stragglers appearing in one week who spoke himso the captain entered iton the subject of spectacles and who without positively purchasing said they would look in again the captain decided that the business was improving and made an entry in the daybook to that effect the wind then blowing which he first recorded pretty fresh west and by north having changed in the night  one of the captains chief difficulties was mr toots who called frequently and who without saying much seemed to have an idea that the little back parlour was an eligible room to chuckle in as he would sit and avail himself of its accommodations in that regard by the halfhour together without at all advancing in intimacy with the captain the captain rendered cautious by his late experience was unable quite to satisfy his mind whether mr toots was the mild subject he appeared to be or was a profoundly artful and dissimulating hypocrite his frequent reference to miss dombey was suspicious but the captain had a secret kindness for mr tootss apparent reliance on him and forbore to decide against him for the present merely eyeing him with a sagacity not to be described whenever he approached the subject that was nearest to his heart  captain gills blurted out mr toots one day all at once as his manner was do you think you could think favourably of that proposition of mine and give me the pleasure of your acquaintance  why i tell you what it is my lad replied the captain who had at length concluded on a course of action ive been turning that there over  captain gills its very kind of you retorted mr toots im much obliged to you upon my word and honour captain gills it would be a charity to give me the pleasure of your acquaintance it really would  you see brother argued the captain slowly i dont know you  but you never can know me captain gills replied mr toots steadfast to his point if you dont give me the pleasure of your acquaintance  the captain seemed struck by the originality and power of this remark and looked at mr toots as if he thought there was a great deal more in him than he had expected  well said my lad observed the captain nodding his head thoughtfully and true now lookee here youve made some observations to me which gives me to understand as you admire a certain sweet creetur hey  captain gills said mr toots gesticulating violently with the hand in which he held his hat admiration is not the word upon my honour you have no conception what my feelings are if i could be dyed black and made miss dombeys slave i should consider it a compliment if at the sacrifice of all my property i could get transmigrated into miss dombeys dogii really think i should never leave off wagging my tail i should be so perfectly happy captain gills  mr toots said it with watery eyes and pressed his hat against his bosom with deep emotion  my lad returned the captain moved to compassion if youre in arnest  captain gills cried mr toots im in such a state of mind and am so dreadfully in earnest that if i could swear to it upon a hot piece of iron or a live coal or melted lead or burning sealingwax or anything of that sort i should be glad to hurt myself as a relief to my feelings and mr toots looked hurriedly about the room as if for some sufficiently painful means of accomplishing his dread purpose  the captain pushed his glazed hat back upon his head stroked his face down with his heavy handmaking his nose more mottled in the processand planting himself before mr toots and hooking him by the lapel of his coat addressed him in these words while mr toots looked up into his face with much attention and some wonder  if youre in arnest you see my lad said the captain youre a object of clemency and clemency is the brightest jewel in the crown of a britons head for which youll overhaul the constitution as laid down in rule britannia and when found that is the charter as them garden angels was a singing of so many times over stand by this here proposal o yourn takes me a little aback and why because i holds my own only you understand in these here waters and havent got no consort and may be dont wish for none steady you hailed me first along of a certain young lady as you was chartered by now if you and me is to keep one anothers company at all that there young creeturs name must never be named nor referred to i dont know what harm maynt have been done by naming of it too free afore now and thereby i brings up short dye make me out pretty clear brother  well youll excuse me captain gills replied mr toots if i dont quite follow you sometimes but upon my word iits a hard thing captain gills not to be able to mention miss dombey i really have got such a dreadful load heremr toots pathetically touched his shirtfront with both handsthat i feel night and day exactly as if somebody was sitting upon me  them said the captain is the terms i offer if theyre hard upon you brother as mayhap they are give em a wide berth sheer off and part company cheerily  captain gills returned mr toots i hardly know how it is but after what you told me when i came here for the first time ii feel that id rather think about miss dombey in your society than talk about her in almost anybody elses therefore captain gills if youll give me the pleasure of your acquaintance i shall be very happy to accept it on your own conditions i wish to be honourable captain gills said mr toots holding back his extended hand for a moment and therefore i am obliged to say that i can not help thinking about miss dombey its impossible for me to make a promise not to think about her  my lad said the captain whose opinion of mr toots was much improved by this candid avowal a mans thoughts is like the winds and nobody cant answer for em for certain any length of time together is it a treaty as to words  as to words captain gills returned mr toots i think i can bind myself  mr toots gave captain cuttle his hand upon it then and there and the captain with a pleasant and gracious show of condescension bestowed his acquaintance upon him formally mr toots seemed much relieved and gladdened by the acquisition and chuckled rapturously during the remainder of his visit the captain for his part was not ill pleased to occupy that position of patronage and was exceedingly well satisfied by his own prudence and foresight  but rich as captain cuttle was in the latter quality he received a surprise that same evening from a no less ingenuous and simple youth than rob the grinder that artless lad drinking tea at the same table and bending meekly over his cup and saucer having taken sidelong observations of his master for some time who was reading the newspaper with great difficulty but much dignity through his glasses broke silence by saying  oh i beg your pardon captain but you maynt be in want of any pigeons may you sir  no my lad replied the captain  because i was wishing to dispose of mine captain said rob  ay ay cried the captain lifting up his bushy eyebrows a little  yes im going captain if you please said rob  going where are you going asked the captain looking round at him over the glasses  what didnt you know that i was going to leave you captain asked rob with a sneaking smile  the captain put down the paper took off his spectacles and brought his eyes to bear on the deserter  oh yes captain i am going to give you warning i thought youd have known that beforehand perhaps said rob rubbing his hands and getting up if you could be so good as provide yourself soon captain it would be a great convenience to me you couldnt provide yourself by tomorrow morning i am afraid captain could you do you think  and youre a going to desert your colours are you my lad said the captain after a long examination of his face  oh its very hard upon a cove captain cried the tender rob injured and indignant in a moment that he cant give lawful warning without being frowned at in that way and called a deserter you havent any right to call a poor cove names captain it aint because im a servant and youre a master that youre to go and libel me what wrong have i done come captain let me know what my crime is will you  the stricken grinder wept and put his coatcuff in his eye  come captain cried the injured youth give my crime a name what have i been and done have i stolen any of the property have i set the house afire if i have why dont you give me in charge and try it but to take away the character of a lad thats been a good servant to you because he cant afford to stand in his own light for your good what a injury it is and what a bad return for faithful service this is the way young coves is spiled and drove wrong i wonder at you captain i do  all of which the grinder howled forth in a lachrymose whine and backing carefully towards the door  and so youve got another berth have you my lad said the captain eyeing him intently  yes captain since you put it in that shape i have got another berth cried rob backing more and more a better berth than ive got here and one where i dont so much as want your good word captain which is fortnate for me after all the dirt youve throwd at me because im poor and cant afford to stand in my own light for your good yes i have got another berth and if it wasnt for leaving you unprovided captain id go to it now sooner than id take them names from you because im poor and cant afford to stand in my own light for your good why do you reproach me for being poor and not standing in my own light for your good captain how can you so demean yourself  look ye here my boy replied the peaceful captain dont you pay out no more of them words  well then dont you pay in no more of your words captain retorted the roused innocent getting louder in his whine and backing into the shop id sooner you took my blood than my character  because pursued the captain calmly you have heerd may be of such a thing as a ropes end  oh have i though captain cried the taunting grinder no i havent i never heerd of any such a article  well said the captain its my belief as youll know more about it pretty soon if you dont keep a bright lookout i can read your signals my lad you may go  oh i may go at once may i captain cried rob exulting in his success but mind i never asked to go at once captain you are not to take away my character again because you send me off of your own accord and youre not to stop any of my wages captain  his employer settled the last point by producing the tin canister and telling the grinders money out in full upon the table rob snivelling and sobbing and grievously wounded in his feelings took up the pieces one by one with a sob and a snivel for each and tied them up separately in knots in his pockethandkerchief then he ascended to the roof of the house and filled his hat and pockets with pigeons then came down to his bed under the counter and made up his bundle snivelling and sobbing louder as if he were cut to the heart by old associations then he whined goodnight captain i leave you without malice and then going out upon the doorstep pulled the little midshipmans nose as a parting indignity and went away down the street grinning triumphantly  the captain left to himself resumed his perusal of the news as if nothing unusual or unexpected had taken place and went reading on with the greatest assiduity but never a word did captain cuttle understand though he read a vast number for rob the grinder was scampering up one column and down another all through the newspaper  it is doubtful whether the worthy captain had ever felt himself quite abandoned until now but now old sol gills walter and hearts delight were lost to him indeed and now mr carker deceived and jeered him cruelly they were all represented in the false rob to whom he had held forth many a time on the recollections that were warm within him he had believed in the false rob and had been glad to believe in him he had made a companion of him as the last of the old ships company he had taken the command of the little midshipman with him at his right hand he had meant to do his duty by him and had felt almost as kindly towards the boy as if they had been shipwrecked and cast upon a desert place together and now that the false rob had brought distrust treachery and meanness into the very parlour which was a kind of sacred place captain cuttle felt as if the parlour might have gone down next and not surprised him much by its sinking or given him any very great concern  therefore captain cuttle read the newspaper with profound attention and no comprehension and therefore captain cuttle said nothing whatever about rob to himself or admitted to himself that he was thinking about him or would recognise in the most distant manner that rob had anything to do with his feeling as lonely as robinson crusoe  in the same composed businesslike way the captain stepped over to leadenhall market in the dusk and effected an arrangement with a private watchman on duty there to come and put up and take down the shutters of the wooden midshipman every night and morning he then called in at the eatinghouse to diminish by one half the daily rations theretofore supplied to the midshipman and at the publichouse to stop the traitors beer my young man said the captain in explanation to the young lady at the bar my young man having bettered himself miss lastly the captain resolved to take possession of the bed under the counter and to turn in there o nights instead of upstairs as sole guardian of the property  from this bed captain cuttle daily rose thenceforth and clapped on his glazed hat at six oclock in the morning with the solitary air of crusoe finishing his toilet with his goatskin cap and although his fears of a visitation from the savage tribe macstinger were somewhat cooled as similar apprehensions on the part of that lone mariner used to be by the lapse of a long interval without any symptoms of the cannibals he still observed a regular routine of defensive operations and never encountered a bonnet without previous survey from his castle of retreat in the meantime during which he received no call from mr toots who wrote to say he was out of town his own voice began to have a strange sound in his ears and he acquired such habits of profound meditation from much polishing and stowing away of the stock and from much sitting behind the counter reading or looking out of window that the red rim made on his forehead by the hard glazed hat sometimes ached again with excess of reflection  the year being now expired captain cuttle deemed it expedient to open the packet but as he had always designed doing this in the presence of rob the grinder who had brought it to him and as he had an idea that it would be regular and shipshape to open it in the presence of somebody he was sadly put to it for want of a witness in this difficulty he hailed one day with unusual delight the announcement in the shipping intelligence of the arrival of the cautious clara captain john bunsby from a coasting voyage and to that philosopher immediately dispatched a letter by post enjoining inviolable secrecy as to his place of residence and requesting to be favoured with an early visit in the evening season  bunsby who was one of those sages who act upon conviction took some days to get the conviction thoroughly into his mind that he had received a letter to this effect but when he had grappled with the fact and mastered it he promptly sent his boy with the message hes a coming tonight who being instructed to deliver those words and disappear fulfilled his mission like a tarry spirit charged with a mysterious warning  the captain well pleased to receive it made preparation of pipes and rum and water and awaited his visitor in the back parlour at the hour of eight a deep lowing as of a nautical bull outside the shopdoor succeeded by the knocking of a stick on the panel announced to the listening ear of captain cuttle that bunsby was alongside whom he instantly admitted shaggy and loose and with his stolid mahogany visage as usual appearing to have no consciousness of anything before it but to be attentively observing something that was taking place in quite another part of the world  bunsby said the captain grasping him by the hand what cheer my lad what cheer  shipmet replied the voice within bunsby unaccompanied by any sign on the part of the commander himself hearty hearty  bunsby said the captain rendering irrepressible homage to his genius here you are a man as can give an opinion as is brighter than dimondsand give me the lad with the tarry trousers as shines to me like dimonds bright for which youll overhaul the stanfells budget and when found make a note here you are a man as gave an opinion in this here very place that has come true every letter on it which the captain sincerely believed  ay ay growled bunsby  every letter said the captain  for why growled bunsby looking at his friend for the first time which way if so why not therefore with these oracular wordsthey seemed almost to make the captain giddy they launched him upon such a sea of speculation and conjecturethe sage submitted to be helped off with his pilotcoat and accompanied his friend into the back parlour where his hand presently alighted on the rumbottle from which he brewed a stiff glass of grog and presently afterwards on a pipe which he filled lighted and began to smoke  captain cuttle imitating his visitor in the matter of these particulars though the rapt and imperturbable manner of the great commander was far above his powers sat in the opposite corner of the fireside observing him respectfully and as if he waited for some encouragement or expression of curiosity on bunsbys part which should lead him to his own affairs but as the mahogany philosopher gave no evidence of being sentient of anything but warmth and tobacco except once when taking his pipe from his lips to make room for his glass he incidentally remarked with exceeding gruffness that his name was jack bunsbya declaration that presented but small opening for conversationthe captain bespeaking his attention in a short complimentary exordium narrated the whole history of uncle sols departure with the change it had produced in his own life and fortunes and concluded by placing the packet on the table  after a long pause mr bunsby nodded his head  open said the captain  bunsby nodded again  the captain accordingly broke the seal and disclosed to view two folded papers of which he severally read the endorsements thus last will and testament of solomon gills letter for ned cuttle  bunsby with his eye on the coast of greenland seemed to listen for the contents the captain therefore hemmed to clear his throat and read the letter aloud  my dear ned cuttle when i left home for the west indies  here the captain stopped and looked hard at bunsby who looked fixedly at the coast of greenland  in forlorn search of intelligence of my dear boy i knew that if you were acquainted with my design you would thwart it or accompany me and therefore i kept it secret if you ever read this letter ned i am likely to be dead you will easily forgive an old friends folly then and will feel for the restlessness and uncertainty in which he wandered away on such a wild voyage so no more of that i have little hope that my poor boy will ever read these words or gladden your eyes with the sight of his frank face any more no no no more said captain cuttle sorrowfully meditating no more there he lays all his days  mr bunsby who had a musical ear suddenly bellowed in the bays of biscay o which so affected the good captain as an appropriate tribute to departed worth that he shook him by the hand in acknowledgment and was fain to wipe his eyes  well well said the captain with a sigh as the lament of bunsby ceased to ring and vibrate in the skylight affliction sore long time he bore and let us overhaul the wollume and there find it  physicians observed bunsby was in vain  ay ay to be sure said the captain whats the good o them in two or three hundred fathoms o water then returning to the letter he read onbut if he should be by when it is opened the captain involuntarily looked round and shook his head or should know of it at any other time the captain shook his head again my blessing on him in case the accompanying paper is not legally written it matters very little for there is no one interested but you and he and my plain wish is that if he is living he should have what little there may be and if as i fear otherwise that you should have it ned you will respect my wish i know god bless you for it and for all your friendliness besides to solomon gills bunsby said the captain appealing to him solemnly what do you make of this there you sit a man as has had his head broke from infancy upards and has got a new opinion into it at every seam as has been opened now what do you make o this  if so be returned bunsby with unusual promptitude as hes dead my opinion is he wont come back no more if so be as hes alive my opinion is he will do i say he will no why not because the bearings of this obserwation lays in the application on it  bunsby said captain cuttle who would seem to have estimated the value of his distinguished friends opinions in proportion to the immensity of the difficulty he experienced in making anything out of them bunsby said the captain quite confounded by admiration you carry a weight of mind easy as would swamp one of my tonnage soon but in regard o this here will i dont mean to take no steps towards the propertylord forbidexcept to keep it for a more rightful owner and i hope yet as the rightful owner sol gills is living andll come back strange as it is that he aint forwarded no dispatches now what is your opinion bunsby as to stowing of these here papers away again and marking outside as they was opened such a day in the presence of john bunsby and edard cuttle  bunsby descrying no objection on the coast of greenland or elsewhere to this proposal it was carried into execution and that great man bringing his eye into the present for a moment affixed his signmanual to the cover totally abstaining with characteristic modesty from the use of capital letters captain cuttle having attached his own lefthanded signature and locked up the packet in the iron safe entreated his guest to mix another glass and smoke another pipe and doing the like himself fell a musing over the fire on the possible fortunes of the poor old instrumentmaker  and now a surprise occurred so overwhelming and terrific that captain cuttle unsupported by the presence of bunsby must have sunk beneath it and been a lost man from that fatal hour  how the captain even in the satisfaction of admitting such a guest could have only shut the door and not locked it of which negligence he was undoubtedly guilty is one of those questions that must for ever remain mere points of speculation or vague charges against destiny but by that unlocked door at this quiet moment did the fell macstinger dash into the parlour bringing alexander macstinger in her parental arms and confusion and vengeance not to mention juliana macstinger and the sweet childs brother charles macstinger popularly known about the scenes of his youthful sports as chowley in her train she came so swiftly and so silently like a rushing air from the neighbourhood of the east india docks that captain cuttle found himself in the very act of sitting looking at her before the calm face with which he had been meditating changed to one of horror and dismay  but the moment captain cuttle understood the full extent of his misfortune selfpreservation dictated an attempt at flight darting at the little door which opened from the parlour on the steep little range of cellarsteps the captain made a rush headforemost at the latter like a man indifferent to bruises and contusions who only sought to hide himself in the bowels of the earth in this gallant effort he would probably have succeeded but for the affectionate dispositions of juliana and chowley who pinning him by the legsone of those dear children holding on to eachclaimed him as their friend with lamentable cries in the meantime mrs macstinger who never entered upon any action of importance without previously inverting alexander macstinger to bring him within the range of a brisk battery of slaps and then sitting him down to cool as the reader first beheld him performed that solemn rite as if on this occasion it were a sacrifice to the furies and having deposited the victim on the floor made at the captain with a strength of purpose that appeared to threaten scratches to the interposing bunsby  the cries of the two elder macstingers and the wailing of young alexander who may be said to have passed a piebald childhood forasmuch as he was black in the face during one half of that fairy period of existence combined to make this visitation the more awful but when silence reigned again and the captain in a violent perspiration stood meekly looking at mrs macstinger its terrors were at their height  oh capen cuttle capen cuttle said mrs macstinger making her chin rigid and shaking it in unison with what but for the weakness of her sex might be described as her fist oh capen cuttle capen cuttle do you dare to look me in the face and not be struck down in the berth  the captain who looked anything but daring feebly muttered standby  oh i was a weak and trusting fool when i took you under my roof capen cuttle i was cried mrs macstinger to think of the benefits ive showered on that man and the way in which i brought my children up to love and honour him as if he was a father to em when there aint a housekeeper no nor a lodger in our street dont know that i lost money by that man and by his guzzlings and his muzzlingsmrs macstinger used the last word for the joint sake of alliteration and aggravation rather than for the expression of any ideaand when they cried out one and all shame upon him for putting upon an industrious woman up early and late for the good of her young family and keeping her poor place so clean that a individual might have ate his dinner yes and his tea too if he was so disposed off any one of the floors or stairs in spite of all his guzzlings and his muzzlings such was the care and pains bestowed upon him  mrs macstinger stopped to fetch her breath and her face flushed with triumph in this second happy introduction of captain cuttles muzzlings  and he runs awaaaycried mrs macstinger with a lengthening out of the last syllable that made the unfortunate captain regard himself as the meanest of men and keeps away a twelvemonth from a woman such is his conscience he hasnt the courage to meet her hiiigh long syllable again but steals away like a fellon why if that baby of mine said mrs macstinger with sudden rapidity was to offer to go and steal away id do my duty as a mother by him till he was covered with wales  the young alexander interpreting this into a positive promise to be shortly redeemed tumbled over with fear and grief and lay upon the floor exhibiting the soles of his shoes and making such a deafening outcry that mrs macstinger found it necessary to take him up in her arms where she quieted him ever and anon as he broke out again by a shake that seemed enough to loosen his teeth  a pretty sort of a man is capen cuttle said mrs macstinger with a sharp stress on the first syllable of the captains name to take on forand to lose sleep forand to faint along ofand to think dead forsoothand to go up and down the blessed town like a madwoman asking questions after oh a pretty sort of a man ha ha ha ha hes worth all that trouble and distress of mind and much more thats nothing bless you ha ha ha ha capen cuttle said mrs macstinger with severe reaction in her voice and manner i wish to know if youre acoming home  the frightened captain looked into his hat as if he saw nothing for it but to put it on and give himself up  capen cuttle repeated mrs macstinger in the same determined manner i wish to know if youre acoming home sir  the captain seemed quite ready to go but faintly suggested something to the effect of not making so much noise about it  ay ay ay said bunsby in a soothing tone awast my lass awast  and who may you be if you please retorted mrs macstinger with chaste loftiness did you ever lodge at number nine brig place sir my memory may be bad but not with me i think there was a mrs jollson lived at number nine before me and perhaps youre mistaking me for her that is my only ways of accounting for your familiarity sir  come come my lass awast awast said bunsby  captain cuttle could hardly believe it even of this great man though he saw it done with his waking eyes but bunsby advancing boldly put his shaggy blue arm round mrs macstinger and so softened her by his magic way of doing it and by these few wordshe said no morethat she melted into tears after looking upon him for a few moments and observed that a child might conquer her now she was so low in her courage  speechless and utterly amazed the captain saw him gradually persuade this inexorable woman into the shop return for rum and water and a candle take them to her and pacify her without appearing to utter one word presently he looked in with his pilotcoat on and said cuttle im agoing to act as convoy home and captain cuttle more to his confusion than if he had been put in irons himself for safe transport to brig place saw the family pacifically filing off with mrs macstinger at their head he had scarcely time to take down his canister and stealthily convey some money into the hands of juliana macstinger his former favourite and chowley who had the claim upon him that he was naturally of a maritime build before the midshipman was abandoned by them all and bunsby whispering that hed carry on smart and hail ned cuttle again before he went aboard shut the door upon himself as the last member of the party  some uneasy ideas that he must be walking in his sleep or that he had been troubled with phantoms and not a family of flesh and blood beset the captain at first when he went back to the little parlour and found himself alone illimitable faith in and immeasurable admiration of the commander of the cautious clara succeeded and threw the captain into a wondering trance  still as time wore on and bunsby failed to reappear the captain began to entertain uncomfortable doubts of another kind whether bunsby had been artfully decoyed to brig place and was there detained in safe custody as hostage for his friend in which case it would become the captain as a man of honour to release him by the sacrifice of his own liberty whether he had been attacked and defeated by mrs macstinger and was ashamed to show himself after his discomfiture whether mrs macstinger thinking better of it in the uncertainty of her temper had turned back to board the midshipman again and bunsby pretending to conduct her by a short cut was endeavouring to lose the family amid the wilds and savage places of the city above all what it would behove him captain cuttle to do in case of his hearing no more either of the macstingers or of bunsby which in these wonderful and unforeseen conjunctions of events might possibly happen  he debated all this until he was tired and still no bunsby he made up his bed under the counter all ready for turning in and still no bunsby at length when the captain had given him up for that night at least and had begun to undress the sound of approaching wheels was heard and stopping at the door was succeeded by bunsbys hail  the captain trembled to think that mrs macstinger was not to be got rid of and had been brought back in a coach  but no bunsby was accompanied by nothing but a large box which he hauled into the shop with his own hands and as soon as he had hauled in sat upon captain cuttle knew it for the chest he had left at mrs macstingers house and looking candle in hand at bunsby more attentively believed that he was three sheets in the wind or in plain words drunk it was difficult however to be sure of this the commander having no trace of expression in his face when sober  cuttle said the commander getting off the chest and opening the lid are these here your traps  captain cuttle looked in and identified his property  done pretty taut and trim hey shipmet said bunsby  the grateful and bewildered captain grasped him by the hand and was launching into a reply expressive of his astonished feelings when bunsby disengaged himself by a jerk of his wrist and seemed to make an effort to wink with his revolving eye the only effect of which attempt in his condition was nearly to overbalance him he then abruptly opened the door and shot away to rejoin the cautious clara with all speedsupposed to be his invariable custom whenever he considered he had made a point  as it was not his humour to be often sought captain cuttle decided not to go or send to him next day or until he should make his gracious pleasure known in such wise or failing that until some little time should have lapsed the captain therefore renewed his solitary life next morning and thought profoundly many mornings noons and nights of old sol gills and bunsbys sentiments concerning him and the hopes there were of his return much of such thinking strengthened captain cuttles hopes and he humoured them and himself by watching for the instrumentmaker at the dooras he ventured to do now in his strange libertyand setting his chair in its place and arranging the little parlour as it used to be in case he should come home unexpectedly he likewise in his thoughtfulness took down a certain little miniature of walter as a schoolboy from its accustomed nail lest it should shock the old man on his return the captain had his presentiments too sometimes that he would come on such a day and one particular sunday even ordered a double allowance of dinner he was so sanguine but come old solomon did not and still the neighbours noticed how the seafaring man in the glazed hat stood at the shopdoor of an evening looking up and down the street    chapter 40 domestic relations   it was not in the nature of things that a man of mr dombeys mood opposed to such a spirit as he had raised against himself should be softened in the imperious asperity of his temper or that the cold hard armour of pride in which he lived encased should be made more flexible by constant collision with haughty scorn and defiance it is the curse of such a natureit is a main part of the heavy retribution on itself it bears within itselfthat while deference and concession swell its evil qualities and are the food it grows upon resistance and a questioning of its exacting claims foster it too no less the evil that is in it finds equally its means of growth and propagation in opposites it draws support and life from sweets and bitters bowed down before or unacknowledged it still enslaves the breast in which it has its throne and worshipped or rejected is as hard a master as the devil in dark fables  towards his first wife mr dombey in his cold and lofty arrogance had borne himself like the removed being he almost conceived himself to be he had been mr dombey with her when she first saw him and he was mr dombey when she died he had asserted his greatness during their whole married life and she had meekly recognised it he had kept his distant seat of state on the top of his throne and she her humble station on its lowest step and much good it had done him so to live in solitary bondage to his one idea he had imagined that the proud character of his second wife would have been added to his ownwould have merged into it and exalted his greatness he had pictured himself haughtier than ever with ediths haughtiness subservient to his he had never entertained the possibility of its arraying itself against him and now when he found it rising in his path at every step and turn of his daily life fixing its cold defiant and contemptuous face upon him this pride of his instead of withering or hanging down its head beneath the shock put forth new shoots became more concentrated and intense more gloomy sullen irksome and unyielding than it had ever been before  who wears such armour too bears with him ever another heavy retribution it is of proof against conciliation love and confidence against all gentle sympathy from without all trust all tenderness all soft emotion but to deep stabs in the selflove it is as vulnerable as the bare breast to steel and such tormenting festers rankle there as follow on no other wounds no though dealt with the mailed hand of pride itself on weaker pride disarmed and thrown down  such wounds were his he felt them sharply in the solitude of his old rooms whither he now began often to retire again and pass long solitary hours it seemed his fate to be ever proud and powerful ever humbled and powerless where he would be most strong who seemed fated to work out that doom  who who was it who could win his wife as she had won his boy who was it who had shown him that new victory as he sat in the dark corner who was it whose least word did what his utmost means could not who was it who unaided by his love regard or notice thrived and grew beautiful when those so aided died who could it be but the same child at whom he had often glanced uneasily in her motherless infancy with a kind of dread lest he might come to hate her and of whom his foreboding was fulfilled for he did hate her in his heart  yes and he would have it hatred and he made it hatred though some sparkles of the light in which she had appeared before him on the memorable night of his return home with his bride occasionally hung about her still he knew now that she was beautiful he did not dispute that she was graceful and winning and that in the bright dawn of her womanhood she had come upon him a surprise but he turned even this against her in his sullen and unwholesome brooding the unhappy man with a dull perception of his alienation from all hearts and a vague yearning for what he had all his life repelled made a distorted picture of his rights and wrongs and justified himself with it against her the worthier she promised to be of him the greater claim he was disposed to antedate upon her duty and submission when had she ever shown him duty and submission did she grace his lifeor ediths had her attractions been manifested first to himor edith why he and she had never been from her birth like father and child they had always been estranged she had crossed him every way and everywhere she was leagued against him now her very beauty softened natures that were obdurate to him and insulted him with an unnatural triumph  it may have been that in all this there were mutterings of an awakened feeling in his breast however selfishly aroused by his position of disadvantage in comparison with what she might have made his life but he silenced the distant thunder with the rolling of his sea of pride he would bear nothing but his pride and in his pride a heap of inconsistency and misery and selfinflicted torment he hated her  to the moody stubborn sullen demon that possessed him his wife opposed her different pride in its full force they never could have led a happy life together but nothing could have made it more unhappy than the wilful and determined warfare of such elements his pride was set upon maintaining his magnificent supremacy and forcing recognition of it from her she would have been racked to death and turned but her haughty glance of calm inflexible disdain upon him to the last such recognition from edith he little knew through what a storm and struggle she had been driven onward to the crowning honour of his hand he little knew how much she thought she had conceded when she suffered him to call her wife  mr dombey was resolved to show her that he was supreme there must be no will but his proud he desired that she should be but she must be proud for not against him as he sat alone hardening he would often hear her go out and come home treading the round of london life with no more heed of his liking or disliking pleasure or displeasure than if he had been her groom her cold supreme indifferencehis own unquestioned attribute usurpedstung him more than any other kind of treatment could have done and he determined to bend her to his magnificent and stately will  he had been long communing with these thoughts when one night he sought her in her own apartment after he had heard her return home late she was alone in her brilliant dress and had but that moment come from her mothers room her face was melancholy and pensive when he came upon her but it marked him at the door for glancing at the mirror before it he saw immediately as in a pictureframe the knitted brow and darkened beauty that he knew so well  mrs dombey he said entering i must beg leave to have a few words with you  tomorrow she replied  there is no time like the present madam he returned you mistake your position i am used to choose my own times not to have them chosen for me i think you scarcely understand who and what i am mrs dombey  i think she answered that i understand you very well  she looked upon him as she said so and folding her white arms sparkling with gold and gems upon her swelling breast turned away her eyes  if she had been less handsome and less stately in her cold composure she might not have had the power of impressing him with the sense of disadvantage that penetrated through his utmost pride but she had the power and he felt it keenly he glanced round the room saw how the splendid means of personal adornment and the luxuries of dress were scattered here and there and disregarded not in mere caprice and carelessness or so he thought but in a steadfast haughty disregard of costly things and felt it more and more chaplets of flowers plumes of feathers jewels laces silks and satins look where he would he saw riches despised poured out and made of no account the very diamondsa marriage giftthat rose and fell impatiently upon her bosom seemed to pant to break the chain that clasped them round her neck and roll down on the floor where she might tread upon them  he felt his disadvantage and he showed it solemn and strange among this wealth of colour and voluptuous glitter strange and constrained towards its haughty mistress whose repellent beauty it repeated and presented all around him as in so many fragments of a mirror he was conscious of embarrassment and awkwardness nothing that ministered to her disdainful selfpossession could fail to gall him galled and irritated with himself he sat down and went on in no improved humour  mrs dombey it is very necessary that there should be some understanding arrived at between us your conduct does not please me madam  she merely glanced at him again and again averted her eyes but she might have spoken for an hour and expressed less  i repeat mrs dombey does not please me i have already taken occasion to request that it may be corrected i now insist upon it  you chose a fitting occasion for your first remonstrance sir and you adopt a fitting manner and a fitting word for your second you insist to me  madam said mr dombey with his most offensive air of state i have made you my wife you bear my name you are associated with my position and my reputation i will not say that the world in general may be disposed to think you honoured by that association but i will say that i am accustomed to insist to my connexions and dependents  which may you be pleased to consider me she asked  possibly i may think that my wife should partakeor does partake and cannot help herselfof both characters mrs dombey  she bent her eyes upon him steadily and set her trembling lips he saw her bosom throb and saw her face flush and turn white all this he could know and did but he could not know that one word was whispering in the deep recesses of her heart to keep her quiet and that the word was florence  blind idiot rushing to a precipice he thought she stood in awe of him  you are too expensive madam said mr dombey you are extravagant you waste a great deal of moneyor what would be a great deal in the pockets of most gentlemenin cultivating a kind of society that is useless to me and indeed that upon the whole is disagreeable to me i have to insist upon a total change in all these respects i know that in the novelty of possessing a tithe of such means as fortune has placed at your disposal ladies are apt to run into a sudden extreme there has been more than enough of that extreme i beg that mrs grangers very different experiences may now come to the instruction of mrs dombey  still the fixed look the trembling lips the throbbing breast the face now crimson and now white and still the deep whisper florence florence speaking to her in the beating of her heart  his insolence of selfimportance dilated as he saw this alteration in her swollen no less by her past scorn of him and his so recent feeling of disadvantage than by her present submission as he took it to be it became too mighty for his breast and burst all bounds why who could long resist his lofty will and pleasure he had resolved to conquer her and look here  you will further please madam said mr dombey in a tone of sovereign command to understand distinctly that i am to be deferred to and obeyed that i must have a positive show and confession of deference before the world madam i am used to this i require it as my right in short i will have it i consider it no unreasonable return for the worldly advancement that has befallen you and i believe nobody will be surprised either at its being required from you or at your making itto meto me he added with emphasis  no word from her no change in her her eyes upon him  i have learnt from your mother mrs dombey said mr dombey with magisterial importance what no doubt you know namely that brighton is recommended for her health mr carker has been so good  she changed suddenly her face and bosom glowed as if the red light of an angry sunset had been flung upon them not unobservant of the change and putting his own interpretation upon it mr dombey resumed  mr carker has been so good as to go down and secure a house there for a time on the return of the establishment to london i shall take such steps for its better management as i consider necessary one of these will be the engagement at brighton if it is to be effected of a very respectable reduced person there a mrs pipchin formerly employed in a situation of trust in my family to act as housekeeper an establishment like this presided over but nominally mrs dombey requires a competent head  she had changed her attitude before he arrived at these words and now satstill looking at him fixedlyturning a bracelet round and round upon her arm not winding it about with a light womanly touch but pressing and dragging it over the smooth skin until the white limb showed a bar of red  i observed said mr dombeyand this concludes what i deem it necessary to say to you at present mrs dombeyi observed a moment ago madam that my allusion to mr carker was received in a peculiar manner on the occasion of my happening to point out to you before that confidential agent the objection i had to your mode of receiving my visitors you were pleased to object to his presence you will have to get the better of that objection madam and to accustom yourself to it very probably on many similar occasions unless you adopt the remedy which is in your own hands of giving me no cause of complaint mr carker said mr dombey who after the emotion he had just seen set great store by this means of reducing his proud wife and who was perhaps sufficiently willing to exhibit his power to that gentleman in a new and triumphant aspect mr carker being in my confidence mrs dombey may very well be in yours to such an extent i hope mrs dombey he continued after a few moments during which in his increasing haughtiness he had improved on his idea i may not find it necessary ever to entrust mr carker with any message of objection or remonstrance to you but as it would be derogatory to my position and reputation to be frequently holding trivial disputes with a lady upon whom i have conferred the highest distinction that it is in my power to bestow i shall not scruple to avail myself of his services if i see occasion  and now he thought rising in his moral magnificence and rising a stiffer and more impenetrable man than ever she knows me and my resolution  the hand that had so pressed the bracelet was laid heavily upon her breast but she looked at him still with an unaltered face and said in a low voice  wait for gods sake i must speak to you  why did she not and what was the inward struggle that rendered her incapable of doing so for minutes while in the strong constraint she put upon her face it was as fixed as any statueslooking upon him with neither yielding nor unyielding liking nor hatred pride not humility nothing but a searching gaze  did i ever tempt you to seek my hand did i ever use any art to win you was i ever more conciliating to you when you pursued me than i have been since our marriage was i ever other to you than i am  it is wholly unnecessary madam said mr dombey to enter upon such discussions  did you think i loved you did you know i did not did you ever care man for my heart or propose to yourself to win the worthless thing was there any poor pretence of any in our bargain upon your side or on mine  these questions said mr dombey are all wide of the purpose madam  she moved between him and the door to prevent his going away and drawing her majestic figure to its height looked steadily upon him still  you answer each of them you answer me before i speak i see how can you help it you who know the miserable truth as well as i now tell me if i loved you to devotion could i do more than render up my whole will and being to you as you have just demanded if my heart were pure and all untried and you its idol could you ask more could you have more  possibly not madam he returned coolly  you know how different i am you see me looking on you now and you can read the warmth of passion for you that is breathing in my face not a curl of the proud lip not a flash of the dark eye nothing but the same intent and searching look accompanied these words you know my general history you have spoken of my mother do you think you can degrade or bend or break me to submission and obedience  mr dombey smiled as he might have smiled at an inquiry whether he thought he could raise ten thousand pounds  if there is anything unusual here she said with a slight motion of her hand before her brow which did not for a moment flinch from its immovable and otherwise expressionless gaze as i know there are unusual feelings here raising the hand she pressed upon her bosom and heavily returning it consider that there is no common meaning in the appeal i am going to make you yes for i am going she said it as in prompt reply to something in his face to appeal to you  mr dombey with a slightly condescending bend of his chin that rustled and crackled his stiff cravat sat down on a sofa that was near him to hear the appeal  if you can believe that i am of such a nature nowhe fancied he saw tears glistening in her eyes and he thought complacently that he had forced them from her though none fell on her cheek and she regarded him as steadily as everas would make what i now say almost incredible to myself said to any man who had become my husband but above all said to you you may perhaps attach the greater weight to it in the dark end to which we are tending and may come we shall not involve ourselves alone that might not be much but others  others he knew at whom that word pointed and frowned heavily  i speak to you for the sake of others also your own sake and for mine since our marriage you have been arrogant to me and i have repaid you in kind you have shown to me and everyone around us every day and hour that you think i am graced and distinguished by your alliance i do not think so and have shown that too it seems you do not understand or so far as your power can go intend that each of us shall take a separate course and you expect from me instead a homage you will never have  although her face was still the same there was emphatic confirmation of this never in the very breath she drew  i feel no tenderness towards you that you know you would care nothing for it if i did or could i know as well that you feel none towards me but we are linked together and in the knot that ties us as i have said others are bound up we must both die we are both connected with the dead already each by a little child let us forbear  mr dombey took a long respiration as if he would have said oh was this all  there is no wealth she went on turning paler as she watched him while her eyes grew yet more lustrous in their earnestness that could buy these words of me and the meaning that belongs to them once cast away as idle breath no wealth or power can bring them back i mean them i have weighed them and i will be true to what i undertake if you will promise to forbear on your part i will promise to forbear on mine we are a most unhappy pair in whom from different causes every sentiment that blesses marriage or justifies it is rooted out but in the course of time some friendship or some fitness for each other may arise between us i will try to hope so if you will make the endeavour too and i will look forward to a better and a happier use of age than i have made of youth or prime  throughout she had spoken in a low plain voice that neither rose nor fell ceasing she dropped the hand with which she had enforced herself to be so passionless and distinct but not the eyes with which she had so steadily observed him  madam said mr dombey with his utmost dignity i cannot entertain any proposal of this extraordinary nature  she looked at him yet without the least change  i cannot said mr dombey rising as he spoke consent to temporise or treat with you mrs dombey upon a subject as to which you are in possession of my opinions and expectations i have stated my ultimatum madam and have only to request your very serious attention to it  to see the face change to its old expression deepened in intensity to see the eyes droop as from some mean and odious object to see the lighting of the haughty brow to see scorn anger indignation and abhorrence starting into sight and the pale blank earnestness vanish like a mist he could not choose but look although he looked to his dismay  go sir she said pointing with an imperious hand towards the door our first and last confidence is at an end nothing can make us stranger to each other than we are henceforth  i shall take my rightful course madam said mr dombey undeterred you may be sure by any general declamation  she turned her back upon him and without reply sat down before her glass  i place my reliance on your improved sense of duty and more correct feeling and better reflection madam said mr dombey  she answered not one word he saw no more expression of any heed of him in the mirror than if he had been an unseen spider on the wall or beetle on the floor or rather than if he had been the one or other seen and crushed when she last turned from him and forgotten among the ignominious and dead vermin of the ground  he looked back as he went out at the door upon the welllighted and luxurious room the beautiful and glittering objects everywhere displayed the shape of edith in its rich dress seated before her glass and the face of edith as the glass presented it to him and betook himself to his old chamber of cogitation carrying away with him a vivid picture in his mind of all these things and a rambling and unaccountable speculation such as sometimes comes into a mans head how they would all look when he saw them next  for the rest mr dombey was very taciturn and very dignified and very confident of carrying out his purpose and remained so  he did not design accompanying the family to brighton but he graciously informed cleopatra at breakfast on the morning of departure which arrived a day or two afterwards that he might be expected down soon there was no time to be lost in getting cleopatra to any place recommended as being salutary for indeed she seemed upon the wane and turning of the earth earthy  without having undergone any decided second attack of her malady the old woman seemed to have crawled backward in her recovery from the first she was more lean and shrunken more uncertain in her imbecility and made stranger confusions in her mind and memory among other symptoms of this last affliction she fell into the habit of confounding the names of her two sonsinlaw the living and the deceased and in general called mr dombey either grangeby or domber or indifferently both  but she was youthful very youthful still and in her youthfulness appeared at breakfast before going away in a new bonnet made express and a travelling robe that was embroidered and braided like an old babys it was not easy to put her into a flyaway bonnet now or to keep the bonnet in its place on the back of her poor nodding head when it was got on in this instance it had not only the extraneous effect of being always on one side but of being perpetually tapped on the crown by flowers the maid who attended in the background during breakfast to perform that duty  now my dearest grangeby said mrs skewton you must posively prom she cut some of her words short and cut out others altogether come down very soon  i said just now madam returned mr dombey loudly and laboriously that i am coming in a day or two  bless you domber  here the major who was come to take leave of the ladies and who was staring through his apoplectic eyes at mrs skewtons face with the disinterested composure of an immortal being said  begad maam you dont ask old joe to come  sterious wretch whos he lisped cleopatra but a tap on the bonnet from flowers seeming to jog her memory she added oh you mean yourself you naughty creature  devilish queer sir whispered the major to mr dombey bad case never did wrap up enough the major being buttoned to the chin why who should j b mean by joe but old joe bagstockjosephyour slavejoe maam here heres the man here are the bagstock bellows maam cried the major striking himself a sounding blow on the chest  my dearest edithgrangebyits most trordinry thing said cleopatra pettishly that major  bagstock j b cried the major seeing that she faltered for his name  well it dont matter said cleopatra edith my love you know i never could remember nameswhat was it ohmost trordinry thing that so many people want to come down to see me im not going for long im coming back surely they can wait till i come back  cleopatra looked all round the table as she said it and appeared very uneasy  i wont have vistorsreally dont want visitors she said little reposeand all that sort of thingis what i quire no odious brutes must proach me till ive shaken off this numbness and in a grisly resumption of her coquettish ways she made a dab at the major with her fan but overset mr dombeys breakfast cup instead which was in quite a different direction  then she called for withers and charged him to see particularly that word was left about some trivial alterations in her room which must be all made before she came back and which must be set about immediately as there was no saying how soon she might come back for she had a great many engagements and all sorts of people to call upon withers received these directions with becoming deference and gave his guarantee for their execution but when he withdrew a pace or two behind her it appeared as if he couldnt help looking strangely at the major who couldnt help looking strangely at mr dombey who couldnt help looking strangely at cleopatra who couldnt help nodding her bonnet over one eye and rattling her knife and fork upon her plate in using them as if she were playing castanets  edith alone never lifted her eyes to any face at the table and never seemed dismayed by anything her mother said or did she listened to her disjointed talk or at least turned her head towards her when addressed replied in a few low words when necessary and sometimes stopped her when she was rambling or brought her thoughts back with a monosyllable to the point from which they had strayed the mother however unsteady in other things was constant in thisthat she was always observant of her she would look at the beautiful face in its marble stillness and severity now with a kind of fearful admiration now in a giggling foolish effort to move it to a smile now with capricious tears and jealous shakings of her head as imagining herself neglected by it always with an attraction towards it that never fluctuated like her other ideas but had constant possession of her from edith she would sometimes look at florence and back again at edith in a manner that was wild enough and sometimes she would try to look elsewhere as if to escape from her daughters face but back to it she seemed forced to come although it never sought hers unless sought or troubled her with one single glance  the best concluded mrs skewton affecting to lean girlishly upon the majors arm but heavily supported on the other side by flowers the maid and propped up behind by withers the page was conducted to the carriage which was to take her florence and edith to brighton  and is joseph absolutely banished said the major thrusting in his purple face over the steps damme maam is cleopatra so hardhearted as to forbid her faithful antony bagstock to approach the presence  go along said cleopatra i cant bear you you shall see me when i come back if you are very good  tell joseph he may live in hope maam said the major or hell die in despair  cleopatra shuddered and leaned back edith my dear she said tell him  what  such dreadful words said cleopatra he uses such dreadful words  edith signed to him to retire gave the word to go on and left the objectionable major to mr dombey to whom he returned whistling  ill tell you what sir said the major with his hands behind him and his legs very wide asunder a fair friend of ours has removed to queer street  what do you mean major inquired mr dombey  i mean to say dombey returned the major that youll soon be an orphaninlaw  mr dombey appeared to relish this waggish description of himself so very little that the major wound up with the horses cough as an expression of gravity  damme sir said the major there is no use in disguising a fact joe is blunt sir thats his nature if you take old josh at all you take him as you find him and a devilish rusty old rasper of a closetoothed j b file you do find him dombey said the major your wifes mother is on the move sir  i fear returned mr dombey with much philosophy that mrs skewton is shaken  shaken dombey said the major smashed  change however pursued mr dombey and attention may do much yet  dont believe it sir returned the major damme sir she never wrapped up enough if a man dont wrap up said the major taking in another button of his buff waistcoat he has nothing to fall back upon but some people will die they will do it damme they will theyre obstinate i tell you what dombey it may not be ornamental it may not be refined it may be rough and tough but a little of the genuine old english bagstock stamina sir would do all the good in the world to the human breed  after imparting this precious piece of information the major who was certainly trueblue whatever other endowments he may have had or wanted coming within the genuine old english classification which has never been exactly ascertained took his lobstereyes and his apoplexy to the club and choked there all day  cleopatra at one time fretful at another selfcomplacent sometimes awake sometimes asleep and at all times juvenile reached brighton the same night fell to pieces as usual and was put away in bed where a gloomy fancy might have pictured a more potent skeleton than the maid who should have been one watching at the rosecoloured curtains which were carried down to shed their bloom upon her  it was settled in high council of medical authority that she should take a carriage airing every day and that it was important she should get out every day and walk if she could edith was ready to attend heralways ready to attend her with the same mechanical attention and immovable beautyand they drove out alone for edith had an uneasiness in the presence of florence now that her mother was worse and told florence with a kiss that she would rather they two went alone  mrs skewton on one particular day was in the irresolute exacting jealous temper that had developed itself on her recovery from her first attack after sitting silent in the carriage watching edith for some time she took her hand and kissed it passionately the hand was neither given nor withdrawn but simply yielded to her raising of it and being released dropped down again almost as if it were insensible at this she began to whimper and moan and say what a mother she had been and how she was forgotten this she continued to do at capricious intervals even when they had alighted when she herself was halting along with the joint support of withers and a stick and edith was walking by her side and the carriage slowly following at a little distance  it was a bleak lowering windy day and they were out upon the downs with nothing but a bare sweep of land between them and the sky the mother with a querulous satisfaction in the monotony of her complaint was still repeating it in a low voice from time to time and the proud form of her daughter moved beside her slowly when there came advancing over a dark ridge before them two other figures which in the distance were so like an exaggerated imitation of their own that edith stopped  almost as she stopped the two figures stopped and that one which to ediths thinking was like a distorted shadow of her mother spoke to the other earnestly and with a pointing hand towards them that one seemed inclined to turn back but the other in which edith recognised enough that was like herself to strike her with an unusual feeling not quite free from fear came on and then they came on together  the greater part of this observation she made while walking towards them for her stoppage had been momentary nearer observation showed her that they were poorly dressed as wanderers about the country that the younger woman carried knitted work or some such goods for sale and that the old one toiled on emptyhanded  and yet however far removed she was in dress in dignity in beauty edith could not but compare the younger woman with herself still it may have been that she saw upon her face some traces which she knew were lingering in her own soul if not yet written on that index but as the woman came on returning her gaze fixing her shining eyes upon her undoubtedly presenting something of her own air and stature and appearing to reciprocate her own thoughts she felt a chill creep over her as if the day were darkening and the wind were colder  they had now come up the old woman holding out her hand importunately stopped to beg of mrs skewton the younger one stopped too and she and edith looked in one anothers eyes  what is it that you have to sell said edith  only this returned the woman holding out her wares without looking at them i sold myself long ago  my lady dont believe her croaked the old woman to mrs skewton dont believe what she says she loves to talk like that shes my handsome and undutiful daughter she gives me nothing but reproaches my lady for all i have done for her look at her now my lady how she turns upon her poor old mother with her looks  as mrs skewton drew her purse out with a trembling hand and eagerly fumbled for some money which the other old woman greedily watched fortheir heads all but touching in their hurry and decrepitudeedith interposed  i have seen you addressing the old woman before  yes my lady with a curtsey down in warwickshire the morning among the trees when you wouldnt give me nothing but the gentleman he give me something oh bless him bless him mumbled the old woman holding up her skinny hand and grinning frightfully at her daughter  its of no use attempting to stay me edith said mrs skewton angrily anticipating an objection from her you know nothing about it i wont be dissuaded i am sure this is an excellent woman and a good mother  yes my lady yes chattered the old woman holding out her avaricious hand thankee my lady lord bless you my lady sixpence more my pretty lady as a good mother yourself  and treated undutifully enough too my good old creature sometimes i assure you said mrs skewton whimpering there shake hands with me youre a very good old creaturefull of whatshisnameand all that youre all affection and et cetera aint you  oh yes my lady  yes im sure you are and sos that gentlemanly creature grangeby i must really shake hands with you again and now you can go you know and i hope addressing the daughter that youll show more gratitude and natural whatsitsname and all the rest of itbut i never remember namesfor there never was a better mother than the good old creatures been to you come edith  as the ruin of cleopatra tottered off whimpering and wiping its eyes with a gingerly remembrance of rouge in their neighbourhood the old woman hobbled another way mumbling and counting her money not one word more nor one other gesture had been exchanged between edith and the younger woman but neither had removed her eyes from the other for a moment they had remained confronted until now when edith as awakening from a dream passed slowly on  youre a handsome woman muttered her shadow looking after her but good looks wont save us and youre a proud woman but pride wont save us we had need to know each other when we meet again    chapter 41 new voices in the waves   all is going on as it was wont the waves are hoarse with repetition of their mystery the dust lies piled upon the shore the seabirds soar and hover the winds and clouds go forth upon their trackless flight the white arms beckon in the moonlight to the invisible country far away   with a tender melancholy pleasure florence finds herself again on the old ground so sadly trodden yet so happily and thinks of him in the quiet place where he and she have many and many a time conversed together with the water welling up about his couch and now as she sits pensive there she hears in the wild low murmur of the sea his little story told again his very words repeated and finds that all her life and hopes and griefs sincein the solitary house and in the pageant it has changed tohave a portion in the burden of the marvellous song  and gentle mr toots who wanders at a distance looking wistfully towards the figure that he dotes upon and has followed there but cannot in his delicacy disturb at such a time likewise hears the requiem of little dombey on the waters rising and falling in the lulls of their eternal madrigal in praise of florence yes and he faintly understands poor mr toots that they are saying something of a time when he was sensible of being brighter and not addlebrained and the tears rising in his eyes when he fears that he is dull and stupid now and good for little but to be laughed at diminish his satisfaction in their soothing reminder that he is relieved from present responsibility to the chicken by the absence of that game head of poultry in the country training at tootss cost for his great mill with the larkey boy  but mr toots takes courage when they whisper a kind thought to him and by slow degrees and with many indecisive stoppages on the way approaches florence stammering and blushing mr toots affects amazement when he comes near her and says having followed close on the carriage in which she travelled every inch of the way from london loving even to be choked by the dust of its wheels that he never was so surprised in all his life  and youve brought diogenes too miss dombey says mr toots thrilled through and through by the touch of the small hand so pleasantly and frankly given him  no doubt diogenes is there and no doubt mr toots has reason to observe him for he comes straightway at mr tootss legs and tumbles over himself in the desperation with which he makes at him like a very dog of montargis but he is checked by his sweet mistress  down di down dont you remember who first made us friends di for shame  oh well may di lay his loving cheek against her hand and run off and run back and run round her barking and run headlong at anybody coming by to show his devotion mr toots would run headlong at anybody too a military gentleman goes past and mr toots would like nothing better than to run at him full tilt  diogenes is quite in his native air isnt he miss dombey says mr toots  florence assents with a grateful smile  miss dombey says mr toots beg your pardon but if you would like to walk to blimbers iim going there  florence puts her arm in that of mr toots without a word and they walk away together with diogenes going on before mr tootss legs shake under him and though he is splendidly dressed he feels misfits and sees wrinkles in the masterpieces of burgess and co and wishes he had put on that brightest pair of boots  doctor blimbers house outside has as scholastic and studious an air as ever and up there is the window where she used to look for the pale face and where the pale face brightened when it saw her and the wasted little hand waved kisses as she passed the door is opened by the same weakeyed young man whose imbecility of grin at sight of mr toots is feebleness of character personified they are shown into the doctors study where blind homer and minerva give them audience as of yore to the sober ticking of the great clock in the hall and where the globes stand still in their accustomed places as if the world were stationary too and nothing in it ever perished in obedience to the universal law that while it keeps it on the roll calls everything to earth  and here is doctor blimber with his learned legs and here is mrs blimber with her skyblue cap and here cornelia with her sandy little row of curls and her bright spectacles still working like a sexton in the graves of languages here is the table upon which he sat forlorn and strange the new boy of the school and hither comes the distant cooing of the old boys at their old lives in the old room on the old principle  toots says doctor blimber i am very glad to see you toots  mr toots chuckles in reply  also to see you toots in such good company says doctor blimber  mr toots with a scarlet visage explains that he has met miss dombey by accident and that miss dombey wishing like himself to see the old place they have come together  you will like says doctor blimber to step among our young friends miss dombey no doubt all fellowstudents of yours toots once i think we have no new disciples in our little portico my dear says doctor blimber to cornelia since mr toots left us  except bitherstone returns cornelia  ay truly says the doctor bitherstone is new to mr toots  new to florence too almost for in the schoolroom bitherstoneno longer master bitherstone of mrs pipchinsshows in collars and a neckcloth and wears a watch but bitherstone born beneath some bengal star of illomen is extremely inky and his lexicon has got so dropsical from constant reference that it wont shut and yawns as if it really could not bear to be so bothered so does bitherstone its master forced at doctor blimbers highest pressure but in the yawn of bitherstone there is malice and snarl and he has been heard to say that he wishes he could catch old blimber in india hed precious soon find himself carried up the country by a few of his bitherstones coolies and handed over to the thugs he can tell him that  briggs is still grinding in the mill of knowledge and tozer too and johnson too and all the rest the older pupils being principally engaged in forgetting with prodigious labour everything they knew when they were younger all are as polite and as pale as ever and among them mr feeder ba with his bony hand and bristly head is still hard at it with his herodotus stop on just at present and his other barrels on a shelf behind him  a mighty sensation is created even among these grave young gentlemen by a visit from the emancipated toots who is regarded with a kind of awe as one who has passed the rubicon and is pledged never to come back and concerning the cut of whose clothes and fashion of whose jewellery whispers go about behind hands the bilious bitherstone who is not of mr tootss time affecting to despise the latter to the smaller boys and saying he knows better and that he should like to see him coming that sort of thing in bengal where his mother had got an emerald belonging to him that was taken out of the footstool of a rajah come now  bewildering emotions are awakened also by the sight of florence with whom every young gentleman immediately falls in love again except as aforesaid the bilious bitherstone who declines to do so out of contradiction black jealousies of mr toots arise and briggs is of opinion that he aint so very old after all but this disparaging insinuation is speedily made nought by mr toots saying aloud to mr feeder ba how are you feeder and asking him to come and dine with him today at the bedford in right of which feats he might set up as old parr if he chose unquestioned  there is much shaking of hands and much bowing and a great desire on the part of each young gentleman to take toots down in miss dombeys good graces and then mr toots having bestowed a chuckle on his old desk florence and he withdraw with mrs blimber and cornelia and doctor blimber is heard to observe behind them as he comes out last and shuts the door gentlemen we will now resume our studies for that and little else is what the doctor hears the sea say or has heard it saying all his life  florence then steals away and goes upstairs to the old bedroom with mrs blimber and cornelia mr toots who feels that neither he nor anybody else is wanted there stands talking to the doctor at the studydoor or rather hearing the doctor talk to him and wondering how he ever thought the study a great sanctuary and the doctor with his round turned legs like a clerical pianoforte an awful man florence soon comes down and takes leave mr toots takes leave and diogenes who has been worrying the weakeyed young man pitilessly all the time shoots out at the door and barks a glad defiance down the cliff while melia and another of the doctors female domestics looks out of an upper window laughing at that there toots and saying of miss dombey but really though nowaint she like her brother only prettier  mr toots who saw when florence came down that there were tears upon her face is desperately anxious and uneasy and at first fears that he did wrong in proposing the visit but he is soon relieved by her saying she is very glad to have been there again and by her talking quite cheerfully about it all as they walked on by the sea what with the voices there and her sweet voice when they come near mr dombeys house and mr toots must leave her he is so enslaved that he has not a scrap of freewill left when she gives him her hand at parting he cannot let it go  miss dombey i beg your pardon says mr toots in a sad fluster but if you would allow me toto  the smiling and unconscious look of florence brings him to a dead stop  if you would allow me toif you would not consider it a liberty miss dombey if i was towithout any encouragement at all if i was to hope you know says mr toots  florence looks at him inquiringly  miss dombey says mr toots who feels that he is in for it now i really am in that state of adoration of you that i dont know what to do with myself i am the most deplorable wretch if it wasnt at the corner of the square at present i should go down on my knees and beg and entreat of you without any encouragement at all just to let me hope that i maymay think it possible that you  oh if you please dont cries florence for the moment quite alarmed and distressed oh pray dont mr toots stop if you please dont say any more as a kindness and a favour to me dont  mr toots is dreadfully abashed and his mouth opens  you have been so good to me says florence i am so grateful to you i have such reason to like you for being a kind friend to me and i do like you so much and here the ingenuous face smiles upon him with the pleasantest look of honesty in the world that i am sure you are only going to say goodbye  certainly miss dombey says mr toots iithats exactly what i mean its of no consequence  goodbye cries florence  goodbye miss dombey stammers mr toots i hope you wont think anything about it itsits of no consequence thank you its not of the least consequence in the world  poor mr toots goes home to his hotel in a state of desperation locks himself into his bedroom flings himself upon his bed and lies there for a long time as if it were of the greatest consequence nevertheless but mr feeder ba is coming to dinner which happens well for mr toots or there is no knowing when he might get up again mr toots is obliged to get up to receive him and to give him hospitable entertainment  and the generous influence of that social virtue hospitality to make no mention of wine and good cheer opens mr tootss heart and warms him to conversation he does not tell mr feeder ba what passed at the corner of the square but when mr feeder asks him when it is to come off mr toots replies that there are certain subjectswhich brings mr feeder down a peg or two immediately mr toots adds that he dont know what right blimber had to notice his being in miss dombeys company and that if he thought he meant impudence by it hed have him out doctor or no doctor but he supposes its only his ignorance mr feeder says he has no doubt of it  mr feeder however as an intimate friend is not excluded from the subject mr toots merely requires that it should be mentioned mysteriously and with feeling after a few glasses of wine he gives miss dombeys health observing feeder you have no idea of the sentiments with which i propose that toast mr feeder replies oh yes i have my dear toots and greatly they redound to your honour old boy mr feeder is then agitated by friendship and shakes hands and says if ever toots wants a brother he knows where to find him either by post or parcel mr feeder likewise says that if he may advise he would recommend mr toots to learn the guitar or at least the flute for women like music when you are paying your addresses to em and he has found the advantage of it himself  this brings mr feeder ba to the confession that he has his eye upon cornelia blimber he informs mr toots that he dont object to spectacles and that if the doctor were to do the handsome thing and give up the business why there they areprovided for he says its his opinion that when a man has made a handsome sum by his business he is bound to give it up and that cornelia would be an assistance in it which any man might be proud of mr toots replies by launching wildly out into miss dombeys praises and by insinuations that sometimes he thinks he should like to blow his brains out mr feeder strongly urges that it would be a rash attempt and shows him as a reconcilement to existence cornelias portrait spectacles and all  thus these quiet spirits pass the evening and when it has yielded place to night mr toots walks home with mr feeder and parts with him at doctor blimbers door but mr feeder only goes up the steps and when mr toots is gone comes down again to stroll upon the beach alone and think about his prospects mr feeder plainly hears the waves informing him as he loiters along that doctor blimber will give up the business and he feels a soft romantic pleasure in looking at the outside of the house and thinking that the doctor will first paint it and put it into thorough repair  mr toots is likewise roaming up and down outside the casket that contains his jewel and in a deplorable condition of mind and not unsuspected by the police gazes at a window where he sees a light and which he has no doubt is florences but it is not for that is mrs skewtons room and while florence sleeping in another chamber dreams lovingly in the midst of the old scenes and their old associations live again the figure which in grim reality is substituted for the patient boys on the same theatre once more to connect itbut how differentlywith decay and death is stretched there wakeful and complaining ugly and haggard it lies upon its bed of unrest and by it in the terror of her unimpassioned lovelinessfor it has terror in the sufferers failing eyessits edith what do the waves say in the stillness of the night to them  edith what is that stone arm raised to strike me dont you see it  there is nothing mother but your fancy  but my fancy everything is my fancy look is it possible that you dont see it  indeed mother there is nothing should i sit unmoved if there were any such thing there  unmoved looking wildly at herits gone nowand why are you so unmoved that is not my fancy edith it turns me cold to see you sitting at my side  i am sorry mother  sorry you seem always sorry but it is not for me  with that she cries and tossing her restless head from side to side upon her pillow runs on about neglect and the mother she has been and the mother the good old creature was whom they met and the cold return the daughters of such mothers make in the midst of her incoherence she stops looks at her daughter cries out that her wits are going and hides her face upon the bed  edith in compassion bends over her and speaks to her the sick old woman clutches her round the neck and says with a look of horror  edith we are going home soon going back you mean that i shall go home again  yes mother yes  and what he saidwhatshisname i never could remember namesmajorthat dreadful word when we came awayits not true edith with a shriek and a stare its not that that is the matter with me  night after night the lights burn in the window and the figure lies upon the bed and edith sits beside it and the restless waves are calling to them both the whole night long night after night the waves are hoarse with repetition of their mystery the dust lies piled upon the shore the seabirds soar and hover the winds and clouds are on their trackless flight the white arms beckon in the moonlight to the invisible country far away  and still the sick old woman looks into the corner where the stone armpart of a figure of some tomb she saysis raised to strike her at last it falls and then a dumb old woman lies upon the the bed and she is crooked and shrunk up and half of her is dead  such is the figure painted and patched for the sun to mock that is drawn slowly through the crowd from day to day looking as it goes for the good old creature who was such a mother and making mouths as it peers among the crowd in vain such is the figure that is often wheeled down to the margin of the sea and stationed there but on which no wind can blow freshness and for which the murmur of the ocean has no soothing word she lies and listens to it by the hour but its speech is dark and gloomy to her and a dread is on her face and when her eyes wander over the expanse they see but a broad stretch of desolation between earth and heaven  florence she seldom sees and when she does is angry with and mows at edith is beside her always and keeps florence away and florence in her bed at night trembles at the thought of death in such a shape and often wakes and listens thinking it has come no one attends on her but edith it is better that few eyes should see her and her daughter watches alone by the bedside  a shadow even on that shadowed face a sharpening even of the sharpened features and a thickening of the veil before the eyes into a pall that shuts out the dim world is come her wandering hands upon the coverlet join feebly palm to palm and move towards her daughter and a voice not like hers not like any voice that speaks our mortal languagesays for i nursed you  edith without a tear kneels down to bring her voice closer to the sinking head and answers  mother can you hear me  staring wide she tries to nod in answer  can you recollect the night before i married  the head is motionless but it expresses somehow that she does  i told you then that i forgave your part in it and prayed god to forgive my own i told you that time past was at an end between us i say so now again kiss me mother  edith touches the white lips and for a moment all is still a moment afterwards her mother with her girlish laugh and the skeleton of the cleopatra manner rises in her bed  draw the rosecoloured curtains there is something else upon its flight besides the wind and clouds draw the rosecoloured curtains close   intelligence of the event is sent to mr dombey in town who waits upon cousin feenix not yet able to make up his mind for badenbaden who has just received it too a goodnatured creature like cousin feenix is the very man for a marriage or a funeral and his position in the family renders it right that he should be consulted  dombey said cousin feenix upon my soul i am very much shocked to see you on such a melancholy occasion my poor aunt she was a devilish lively woman  mr dombey replies very much so  and made up says cousin feenix really young you know considering i am sure on the day of your marriage i thought she was good for another twenty years in point of fact i said so to a man at brooksslittle billy joperyou know him no doubtman with a glass in his eye  mr dombey bows a negative in reference to the obsequies he hints whether there is any suggestion  well upon my life says cousin feenix stroking his chin which he has just enough of hand below his wristbands to do i really dont know theres a mausoleum down at my place in the park but im afraid its in bad repair and in point of fact in a devil of a state but for being a little out at elbows i should have had it put to rights but i believe the people come and make picnic parties there inside the iron railings  mr dombey is clear that this wont do  theres an uncommon good church in the village says cousin feenix thoughtfully pure specimen of the anglonorman style and admirably well sketched too by lady jane finchburywoman with tight staysbut theyve spoilt it with whitewash i understand and its a long journey  perhaps brighton itself mr dombey suggests  upon my honour dombey i dont think we could do better says cousin feenix its on the spot you see and a very cheerful place  and when hints mr dombey would it be convenient  i shall make a point says cousin feenix of pledging myself for any day you think best i shall have great pleasure melancholy pleasure of course in following my poor aunt to the confines of thein point of fact to the grave says cousin feenix failing in the other turn of speech  would monday do for leaving town says mr dombey  monday would suit me to perfection replies cousin feenix therefore mr dombey arranges to take cousin feenix down on that day and presently takes his leave attended to the stairs by cousin feenix who says at parting im really excessively sorry dombey that you should have so much trouble about it to which mr dombey answers not at all  at the appointed time cousin feenix and mr dombey meet and go down to brighton and representing in their two selves all the other mourners for the deceased ladys loss attend her remains to their place of rest cousin feenix sitting in the mourningcoach recognises innumerable acquaintances on the road but takes no other notice of them in decorum than checking them off aloud as they go by for mr dombeys information as tom johnson man with cork leg from whites what are you here tommy foley on a blood mare the smalder girlsand so forth at the ceremony cousin feenix is depressed observing that these are the occasions to make a man think in point of fact that he is getting shaky and his eyes are really moistened when it is over but he soon recovers and so do the rest of mrs skewtons relatives and friends of whom the major continually tells the club that she never did wrap up enough while the young lady with the back who has so much trouble with her eyelids says with a little scream that she must have been enormously old and that she died of all kinds of horrors and you mustnt mention it  so ediths mother lies unmentioned of her dear friends who are deaf to the waves that are hoarse with repetition of their mystery and blind to the dust that is piled upon the shore and to the white arms that are beckoning in the moonlight to the invisible country far away but all goes on as it was wont upon the margin of the unknown sea and edith standing there alone and listening to its waves has dank weed cast up at her feet to strew her path in life withal    chapter 42 confidential and accidental   attired no more in captain cuttles sable slops and souwester hat but dressed in a substantial suit of brown livery which while it affected to be a very sober and demure livery indeed was really as selfsatisfied and confident a one as tailor need desire to make rob the grinder thus transformed as to his outer man and all regardless within of the captain and the midshipman except when he devoted a few minutes of his leisure time to crowing over those inseparable worthies and recalling with much applauding music from that brazen instrument his conscience the triumphant manner in which he had disembarrassed himself of their company now served his patron mr carker inmate of mr carkers house and serving about his person rob kept his round eyes on the white teeth with fear and trembling and felt that he had need to open them wider than ever  he could not have quaked more through his whole being before the teeth though he had come into the service of some powerful enchanter and they had been his strongest spells the boy had a sense of power and authority in this patron of his that engrossed his whole attention and exacted his most implicit submission and obedience he hardly considered himself safe in thinking about him when he was absent lest he should feel himself immediately taken by the throat again as on the morning when he first became bound to him and should see every one of the teeth finding him out and taxing him with every fancy of his mind face to face with him rob had no more doubt that mr carker read his secret thoughts or that he could read them by the least exertion of his will if he were so inclined than he had that mr carker saw him when he looked at him the ascendancy was so complete and held him in such enthralment that hardly daring to think at all but with his mind filled with a constantly dilating impression of his patrons irresistible command over him and power of doing anything with him he would stand watching his pleasure and trying to anticipate his orders in a state of mental suspension as to all other things  rob had not informed himself perhapsin his then state of mind it would have been an act of no common temerity to inquirewhether he yielded so completely to this influence in any part because he had floating suspicions of his patrons being a master of certain treacherous arts in which he had himself been a poor scholar at the grinders school but certainly rob admired him as well as feared him mr carker perhaps was better acquainted with the sources of his power which lost nothing by his management of it  on the very night when he left the captains service rob after disposing of his pigeons and even making a bad bargain in his hurry had gone straight down to mr carkers house and hotly presented himself before his new master with a glowing face that seemed to expect commendation  what scapegrace said mr carker glancing at his bundle have you left your situation and come to me  oh if you please sir faltered rob you said you know when i come here last  i said returned mr carker what did i say  if you please sir you didnt say nothing at all sir returned rob warned by the manner of this inquiry and very much disconcerted  his patron looked at him with a wide display of gums and shaking his forefinger observed  youll come to an evil end my vagabond friend i foresee theres ruin in store for you  oh if you please dont sir cried rob with his legs trembling under him im sure sir i only want to work for you sir and to wait upon you sir and to do faithful whatever im bid sir  you had better do faithfully whatever you are bid returned his patron if you have anything to do with me  yes i know that sir pleaded the submissive rob im sure of that sir if youll only be so good as try me sir and if ever you find me out sir doing anything against your wishes i give you leave to kill me  you dog said mr carker leaning back in his chair and smiling at him serenely thats nothing to what id do to you if you tried to deceive me  yes sir replied the abject grinder im sure you would be down upon me dreadful sir i wouldnt attempt for to go and do it sir not if i was bribed with golden guineas  thoroughly checked in his expectations of commendation the crestfallen grinder stood looking at his patron and vainly endeavouring not to look at him with the uneasiness which a cur will often manifest in a similar situation  so you have left your old service and come here to ask me to take you into mine eh said mr carker  yes if you please sir returned rob who in doing so had acted on his patrons own instructions but dared not justify himself by the least insinuation to that effect  well said mr carker you know me boy  please sir yes sir returned rob tumbling with his hat and still fixed by mr carkers eye and fruitlessly endeavouring to unfix himself  mr carker nodded take care then  rob expressed in a number of short bows his lively understanding of this caution and was bowing himself back to the door greatly relieved by the prospect of getting on the outside of it when his patron stopped him  halloa he cried calling him roughly back you have beenshut that door  rob obeyed as if his life had depended on his alacrity  you have been used to eavesdropping do you know what that means  listening sir rob hazarded after some embarrassed reflection  his patron nodded and watching and so forth  i wouldnt do such a thing here sir answered rob upon my word and honour i wouldnt sir i wish i may die if i would sir for anything that could be promised to me i should consider it is as much as all the world was worth to offer to do such a thing unless i was ordered sir  you had better not you have been used too to babbling and tattling said his patron with perfect coolness beware of that here or youre a lost rascal and he smiled again and again cautioned him with his forefinger  the grinders breath came short and thick with consternation he tried to protest the purity of his intentions but could only stare at the smiling gentleman in a stupor of submission with which the smiling gentleman seemed well enough satisfied for he ordered him downstairs after observing him for some moments in silence and gave him to understand that he was retained in his employment this was the manner of rob the grinders engagement by mr carker and his awestricken devotion to that gentleman had strengthened and increased if possible with every minute of his service  it was a service of some months duration when early one morning rob opened the garden gate to mr dombey who was come to breakfast with his master by appointment at the same moment his master himself came hurrying forth to receive the distinguished guest and give him welcome with all his teeth  i never thought said carker when he had assisted him to alight from his horse to see you here im sure this is an extraordinary day in my calendar no occasion is very special to a man like you who may do anything but to a man like me the case is widely different  you have a tasteful place here carker said mr dombey condescending to stop upon the lawn to look about him  you can afford to say so returned carker thank you  indeed said mr dombey in his lofty patronage anyone might say so as far as it goes it is a very commodious and wellarranged placequite elegant  as far as it goes truly returned carker with an air of disparagement it wants that qualification well we have said enough about it and though you can afford to praise it i thank you nonetheless will you walk in  mr dombey entering the house noticed as he had reason to do the complete arrangement of the rooms and the numerous contrivances for comfort and effect that abounded there mr carker in his ostentation of humility received this notice with a deferential smile and said he understood its delicate meaning and appreciated it but in truth the cottage was good enough for one in his positionbetter perhaps than such a man should occupy poor as it was  but perhaps to you who are so far removed it really does look better than it is he said with his false mouth distended to its fullest stretch just as monarchs imagine attractions in the lives of beggars  he directed a sharp glance and a sharp smile at mr dombey as he spoke and a sharper glance and a sharper smile yet when mr dombey drawing himself up before the fire in the attitude so often copied by his second in command looked round at the pictures on the walls cursorily as his cold eye wandered over them carkers keen glance accompanied his and kept pace with his marking exactly where it went and what it saw as it rested on one picture in particular carker hardly seemed to breathe his sidelong scrutiny was so catlike and vigilant but the eye of his great chief passed from that as from the others and appeared no more impressed by it than by the rest  carker looked at itit was the picture that resembled edithas if it were a living thing and with a wicked silent laugh upon his face that seemed in part addressed to it though it was all derisive of the great man standing so unconscious beside him breakfast was soon set upon the table and inviting mr dombey to a chair which had its back towards this picture he took his own seat opposite to it as usual  mr dombey was even graver than it was his custom to be and quite silent the parrot swinging in the gilded hoop within her gaudy cage attempted in vain to attract notice for carker was too observant of his visitor to heed her and the visitor abstracted in meditation looked fixedly not to say sullenly over his stiff neckcloth without raising his eyes from the tablecloth as to rob who was in attendance all his faculties and energies were so locked up in observation of his master that he scarcely ventured to give shelter to the thought that the visitor was the great gentleman before whom he had been carried as a certificate of the family health in his childhood and to whom he had been indebted for his leather smalls  allow me said carker suddenly to ask how mrs dombey is  he leaned forward obsequiously as he made the inquiry with his chin resting on his hand and at the same time his eyes went up to the picture as if he said to it now see how i will lead him on  mr dombey reddened as he answered  mrs dombey is quite well you remind me carker of some conversation that i wish to have with you  robin you can leave us said his master at whose mild tones robin started and disappeared with his eyes fixed on his patron to the last you dont remember that boy of course he added when the enmeshed grinder was gone  no said mr dombey with magnificent indifference  not likely that a man like you would hardly possible murmured carker but he is one of that family from whom you took a nurse perhaps you may remember having generously charged yourself with his education  is it that boy said mr dombey with a frown he does little credit to his education i believe  why he is a young rip i am afraid returned carker with a shrug he bears that character but the truth is i took him into my service because being able to get no other employment he conceived had been taught at home i daresay that he had some sort of claim upon you and was constantly trying to dog your heels with his petition and although my defined and recognised connexion with your affairs is merely of a business character still i have that spontaneous interest in everything belonging to you that  he stopped again as if to discover whether he had led mr dombey far enough yet and again with his chin resting on his hand he leered at the picture  carker said mr dombey i am sensible that you do not limit your  service suggested his smiling entertainer  no i prefer to say your regard observed mr dombey very sensible as he said so that he was paying him a handsome and flattering compliment to our mere business relations your consideration for my feelings hopes and disappointments in the little instance you have just now mentioned is an example in point i i am obliged to you carker  mr carker bent his head slowly and very softly rubbed his hands as if he were afraid by any action to disturb the current of mr dombeys confidence  your allusion to it is opportune said mr dombey after a little hesitation for it prepares the way to what i was beginning to say to you and reminds me that that involves no absolutely new relations between us although it may involve more personal confidence on my part than i have hitherto  distinguished me with suggested carker bending his head again i will not say to you how honoured i am for a man like you well knows how much honour he has in his power to bestow at pleasure  mrs dombey and myself said mr dombey passing this compliment with august selfdenial are not quite agreed upon some points we do not appear to understand each other yet mrs dombey has something to learn  mrs dombey is distinguished by many rare attractions and has been accustomed no doubt to receive much adulation said the smooth sleek watcher of his slightest look and tone but where there is affection duty and respect any little mistakes engendered by such causes are soon set right  mr dombeys thoughts instinctively flew back to the face that had looked at him in his wifes dressingroom when an imperious hand was stretched towards the door and remembering the affection duty and respect expressed in it he felt the blood rush to his own face quite as plainly as the watchful eyes upon him saw it there  mrs dombey and myself he went on to say had some discussion before mrs skewtons death upon the causes of my dissatisfaction of which you will have formed a general understanding from having been a witness of what passed between mrs dombey and myself on the evening when you were at ourat my house  when i so much regretted being present said the smiling carker proud as a man in my position nay must be of your familiar noticethough i give you no credit for it you may do anything you please without losing casteand honoured as i was by an early presentation to mrs dombey before she was made eminent by bearing your name i almost regretted that night i assure you that i had been the object of such especial good fortune  that any man could under any possible circumstances regret the being distinguished by his condescension and patronage was a moral phenomenon which mr dombey could not comprehend he therefore responded with a considerable accession of dignity indeed and why carker  i fear returned the confidential agent that mrs dombey never very much disposed to regard me with favourable interestone in my position could not expect that from a lady naturally proud and whose pride becomes her so wellmay not easily forgive my innocent part in that conversation your displeasure is no light matter you must remember and to be visited with it before a third party  carker said mr dombey arrogantly i presume that i am the first consideration  oh can there be a doubt about it replied the other with the impatience of a man admitting a notorious and incontrovertible fact  mrs dombey becomes a secondary consideration when we are both in question i imagine said mr dombey is that so  is it so returned carker do you know better than anyone that you have no need to ask  then i hope carker said mr dombey that your regret in the acquisition of mrs dombeys displeasure may be almost counterbalanced by your satisfaction in retaining my confidence and good opinion  i have the misfortune i find returned carker to have incurred that displeasure mrs dombey has expressed it to you  mrs dombey has expressed various opinions said mr dombey with majestic coldness and indifference in which i do not participate and which i am not inclined to discuss or to recall i made mr dombey acquainted some time since as i have already told you with certain points of domestic deference and submission on which i felt it necessary to insist i failed to convince mrs dombey of the expediency of her immediately altering her conduct in those respects with a view to her own peace and welfare and my dignity and i informed mrs dombey that if i should find it necessary to object or remonstrate again i should express my opinion to her through yourself my confidential agent  blended with the look that carker bent upon him was a devilish look at the picture over his head that struck upon it like a flash of lightning  now carker said mr dombey i do not hesitate to say to you that i will carry my point i am not to be trifled with mrs dombey must understand that my will is law and that i cannot allow of one exception to the whole rule of my life you will have the goodness to undertake this charge which coming from me is not unacceptable to you i hope whatever regret you may politely professfor which i am obliged to you on behalf of mrs dombey and you will have the goodness i am persuaded to discharge it as exactly as any other commission  you know said mr carker that you have only to command me  i know said mr dombey with a majestic indication of assent that i have only to command you it is necessary that i should proceed in this mrs dombey is a lady undoubtedly highly qualified in many respects to  to do credit even to your choice suggested carker with a yawning show of teeth  yes if you please to adopt that form of words said mr dombey in his tone of state and at present i do not conceive that mrs dombey does that credit to it to which it is entitled there is a principle of opposition in mrs dombey that must be eradicated that must be overcome mrs dombey does not appear to understand said mr dombey forcibly that the idea of opposition to me is monstrous and absurd  we in the city know you better replied carker with a smile from ear to ear  you know me better said mr dombey i hope so though indeed i am bound to do mrs dombey the justice of saying however inconsistent it may seem with her subsequent conduct which remains unchanged that on my expressing my disapprobation and determination to her with some severity on the occasion to which i have referred my admonition appeared to produce a very powerful effect mr dombey delivered himself of those words with most portentous stateliness i wish you to have the goodness then to inform mrs dombey carker from me that i must recall our former conversation to her remembrance in some surprise that it has not yet had its effect that i must insist upon her regulating her conduct by the injunctions laid upon her in that conversation that i am not satisfied with her conduct that i am greatly dissatisfied with it and that i shall be under the very disagreeable necessity of making you the bearer of yet more unwelcome and explicit communications if she has not the good sense and the proper feeling to adapt herself to my wishes as the first mrs dombey did and i believe i may add as any other lady in her place would  the first mrs dombey lived very happily said carker  the first mrs dombey had great good sense said mr dombey in a gentlemanly toleration of the dead and very correct feeling  is miss dombey like her mother do you think said carker  swiftly and darkly mr dombeys face changed his confidential agent eyed it keenly  i have approached a painful subject he said in a soft regretful tone of voice irreconcilable with his eager eye pray forgive me i forget these chains of association in the interest i have pray forgive me  but for all he said his eager eye scanned mr dombeys downcast face none the less closely and then it shot a strange triumphant look at the picture as appealing to it to bear witness how he led him on again and what was coming  carker said mr dombey looking here and there upon the table and saying in a somewhat altered and more hurried voice and with a paler lip there is no occasion for apology you mistake the association is with the matter in hand and not with any recollection as you suppose i do not approve of mrs dombeys behaviour towards my daughter  pardon me said mr carker i dont quite understand  understand then returned mr dombey that you may make thatthat you will make that if you pleasematter of direct objection from me to mrs dombey you will please to tell her that her show of devotion for my daughter is disagreeable to me it is likely to be noticed it is likely to induce people to contrast mrs dombey in her relation towards my daughter with mrs dombey in her relation towards myself you will have the goodness to let mrs dombey know plainly that i object to it and that i expect her to defer immediately to my objection mrs dombey may be in earnest or she may be pursuing a whim or she may be opposing me but i object to it in any case and in every case if mrs dombey is in earnest so much the less reluctant should she be to desist for she will not serve my daughter by any such display if my wife has any superfluous gentleness and duty over and above her proper submission to me she may bestow them where she pleases perhaps but i will have submission firstcarker said mr dombey checking the unusual emotion with which he had spoken and falling into a tone more like that in which he was accustomed to assert his greatness you will have the goodness not to omit or slur this point but to consider it a very important part of your instructions  mr carker bowed his head and rising from the table and standing thoughtfully before the fire with his hand to his smooth chin looked down at mr dombey with the evil slyness of some monkish carving half human and half brute or like a leering face on an old waterspout mr dombey recovering his composure by degrees or cooling his emotion in his sense of having taken a high position sat gradually stiffening again and looking at the parrot as she swung to and fro in her great wedding ring  i beg your pardon said carker after a silence suddenly resuming his chair and drawing it opposite to mr dombeys but let me understand mrs dombey is aware of the probability of your making me the organ of your displeasure  yes replied mr dombey i have said so  yes rejoined carker quickly but why  why mr dombey repeated not without hesitation because i told her  ay replied carker but why did you tell her you see he continued with a smile and softly laying his velvet hand as a cat might have laid its sheathed claws on mr dombeys arm if i perfectly understand what is in your mind i am so much more likely to be useful and to have the happiness of being effectually employed i think i do understand i have not the honour of mrs dombeys good opinion in my position i have no reason to expect it but i take the fact to be that i have not got it  possibly not said mr dombey  consequently pursued carker your making the communications to mrs dombey through me is sure to be particularly unpalatable to that lady  it appears to me said mr dombey with haughty reserve and yet with some embarrassment that mrs dombeys views upon the subject form no part of it as it presents itself to you and me carker but it may be so  andpardon medo i misconceive you said carker when i think you descry in this a likely means of humbling mrs dombeys pridei use the word as expressive of a quality which kept within due bounds adorns and graces a lady so distinguished for her beauty and accomplishmentsand not to say of punishing her but of reducing her to the submission you so naturally and justly require  i am not accustomed carker as you know said mr dombey to give such close reasons for any course of conduct i think proper to adopt but i will gainsay nothing of this if you have any objection to found upon it that is indeed another thing and the mere statement that you have one will be sufficient but i have not supposed i confess that any confidence i could entrust to you would be likely to degrade you  oh i degraded exclaimed carker in your service  or to place you pursued mr dombey in a false position  i in a false position exclaimed carker i shall be prouddelightedto execute your trust i could have wished i own to have given the lady at whose feet i would lay my humble duty and devotionfor is she not your wifeno new cause of dislike but a wish from you is of course paramount to every other consideration on earth besides when mrs dombey is converted from these little errors of judgment incidental i would presume to say to the novelty of her situation i shall hope that she will perceive in the slight part i take only a grainmy removed and different sphere gives room for little moreof the respect for you and sacrifice of all considerations to you of which it will be her pleasure and privilege to garner up a great store every day  mr dombey seemed at the moment again to see her with her hand stretched out towards the door and again to hear through the mild speech of his confidential agent an echo of the words nothing can make us stranger to each other than we are henceforth but he shook off the fancy and did not shake in his resolution and said certainly no doubt  there is nothing more quoth carker drawing his chair back to its old placefor they had taken little breakfast as yetand pausing for an answer before he sat down  nothing said mr dombey but this you will be good enough to observe carker that no message to mrs dombey with which you are or may be charged admits of reply you will be good enough to bring me no reply mrs dombey is informed that it does not become me to temporise or treat upon any matter that is at issue between us and that what i say is final  mr carker signified his understanding of these credentials and they fell to breakfast with what appetite they might the grinder also in due time reappeared keeping his eyes upon his master without a moments respite and passing the time in a reverie of worshipful tenor breakfast concluded mr dombeys horse was ordered out again and mr carker mounting his own they rode off for the city together  mr carker was in capital spirits and talked much mr dombey received his conversation with the sovereign air of a man who had a right to be talked to and occasionally condescended to throw in a few words to carry on the conversation so they rode on characteristically enough but mr dombey in his dignity rode with very long stirrups and a very loose rein and very rarely deigned to look down to see where his horse went in consequence of which it happened that mr dombeys horse while going at a round trot stumbled on some loose stones threw him rolled over him and lashing out with his ironshod feet in his struggles to get up kicked him  mr carker quick of eye steady of hand and a good horseman was afoot and had the struggling animal upon his legs and by the bridle in a moment otherwise that mornings confidence would have been mr dombeys last yet even with the flush and hurry of this action red upon him he bent over his prostrate chief with every tooth disclosed and muttered as he stooped down i have given good cause of offence to mrs dombey now if she knew it  mr dombey being insensible and bleeding from the head and face was carried by certain menders of the road under carkers direction to the nearest publichouse which was not far off and where he was soon attended by divers surgeons who arrived in quick succession from all parts and who seemed to come by some mysterious instinct as vultures are said to gather about a camel who dies in the desert after being at some pains to restore him to consciousness these gentlemen examined into the nature of his injuries  one surgeon who lived hard by was strong for a compound fracture of the leg which was the landlords opinion also but two surgeons who lived at a distance and were only in that neighbourhood by accident combated this opinion so disinterestedly that it was decided at last that the patient though severely cut and bruised had broken no bones but a lesser rib or so and might be carefully taken home before night his injuries being dressed and bandaged which was a long operation and he at length left to repose mr carker mounted his horse again and rode away to carry the intelligence home  crafty and cruel as his face was at the best of times though it was a sufficiently fair face as to form and regularity of feature it was at its worst when he set forth on this errand animated by the craft and cruelty of thoughts within him suggestions of remote possibility rather than of design or plot that made him ride as if he hunted men and women drawing rein at length and slackening in his speed as he came into the more public roads he checked his whitelegged horse into picking his way along as usual and hid himself beneath his sleek hushed crouched manner and his ivory smile as he best could  he rode direct to mr dombeys house alighted at the door and begged to see mrs dombey on an affair of importance the servant who showed him to mr dombeys own room soon returned to say that it was not mrs dombeys hour for receiving visitors and that he begged pardon for not having mentioned it before  mr carker who was quite prepared for a cold reception wrote upon a card that he must take the liberty of pressing for an interview and that he would not be so bold as to do so for the second time this he underlined if he were not equally sure of the occasion being sufficient for his justification after a trifling delay mrs dombeys maid appeared and conducted him to a morning room upstairs where edith and florence were together  he had never thought edith half so beautiful before much as he admired the graces of her face and form and freshly as they dwelt within his sensual remembrance he had never thought her half so beautiful  her glance fell haughtily upon him in the doorway but he looked at florencethough only in the act of bending his head as he came inwith some irrepressible expression of the new power he held and it was his triumph to see the glance droop and falter and to see that edith half rose up to receive him  he was very sorry he was deeply grieved he couldnt say with what unwillingness he came to prepare her for the intelligence of a very slight accident he entreated mrs dombey to compose herself upon his sacred word of honour there was no cause of alarm but mr dombey  florence uttered a sudden cry he did not look at her but at edith edith composed and reassured her she uttered no cry of distress no no  mr dombey had met with an accident in riding his horse had slipped and he had been thrown  florence wildly exclaimed that he was badly hurt that he was killed  no upon his honour mr dombey though stunned at first was soon recovered and though certainly hurt was in no kind of danger if this were not the truth he the distressed intruder never could have had the courage to present himself before mrs dombey it was the truth indeed he solemnly assured her  all this he said as if he were answering edith and not florence and with his eyes and his smile fastened on edith  he then went on to tell her where mr dombey was lying and to request that a carriage might be placed at his disposal to bring him home  mama faltered florence in tears if i might venture to go  mr carker having his eyes on edith when he heard these words gave her a secret look and slightly shook his head he saw how she battled with herself before she answered him with her handsome eyes but he wrested the answer from herhe showed her that he would have it or that he would speak and cut florence to the heartand she gave it to him as he had looked at the picture in the morning so he looked at her afterwards when she turned her eyes away  i am directed to request he said that the new housekeepermrs pipchin i think is the name  nothing escaped him he saw in an instant that she was another slight of mr dombeys on his wife  may be informed that mr dombey wishes to have his bed prepared in his own apartments downstairs as he prefers those rooms to any other i shall return to mr dombey almost immediately that every possible attention has been paid to his comfort and that he is the object of every possible solicitude i need not assure you madam let me again say there is no cause for the least alarm even you may be quite at ease believe me  he bowed himself out with his extremest show of deference and conciliation and having returned to mr dombeys room and there arranged for a carriage being sent after him to the city mounted his horse again and rode slowly thither he was very thoughtful as he went along and very thoughtful there and very thoughtful in the carriage on his way back to the place where mr dombey had been left it was only when sitting by that gentlemans couch that he was quite himself again and conscious of his teeth  about the time of twilight mr dombey grievously afflicted with aches and pains was helped into his carriage and propped with cloaks and pillows on one side of it while his confidential agent bore him company upon the other as he was not to be shaken they moved at little more than a foot pace and hence it was quite dark when he was brought home mrs pipchin bitter and grim and not oblivious of the peruvian mines as the establishment in general had good reason to know received him at the door and freshened the domestics with several little sprinklings of wordy vinegar while they assisted in conveying him to his room mr carker remained in attendance until he was safe in bed and then as he declined to receive any female visitor but the excellent ogress who presided over his household waited on mrs dombey once more with his report on her lords condition  he again found edith alone with florence and he again addressed the whole of his soothing speech to edith as if she were a prey to the liveliest and most affectionate anxieties so earnest he was in his respectful sympathy that on taking leave he venturedwith one more glance towards florence at the momentto take her hand and bending over it to touch it with his lips  edith did not withdraw the hand nor did she strike his fair face with it despite the flush upon her cheek the bright light in her eyes and the dilation of her whole form but when she was alone in her own room she struck it on the marble chimneyshelf so that at one blow it was bruised and bled and held it from her near the shining fire as if she could have thrust it in and burned it  far into the night she sat alone by the sinking blaze in dark and threatening beauty watching the murky shadows looming on the wall as if her thoughts were tangible and cast them there whatever shapes of outrage and affront and black foreshadowings of things that might happen flickered indistinct and giantlike before her one resented figure marshalled them against her and that figure was her husband    chapter 43 the watches of the night   florence long since awakened from her dream mournfully observed the estrangement between her father and edith and saw it widen more and more and knew that there was greater bitterness between them every day each days added knowledge deepened the shade upon her love and hope roused up the old sorrow that had slumbered for a little time and made it even heavier to bear than it had been before  it had been hardhow hard may none but florence ever knowto have the natural affection of a true and earnest nature turned to agony and slight or stern repulse substituted for the tenderest protection and the dearest care it had been hard to feel in her deep heart what she had felt and never know the happiness of one touch of response but it was much more hard to be compelled to doubt either her father or edith so affectionate and dear to her and to think of her love for each of them by turns with fear distrust and wonder  yet florence now began to do so and the doing of it was a task imposed upon her by the very purity of her soul as one she could not fly from she saw her father cold and obdurate to edith as to her hard inflexible unyielding could it be she asked herself with starting tears that her own dear mother had been made unhappy by such treatment and had pined away and died then she would think how proud and stately edith was to everyone but her with what disdain she treated him how distantly she kept apart from him and what she had said on the night when they came home and quickly it would come on florence almost as a crime that she loved one who was set in opposition to her father and that her father knowing of it must think of her in his solitary room as the unnatural child who added this wrong to the old fault so much wept for of never having won his fatherly affection from her birth the next kind word from edith the next kind glance would shake these thoughts again and make them seem like black ingratitude for who but she had cheered the drooping heart of florence so lonely and so hurt and been its best of comforters thus with her gentle nature yearning to them both feeling for the misery of both and whispering doubts of her own duty to both florence in her wider and expanded love and by the side of edith endured more than when she had hoarded up her undivided secret in the mournful house and her beautiful mama had never dawned upon it  one exquisite unhappiness that would have far outweighed this florence was spared she never had the least suspicion that edith by her tenderness for her widened the separation from her father or gave him new cause of dislike if florence had conceived the possibility of such an effect being wrought by such a cause what grief she would have felt what sacrifice she would have tried to make poor loving girl how fast and sure her quiet passage might have been beneath it to the presence of that higher father who does not reject his childrens love or spurn their tried and broken hearts heaven knows but it was otherwise and that was well  no word was ever spoken between florence and edith now on these subjects edith had said there ought to be between them in that wise a division and a silence like the grave itself and florence felt she was right  in this state of affairs her father was brought home suffering and disabled and gloomily retired to his own rooms where he was tended by servants not approached by edith and had no friend or companion but mr carker who withdrew near midnight  and nice company he is miss floy said susan nipper oh hes a precious piece of goods if ever he wants a character dont let him come to me whatever he does thats all i tell him  dear susan urged florence dont  oh its very well to say dont miss floy returned the nipper much exasperated but raly begging your pardon were coming to such passes that it turns all the blood in a persons body into pins and needles with their pints all ways dont mistake me miss floy i dont mean nothing again your mainlaw who has always treated me as a lady should though she is rather high i must say not that i have any right to object to that particular but when we come to mrs pipchinses and having them put over us and keeping guard at your pas door like crocodiles only make us thankful that they lay no eggs we are a growing too outrageous  papa thinks well of mrs pipchin susan returned florence and has a right to choose his housekeeper you know pray dont  well miss floy returned the nipper when you say dont i never do i hope but mrs pipchin acts like early gooseberries upon me miss and nothing less  susan was unusually emphatic and destitute of punctuation in her discourse on this night which was the night of mr dombeys being brought home because having been sent downstairs by florence to inquire after him she had been obliged to deliver her message to her mortal enemy mrs pipchin who without carrying it in to mr dombey had taken upon herself to return what miss nipper called a huffish answer on her own responsibility this susan nipper construed into presumption on the part of that exemplary sufferer by the peruvian mines and a deed of disparagement upon her young lady that was not to be forgiven and so far her emphatic state was special but she had been in a condition of greatly increased suspicion and distrust ever since the marriage for like most persons of her quality of mind who form a strong and sincere attachment to one in the different station which florence occupied susan was very jealous and her jealousy naturally attached to edith who divided her old empire and came between them proud and glad as susan nipper truly was that her young mistress should be advanced towards her proper place in the scene of her old neglect and that she should have her fathers handsome wife for her companion and protectress she could not relinquish any part of her own dominion to the handsome wife without a grudge and a vague feeling of illwill for which she did not fail to find a disinterested justification in her sharp perception of the pride and passion of the ladys character from the background to which she had necessarily retired somewhat since the marriage miss nipper looked on therefore at domestic affairs in general with a resolute conviction that no good would come of mrs dombey always being very careful to publish on all possible occasions that she had nothing to say against her  susan said florence who was sitting thoughtfully at her table it is very late i shall want nothing more tonight  ah miss floy returned the nipper im sure i often wish for them old times when i sat up with you hours later than this and fell asleep through being tired out when you was as broad awake as spectacles but youve masinlaw to come and sit with you now miss floy and im thankful for it im sure ive not a word to say against em  i shall not forget who was my old companion when i had none susan returned florence gently never and looking up she put her arm round the neck of her humble friend drew her face down to hers and bidding her goodnight kissed it which so mollified miss nipper that she fell a sobbing  now my dear miss floy said susan let me go downstairs again and see how your pa is i know youre wretched about him do let me go downstairs again and knock at his door my own self  no said florence go to bed we shall hear more in the morning i will inquire myself in the morning mama has been down i daresay florence blushed for she had no such hope or is there now perhaps goodnight  susan was too much softened to express her private opinion on the probability of mrs dombeys being in attendance on her husband and silently withdrew florence left alone soon hid her head upon her hands as she had often done in other days and did not restrain the tears from coursing down her face the misery of this domestic discord and unhappiness the withered hope she cherished now if hope it could be called of ever being taken to her fathers heart her doubts and fears between the two the yearning of her innocent breast to both the heavy disappointment and regret of such an end as this to what had been a vision of bright hope and promise to her all crowded on her mind and made her tears flow fast her mother and her brother dead her father unmoved towards her edith opposed to him and casting him away but loving her and loved by her it seemed as if her affection could never prosper rest where it would that weak thought was soon hushed but the thoughts in which it had arisen were too true and strong to be dismissed with it and they made the night desolate  among such reflections there rose up as there had risen up all day the image of her father wounded and in pain alone in his own room untended by those who should be nearest to him and passing the tardy hours in lonely suffering a frightened thought which made her start and clasp her handsthough it was not a new one in her mindthat he might die and never see her or pronounce her name thrilled her whole frame in her agitation she thought and trembled while she thought of once more stealing downstairs and venturing to his door  she listened at her own the house was quiet and all the lights were out it was a long long time she thought since she used to make her nightly pilgrimages to his door it was a long long time she tried to think since she had entered his room at midnight and he had led her back to the stairfoot  with the same childs heart within her as of old even with the childs sweet timid eyes and clustering hair florence as strange to her father in her early maiden bloom as in her nursery time crept down the staircase listening as she went and drew near to his room no one was stirring in the house the door was partly open to admit air and all was so still within that she could hear the burning of the fire and count the ticking of the clock that stood upon the chimneypiece  she looked in in that room the housekeeper wrapped in a blanket was fast asleep in an easy chair before the fire the doors between it and the next were partly closed and a screen was drawn before them but there was a light there and it shone upon the cornice of his bed all was so very still that she could hear from his breathing that he was asleep this gave her courage to pass round the screen and look into his chamber  it was as great a start to come upon his sleeping face as if she had not expected to see it florence stood arrested on the spot and if he had awakened then must have remained there  there was a cut upon his forehead and they had been wetting his hair which lay bedabbled and entangled on the pillow one of his arms resting outside the bed was bandaged up and he was very white but it was not this that after the first quick glance and first assurance of his sleeping quietly held florence rooted to the ground it was something very different from this and more than this that made him look so solemn in her eye  she had never seen his face in all her life but there had been upon itor she fancied sosome disturbing consciousness of her she had never seen his face in all her life but hope had sunk within her and her timid glance had dropped before its stern unloving and repelling harshness as she looked upon it now she saw it for the first time free from the cloud that had darkened her childhood calm tranquil night was reigning in its stead he might have gone to sleep for anything she saw there blessing her  awake unkind father awake now sullen man the time is flitting by the hour is coming with an angry tread awake  there was no change upon his face and as she watched it awfully its motionless response recalled the faces that were gone so they looked so would he so she his weeping child who should say when so all the world of love and hatred and indifference around them when that time should come it would not be the heavier to him for this that she was going to do and it might fall something lighter upon her  she stole close to the bed and drawing in her breath bent down and softly kissed him on the face and laid her own for one brief moment by its side and put the arm with which she dared not touch him round about him on the pillow  awake doomed man while she is near the time is flitting by the hour is coming with an angry tread its foot is in the house awake  in her mind she prayed to god to bless her father and to soften him towards her if it might be so and if not to forgive him if he was wrong and pardon her the prayer which almost seemed impiety and doing so and looking back at him with blinded eyes and stealing timidly away passed out of his room and crossed the other and was gone  he may sleep on now he may sleep on while he may but let him look for that slight figure when he wakes and find it near him when the hour is come  sad and grieving was the heart of florence as she crept upstairs the quiet house had grown more dismal since she came down the sleep she had been looking on in the dead of night had the solemnity to her of death and life in one the secrecy and silence of her own proceeding made the night secret silent and oppressive she felt unwilling almost unable to go on to her own chamber and turning into the drawingrooms where the clouded moon was shining through the blinds looked out into the empty streets  the wind was blowing drearily the lamps looked pale and shook as if they were cold there was a distant glimmer of something that was not quite darkness rather than of light in the sky and foreboding night was shivering and restless as the dying are who make a troubled end florence remembered how as a watcher by a sickbed she had noted this bleak time and felt its influence as if in some hidden natural antipathy to it and now it was very very gloomy  her mama had not come to her room that night which was one cause of her having sat late out of her bed in her general uneasiness no less than in her ardent longing to have somebody to speak to and to break the spell of gloom and silence florence directed her steps towards the chamber where she slept  the door was not fastened within and yielded smoothly to her hesitating hand she was surprised to find a bright light burning still more surprised on looking in to see that her mama but partially undressed was sitting near the ashes of the fire which had crumbled and dropped away her eyes were intently bent upon the air and in their light and in her face and in her form and in the grasp with which she held the elbows of her chair as if about to start up florence saw such fierce emotion that it terrified her  mama she cried what is the matter  edith started looking at her with such a strange dread in her face that florence was more frightened than before  mama said florence hurriedly advancing dear mama what is the matter  i have not been well said edith shaking and still looking at her in the same strange way i have had had dreams my love  and not yet been to bed mama  no she returned halfwaking dreams  her features gradually softened and suffering florence to come closer to her within her embrace she said in a tender manner but what does my bird do here what does my bird do here  i have been uneasy mama in not seeing you tonight and in not knowing how papa was and i  florence stopped there and said no more  is it late asked edith fondly putting back the curls that mingled with her own dark hair and strayed upon her face  very late near day  near day she repeated in surprise  dear mama what have you done to your hand said florence  edith drew it suddenly away and for a moment looked at her with the same strange dread there was a sort of wild avoidance in it as before but she presently said nothing nothing a blow and then she said my florence and then her bosom heaved and she was weeping passionately  mama said florence oh mama what can i do what should i do to make us happier is there anything  nothing she replied  are you sure of that can it never be if i speak now of what is in my thoughts in spite of what we have agreed said florence you will not blame me will you  it is useless she replied useless i have told you dear that i have had bad dreams nothing can change them or prevent them coming back  i do not understand said florence gazing on her agitated face which seemed to darken as she looked  i have dreamed said edith in a low voice of a pride that is all powerless for good all powerful for evil of a pride that has been galled and goaded through many shameful years and has never recoiled except upon itself a pride that has debased its owner with the consciousness of deep humiliation and never helped its owner boldly to resent it or avoid it or to say this shall not be a pride that rightly guided might have led perhaps to better things but which misdirected and perverted like all else belonging to the same possessor has been selfcontempt mere hardihood and ruin  she neither looked nor spoke to florence now but went on as if she were alone  i have dreamed she said of such indifference and callousness arising from this selfcontempt this wretched inefficient miserable pride that it has gone on with listless steps even to the altar yielding to the old familiar beckoning fingeroh mother oh motherwhile it spurned it and willing to be hateful to itself for once and for all rather than to be stung daily in some new form mean poor thing  and now with gathering and darkening emotion she looked as she had looked when florence entered  and i have dreamed she said that in a first late effort to achieve a purpose it has been trodden on and trodden down by a base foot but turns and looks upon him i have dreamed that it is wounded hunted set upon by dogs but that it stands at hay and will not yield no that it cannot if it would but that it is urged on to hate  her clenched hand tightened on the trembling arm she had in hers and as she looked down on the alarmed and wondering face frown subsided oh florence she said i think i have been nearly mad tonight and humbled her proud head upon her neck and wept again  dont leave me be near me i have no hope but in you these words she said a score of times  soon she grew calmer and was full of pity for the tears of florence and for her waking at such untimely hours and the day now dawning with folded her in her arms and laid her down upon her bed and not lying down herself sat by her and bade her try to sleep  for you are weary dearest and unhappy and should rest  i am indeed unhappy dear mama tonight said florence but you are weary and unhappy too  not when you lie asleep so near me sweet  they kissed each other and florence worn out gradually fell into a gentle slumber but as her eyes closed on the face beside her it was so sad to think upon the face downstairs that her hand drew closer to edith for some comfort yet even in the act it faltered lest it should be deserting him so in her sleep she tried to reconcile the two together and to show them that she loved them both but could not do it and her waking grief was part of her dreams  edith sitting by looked down at the dark eyelashes lying wet on the flushed cheeks and looked with gentleness and pity for she knew the truth but no sleep hung upon her own eyes as the day came on she still sat watching and waking with the placid hand in hers and sometimes whispered as she looked at the hushed face be near me florence i have no hope but in you    chapter 44 a separation   with the day though not so early as the sun uprose miss susan nipper there was a heaviness in this young maidens exceedingly sharp black eyes that abated somewhat of their sparkling and suggestedwhich was not their usual characterthe possibility of their being sometimes shut there was likewise a swollen look about them as if they had been crying overnight but the nipper so far from being cast down was singularly brisk and bold and all her energies appeared to be braced up for some great feat this was noticeable even in her dress which was much more tight and trim than usual and in occasional twitches of her head as she went about the house which were mightily expressive of determination  in a word she had formed a determination and an aspiring one it being nothing less than thisto penetrate to mr dombeys presence and have speech of that gentleman alone i have often said i would she remarked in a threatening manner to herself that morning with many twitches of her head and now i will  spurring herself on to the accomplishment of this desperate design with a sharpness that was peculiar to herself susan nipper haunted the hall and staircase during the whole forenoon without finding a favourable opportunity for the assault not at all baffled by this discomfiture which indeed had a stimulating effect and put her on her mettle she diminished nothing of her vigilance and at last discovered towards evening that her sworn foe mrs pipchin under pretence of having sat up all night was dozing in her own room and that mr dombey was lying on his sofa unattended  with a twitchnot of her head merely this time but of her whole selfthe nipper went on tiptoe to mr dombeys door and knocked come in said mr dombey susan encouraged herself with a final twitch and went in  mr dombey who was eyeing the fire gave an amazed look at his visitor and raised himself a little on his arm the nipper dropped a curtsey  what do you want said mr dombey  if you please sir i wish to speak to you said susan  mr dombey moved his lips as if he were repeating the words but he seemed so lost in astonishment at the presumption of the young woman as to be incapable of giving them utterance  i have been in your service sir said susan nipper with her usual rapidity now twelve year a waiting on miss floy my own young lady who couldnt speak plain when i first come here and i was old in this house when mrs richards was new i may not be meethosalem but i am not a child in arms  mr dombey raised upon his arm and looking at her offered no comment on this preparatory statement of fact  there never was a dearer or a blesseder young lady than is my young lady sir said susan and i ought to know a great deal better than some for i have seen her in her grief and i have seen her in her joy theres not been much of it and i have seen her with her brother and i have seen her in her loneliness and some have never seen her and i say to some and alli do and here the blackeyed shook her head and slightly stamped her foot that shes the blessedest and dearest angel is miss floy that ever drew the breath of life the more that i was torn to pieces sir the more id say it though i may not be a foxs martyr  mr dombey turned yet paler than his fall had made him with indignation and astonishment and kept his eyes upon the speaker as if he accused them and his ears too of playing him false  no one could be anything but true and faithful to miss floy sir pursued susan and i take no merit for my service of twelve year for i love heryes i say to some and all i doand here the blackeyed shook her head again and slightly stamped her foot again and checked a sob but true and faithful service gives me right to speak i hope and speak i must and will now right or wrong  what do you mean woman said mr dombey glaring at her how do you dare  what i mean sir is to speak respectful and without offence but out and how i dare i know not but i dosaid susan oh you dont know my young lady sir you dont indeed youd never know so little of her if you did  mr dombey in a fury put his hand out for the bellrope but there was no bellrope on that side of the fire and he could not rise and cross to the other without assistance the quick eye of the nipper detected his helplessness immediately and now as she afterwards observed she felt she had got him  miss floy said susan nipper is the most devoted and most patient and most dutiful and beautiful of daughters there aint no gentleman no sir though as great and rich as all the greatest and richest of england put together but might be proud of her and would and ought if he knew her value right hed rather lose his greatness and his fortune piece by piece and beg his way in rags from door to door i say to some and all he would cried susan nipper bursting into tears than bring the sorrow on her tender heart that i have seen it suffer in this house  woman cried mr dombey leave the room  begging your pardon not even if i am to leave the situation sir replied the steadfast nipper in which i have been so many years and seen so muchalthough i hope youd never have the heart to send me from miss floy for such a causewill i go now till i have said the rest i may not be a indian widow sir and i am not and i would not so become but if i once made up my mind to burn myself alive id do it and ive made my mind up to go on  which was rendered no less clear by the expression of susan nippers countenance than by her words  there aint a person in your service sir pursued the blackeyed that has always stood more in awe of you than me and you may think how true it is when i make so bold as say that i have hundreds and hundreds of times thought of speaking to you and never been able to make my mind up to it till last night but last night decided of me  mr dombey in a paroxysm of rage made another grasp at the bellrope that was not there and in its absence pulled his hair rather than nothing  i have seen said susan nipper miss floy strive and strive when nothing but a child so sweet and patient that the best of women might have copied from her ive seen her sitting nights together half the night through to help her delicate brother with his learning ive seen her helping him and watching him at other timessome well know whenive seen her with no encouragement and no help grow up to be a lady thank god that is the grace and pride of every company she goes in and ive always seen her cruelly neglected and keenly feeling of iti say to some and all i haveand never said one word but ordering ones self lowly and reverently towards ones betters is not to be a worshipper of graven images and i will and must speak  is there anybody there cried mr dombey calling out where are the men where are the women is there no one there  i left my dear young lady out of bed late last night said susan nothing checked and i knew why for you was ill sir and she didnt know how ill and that was enough to make her wretched as i saw it did i may not be a peacock but i have my eyesand i sat up a little in my own room thinking she might be lonesome and might want me and i saw her steal downstairs and come to this door as if it was a guilty thing to look at her own pa and then steal back again and go into them lonely drawingrooms acrying so that i could hardly bear to hear it i can not bear to hear it said susan nipper wiping her black eyes and fixing them undauntingly on mr dombeys infuriated face its not the first time i have heard it not by many and many a time you dont know your own daughter sir you dont know what youre doing sir i say to some and all cried susan nipper in a final burst that its a sinful shame  why hoity toity cried the voice of mrs pipchin as the black bombazeen garments of that fair peruvian miner swept into the room whats this indeed  susan favoured mrs pipchin with a look she had invented expressly for her when they first became acquainted and resigned the reply to mr dombey  whats this repeated mr dombey almost foaming whats this madam you who are at the head of this household and bound to keep it in order have reason to inquire do you know this woman  i know very little good of her sir croaked mrs pipchin how dare you come here you hussy go along with you  but the inflexible nipper merely honouring mrs pipchin with another look remained  do you call it managing this establishment madam said mr dombey to leave a person like this at liberty to come and talk to me a gentlemanin his own housein his own roomassailed with the impertinences of womenservants  well sir returned mrs pipchin with vengeance in her hard grey eye i exceedingly deplore it nothing can be more irregular nothing can be more out of all bounds and reason but i regret to say sir that this young woman is quite beyond control she has been spoiled by miss dombey and is amenable to nobody you know youre not said mrs pipchin sharply and shaking her head at susan nipper for shame you hussy go along with you  if you find people in my service who are not to be controlled mrs pipchin said mr dombey turning back towards the fire you know what to do with them i presume you know what you are here for take her away  sir i know what to do retorted mrs pipchin and of course shall do it susan nipper snapping her up particularly short a months warning from this hour  oh indeed cried susan loftily  yes returned mrs pipchin and dont smile at me you minx or ill know the reason why go along with you this minute  i intend to go this minute you may rely upon it said the voluble nipper i have been in this house waiting on my young lady a dozen year and i wont stop in it one hour under notice from a person owning to the name of pipchin trust me mrs p  a good riddance of bad rubbish said that wrathful old lady get along with you or ill have you carried out  my comfort is said susan looking back at mr dombey that i have told a piece of truth this day which ought to have been told long before and cant be told too often or too plain and that no amount of pipchinsesi hope the number of em maynt be great here mrs pipchin uttered a very sharp go along with you and miss nipper repeated the look can unsay what i have said though they gave a whole year full of warnings beginning at ten oclock in the forenoon and never leaving off till twelve at night and died of the exhaustion which would be a jubilee  with these words miss nipper preceded her foe out of the room and walking upstairs to her own apartments in great state to the choking exasperation of the ireful pipchin sat down among her boxes and began to cry  from this soft mood she was soon aroused with a very wholesome and refreshing effect by the voice of mrs pipchin outside the door  does that boldfaced slut said the fell pipchin intend to take her warning or does she not  miss nipper replied from within that the person described did not inhabit that part of the house but that her name was pipchin and she was to be found in the housekeepers room  you saucy baggage retorted mrs pipchin rattling at the handle of the door go along with you this minute pack up your things directly how dare you talk in this way to a gentlewoman who has seen better days  to which miss nipper rejoined from her castle that she pitied the better days that had seen mrs pipchin and that for her part she considered the worst days in the year to be about that ladys mark except that they were much too good for her  but you neednt trouble yourself to make a noise at my door said susan nipper nor to contaminate the keyhole with your eye im packing up and going you may take your affidavit  the dowager expressed her lively satisfaction at this intelligence and with some general opinions upon young hussies as a race and especially upon their demerits after being spoiled by miss dombey withdrew to prepare the nippers wages susan then bestirred herself to get her trunks in order that she might take an immediate and dignified departure sobbing heartily all the time as she thought of florence  the object of her regret was not long in coming to her for the news soon spread over the house that susan nipper had had a disturbance with mrs pipchin and that they had both appealed to mr dombey and that there had been an unprecedented piece of work in mr dombeys room and that susan was going the latter part of this confused rumour florence found to be so correct that susan had locked the last trunk and was sitting upon it with her bonnet on when she came into her room  susan cried florence going to leave me you  oh for goodness gracious sake miss floy said susan sobbing dont speak a word to me or i shall demean myself before them pipchinses and i wouldnt have em see me cry miss floy for worlds  susan said florence my dear girl my old friend what shall i do without you can you bear to go away so  nonoo my darling dear miss floy i cant indeed sobbed susan but it cant be helped ive done my duty miss i have indeed its no fault of mine i am quite resigned i couldnt stay my month or i could never leave you then my darling and i must at last as well as at first dont speak to me miss floy for though im pretty firm im not a marble doorpost my own dear  what is it why is it said florence wont you tell me for susan was shaking her head  nonno my darling returned susan dont ask me for i mustnt and whatever you do dont put in a word for me to stop for it couldnt be and youd only wrong yourself and so god bless you my own precious and forgive me any harm i have done or any temper i have showed in all these many years  with which entreaty very heartily delivered susan hugged her mistress in her arms  my darling theres a many that may come to serve you and be glad to serve you and wholl serve you well and true said susan but there cant be one wholl serve you so affectionate as me or love you half as dearly thats my comfort goodbye sweet miss floy  where will you go susan asked her weeping mistress  ive got a brother down in the country missa farmer in essex said the heartbroken nipper that keeps ever so many cooows and pigs and i shall go down there by the coach and stoop with him and dont mind me for ive got money in the savings banks my dear and neednt take another service just yet which i couldnt couldnt couldnt do my hearts own mistress susan finished with a burst of sorrow which was opportunely broken by the voice of mrs pipchin talking downstairs on hearing which she dried her red and swollen eyes and made a melancholy feint of calling jauntily to mr towlinson to fetch a cab and carry down her boxes  florence pale and hurried and distressed but withheld from useless interference even here by her dread of causing any new division between her father and his wife whose stern indignant face had been a warning to her a few moments since and by her apprehension of being in some way unconsciously connected already with the dismissal of her old servant and friend followed weeping downstairs to ediths dressingroom whither susan betook herself to make her parting curtsey  now heres the cab and heres the boxes get along with you do said mrs pipchin presenting herself at the same moment i beg your pardon maam but mr dombeys orders are imperative  edith sitting under the hands of her maidshe was going out to dinnerpreserved her haughty face and took not the least notice  theres your money said mrs pipchin who in pursuance of her system and in recollection of the mines was accustomed to rout the servants about as she had routed her young brighton boarders to the everlasting acidulation of master bitherstone and the sooner this house sees your back the better  susan had no spirits even for the look that belonged to ma pipchin by right so she dropped her curtsey to mrs dombey who inclined her head without one word and whose eye avoided everyone but florence and gave one last parting hug to her young mistress and received her parting embrace in return poor susans face at this crisis in the intensity of her feelings and the determined suffocation of her sobs lest one should become audible and be a triumph to mrs pipchin presented a series of the most extraordinary physiognomical phenomena ever witnessed  i beg your pardon miss im sure said towlinson outside the door with the boxes addressing florence but mr toots is in the drawingroom and sends his compliments and begs to know how diogenes and master is  quick as thought florence glided out and hastened downstairs where mr toots in the most splendid vestments was breathing very hard with doubt and agitation on the subject of her coming  oh how de do miss dombey said mr toots god bless my soul  this last ejaculation was occasioned by mr tootss deep concern at the distress he saw in florences face which caused him to stop short in a fit of chuckles and become an image of despair  dear mr toots said florence you are so friendly to me and so honest that i am sure i may ask a favour of you  miss dombey returned mr toots if youll only name one youllyoull give me an appetite to which said mr toots with some sentiment i have long been a stranger  susan who is an old friend of mine the oldest friend i have said florence is about to leave here suddenly and quite alone poor girl she is going home a little way into the country might i ask you to take care of her until she is in the coach  miss dombey returned mr toots you really do me an honour and a kindness this proof of your confidence after the manner in which i was beast enough to conduct myself at brighton  yes said florence hurriedlynodont think of that then would you have the kindness toto go and to be ready to meet her when she comes out thank you a thousand times you ease my mind so much she doesnt seem so desolate you cannot think how grateful i feel to you or what a good friend i am sure you are and florence in her earnestness thanked him again and again and mr toots in his earnestness hurried awaybut backwards that he might lose no glimpse of her  florence had not the courage to go out when she saw poor susan in the hall with mrs pipchin driving her forth and diogenes jumping about her and terrifying mrs pipchin to the last degree by making snaps at her bombazeen skirts and howling with anguish at the sound of her voicefor the good duenna was the dearest and most cherished aversion of his breast but she saw susan shake hands with the servants all round and turn once to look at her old home and she saw diogenes bound out after the cab and want to follow it and testify an impossibility of conviction that he had no longer any property in the fare and the door was shut and the hurry over and her tears flowed fast for the loss of an old friend whom no one could replace no one no one  mr toots like the leal and trusty soul he was stopped the cabriolet in a twinkling and told susan nipper of his commission at which she cried more than before  upon my soul and body said mr toots taking his seat beside her i feel for you upon my word and honour i think you can hardly know your own feelings better than i imagine them i can conceive nothing more dreadful than to have to leave miss dombey  susan abandoned herself to her grief now and it really was touching to see her  i say said mr toots now dont at least i mean now do you know  do what mr toots cried susan  why come home to my place and have some dinner before you start said mr toots my cooks a most respectable womanone of the most motherly people i ever sawand shell be delighted to make you comfortable her son said mr toots as an additional recommendation was educated in the bluecoat school and blown up in a powdermill  susan accepting this kind offer mr toots conducted her to his dwelling where they were received by the matron in question who fully justified his character of her and by the chicken who at first supposed on seeing a lady in the vehicle that mr dombey had been doubled up ably to his old recommendation and miss dombey abducted this gentleman awakened in miss nipper some considerable astonishment for having been defeated by the larkey boy his visage was in a state of such great dilapidation as to be hardly presentable in society with comfort to the beholders the chicken himself attributed this punishment to his having had the misfortune to get into chancery early in the proceedings when he was severely fibbed by the larkey one and heavily grassed but it appeared from the published records of that great contest that the larkey boy had had it all his own way from the beginning and that the chicken had been tapped and bunged and had received pepper and had been made groggy and had come up piping and had endured a complication of similar strange inconveniences until he had been gone into and finished  after a good repast and much hospitality susan set out for the coachoffice in another cabriolet with mr toots inside as before and the chicken on the box who whatever distinction he conferred on the little party by the moral weight and heroism of his character was scarcely ornamental to it physically speaking on account of his plasters which were numerous but the chicken had registered a vow in secret that he would never leave mr toots who was secretly pining to get rid of him for any less consideration than the goodwill and fixtures of a publichouse and being ambitious to go into that line and drink himself to death as soon as possible he felt it his cue to make his company unacceptable  the nightcoach by which susan was to go was on the point of departure mr toots having put her inside lingered by the window irresolutely until the driver was about to mount when standing on the step and putting in a face that by the light of the lamp was anxious and confused he said abruptly  i say susan miss dombey you know  yes sir  do you think she couldyou knoweh  i beg your pardon mr toots said susan but i dont hear you  do you think she could be brought you knownot exactly at once but in timein a long timetoto love me you know there said poor mr toots  oh dear no returned susan shaking her head i should say never never  thankee said mr toots its of no consequence goodnight its of no consequence thankee    chapter 45 the trusty agent   edith went out alone that day and returned home early it was but a few minutes after ten oclock when her carriage rolled along the street in which she lived  there was the same enforced composure on her face that there had been when she was dressing and the wreath upon her head encircled the same cold and steady brow but it would have been better to have seen its leaves and flowers reft into fragments by her passionate hand or rendered shapeless by the fitful searches of a throbbing and bewildered brain for any restingplace than adorning such tranquillity so obdurate so unapproachable so unrelenting one would have thought that nothing could soften such a womans nature and that everything in life had hardened it  arrived at her own door she was alighting when some one coming quietly from the hall and standing bareheaded offered her his arm the servant being thrust aside she had no choice but to touch it and she then knew whose arm it was  how is your patient sir she asked with a curled lip  he is better returned carker he is doing very well i have left him for the night  she bent her head and was passing up the staircase when he followed and said speaking at the bottom  madam may i beg the favour of a minutes audience  she stopped and turned her eyes back it is an unseasonable time sir and i am fatigued is your business urgent  it is very urgent returned carker as i am so fortunate as to have met you let me press my petition  she looked down for a moment at his glistening mouth and he looked up at her standing above him in her stately dress and thought again how beautiful she was  where is miss dombey she asked the servant aloud  in the morning room maam  show the way there turning her eyes again on the attentive gentleman at the bottom of the stairs and informing him with a slight motion of her head that he was at liberty to follow she passed on  i beg your pardon madam mrs dombey cried the soft and nimble carker at her side in a moment may i be permitted to entreat that miss dombey is not present  she confronted him with a quick look but with the same selfpossession and steadiness  i would spare miss dombey said carker in a low voice the knowledge of what i have to say at least madam i would leave it to you to decide whether she shall know of it or not i owe that to you it is my bounden duty to you after our former interview it would be monstrous in me if i did otherwise  she slowly withdrew her eyes from his face and turning to the servant said some other room he led the way to a drawingroom which he speedily lighted up and then left them while he remained not a word was spoken edith enthroned herself upon a couch by the fire and mr carker with his hat in his hand and his eyes bent upon the carpet stood before her at some little distance  before i hear you sir said edith when the door was closed i wish you to hear me  to be addressed by mrs dombey he returned even in accents of unmerited reproach is an honour i so greatly esteem that although i were not her servant in all things i should defer to such a wish most readily  if you are charged by the man whom you have just now left sir mr carker raised his eyes as if he were going to counterfeit surprise but she met them and stopped him if such were his intention with any message to me do not attempt to deliver it for i will not receive it i need scarcely ask you if you are come on such an errand i have expected you some time  it is my misfortune he replied to be here wholly against my will for such a purpose allow me to say that i am here for two purposes that is one  that one sir she returned is ended or if you return to it  can mrs dombey believe said carker coming nearer that i would return to it in the face of her prohibition is it possible that mrs dombey having no regard to my unfortunate position is so determined to consider me inseparable from my instructor as to do me great and wilful injustice  sir returned edith bending her dark gaze full upon him and speaking with a rising passion that inflated her proud nostril and her swelling neck and stirred the delicate white down upon a robe she wore thrown loosely over shoulders that could hear its snowy neighbourhood why do you present yourself to me as you have done and speak to me of love and duty to my husband and pretend to think that i am happily married and that i honour him how dare you venture so to affront me when you knowi do not know better sir i have seen it in your every glance and heard it in your every wordthat in place of affection between us there is aversion and contempt and that i despise him hardly less than i despise myself for being his injustice if i had done justice to the torment you have made me feel and to my sense of the insult you have put upon me i should have slain you  she had asked him why he did this had she not been blinded by her pride and wrath and selfhumiliationwhich she was fiercely as she bent her gaze upon himshe would have seen the answer in his face to bring her to this declaration  she saw it not and cared not whether it was there or no she saw only the indignities and struggles she had undergone and had to undergo and was writhing under them as she sat looking fixedly at them rather than at him she plucked the feathers from a pinion of some rare and beautiful bird which hung from her wrist by a golden thread to serve her as a fan and rained them on the ground  he did not shrink beneath her gaze but stood until such outward signs of her anger as had escaped her control subsided with the air of a man who had his sufficient reply in reserve and would presently deliver it and he then spoke looking straight into her kindling eyes  madam he said i know and knew before today that i have found no favour with you and i knew why yes i knew why you have spoken so openly to me i am so relieved by the possession of your confidence  confidence she repeated with disdain  he passed it over  that i will make no pretence of concealment i did see from the first that there was no affection on your part for mr dombeyhow could it possibly exist between such different subjects and i have seen since that stronger feelings than indifference have been engendered in your breasthow could that possibly be otherwise either circumstanced as you have been but was it for me to presume to avow this knowledge to you in so many words  was it for you sir she replied to feign that other belief and audaciously to thrust it on me day by day  madam it was he eagerly retorted if i had done less if i had done anything but that i should not be speaking to you thus and i foresawwho could better foresee for who has had greater experience of mr dombey than myselfthat unless your character should prove to be as yielding and obedient as that of his first submissive lady which i did not believe  a haughty smile gave him reason to observe that he might repeat this  i say which i did not believethe time was likely to come when such an understanding as we have now arrived at would be serviceable  serviceable to whom sir she demanded scornfully  to you i will not add to myself as warning me to refrain even from that limited commendation of mr dombey in which i can honestly indulge in order that i may not have the misfortune of saying anything distasteful to one whose aversion and contempt with great expression are so keen  is it honest in you sir said edith to confess to your limited commendation and to speak in that tone of disparagement even of him being his chief counsellor and flatterer  counselloryes said carker flattererno a little reservation i fear i must confess to but our interest and convenience commonly oblige many of us to make professions that we cannot feel we have partnerships of interest and convenience friendships of interest and convenience dealings of interest and convenience marriages of interest and convenience every day  she bit her bloodred lip but without wavering in the dark stern watch she kept upon him  madam said mr carker sitting down in a chair that was near her with an air of the most profound and most considerate respect why should i hesitate now being altogether devoted to your service to speak plainly it was natural that a lady endowed as you are should think it feasible to change her husbands character in some respects and mould him to a better form  it was not natural to me sir she rejoined i had never any expectation or intention of that kind  the proud undaunted face showed him it was resolute to wear no mask he offered but was set upon a reckless disclosure of itself indifferent to any aspect in which it might present itself to such as he  at least it was natural he resumed that you should deem it quite possible to live with mr dombey as his wife at once without submitting to him and without coming into such violent collision with him but madam you did not know mr dombey as you have since ascertained when you thought that you did not know how exacting and how proud he is or how he is if i may say so the slave of his own greatness and goes yoked to his own triumphal car like a beast of burden with no idea on earth but that it is behind him and is to be drawn on over everything and through everything  his teeth gleamed through his malicious relish of this conceit as he went on talking  mr dombey is really capable of no more true consideration for you madam than for me the comparison is an extreme one i intend it to be so but quite just mr dombey in the plenitude of his power asked mei had it from his own lips yesterday morningto be his gobetween to you because he knows i am not agreeable to you and because he intends that i shall be a punishment for your contumacy and besides that because he really does consider that i his paid servant am an ambassador whom it is derogatory to the dignitynot of the lady to whom i have the happiness of speaking she has no existence in his mindbut of his wife a part of himself to receive you may imagine how regardless of me how obtuse to the possibility of my having any individual sentiment or opinion he is when he tells me openly that i am so employed you know how perfectly indifferent to your feelings he is when he threatens you with such a messenger as you of course have not forgotten that he did  she watched him still attentively but he watched her too and he saw that this indication of a knowledge on his part of something that had passed between herself and her husband rankled and smarted in her haughty breast like a poisoned arrow  i do not recall all this to widen the breach between yourself and mr dombey madamheaven forbid what would it profit mebut as an example of the hopelessness of impressing mr dombey with a sense that anybody is to be considered when he is in question we who are about him have in our various positions done our part i daresay to confirm him in his way of thinking but if we had not done so others wouldor they would not have been about him and it has always been from the beginning the very staple of his life mr dombey has had to deal in short with none but submissive and dependent persons who have bowed the knee and bent the neck before him he has never known what it is to have angry pride and strong resentment opposed to him  but he will know it now she seemed to say though her lips did not part nor her eyes falter he saw the soft down tremble once again and he saw her lay the plumage of the beautiful bird against her bosom for a moment and he unfolded one more ring of the coil into which he had gathered himself  mr dombey though a most honourable gentleman he said is so prone to pervert even facts to his own view when he is at all opposed in consequence of the warp in his mind that hecan i give a better instance than thishe sincerely believes you will excuse the folly of what i am about to say it not being mine that his severe expression of opinion to his present wife on a certain special occasion she may remember before the lamented death of mrs skewton produced a withering effect and for the moment quite subdued her  edith laughed how harshly and unmusically need not be described it is enough that he was glad to hear her  madam he resumed i have done with this your own opinions are so strong and i am persuaded so unalterable he repeated those words slowly and with great emphasis that i am almost afraid to incur your displeasure anew when i say that in spite of these defects and my full knowledge of them i have become habituated to mr dombey and esteem him but when i say so it is not believe me for the mere sake of vaunting a feeling that is so utterly at variance with your own and for which you can have no sympathyoh how distinct and plain and emphasized this wasbut to give you an assurance of the zeal with which in this unhappy matter i am yours and the indignation with which i regard the part i am to fill  she sat as if she were afraid to take her eyes from his face  and now to unwind the last ring of the coil  it is growing late said carker after a pause and you are as you said fatigued but the second object of this interview i must not forget i must recommend you i must entreat you in the most earnest manner for sufficient reasons that i have to be cautious in your demonstrations of regard for miss dombey  cautious what do you mean  to be careful how you exhibit too much affection for that young lady  too much affection sir said edith knitting her broad brow and rising who judges my affection or measures it out you  it is not i who do so he was or feigned to be perplexed  who then  can you not guess who then  i do not choose to guess she answered  madam he said after a little hesitation meantime they had been and still were regarding each other as before i am in a difficulty here you have told me you will receive no message and you have forbidden me to return to that subject but the two subjects are so closely entwined i find that unless you will accept this vague caution from one who has now the honour to possess your confidence though the way to it has been through your displeasure i must violate the injunction you have laid upon me  you know that you are free to do so sir said edith do it  so pale so trembling so impassioned he had not miscalculated the effect then  his instructions were he said in a low voice that i should inform you that your demeanour towards miss dombey is not agreeable to him that it suggests comparisons to him which are not favourable to himself that he desires it may be wholly changed and that if you are in earnest he is confident it will be for your continued show of affection will not benefit its object  that is a threat she said  that is a threat he answered in his voiceless manner of assent adding aloud but not directed against you  proud erect and dignified as she stood confronting him and looking through him as she did with her full bright flashing eye and smiling as she was with scorn and bitterness she sunk as if the ground had dropped beneath her and in an instant would have fallen on the floor but that he caught her in his arms as instantaneously she threw him off the moment that he touched her and drawing back confronted him again immoveable with her hand stretched out  please to leave me say no more tonight  i feel the urgency of this said mr carker because it is impossible to say what unforeseen consequences might arise or how soon from your being unacquainted with his state of mind i understand miss dombey is concerned now at the dismissal of her old servant which is likely to have been a minor consequence in itself you dont blame me for requesting that miss dombey might not be present may i hope so  i do not please to leave me sir  i knew that your regard for the young lady which is very sincere and strong i am well persuaded would render it a great unhappiness to you ever to be a prey to the reflection that you had injured her position and ruined her future hopes said carker hurriedly but eagerly  no more tonight leave me if you please  i shall be here constantly in my attendance upon him and in the transaction of business matters you will allow me to see you again and to consult what should be done and learn your wishes  she motioned him towards the door  i cannot even decide whether to tell him i have spoken to you yet or to lead him to suppose that i have deferred doing so for want of opportunity or for any other reason it will be necessary that you should enable me to consult with you very soon  at any time but now she answered  you will understand when i wish to see you that miss dombey is not to be present and that i seek an interview as one who has the happiness to possess your confidence and who comes to render you every assistance in his power and perhaps on many occasions to ward off evil from her  looking at him still with the same apparent dread of releasing him for a moment from the influence of her steady gaze whatever that might be she answered yes and once more bade him go  he bowed as if in compliance but turning back when he had nearly reached the door said  i am forgiven and have explained my fault may ifor miss dombeys sake and for my owntake your hand before i go  she gave him the gloved hand she had maimed last night he took it in one of his and kissed it and withdrew and when he had closed the door he waved the hand with which he had taken hers and thrust it in his breast  edith saw no one that night but locked her door and kept herself alone  she did not weep she showed no greater agitation outwardly than when she was riding home she laid as proud a head upon her pillow as she had borne in her carriage and her prayer ran thus  may this man be a liar for if he has spoken truth she is lost to me and i have no hope left  this man meanwhile went home musing to bed thinking with a dainty pleasure how imperious her passion was how she had sat before him in her beauty with the dark eyes that had never turned away but once how the white down had fluttered how the birds feathers had been strewn upon the ground    chapter 46 recognizant and reflective   among sundry minor alterations in mr carkers life and habits that began to take place at this time none was more remarkable than the extraordinary diligence with which he applied himself to business and the closeness with which he investigated every detail that the affairs of the house laid open to him always active and penetrating in such matters his lynxeyed vigilance now increased twentyfold not only did his weary watch keep pace with every present point that every day presented to him in some new form but in the midst of these engrossing occupations he found leisurethat is he made itto review the past transactions of the firm and his share in them during a long series of years frequently when the clerks were all gone the offices dark and empty and all similar places of business shut up mr carker with the whole anatomy of the iron room laid bare before him would explore the mysteries of books and papers with the patient progress of a man who was dissecting the minutest nerves and fibres of his subject perch the messenger who usually remained on these occasions to entertain himself with the perusal of the price current by the light of one candle or to doze over the fire in the outer office at the imminent risk every moment of diving head foremost into the coalbox could not withhold the tribute of his admiration from this zealous conduct although it much contracted his domestic enjoyments and again and again expatiated to mrs perch now nursing twins on the industry and acuteness of their managing gentleman in the city  the same increased and sharp attention that mr carker bestowed on the business of the house he applied to his own personal affairs though not a partner in the concerna distinction hitherto reserved solely to inheritors of the great name of dombeyhe was in the receipt of some percentage on its dealings and participating in all its facilities for the employment of money to advantage was considered by the minnows among the tritons of the east a rich man it began to be said among these shrewd observers that jem carker of dombeys was looking about him to see what he was worth and that he was calling in his money at a good time like the longheaded fellow he was and bets were even offered on the stock exchange that jem was going to marry a rich widow  yet these cares did not in the least interfere with mr carkers watching of his chief or with his cleanness neatness sleekness or any catlike quality he possessed it was not so much that there was a change in him in reference to any of his habits as that the whole man was intensified everything that had been observable in him before was observable now but with a greater amount of concentration he did each single thing as if he did nothing elsea pretty certain indication in a man of that range of ability and purpose that he is doing something which sharpens and keeps alive his keenest powers  the only decided alteration in him was that as he rode to and fro along the streets he would fall into deep fits of musing like that in which he had come away from mr dombeys house on the morning of that gentlemans disaster at such times he would keep clear of the obstacles in his way mechanically and would appear to see and hear nothing until arrival at his destination or some sudden chance or effort roused him  walking his whitelegged horse thus to the countinghouse of dombey and son one day he was as unconscious of the observation of two pairs of womens eyes as of the fascinated orbs of rob the grinder who in waiting a streets length from the appointed place as a demonstration of punctuality vainly touched and retouched his hat to attract attention and trotted along on foot by his masters side prepared to hold his stirrup when he should alight  see where he goes cried one of these two women an old creature who stretched out her shrivelled arm to point him out to her companion a young woman who stood close beside her withdrawn like herself into a gateway  mrs browns daughter looked out at this bidding on the part of mrs brown and there were wrath and vengeance in her face  i never thought to look at him again she said in a low voice but its well i should perhaps i see i see  not changed said the old woman with a look of eager malice  he changed returned the other what for what has he suffered there is change enough for twenty in me isnt that enough  see where he goes muttered the old woman watching her daughter with her red eyes so easy and so trim ahorseback while we are in the mud  and of it said her daughter impatiently we are mud underneath his horses feet what should we be  in the intentness with which she looked after him again she made a hasty gesture with her hand when the old woman began to reply as if her view could be obstructed by mere sound her mother watching her and not him remained silent until her kindling glance subsided and she drew a long breath as if in the relief of his being gone  deary said the old woman then alice handsome gall ally she gently shook her sleeve to arouse her attention will you let him go like that when you can wring money from him why its a wickedness my daughter  havent i told you that i will not have money from him she returned and dont you yet believe me did i take his sisters money would i touch a penny if i knew it that had gone through his white handsunless it was indeed that i could poison it and send it back to him peace mother and come away  and him so rich murmured the old woman and us so poor  poor in not being able to pay him any of the harm we owe him returned her daughter let him give me that sort of riches and ill take them from him and use them come away its no good looking at his horse come away mother  but the old woman for whom the spectacle of rob the grinder returning down the street leading the riderless horse appeared to have some extraneous interest that it did not possess in itself surveyed that young man with the utmost earnestness and seeming to have whatever doubts she entertained resolved as he drew nearer glanced at her daughter with brightened eyes and with her finger on her lip and emerging from the gateway at the moment of his passing touched him on the shoulder  why wheres my sprightly rob been all this time she said as he turned round  the sprightly rob whose sprightliness was very much diminished by the salutation looked exceedingly dismayed and said with the water rising in his eyes  oh why cant you leave a poor cove alone misses brown when hes getting an honest livelihood and conducting himself respectable what do you come and deprive a cove of his character for by talking to him in the streets when hes taking his masters horse to a honest stablea horse youd go and sell for cats and dogs meat if you had your way why i thought said the grinder producing his concluding remark as if it were the climax of all his injuries that you was dead long ago  this is the way cried the old woman appealing to her daughter that he talks to me who knew him weeks and months together my deary and have stood his friend many and many a time among the pigeonfancying tramps and birdcatchers  let the birds be will you misses brown retorted rob in a tone of the acutest anguish i think a cove had better have to do with lions than them little creeturs for theyre always flying back in your face when you least expect it well how dye do and what do you want these polite inquiries the grinder uttered as it were under protest and with great exasperation and vindictiveness  hark how he speaks to an old friend my deary said mrs brown again appealing to her daughter but theres some of his old friends not so patient as me if i was to tell some that he knows and has spotted and cheated with where to find him  will you hold your tongue misses brown interrupted the miserable grinder glancing quickly round as though he expected to see his masters teeth shining at his elbow what do you take a pleasure in ruining a cove for at your time of life too when you ought to be thinking of a variety of things  what a gallant horse said the old woman patting the animals neck  let him alone will you misses brown cried rob pushing away her hand youre enough to drive a penitent cove mad  why what hurt do i do him child returned the old woman  hurt said rob hes got a master that would find it out if he was touched with a straw and he blew upon the place where the old womans hand had rested for a moment and smoothed it gently with his finger as if he seriously believed what he said  the old woman looking back to mumble and mouth at her daughter who followed kept close to robs heels as he walked on with the bridle in his hand and pursued the conversation  a good place rob eh said she youre in luck my child  oh dont talk about luck misses brown returned the wretched grinder facing round and stopping if youd never come or if youd go away then indeed a cove might be considered tolerable lucky cant you go along misses brown and not foller me blubbered rob with sudden defiance if the young womans a friend of yours why dont she take you away instead of letting you make yourself so disgraceful  what croaked the old woman putting her face close to his with a malevolent grin upon it that puckered up the loose skin down in her very throat do you deny your old chum have you lurked to my house fifty times and slept sound in a corner when you had no other bed but the pavingstones and do you talk to me like this have i bought and sold with you and helped you in my way of business schoolboy sneak and what not and do you tell me to go along could i raise a crowd of old company about you tomorrow morning that would follow you to ruin like copies of your own shadow and do you turn on me with your bold looks ill go come alice  stop misses brown cried the distracted grinder what are you doing of dont put yourself in a passion dont let her go if you please i havent meant any offence i said how dye do at first didnt i but you wouldnt answer how you do besides said rob piteously look here how can a cove stand talking in the street with his masters prad a wanting to be took to be rubbed down and his master up to every individgle thing that happens  the old woman made a show of being partially appeased but shook her head and mouthed and muttered still  come along to the stables and have a glass of something thats good for you misses brown cant you said rob instead of going on like that which is no good to you nor anybody else come along with her will you be so kind said rob im sure im delighted to see her if it wasnt for the horse  with this apology rob turned away a rueful picture of despair and walked his charge down a bye street the old woman mouthing at her daughter followed close upon him the daughter followed  turning into a silent little square or courtyard that had a great church tower rising above it and a packers warehouse and a bottlemakers warehouse for its places of business rob the grinder delivered the whitelegged horse to the hostler of a quaint stable at the corner and inviting mrs brown and her daughter to seat themselves upon a stone bench at the gate of that establishment soon reappeared from a neighbouring publichouse with a pewter measure and a glass  heres mastermr carker child said the old woman slowly as her sentiment before drinking lord bless him  why i didnt tell you who he was observed rob with staring eyes  we know him by sight said mrs brown whose working mouth and nodding head stopped for the moment in the fixedness of her attention we saw him pass this morning afore he got off his horse when you were ready to take it  ay ay returned rob appearing to wish that his readiness had carried him to any other placewhats the matter with her wont she drink  this inquiry had reference to alice who folded in her cloak sat a little apart profoundly inattentive to his offer of the replenished glass  the old woman shook her head dont mind her she said shes a strange creetur if you knowd her rob but mr carker  hush said rob glancing cautiously up at the packers and at the bottlemakers as if from any one of the tiers of warehouses mr carker might be looking down softly  why he aint here cried mrs brown  i dont know that muttered rob whose glance even wandered to the church tower as if he might be there with a supernatural power of hearing  good master inquired mrs brown  rob nodded and added in a low voice precious sharp  lives out of town dont he lovey said the old woman  when hes at home returned rob but we dont live at home just now  where then asked the old woman  lodgings up near mr dombeys returned rob  the younger woman fixed her eyes so searchingly upon him and so suddenly that rob was quite confounded and offered the glass again but with no more effect upon her than before  mr dombeyyou and i used to talk about him sometimes you know said rob to mrs brown you used to get me to talk about him  the old woman nodded  well mr dombey hes had a fall from his horse said rob unwillingly and my master has to be up there more than usual either with him or mrs dombey or some of em and so weve come to town  are they good friends loveyasked the old woman  who retorted rob  he and she  what mr and mrs dombey said rob how should i know  not themmaster and mrs dombey chick replied the old woman coaxingly  i dont know said rob looking round him again i suppose so how curious you are misses brown least said soonest mended  why theres no harm in it exclaimed the old woman with a laugh and a clap of her hands sprightly rob has grown tame since he has been well off theres no harm in it  no theres no harm in it i know returned rob with the same distrustful glance at the packers and the bottlemakers and the church but blabbing if its only about the number of buttons on my masters coat wont do i tell you it wont do with him a cove had better drown himself he says so i shouldnt have so much as told you what his name was if you hadnt known it talk about somebody else  as rob took another cautious survey of the yard the old woman made a secret motion to her daughter it was momentary but the daughter with a slight look of intelligence withdrew her eyes from the boys face and sat folded in her cloak as before  rob lovey said the old woman beckoning him to the other end of the bench you were always a pet and favourite of mine now werent you dont you know you were  yes misses brown replied the grinder with a very bad grace  and you could leave me said the old woman flinging her arms about his neck you could go away and grow almost out of knowledge and never come to tell your poor old friend how fortunate you were proud lad oho oho  oh heres a dreadful go for a cove thats got a master wide awake in the neighbourhood exclaimed the wretched grinder to be howled over like this here  wont you come and see me robby cried mrs brown oho wont you ever come and see me  yes i tell you yes i will returned the grinder  thats my own rob thats my lovey said mrs brown drying the tears upon her shrivelled face and giving him a tender squeeze at the old place rob  yes replied the grinder  soon robby dear cried mrs brown and often  yes yes yes replied rob i will indeed upon my soul and body  and then said mrs brown with her arms uplifted towards the sky and her head thrown back and shaking if hes true to his word ill never come anear him though i know where he is and never breathe a syllable about him never  this ejaculation seemed a drop of comfort to the miserable grinder who shook mrs brown by the hand upon it and implored her with tears in his eyes to leave a cove and not destroy his prospects mrs brown with another fond embrace assented but in the act of following her daughter turned back with her finger stealthily raised and asked in a hoarse whisper for some money  a shilling dear she said with her eager avaricious face or sixpence for old acquaintance sake im so poor and my handsome gallooking over her shouldershes my gal robhalf starves me  but as the reluctant grinder put it in her hand her daughter coming quietly back caught the hand in hen and twisted out the coin  what she said mother always money money from the first and to the last do you mind so little what i said but now here take it  the old woman uttered a moan as the money was restored but without in any other way opposing its restoration hobbled at her daughters side out of the yard and along the bye street upon which it opened the astonished and dismayed rob staring after them saw that they stopped and fell to earnest conversation very soon and more than once observed a darkly threatening action of the younger womans hand obviously having reference to someone of whom they spoke and a crooning feeble imitation of it on the part of mrs brown that made him earnestly hope he might not be the subject of their discourse  with the present consolation that they were gone and with the prospective comfort that mrs brown could not live for ever and was not likely to live long to trouble him the grinder not otherwise regretting his misdeeds than as they were attended with such disagreeable incidental consequences composed his ruffled features to a more serene expression by thinking of the admirable manner in which he had disposed of captain cuttle a reflection that seldom failed to put him in a flow of spirits and went to the dombey counting house to receive his masters orders  there his master so subtle and vigilant of eye that rob quaked before him more than half expecting to be taxed with mrs brown gave him the usual mornings box of papers for mr dombey and a note for mrs dombey merely nodding his head as an enjoinder to be careful and to use dispatcha mysterious admonition fraught in the grinders imagination with dismal warnings and threats and more powerful with him than any words  alone again in his own room mr carker applied himself to work and worked all day he saw many visitors overlooked a number of documents went in and out to and from sundry places of mercantile resort and indulged in no more abstraction until the days business was done but when the usual clearance of papers from his table was made at last he fell into his thoughtful mood once more  he was standing in his accustomed place and attitude with his eyes intently fixed upon the ground when his brother entered to bring back some letters that had been taken out in the course of the day he put them quietly on the table and was going immediately when mr carker the manager whose eyes had rested on him on his entrance as if they had all this time had him for the subject of their contemplation instead of the officefloor said  well john carker and what brings you here  his brother pointed to the letters and was again withdrawing  i wonder said the manager that you can come and go without inquiring how our master is  we had word this morning in the counting house that mr dombey was doing well replied his brother  you are such a meek fellow said the manager with a smilebut you have grown so in the course of yearsthat if any harm came to him youd be miserable i dare swear now  i should be truly sorry james returned the other  he would be sorry said the manager pointing at him as if there were some other person present to whom he was appealing he would be truly sorry this brother of mine this junior of the place this slighted piece of lumber pushed aside with his face to the wall like a rotten picture and left so for heaven knows how many years hes all gratitude and respect and devotion too he would have me believe  i would have you believe nothing james returned the other be as just to me as you would to any other man below you you ask a question and i answer it  and have you nothing spaniel said the manager with unusual irascibility to complain of in him no proud treatment to resent no insolence no foolery of state no exaction of any sort what the devil are you man or mouse  it would be strange if any two persons could be together for so many years especially as superior and inferior without each having something to complain of in the otheras he thought at all events replied john carker but apart from my history here  his history here exclaimed the manager why there it is the very fact that makes him an extreme case puts him out of the whole chapter well  apart from that which as you hint gives me a reason to be thankful that i alone happily for all the rest possess surely there is no one in the house who would not say and feel at least as much you do not think that anybody here would be indifferent to a mischance or misfortune happening to the head of the house or anything than truly sorry for it  you have good reason to be bound to him too said the manager contemptuously why dont you believe that you are kept here as a cheap example and a famous instance of the clemency of dombey and son redounding to the credit of the illustrious house  no replied his brother mildly i have long believed that i am kept here for more kind and disinterested reasons  but you were going said the manager with the snarl of a tigercat to recite some christian precept i observed  nay james returned the other though the tie of brotherhood between us has been long broken and thrown away  who broke it good sir said the manager  i by my misconduct i do not charge it upon you  the manager replied with that mute action of his bristling mouth oh you dont charge it upon me and bade him go on  i say though there is not that tie between us do not i entreat assail me with unnecessary taunts or misinterpret what i say or would say i was only going to suggest to you that it would be a mistake to suppose that it is only you who have been selected here above all others for advancement confidence and distinction selected in the beginning i know for your great ability and trustfulness and who communicate more freely with mr dombey than anyone and stand it may be said on equal terms with him and have been favoured and enriched by himthat it would be a mistake to suppose that it is only you who are tender of his welfare and reputation there is no one in the house from yourself down to the lowest i sincerely believe who does not participate in that feeling  you lie said the manager red with sudden anger youre a hypocrite john carker and you lie  james cried the other flushing in his turn what do you mean by these insulting words why do you so basely use them to me unprovoked  i tell you said the manager that your hypocrisy and meeknessthat all the hypocrisy and meekness of this placeis not worth that to me snapping his thumb and finger and that i see through it as if it were air there is not a man employed here standing between myself and the lowest in place of whom you are very considerate and with reason for he is not far off who wouldnt be glad at heart to see his master humbled who does not hate him secretly who does not wish him evil rather than good and who would not turn upon him if he had the power and boldness the nearer to his favour the nearer to his insolence the closer to him the farther from him thats the creed here  i dont know said his brother whose roused feelings had soon yielded to surprise who may have abused your ear with such representations or why you have chosen to try me rather than another but that you have been trying me and tampering with me i am now sure you have a different manner and a different aspect from any that i ever saw m you i will only say to you once more you are deceived  i know i am said the manager i have told you so  not by me returned his brother by your informant if you have one if not by your own thoughts and suspicions  i have no suspicions said the manager mine are certainties you pusillanimous abject cringing dogs all making the same show all canting the same story all whining the same professions all harbouring the same transparent secret  his brother withdrew without saying more and shut the door as he concluded mr carker the manager drew a chair close before the fire and fell to beating the coals softly with the poker  the fainthearted fawning knaves he muttered with his two shining rows of teeth laid bare theres not one among them who wouldnt feign to be so shocked and outraged bah theres not one among them but if he had at once the power and the wit and daring to use it would scatter dombeys pride and lay it low as ruthlessly as i rake out these ashes  as he broke them up and strewed them in the grate he looked on with a thoughtful smile at what he was doing without the same queen beckoner too he added presently and there is pride there not to be forgottenwitness our own acquaintance with that he fell into a deeper reverie and sat pondering over the blackening grate until he rose up like a man who had been absorbed in a book and looking round him took his hat and gloves went to where his horse was waiting mounted and rode away through the lighted streets for it was evening  he rode near mr dombeys house and falling into a walk as he approached it looked up at the windows the window where he had once seen florence sitting with her dog attracted his attention first though there was no light in it but he smiled as he carried his eyes up the tall front of the house and seemed to leave that object superciliously behind  time was he said when it was well to watch even your rising little star and know in what quarter there were clouds to shadow you if needful but a planet has arisen and you are lost in its light  he turned the whitelegged horse round the street corner and sought one shining window from among those at the back of the house associated with it was a certain stately presence a gloved hand the remembrance how the feathers of a beautiful birds wing had been showered down upon the floor and how the light white down upon a robe had stirred and rustled as in the rising of a distant storm these were the things he carried with him as he turned away again and rode through the darkening and deserted parks at a quick rate  in fatal truth these were associated with a woman a proud woman who hated him but who by slow and sure degrees had been led on by his craft and her pride and resentment to endure his company and little by little to receive him as one who had the privilege to talk to her of her own defiant disregard of her own husband and her abandonment of high consideration for herself they were associated with a woman who hated him deeply and who knew him and who mistrusted him because she knew him and because he knew her but who fed her fierce resentment by suffering him to draw nearer and yet nearer to her every day in spite of the hate she cherished for him in spite of it for that very reason since in its depths too far down for her threatening eye to pierce though she could see into them dimly lay the dark retaliation whose faintest shadow seen once and shuddered at and never seen again would have been sufficient stain upon her soul  did the phantom of such a woman flit about him on his ride true to the reality and obvious to him  yes he saw her in his mind exactly as she was she bore him company with her pride resentment hatred all as plain to him as her beauty with nothing plainer to him than her hatred of him he saw her sometimes haughty and repellent at his side and some times down among his horses feet fallen and in the dust but he always saw her as she was without disguise and watched her on the dangerous way that she was going  and when his ride was over and he was newly dressed and came into the light of her bright room with his bent head soft voice and soothing smile he saw her yet as plainly he even suspected the mystery of the gloved hand and held it all the longer in his own for that suspicion upon the dangerous way that she was going he was still and not a footprint did she mark upon it but he set his own there straight    chapter 47 the thunderbolt   the barrier between mr dombey and his wife was not weakened by time illassorted couple unhappy in themselves and in each other bound together by no tie but the manacle that joined their fettered hands and straining that so harshly in their shrinking asunder that it wore and chafed to the bone time consoler of affliction and softener of anger could do nothing to help them their pride however different in kind and object was equal in degree and in their flinty opposition struck out fire between them which might smoulder or might blaze as circumstances were but burned up everything within their mutual reach and made their marriage way a road of ashes  let us be just to him in the monstrous delusion of his life swelling with every grain of sand that shifted in its glass he urged her on he little thought to what or considered how but still his feeling towards her such as it was remained as at first she had the grand demerit of unaccountably putting herself in opposition to the recognition of his vast importance and to the acknowledgment of her complete submission to it and so far it was necessary to correct and reduce her but otherwise he still considered her in his cold way a lady capable of doing honour if she would to his choice and name and of reflecting credit on his proprietorship  now she with all her might of passionate and proud resentment bent her dark glance from day to day and hour to hourfrom that night in her own chamber when she had sat gazing at the shadows on the wall to the deeper night fast comingupon one figure directing a crowd of humiliations and exasperations against her and that figure still her husbands  was mr dombeys mastervice that ruled him so inexorably an unnatural characteristic it might be worthwhile sometimes to inquire what nature is and how men work to change her and whether in the enforced distortions so produced it is not natural to be unnatural coop any son or daughter of our mighty mother within narrow range and bind the prisoner to one idea and foster it by servile worship of it on the part of the few timid or designing people standing round and what is nature to the willing captive who has never risen up upon the wings of a free minddrooping and useless soonto see her in her comprehensive truth  alas are there so few things in the world about us most unnatural and yet most natural in being so hear the magistrate or judge admonish the unnatural outcasts of society unnatural in brutal habits unnatural in want of decency unnatural in losing and confounding all distinctions between good and evil unnatural in ignorance in vice in recklessness in contumacy in mind in looks in everything but follow the good clergyman or doctor who with his life imperilled at every breath he draws goes down into their dens lying within the echoes of our carriage wheels and daily tread upon the pavement stones look round upon the world of odious sightsmillions of immortal creatures have no other world on earthat the lightest mention of which humanity revolts and dainty delicacy living in the next street stops her ears and lisps i dont believe it breathe the polluted air foul with every impurity that is poisonous to health and life and have every sense conferred upon our race for its delight and happiness offended sickened and disgusted and made a channel by which misery and death alone can enter vainly attempt to think of any simple plant or flower or wholesome weed that set in this foetid bed could have its natural growth or put its little leaves off to the sun as god designed it and then calling up some ghastly child with stunted form and wicked face hold forth on its unnatural sinfulness and lament its being so early far away from heavenbut think a little of its having been conceived and born and bred in hell  those who study the physical sciences and bring them to bear upon the health of man tell us that if the noxious particles that rise from vitiated air were palpable to the sight we should see them lowering in a dense black cloud above such haunts and rolling slowly on to corrupt the better portions of a town but if the moral pestilence that rises with them and in the eternal laws of our nature is inseparable from them could be made discernible too how terrible the revelation then should we see depravity impiety drunkenness theft murder and a long train of nameless sins against the natural affections and repulsions of mankind overhanging the devoted spots and creeping on to blight the innocent and spread contagion among the pure then should we see how the same poisoned fountains that flow into our hospitals and lazarhouses inundate the jails and make the convictships swim deep and roll across the seas and overrun vast continents with crime then should we stand appalled to know that where we generate disease to strike our children down and entail itself on unborn generations there also we breed by the same certain process infancy that knows no innocence youth without modesty or shame maturity that is mature in nothing but in suffering and guilt blasted old age that is a scandal on the form we bear unnatural humanity when we shall gather grapes from thorns and figs from thistles when fields of grain shall spring up from the offal in the byeways of our wicked cities and roses bloom in the fat churchyards that they cherish then we may look for natural humanity and find it growing from such seed  oh for a good spirit who would take the housetops off with a more potent and benignant hand than the lame demon in the tale and show a christian people what dark shapes issue from amidst their homes to swell the retinue of the destroying angel as he moves forth among them for only one nights view of the pale phantoms rising from the scenes of our toolong neglect and from the thick and sullen air where vice and fever propagate together raining the tremendous social retributions which are ever pouring down and ever coming thicker bright and blest the morning that should rise on such a night for men delayed no more by stumblingblocks of their own making which are but specks of dust upon the path between them and eternity would then apply themselves like creatures of one common origin owing one duty to the father of one family and tending to one common end to make the world a better place  not the less bright and blest would that day be for rousing some who never have looked out upon the world of human life around them to a knowledge of their own relation to it and for making them acquainted with a perversion of nature in their own contracted sympathies and estimates as great and yet as natural in its development when once begun as the lowest degradation known  but no such day had ever dawned on mr dombey or his wife and the course of each was taken  through six months that ensued upon his accident they held the same relations one towards the other a marble rock could not have stood more obdurately in his way than she and no chilled spring lying uncheered by any ray of light in the depths of a deep cave could be more sullen or more cold than he  the hope that had fluttered within her when the promise of her new home dawned was quite gone from the heart of florence now that home was nearly two years old and even the patient trust that was in her could not survive the daily blight of such experience if she had any lingering fancy in the nature of hope left that edith and her father might be happier together in some distant time she had none now that her father would ever love her the little interval in which she had imagined that she saw some small relenting in him was forgotten in the long remembrance of his coldness since and before or only remembered as a sorrowful delusion  florence loved him still but by degrees had come to love him rather as some dear one who had been or who might have been than as the hard reality before her eyes something of the softened sadness with which she loved the memory of little paul or of her mother seemed to enter now into her thoughts of him and to make them as it were a dear remembrance whether it was that he was dead to her and that partly for this reason partly for his share in those old objects of her affection and partly for the long association of him with hopes that were withered and tendernesses he had frozen she could not have told but the father whom she loved began to be a vague and dreamy idea to her hardly more substantially connected with her real life than the image she would sometimes conjure up of her dear brother yet alive and growing to be a man who would protect and cherish her  the change if it may be called one had stolen on her like the change from childhood to womanhood and had come with it florence was almost seventeen when in her lonely musings she was conscious of these thoughts  she was often alone now for the old association between her and her mama was greatly changed at the time of her fathers accident and when he was lying in his room downstairs florence had first observed that edith avoided her wounded and shocked and yet unable to reconcile this with her affection when they did meet she sought her in her own room at night once more  mama said florence stealing softly to her side have i offended you  edith answered no  i must have done something said florence tell me what it is you have changed your manner to me dear mama i cannot say how instantly i feel the least change for i love you with my whole heart  as i do you said edith ah florence believe me never more than now  why do you go away from me so often and keep away asked florence and why do you sometimes look so strangely on me dear mama you do so do you not  edith signified assent with her dark eyes  why returned florence imploringly tell me why that i may know how to please you better and tell me this shall not be so any more  my florence answered edith taking the hand that embraced her neck and looking into the eyes that looked into hers so lovingly as florence knelt upon the ground before her why it is i cannot tell you it is neither for me to say nor you to hear but that it is and that it must be i know should i do it if i did not  are we to be estranged mama asked florence gazing at her like one frightened  ediths silent lips formed yes  florence looked at her with increasing fear and wonder until she could see her no more through the blinding tears that ran down her face  florence my life said edith hurriedly listen to me i cannot bear to see this grief be calmer you see that i am composed and is it nothing to me  she resumed her steady voice and manner as she said the latter words and added presently  not wholly estranged partially and only that in appearance florence for in my own breast i am still the same to you and ever will be but what i do is not done for myself  is it for me mama asked florence  it is enough said edith after a pause to know what it is why matters little dear florence it is betterit is necessaryit must bethat our association should be less frequent the confidence there has been between us must be broken off  when cried florence oh mama when  now said edith  for all time to come asked florence  i do not say that answered edith i do not know that nor will i say that companionship between us is at the best an illassorted and unholy union of which i might have known no good could come my way here has been through paths that you will never tread and my way henceforth may liegod knowsi do not see it  her voice died away into silence and she sat looking at florence and almost shrinking from her with the same strange dread and wild avoidance that florence had noticed once before the same dark pride and rage succeeded sweeping over her form and features like an angry chord across the strings of a wild harp but no softness or humility ensued on that she did not lay her head down now and weep and say that she had no hope but in florence she held it up as if she were a beautiful medusa looking on him face to face to strike him dead yes and she would have done it if she had had the charm  mama said florence anxiously there is a change in you in more than what you say to me which alarms me let me stay with you a little  no said edith no dearest i am best left alone now and i do best to keep apart from you of all else ask me no questions but believe that what i am when i seem fickle or capricious to you i am not of my own will or for myself believe though we are stranger to each other than we have been that i am unchanged to you within forgive me for having ever darkened your dark homei am a shadow on it i know welland let us never speak of this again  mama sobbed florence we are not to part  we do this that we may not part said edith ask no more go florence my love and my remorse go with you  she embraced her and dismissed her and as florence passed out of her room edith looked on the retiring figure as if her good angel went out in that form and left her to the haughty and indignant passions that now claimed her for their own and set their seal upon her brow  from that hour florence and she were as they had been no more for days together they would seldom meet except at table and when mr dombey was present then edith imperious inflexible and silent never looked at her whenever mr carker was of the party as he often was during the progress of mr dombeys recovery and afterwards edith held herself more removed from her and was more distant towards her than at other times yet she and florence never encountered when there was no one by but she would embrace her as affectionately as of old though not with the same relenting of her proud aspect and often when she had been out late she would steal up to florences room as she had been used to do in the dark and whisper goodnight on her pillow when unconscious in her slumber of such visits florence would sometimes awake as from a dream of those words softly spoken and would seem to feel the touch of lips upon her face but less and less often as the months went on  and now the void in florences own heart began again indeed to make a solitude around her as the image of the father whom she loved had insensibly become a mere abstraction so edith following the fate of all the rest about whom her affections had entwined themselves was fleeting fading growing paler in the distance every day little by little she receded from florence like the retiring ghost of what she had been little by little the chasm between them widened and seemed deeper little by little all the power of earnestness and tenderness she had shown was frozen up in the bold angry hardihood with which she stood upon the brink of a deep precipice unseen by florence daring to look down  there was but one consideration to set against the heavy loss of edith and though it was slight comfort to her burdened heart she tried to think it some relief no longer divided between her affection and duty to the two florence could love both and do no injustice to either as shadows of her fond imagination she could give them equal place in her own bosom and wrong them with no doubts  so she tried to do at times and often too wondering speculations on the cause of this change in edith would obtrude themselves upon her mind and frighten her but in the calm of its abandonment once more to silent grief and loneliness it was not a curious mind florence had only to remember that her star of promise was clouded in the general gloom that hung upon the house and to weep and be resigned  thus living in a dream wherein the overflowing love of her young heart expended itself on airy forms and in a real world where she had experienced little but the rolling back of that strong tide upon itself florence grew to be seventeen timid and retiring as her solitary life had made her it had not embittered her sweet temper or her earnest nature a child in innocent simplicity a woman m her modest selfreliance and her deep intensity of feeling both child and woman seemed at once expressed in her face and fragile delicacy of shape and gracefully to mingle thereas if the spring should be unwilling to depart when summer came and sought to blend the earlier beauties of the flowers with their bloom but in her thrilling voice in her calm eyes sometimes in a sage ethereal light that seemed to rest upon her head and always in a certain pensive air upon her beauty there was an expression such as had been seen in the dead boy and the council in the servants hall whispered so among themselves and shook their heads and ate and drank the more in a closer bond of goodfellowship  this observant body had plenty to say of mr and mrs dombey and of mr carker who appeared to be a mediator between them and who came and went as if he were trying to make peace but never could they all deplored the uncomfortable state of affairs and all agreed that mrs pipchin whose unpopularity was not to be surpassed had some hand in it but upon the whole it was agreeable to have so good a subject for a rallying point and they made a great deal of it and enjoyed themselves very much  the general visitors who came to the house and those among whom mr and mrs dombey visited thought it a pretty equal match as to haughtiness at all events and thought nothing more about it the young lady with the back did not appear for some time after mrs skewtons death observing to some particular friends with her usual engaging little scream that she couldnt separate the family from a notion of tombstones and horrors of that sort but when she did come she saw nothing wrong except mr dombeys wearing a bunch of gold seals to his watch which shocked her very much as an exploded superstition this youthful fascinator considered a daughterinlaw objectionable in principle otherwise she had nothing to say against florence but that she sadly wanted stylewhich might mean back perhaps many who only came to the house on state occasions hardly knew who florence was and said going home indeed was that miss dombey in the corner very pretty but a little delicate and thoughtful in appearance  none the less so certainly for her life of the last six months florence took her seat at the dinnertable on the day before the second anniversary of her fathers marriage to edith mrs skewton had been lying stricken with paralysis when the first came round with an uneasiness amounting to dread she had no other warrant for it than the occasion the expression of her fathers face in the hasty glance she caught of it and the presence of mr carker which always unpleasant to her was more so on this day than she had ever felt it before  edith was richly dressed for she and mr dombey were engaged in the evening to some large assembly and the dinnerhour that day was late she did not appear until they were seated at table when mr carker rose and led her to her chair beautiful and lustrous as she was there was that in her face and air which seemed to separate her hopelessly from florence and from everyone for ever more and yet for an instant florence saw a beam of kindness in her eyes when they were turned on her that made the distance to which she had withdrawn herself a greater cause of sorrow and regret than ever  there was very little said at dinner florence heard her father speak to mr carker sometimes on business matters and heard him softly reply but she paid little attention to what they said and only wished the dinner at an end when the dessert was placed upon the table and they were left alone with no servant in attendance mr dombey who had been several times clearing his throat in a manner that augured no good said  mrs dombey you know i suppose that i have instructed the housekeeper that there will be some company to dinner here tomorrow  i do not dine at home she answered  not a large party pursued mr dombey with an indifferent assumption of not having heard her merely some twelve or fourteen my sister major bagstock and some others whom you know but slightly  i do not dine at home she repeated  however doubtful reason i may have mrs dombey said mr dombey still going majestically on as if she had not spoken to hold the occasion in very pleasant remembrance just now there are appearances in these things which must be maintained before the world if you have no respect for yourself mrs dombey  i have none she said  madam cried mr dombey striking his hand upon the table hear me if you please i say if you have no respect for yourself  and i say i have none she answered  he looked at her but the face she showed him in return would not have changed if death itself had looked  carker said mr dombey turning more quietly to that gentleman as you have been my medium of communication with mrs dombey on former occasions and as i choose to preserve the decencies of life so far as i am individually concerned i will trouble you to have the goodness to inform mrs dombey that if she has no respect for herself i have some respect for myself and therefore insist on my arrangements for tomorrow  tell your sovereign master sir said edith that i will take leave to speak to him on this subject byandbye and that i will speak to him alone  mr carker madam said her husband being in possession of the reason which obliges me to refuse you that privilege shall be absolved from the delivery of any such message he saw her eyes move while he spoke and followed them with his own  your daughter is present sir said edith  my daughter will remain present said mr dombey  florence who had risen sat down again hiding her face in her hands and trembling  my daughter madambegan mr dombey  but edith stopped him in a voice which although not raised in the least was so clear emphatic and distinct that it might have been heard in a whirlwind  i tell you i will speak to you alone she said if you are not mad heed what i say  i have authority to speak to you madam returned her husband when and where i please and it is my pleasure to speak here and now  she rose up as if to leave the room but sat down again and looking at him with all outward composure said in the same voice  you shall  i must tell you first that there is a threatening appearance in your manner madam said mr dombey which does not become you  she laughed the shaken diamonds in her hair started and trembled there are fables of precious stones that would turn pale their wearer being in danger had these been such their imprisoned rays of light would have taken flight that moment and they would have been as dull as lead  carker listened with his eyes cast down  as to my daughter madam said mr dombey resuming the thread of his discourse it is by no means inconsistent with her duty to me that she should know what conduct to avoid at present you are a very strong example to her of this kind and i hope she may profit by it  i would not stop you now returned his wife immoveable in eye and voice and attitude i would not rise and go away and save you the utterance of one word if the room were burning  mr dombey moved his head as if in a sarcastic acknowledgment of the attention and resumed but not with so much selfpossession as before for ediths quick uneasiness in reference to florence and ediths indifference to him and his censure chafed and galled him like a stiffening wound  mrs dombey said he it may not be inconsistent with my daughters improvement to know how very much to be lamented and how necessary to be corrected a stubborn disposition is especially when it is indulged inunthankfully indulged in i will addafter the gratification of ambition and interest both of which i believe had some share in inducing you to occupy your present station at this board  no i would not rise and go away and save you the utterance of one word she repeated exactly as before if the room were burning  it may be natural enough mrs dombey he pursued that you should be uneasy in the presence of any auditors of these disagreeable truths though whyhe could not hide his real feeling here or keep his eyes from glancing gloomily at florencewhy anyone can give them greater force and point than myself whom they so nearly concern i do not pretend to understand it may be natural enough that you should object to hear in anybodys presence that there is a rebellious principle within you which you cannot curb too soon which you must curb mrs dombey and which i regret to say i remember to have seen manifestedwith some doubt and displeasure on more than one occasion before our marriagetowards your deceased mother but you have the remedy in your own hands i by no means forgot when i began that my daughter was present mrs dombey i beg you will not forget tomorrow that there are several persons present and that with some regard to appearances you will receive your company in a becoming manner  so it is not enough said edith that you know what has passed between yourself and me it is not enough that you can look here pointing at carker who still listened with his eyes cast down and be reminded of the affronts you have put upon me it is not enough that you can look here pointing to florence with a hand that slightly trembled for the first and only time and think of what you have done and of the ingenious agony daily hourly constant you have made me feel in doing it it is not enough that this day of all others in the year is memorable to me for a struggle welldeserved but not conceivable by such as you in which i wish i had died you add to all this do you the last crowning meanness of making her a witness of the depth to which i have fallen when you know that you have made me sacrifice to her peace the only gentle feeling and interest of my life when you know that for her sake i would now if i couldbut i can not my soul recoils from you too muchsubmit myself wholly to your will and be the meekest vassal that you have  this was not the way to minister to mr dombeys greatness the old feeling was roused by what she said into a stronger and fiercer existence than it had ever had again his neglected child at this rough passage of his life put forth by even this rebellious woman as powerful where he was powerless and everything where he was nothing  he turned on florence as if it were she who had spoken and bade her leave the room florence with her covered face obeyed trembling and weeping as she went  i understand madam said mr dombey with an angry flush of triumph the spirit of opposition that turned your affections in that channel but they have been met mrs dombey they have been met and turned back  the worse for you she answered with her voice and manner still unchanged ay for he turned sharply when she said so what is the worse for me is twenty million times the worse for you heed that if you heed nothing else  the arch of diamonds spanning her dark hair flashed and glittered like a starry bridge there was no warning in them or they would have turned as dull and dim as tarnished honour carker still sat and listened with his eyes cast down  mrs dombey said mr dombey resuming as much as he could of his arrogant composure you will not conciliate me or turn me from any purpose by this course of conduct  it is the only true although it is a faint expression of what is within me she replied but if i thought it would conciliate you i would repress it if it were repressible by any human effort i will do nothing that you ask  i am not accustomed to ask mrs dombey he observed i direct  i will hold no place in your house tomorrow or on any recurrence of tomorrow i will be exhibited to no one as the refractory slave you purchased such a time if i kept my marriage day i would keep it as a day of shame selfrespect appearances before the world what are these to me you have done all you can to make them nothing to me and they are nothing  carker said mr dombey speaking with knitted brows and after a moments consideration mrs dombey is so forgetful of herself and me in all this and places me in a position so unsuited to my character that i must bring this state of matters to a close  release me then said edith immoveable in voice in look and bearing as she had been throughout from the chain by which i am bound let me go  madam exclaimed mr dombey  loose me set me free  madam he repeated mrs dombey  tell him said edith addressing her proud face to carker that i wish for a separation between us that there had better be one that i recommend it to him tell him it may take place on his own termshis wealth is nothing to mebut that it cannot be too soon  good heaven mrs dombey said her husband with supreme amazement do you imagine it possible that i could ever listen to such a proposition do you know who i am madam do you know what i represent did you ever hear of dombey and son people to say that mr dombeymr dombeywas separated from his wife common people to talk of mr dombey and his domestic affairs do you seriously think mrs dombey that i would permit my name to be banded about in such connexion pooh pooh madam fie for shame youre absurd mr dombey absolutely laughed  but not as she did she had better have been dead than laugh as she did in reply with her intent look fixed upon him he had better have been dead than sitting there in his magnificence to hear her  no mrs dombey he resumed no madam there is no possibility of separation between you and me and therefore i the more advise you to be awakened to a sense of duty and carker as i was about to say to you  mr carker who had sat and listened all this time now raised his eyes in which there was a bright unusual light  as i was about to say to you resumed mr dombey i must beg you now that matters have come to this to inform mrs dombey that it is not the rule of my life to allow myself to be thwarted by anybodyanybody carkeror to suffer anybody to be paraded as a stronger motive for obedience in those who owe obedience to me than i am my self the mention that has been made of my daughter and the use that is made of my daughter in opposition to me are unnatural whether my daughter is in actual concert with mrs dombey i do not know and do not care but after what mrs dombey has said today and my daughter has heard today i beg you to make known to mrs dombey that if she continues to make this house the scene of contention it has become i shall consider my daughter responsible in some degree on that ladys own avowal and shall visit her with my severe displeasure mrs dombey has asked whether it is not enough that she had done this and that you will please to answer no it is not enough  a moment cried carker interposing permit me painful as my position is at the best and unusually painful in seeming to entertain a different opinion from you addressing mr dombey i must ask had you not better reconsider the question of a separation i know how incompatible it appears with your high public position and i know how determined you are when you give mrs dombey to understandthe light in his eyes fell upon her as he separated his words each from each with the distinctness of so many bellsthat nothing but death can ever part you nothing else but when you consider that mrs dombey by living in this house and making it as you have said a scene of contention not only has her part in that contention but compromises miss dombey every day for i know how determined you are will you not relieve her from a continual irritation of spirit and a continual sense of being unjust to another almost intolerable does this not seem likei do not say it issacrificing mrs dombey to the preservation of your preeminent and unassailable position  again the light in his eyes fell upon her as she stood looking at her husband now with an extraordinary and awful smile upon her face  carker returned mr dombey with a supercilious frown and in a tone that was intended to be final you mistake your position in offering advice to me on such a point and you mistake me i am surprised to find in the character of your advice i have no more to say  perhaps said carker with an unusual and indefinable taunt in his air you mistook my position when you honoured me with the negotiations in which i have been engaged herewith a motion of his hand towards mrs dombey  not at all sir not at all returned the other haughtily you were employed  being an inferior person for the humiliation of mrs dombey i forgot oh yes it was expressly understood said carker i beg your pardon  as he bent his head to mr dombey with an air of deference that accorded ill with his words though they were humbly spoken he moved it round towards her and kept his watching eyes that way  she had better have turned hideous and dropped dead than have stood up with such a smile upon her face in such a fallen spirits majesty of scorn and beauty she lifted her hand to the tiara of bright jewels radiant on her head and plucking it off with a force that dragged and strained her rich black hair with heedless cruelty and brought it tumbling wildly on her shoulders cast the gems upon the ground from each arm she unclasped a diamond bracelet flung it down and trod upon the glittering heap without a word without a shadow on the fire of her bright eye without abatement of her awful smile she looked on mr dombey to the last in moving to the door and left him  florence had heard enough before quitting the room to know that edith loved her yet that she had suffered for her sake and that she had kept her sacrifices quiet lest they should trouble her peace she did not want to speak to her of thisshe could not remembering to whom she was opposedbut she wished in one silent and affectionate embrace to assure her that she felt it all and thanked her  her father went out alone that evening and florence issuing from her own chamber soon afterwards went about the house in search of edith but unavailingly she was in her own rooms where florence had long ceased to go and did not dare to venture now lest she should unconsciously engender new trouble still florence hoping to meet her before going to bed changed from room to room and wandered through the house so splendid and so dreary without remaining anywhere  she was crossing a gallery of communication that opened at some little distance on the staircase and was only lighted on great occasions when she saw through the opening which was an arch the figure of a man coming down some few stairs opposite instinctively apprehensive of her father whom she supposed it was she stopped in the dark gazing through the arch into the light but it was mr carker coming down alone and looking over the railing into the hall no bell was rung to announce his departure and no servant was in attendance he went down quietly opened the door for himself glided out and shut it softly after him  her invincible repugnance to this man and perhaps the stealthy act of watching anyone which even under such innocent circumstances is in a manner guilty and oppressive made florence shake from head to foot her blood seemed to run cold as soon as she couldfor at first she felt an insurmountable dread of movingshe went quickly to her own room and locked her door but even then shut in with her dog beside her felt a chill sensation of horror as if there were danger brooding somewhere near her  it invaded her dreams and disturbed the whole night rising in the morning unrefreshed and with a heavy recollection of the domestic unhappiness of the preceding day she sought edith again in all the rooms and did so from time to time all the morning but she remained in her own chamber and florence saw nothing of her learning however that the projected dinner at home was put off florence thought it likely that she would go out in the evening to fulfil the engagement she had spoken of and resolved to try and meet her then upon the staircase  when the evening had set in she heard from the room in which she sat on purpose a footstep on the stairs that she thought to be ediths hurrying out and up towards her room florence met her immediately coming down alone  what was florences affright and wonder when at sight of her with her tearful face and outstretched arms edith recoiled and shrieked  dont come near me she cried keep away let me go by  mama said florence  dont call me by that name dont speak to me dont look at meflorence shrinking back as florence moved a step towards her dont touch me  as florence stood transfixed before the haggard face and staring eyes she noted as in a dream that edith spread her hands over them and shuddering through all her form and crouching down against the wall crawled by her like some lower animal sprang up and fled away  florence dropped upon the stairs in a swoon and was found there by mrs pipchin she supposed she knew nothing more until she found herself lying on her own bed with mrs pipchin and some servants standing round her  where is mama was her first question  gone out to dinner said mrs pipchin  and papa  mr dombey is in his own room miss dombey said mrs pipchin and the best thing you can do is to take off your things and go to bed this minute this was the sagacious womans remedy for all complaints particularly lowness of spirits and inability to sleep for which offences many young victims in the days of the brighton castle had been committed to bed at ten oclock in the morning  without promising obedience but on the plea of desiring to be very quiet florence disengaged herself as soon as she could from the ministration of mrs pipchin and her attendants left alone she thought of what had happened on the staircase at first in doubt of its reality then with tears then with an indescribable and terrible alarm like that she had felt the night before  she determined not to go to bed until edith returned and if she could not speak to her at least to be sure that she was safe at home what indistinct and shadowy dread moved florence to this resolution she did not know and did not dare to think she only knew that until edith came back there was no repose for her aching head or throbbing heart  the evening deepened into night midnight came no edith  florence could not read or rest a moment she paced her own room opened the door and paced the staircasegallery outside looked out of window on the night listened to the wind blowing and the rain falling sat down and watched the faces in the fire got up and watched the moon flying like a stormdriven ship through the sea of clouds  all the house was gone to bed except two servants who were waiting the return of their mistress downstairs  one oclock the carriages that rumbled in the distance turned away or stopped short or went past the silence gradually deepened and was more and more rarely broken save by a rush of wind or sweep of rain two oclock no edith  florence more agitated paced her room and paced the gallery outside and looked out at the night blurred and wavy with the raindrops on the glass and the tears in her own eyes and looked up at the hurry in the sky so different from the repose below and yet so tranquil and solitary three oclock there was a terror in every ash that dropped out of the fire no edith yet  more and more agitated florence paced her room and paced the gallery and looked out at the moon with a new fancy of her likeness to a pale fugitive hurrying away and hiding her guilty face four struck five no edith yet  but now there was some cautious stir in the house and florence found that mrs pipchin had been awakened by one of those who sat up had risen and had gone down to her fathers door stealing lower down the stairs and observing what passed she saw her father come out in his morning gown and start when he was told his wife had not come home he dispatched a messenger to the stables to inquire whether the coachman was there and while the man was gone dressed himself very hurriedly  the man came back in great haste bringing the coachman with him who said he had been at home and in bed since ten oclock he had driven his mistress to her old house in brook street where she had been met by mr carker  florence stood upon the very spot where she had seen him coming down again she shivered with the nameless terror of that sight and had hardly steadiness enough to hear and understand what followedwho had told him the man went on to say that his mistress would not want the carriage to go home in and had dismissed him  she saw her father turn white in the face and heard him ask in a quick trembling voice for mrs dombeys maid the whole house was roused for she was there in a moment very pale too and speaking incoherently  she said she had dressed her mistress earlyfull two hours before she went outand had been told as she often was that she would not be wanted at night she had just come from her mistresss rooms but  but what what was it florence heard her father demand like a madman  but the inner dressingroom was locked and the key gone  her father seized a candle that was flaming on the groundsomeone had put it down there and forgotten itand came running upstairs with such fury that florence in her fear had hardly time to fly before him she heard him striking in the door as she ran on with her hands widely spread and her hair streaming and her face like a distracted persons back to her own room  when the door yielded and he rushed in what did he see there no one knew but thrown down in a costly mass upon the ground was every ornament she had had since she had been his wife every dress she had worn and everything she had possessed this was the room in which he had seen in yonder mirror the proud face discard him this was the room in which he had wondered idly how these things would look when he should see them next  heaping them back into the drawers and locking them up in a rage of haste he saw some papers on the table the deed of settlement he had executed on their marriage and a letter he read that she was gone he read that he was dishonoured he read that she had fled upon her shameful weddingday with the man whom he had chosen for her humiliation and he tore out of the room and out of the house with a frantic idea of finding her yet at the place to which she had been taken and beating all trace of beauty out of the triumphant face with his bare hand  florence not knowing what she did put on a shawl and bonnet in a dream of running through the streets until she found edith and then clasping her in her arms to save and bring her back but when she hurried out upon the staircase and saw the frightened servants going up and down with lights and whispering together and falling away from her father as he passed down she awoke to a sense of her own powerlessness and hiding in one of the great rooms that had been made gorgeous for this felt as if her heart would burst with grief  compassion for her father was the first distinct emotion that made head against the flood of sorrow which overwhelmed her her constant nature turned to him in his distress as fervently and faithfully as if in his prosperity he had been the embodiment of that idea which had gradually become so faint and dim although she did not know otherwise than through the suggestions of a shapeless fear the full extent of his calamity he stood before her wronged and deserted and again her yearning love impelled her to his side  he was not long away for florence was yet weeping in the great room and nourishing these thoughts when she heard him come back he ordered the servants to set about their ordinary occupations and went into his own apartment where he trod so heavily that she could hear him walking up and down from end to end  yielding at once to the impulse of her affection timid at all other times but bold in its truth to him in his adversity and undaunted by past repulse florence dressed as she was hurried downstairs as she set her light foot in the hall he came out of his room she hastened towards him unchecked with her arms stretched out and crying oh dear dear papa as if she would have clasped him round the neck  and so she would have done but in his frenzy he lifted up his cruel arm and struck her crosswise with that heaviness that she tottered on the marble floor and as he dealt the blow he told her what edith was and bade her follow her since they had always been in league  she did not sink down at his feet she did not shut out the sight of him with her trembling hands she did not weep she did not utter one word of reproach but she looked at him and a cry of desolation issued from her heart for as she looked she saw him murdering that fond idea to which she had held in spite of him she saw his cruelty neglect and hatred dominant above it and stamping it down she saw she had no father upon earth and ran out orphaned from his house  ran out of his house a moment and her hand was on the lock the cry was on her lips his face was there made paler by the yellow candles hastily put down and guttering away and by the daylight coming in above the door another moment and the close darkness of the shutup house forgotten to be opened though it was long since day yielded to the unexpected glare and freedom of the morning and florence with her head bent down to hide her agony of tears was in the streets    chapter 48 the flight of florence   in the wildness of her sorrow shame and terror the forlorn girl hurried through the sunshine of a bright morning as if it were the darkness of a winter night wringing her hands and weeping bitterly insensible to everything but the deep wound in her breast stunned by the loss of all she loved left like the sole survivor on a lonely shore from the wreck of a great vessel she fled without a thought without a hope without a purpose but to fly somewhere anywhere  the cheerful vista of the long street burnished by the morning light the sight of the blue sky and airy clouds the vigorous freshness of the day so flushed and rosy in its conquest of the night awakened no responsive feelings in her so hurt bosom somewhere anywhere to hide her head somewhere anywhere for refuge never more to look upon the place from which she fled  but there were people going to and fro there were opening shops and servants at the doors of houses there was the rising clash and roar of the days struggle florence saw surprise and curiosity in the faces flitting past her saw long shadows coming back upon the pavement and heard voices that were strange to her asking her where she went and what the matter was and though these frightened her the more at first and made her hurry on the faster they did her the good service of recalling her in some degree to herself and reminding her of the necessity of greater composure  where to go still somewhere anywhere still going on but where she thought of the only other time she had been lost in the wild wilderness of londonthough not lost as nowand went that way to the home of walters uncle  checking her sobs and drying her swollen eyes and endeavouring to calm the agitation of her manner so as to avoid attracting notice florence resolving to keep to the more quiet streets as long as she could was going on more quietly herself when a familiar little shadow darted past upon the sunny pavement stopped short wheeled about came close to her made off again bounded round and round her and diogenes panting for breath and yet making the street ring with his glad bark was at her feet  oh di oh dear true faithful di how did you come here how could i ever leave you di who would never leave me  florence bent down on the pavement and laid his rough old loving foolish head against her breast and they got up together and went on together di more off the ground than on it endeavouring to kiss his mistress flying tumbling over and getting up again without the least concern dashing at big dogs in a jocose defiance of his species terrifying with touches of his nose young housemaids who were cleaning doorsteps and continually stopping in the midst of a thousand extravagances to look back at florence and bark until all the dogs within hearing answered and all the dogs who could come out came out to stare at him  with this last adherent florence hurried away in the advancing morning and the strengthening sunshine to the city the roar soon grew more loud the passengers more numerous the shops more busy until she was carried onward in a stream of life setting that way and flowing indifferently past marts and mansions prisons churches marketplaces wealth poverty good and evil like the broad river side by side with it awakened from its dreams of rushes willows and green moss and rolling on turbid and troubled among the works and cares of men to the deep sea  at length the quarters of the little midshipman arose in view nearer yet and the little midshipman himself was seen upon his post intent as ever on his observations nearer yet and the door stood open inviting her to enter florence who had again quickened her pace as she approached the end of her journey ran across the road closely followed by diogenes whom the bustle had somewhat confused ran in and sank upon the threshold of the wellremembered little parlour  the captain in his glazed hat was standing over the fire making his mornings cocoa with that elegant trifle his watch upon the chimneypiece for easy reference during the progress of the cookery hearing a footstep and the rustle of a dress the captain turned with a palpitating remembrance of the dreadful mrs macstinger at the instant when florence made a motion with her hand towards him reeled and fell upon the floor  the captain pale as florence pale in the very knobs upon his face raised her like a baby and laid her on the same old sofa upon which she had slumbered long ago  its hearts delight said the captain looking intently in her face its the sweet creetur growd a woman  captain cuttle was so respectful of her and had such a reverence for her in this new character that he would not have held her in his arms while she was unconscious for a thousand pounds  my hearts delight said the captain withdrawing to a little distance with the greatest alarm and sympathy depicted on his countenance if you can hail ned cuttle with a finger do it  but florence did not stir  my hearts delight said the trembling captain for the sake of walr drownded in the briny deep turn to and histe up something or another if able  finding her insensible to this impressive adjuration also captain cuttle snatched from his breakfasttable a basin of cold water and sprinkled some upon her face yielding to the urgency of the case the captain then using his immense hand with extraordinary gentleness relieved her of her bonnet moistened her lips and forehead put back her hair covered her feet with his own coat which he pulled off for the purpose patted her handso small in his that he was struck with wonder when he touched itand seeing that her eyelids quivered and that her lips began to move continued these restorative applications with a better heart  cheerily said the captain cheerily stand by my pretty one stand by there youre better now steadys the word and steady it is keep her so drink a little drop o this here said the captain there you are what cheer now my pretty what cheer now  at this stage of her recovery captain cuttle with an imperfect association of a watch with a physicians treatment of a patient took his own down from the mantelshelf and holding it out on his hook and taking florences hand in his looked steadily from one to the other as expecting the dial to do something  what cheer my pretty said the captain what cheer now youve done her some good my lad i believe said the captain under his breath and throwing an approving glance upon his watch put you back halfanhour every morning and about another quarter towards the arternoon and youre a watch as can be ekalled by few and excelled by none what cheer my lady lass  captain cuttle is it you exclaimed florence raising herself a little  yes yes my lady lass said the captain hastily deciding in his own mind upon the superior elegance of that form of address as the most courtly he could think of  is walters uncle here asked florence  here pretty returned the captain he aint been here this many a long day he aint been heerd on since he sheered off arter poor walr but said the captain as a quotation though lost to sight to memory dear and england home and beauty  do you live here asked florence  yes my lady lass returned the captain  oh captain cuttle cried florence putting her hands together and speaking wildly save me keep me here let no one know where i am ill tell you what has happened byandby when i can i have no one in the world to go to do not send me away  send you away my lady lass exclaimed the captain you my hearts delight stay a bit well put up this here deadlight and take a double turn on the key  with these words the captain using his one hand and his hook with the greatest dexterity got out the shutter of the door put it up made it all fast and locked the door itself  when he came back to the side of florence she took his hand and kissed it the helplessness of the action the appeal it made to him the confidence it expressed the unspeakable sorrow in her face the pain of mind she had too plainly suffered and was suffering then his knowledge of her past history her present lonely worn and unprotected appearance all so rushed upon the good captain together that he fairly overflowed with compassion and gentleness  my lady lass said the captain polishing the bridge of his nose with his arm until it shone like burnished copper dont you say a word to edard cuttle until such times as you finds yourself a riding smooth and easy which wont be today nor yet tomorrow and as to giving of you up or reporting where you are yes verily and by gods help so i wont church catechism make a note on  this the captain said reference and all in one breath and with much solemnity taking off his hat at yes verily and putting it on again when he had quite concluded  florence could do but one thing more to thank him and to show him how she trusted in him and she did it clinging to this rough creature as the last asylum of her bleeding heart she laid her head upon his honest shoulder and clasped him round his neck and would have kneeled down to bless him but that he divined her purpose and held her up like a true man  steady said the captain steady youre too weak to stand you see my pretty and must lie down here again there there to see the captain lift her on the sofa and cover her with his coat would have been worth a hundred state sights and now said the captain you must take some breakfast lady lass and the dog shall have some too and arter that you shall go aloft to old sol gillss room and fall asleep there like a angel  captain cuttle patted diogenes when he made allusion to him and diogenes met that overture graciously halfway during the administration of the restoratives he had clearly been in two minds whether to fly at the captain or to offer him his friendship and he had expressed that conflict of feeling by alternate waggings of his tail and displays of his teeth with now and then a growl or so but by this time his doubts were all removed it was plain that he considered the captain one of the most amiable of men and a man whom it was an honour to a dog to know  in evidence of these convictions diogenes attended on the captain while he made some tea and toast and showed a lively interest in his housekeeping but it was in vain for the kind captain to make such preparations for florence who sorely tried to do some honour to them but could touch nothing and could only weep and weep again  well well said the compassionate captain arter turning in my hearts delight youll get more way upon you now ill serve out your allowance my lad to diogenes and you shall keep guard on your mistress aloft  diogenes however although he had been eyeing his intended breakfast with a watering mouth and glistening eyes instead of falling to ravenously when it was put before him pricked up his ears darted to the shopdoor and barked there furiously burrowing with his head at the bottom as if he were bent on mining his way out  can there be anybody there asked florence in alarm  no my lady lass returned the captain whod stay there without making any noise keep up a good heart pretty its only people going by  but for all that diogenes barked and barked and burrowed and burrowed with pertinacious fury and whenever he stopped to listen appeared to receive some new conviction into his mind for he set to barking and burrowing again a dozen times even when he was persuaded to return to his breakfast he came jogging back to it with a very doubtful air and was off again in another paroxysm before touching a morsel  if there should be someone listening and watching whispered florence someone who saw me comewho followed me perhaps  it aint the young woman lady lass is it said the captain taken with a bright idea  susan said florence shaking her head ah no susan has been gone from me a long time  not deserted i hope said the captain dont say that that there young womans run my pretty  oh no no cried florence she is one of the truest hearts in the world  the captain was greatly relieved by this reply and expressed his satisfaction by taking off his hard glazed hat and dabbing his head all over with his handkerchief rolled up like a ball observing several times with infinite complacency and with a beaming countenance that he knowd it  so youre quiet now are you brother said the captain to diogenes there warnt nobody there my lady lass bless you  diogenes was not so sure of that the door still had an attraction for him at intervals and he went snuffing about it and growling to himself unable to forget the subject this incident coupled with the captains observation of florences fatigue and faintness decided him to prepare sol gillss chamber as a place of retirement for her immediately he therefore hastily betook himself to the top of the house and made the best arrangement of it that his imagination and his means suggested  it was very clean already and the captain being an orderly man and accustomed to make things shipshape converted the bed into a couch by covering it all over with a clean white drapery by a similar contrivance the captain converted the little dressingtable into a species of altar on which he set forth two silver teaspoons a flowerpot a telescope his celebrated watch a pocketcomb and a songbook as a small collection of rarities that made a choice appearance having darkened the window and straightened the pieces of carpet on the floor the captain surveyed these preparations with great delight and descended to the little parlour again to bring florence to her bower  nothing would induce the captain to believe that it was possible for florence to walk upstairs if he could have got the idea into his head he would have considered it an outrageous breach of hospitality to allow her to do so florence was too weak to dispute the point and the captain carried her up out of hand laid her down and covered her with a great watchcoat  my lady lass said the captain youre as safe here as if you was at the top of st pauls cathedral with the ladder cast off sleep is what you want afore all other things and may you be able to show yourself smart with that there balsam for the still small woice of a wounded mind when theres anything you want my hearts delight as this here humble house or town can offer pass the word to edard cuttle asll stand off and on outside that door and that there man will wibrate with joy the captain concluded by kissing the hand that florence stretched out to him with the chivalry of any old knighterrant and walking on tiptoe out of the room  descending to the little parlour captain cuttle after holding a hasty council with himself decided to open the shopdoor for a few minutes and satisfy himself that now at all events there was no one loitering about it accordingly he set it open and stood upon the threshold keeping a bright lookout and sweeping the whole street with his spectacles  how de do captain gills said a voice beside him the captain looking down found that he had been boarded by mr toots while sweeping the horizon  how are you my lad replied the captain  well i m pretty well thankee captain gills said mr toots you know im never quite what i could wish to be now i dont expect that i ever shall be any more  mr toots never approached any nearer than this to the great theme of his life when in conversation with captain cuttle on account of the agreement between them  captain gills said mr toots if i could have the pleasure of a word with you itsits rather particular  why you see my lad replied the captain leading the way into the parlour i aint what you may call exactly free this morning and therefore if you can clap on a bit i should take it kindly  certainly captain gills replied mr toots who seldom had any notion of the captains meaning to clap on is exactly what i could wish to do naturally  if so be my lad returned the captain do it  the captain was so impressed by the possession of his tremendous secretby the fact of miss dombey being at that moment under his roof while the innocent and unconscious toots sat opposite to himthat a perspiration broke out on his forehead and he found it impossible while slowly drying the same glazed hat in hand to keep his eyes off mr tootss face mr toots who himself appeared to have some secret reasons for being in a nervous state was so unspeakably disconcerted by the captains stare that after looking at him vacantly for some time in silence and shifting uneasily on his chair he said  i beg your pardon captain gills but you dont happen to see anything particular in me do you  no my lad returned the captain no  because you know said mr toots with a chuckle i know im wasting away you neednt at all mind alluding to that ii should like it burgess and co have altered my measure im in that state of thinness its a gratification to me iim glad of it iid a great deal rather go into a decline if i could im a mere brute you know grazing upon the surface of the earth captain gills  the more mr toots went on in this way the more the captain was weighed down by his secret and stared at him what with this cause of uneasiness and his desire to get rid of mr toots the captain was in such a scared and strange condition indeed that if he had been in conversation with a ghost he could hardly have evinced greater discomposure  but i was going to say captain gills said mr toots happening to be this way early this morningto tell you the truth i was coming to breakfast with you as to sleep you know i never sleep now i might be a watchman except that i dont get any pay and hes got nothing on his mind  carry on my lad said the captain in an admonitory voice  certainly captain gills said mr toots perfectly true happening to be this way early this morning an hour or so ago and finding the door shut  what were you waiting there brother demanded the captain  not at all captain gills returned mr toots i didnt stop a moment i thought you were out but the person saidby the bye you dont keep a dog you captain gills  the captain shook his head  to be sure said mr toots thats exactly what i said i knew you didnt there is a dog captain gills connected withbut excuse me thats forbidden ground  the captain stared at mr toots until he seemed to swell to twice his natural size and again the perspiration broke out on the captains forehead when he thought of diogenes taking it into his head to come down and make a third in the parlour  the person said continued mr toots that he had heard a dog barking in the shop which i knew couldnt be and i told him so but he was as positive as if he had seen the dog  what person my lad inquired the captain  why you see there it is captain gills said mr toots with a perceptible increase in the nervousness of his manner its not for me to say what may have taken place or what may not have taken place indeed i dont know i get mixed up with all sorts of things that i dont quite understand and i think theres something rather weak in myin my head in short  the captain nodded his own as a mark of assent  but the person said as we were walking away continued mr toots that you knew what under existing circumstances might occurhe said might very stronglyand that if you were requested to prepare yourself you would no doubt come prepared  person my lad the captain repeated  i dont know what person im sure captain gills replied mr toots i havent the least idea but coming to the door i found him waiting there and he said was i coming back again and i said yes and he said did i know you and i said yes i had the pleasure of your acquaintanceyou had given me the pleasure of your acquaintance after some persuasion and he said if that was the case would i say to you what i have said about existing circumstances and coming prepared and as soon as ever i saw you would i ask you to step round the corner if it was only for one minute on most important business to mr brogleys the brokers now i tell you what captain gillswhatever it is i am convinced its very important and if you like to step round now ill wait here till you come back  the captain divided between his fear of compromising florence in some way by not going and his horror of leaving mr toots in possession of the house with a chance of finding out the secret was a spectacle of mental disturbance that even mr toots could not be blind to but that young gentleman considering his nautical friend as merely in a state of preparation for the interview he was going to have was quite satisfied and did not review his own discreet conduct without chuckle  at length the captain decided as the lesser of two evils to run round to brogleys the brokers previously locking the door that communicated with the upper part of the house and putting the key in his pocket if so be said the captain to mr toots with not a little shame and hesitation as youll excuse my doing of it brother  captain gills returned mr toots whatever you do is satisfactory to me  the captain thanked him heartily and promising to come back in less than five minutes went out in quest of the person who had entrusted mr toots with this mysterious message poor mr toots left to himself lay down upon the sofa little thinking who had reclined there last and gazing up at the skylight and resigning himself to visions of miss dombey lost all heed of time and place  it was as well that he did so for although the captain was not gone long he was gone much longer than he had proposed when he came back he was very pale indeed and greatly agitated and even looked as if he had been shedding tears he seemed to have lost the faculty of speech until he had been to the cupboard and taken a dram of rum from the casebottle when he fetched a deep breath and sat down in a chair with his hand before his face  captain gills said toots kindly i hope and trust theres nothing wrong  thankee my lad not a bit said the captain quite contrairy  you have the appearance of being overcome captain gills observed mr toots  why my lad i am took aback the captain admitted i am  is there anything i can do captain gills inquired mr toots if there is make use of me  the captain removed his hand from his face looked at him with a remarkable expression of pity and tenderness and took him by the hand and shook it hard  no thankee said the captain nothing only ill take it as a favour if youll part company for the present i believe brother wringing his hand again that after walr and on a different model youre as good a lad as ever stepped  upon my word and honour captain gills returned mr toots giving the captains hand a preliminary slap before shaking it again its delightful to me to possess your good opinion thankee  and bear a hand and cheer up said the captain patting him on the back what theres more than one sweet creetur in the world  not to me captain gills replied mr toots gravely not to me i assure you the state of my feelings towards miss dombey is of that unspeakable description that my heart is a desert island and she lives in it alone im getting more used up every day and im proud to be so if you could see my legs when i take my boots off youd form some idea of what unrequited affection is i have been prescribed bark but i dont take it for i dont wish to have any tone whatever given to my constitution id rather not this however is forbidden ground captain gills goodbye  captain cuttle cordially reciprocating the warmth of mr tootss farewell locked the door behind him and shaking his head with the same remarkable expression of pity and tenderness as he had regarded him with before went up to see if florence wanted him  there was an entire change in the captains face as he went upstairs he wiped his eyes with his handkerchief and he polished the bridge of his nose with his sleeve as he had done already that morning but his face was absolutely changed now he might have been thought supremely happy now he might have been thought sad but the kind of gravity that sat upon his features was quite new to them and was as great an improvement to them as if they had undergone some sublimating process  he knocked softly with his hook at florences door twice or thrice but receiving no answer ventured first to peep in and then to enter emboldened to take the latter step perhaps by the familiar recognition of diogenes who stretched upon the ground by the side of her couch wagged his tail and winked his eyes at the captain without being at the trouble of getting up  she was sleeping heavily and moaning in her sleep and captain cuttle with a perfect awe of her youth and beauty and her sorrow raised her head and adjusted the coat that covered her where it had fallen off and darkened the window a little more that she might sleep on and crept out again and took his post of watch upon the stairs all this with a touch and tread as light as florences own  long may it remain in this mixed world a point not easy of decision which is the more beautiful evidence of the almightys goodnessthe delicate fingers that are formed for sensitiveness and sympathy of touch and made to minister to pain and grief or the rough hard captain cuttle hand that the heart teaches guides and softens in a moment  florence slept upon her couch forgetful of her homelessness and orphanage and captain cuttle watched upon the stairs a louder sob or moan than usual brought him sometimes to her door but by degrees she slept more peacefully and the captains watch was undisturbed    chapter 49 the midshipman makes a discovery   it was long before florence awoke the day was in its prime the day was in its wane and still uneasy in mind and body she slept on unconscious of her strange bed of the noise and turmoil in the street and of the light that shone outside the shaded window perfect unconsciousness of what had happened in the home that existed no more even the deep slumber of exhaustion could not produce some undefined and mournful recollection of it dozing uneasily but never sleeping pervaded all her rest a dull sorrow like a halflulled sense of pain was always present to her and her pale cheek was oftener wet with tears than the honest captain softly putting in his head from time to time at the halfclosed door could have desired to see it  the sun was getting low in the west and glancing out of a red mist pierced with its rays opposite loopholes and pieces of fretwork in the spires of city churches as if with golden arrows that struck through and through themand far away athwart the river and its flat banks it was gleaming like a path of fireand out at sea it was irradiating sails of shipsand looked towards from quiet churchyards upon hilltops in the country it was steeping distant prospects in a flush and glow that seemed to mingle earth and sky together in one glorious suffusionwhen florence opening her heavy eyes lay at first looking without interest or recognition at the unfamiliar walls around her and listening in the same regardless manner to the noises in the street but presently she started up upon her couch gazed round with a surprised and vacant look and recollected all  my pretty said the captain knocking at the door what cheer  dear friend cried florence hurrying to him is it you  the captain felt so much pride in the name and was so pleased by the gleam of pleasure in her face when she saw him that he kissed his hook by way of reply in speechless gratification  what cheer bright dimond said the captain  i have surely slept very long returned florence when did i come here yesterday  this here blessed day my lady lass replied the captain  has there been no night is it still day asked florence  getting on for evening now my pretty said the captain drawing back the curtain of the window see  florence with her hand upon the captains arm so sorrowful and timid and the captain with his rough face and burly figure so quietly protective of her stood in the rosy light of the bright evening sky without saying a word however strange the form of speech into which he might have fashioned the feeling if he had had to give it utterance the captain felt as sensibly as the most eloquent of men could have done that there was something in the tranquil time and in its softened beauty that would make the wounded heart of florence overflow and that it was better that such tears should have their way so not a word spake captain cuttle but when he felt his arm clasped closer and when he felt the lonely head come nearer to it and lay itself against his homely coarse blue sleeve he pressed it gently with his rugged hand and understood it and was understood  better now my pretty said the captain cheerily cheerily ill go down below and get some dinner ready will you come down of your own self arterwards pretty or shall edard cuttle come and fetch you  as florence assured him that she was quite able to walk downstairs the captain though evidently doubtful of his own hospitality in permitting it left her to do so and immediately set about roasting a fowl at the fire in the little parlour to achieve his cookery with the greater skill he pulled off his coat tucked up his wristbands and put on his glazed hat without which assistant he never applied himself to any nice or difficult undertaking  after cooling her aching head and burning face in the fresh water which the captains care had provided for her while she slept florence went to the little mirror to bind up her disordered hair then she knewin a moment for she shunned it instantly that on her breast there was the darkening mark of an angry hand  her tears burst forth afresh at the sight she was ashamed and afraid of it but it moved her to no anger against him homeless and fatherless she forgave him everything hardly thought that she had need to forgive him or that she did but she fled from the idea of him as she had fled from the reality and he was utterly gone and lost there was no such being in the world  what to do or where to live florencepoor inexperienced girlcould not yet consider she had indistinct dreams of finding a long way off some little sisters to instruct who would be gentle with her and to whom under some feigned name she might attach herself and who would grow up in their happy home and marry and be good to their old governess and perhaps entrust her in time with the education of their own daughters and she thought how strange and sorrowful it would be thus to become a greyhaired woman carrying her secret to the grave when florence dombey was forgotten but it was all dim and clouded to her now she only knew that she had no father upon earth and she said so many times with her suppliant head hidden from all but her father who was in heaven  her little stock of money amounted to but a few guineas with a part of this it would be necessary to buy some clothes for she had none but those she wore she was too desolate to think how soon her money would be gonetoo much a child in worldly matters to be greatly troubled on that score yet even if her other trouble had been less she tried to calm her thoughts and stay her tears to quiet the hurry in her throbbing head and bring herself to believe that what had happened were but the events of a few hours ago instead of weeks or months as they appeared and went down to her kind protector  the captain had spread the cloth with great care and was making some eggsauce in a little saucepan basting the fowl from time to time during the process with a strong interest as it turned and browned on a string before the fire having propped florence up with cushions on the sofa which was already wheeled into a warm corner for her greater comfort the captain pursued his cooking with extraordinary skill making hot gravy in a second little saucepan boiling a handful of potatoes in a third never forgetting the eggsauce in the first and making an impartial round of basting and stirring with the most useful of spoons every minute besides these cares the captain had to keep his eye on a diminutive fryingpan in which some sausages were hissing and bubbling in a most musical manner and there was never such a radiant cook as the captain looked in the height and heat of these functions it being impossible to say whether his face or his glazed hat shone the brighter  the dinner being at length quite ready captain cuttle dished and served it up with no less dexterity than he had cooked it he then dressed for dinner by taking off his glazed hat and putting on his coat that done he wheeled the table close against florence on the sofa said grace unscrewed his hook screwed his fork into its place and did the honours of the table  my lady lass said the captain cheer up and try to eat a deal stand by my deary liver wing it is sarse it is sassage it is and potato all which the captain ranged symmetrically on a plate and pouring hot gravy on the whole with the useful spoon set before his cherished guest  the whole row o dead lights is up forard lady lass observed the captain encouragingly and everythink is made snug try and pick a bit my pretty if walr was here  ah if i had him for my brother now cried florence  dont dont take on my pretty said the captain awast to obleege me he was your natral born friend like warnt he pet  florence had no words to answer with she only said oh dear dear paul oh walter  the wery planks she walked on murmured the captain looking at her drooping face was as high esteemed by walr as the water brooks is by the hart which never rejices i see him now the wery day as he was rated on them dombey books a speaking of her with his face a glistening with dooleastways with his modest sentimentslike a new blowed rose at dinner well well if our poor walr was here my lady lassor if he could befor hes drownded aint he  florence shook her head  yes yes drownded said the captain soothingly as i was saying if he could be here hed beg and pray of you my precious to pick a leetle bit with a lookout for your own sweet health whereby hold your own my lady lass as if it was for walrs sake and lay your pretty head to the wind  florence essayed to eat a morsel for the captains pleasure the captain meanwhile who seemed to have quite forgotten his own dinner laid down his knife and fork and drew his chair to the sofa  walr was a trim lad warnt he precious said the captain after sitting for some time silently rubbing his chin with his eyes fixed upon her and a brave lad and a good lad  florence tearfully assented  and hes drownded beauty aint he said the captain in a soothing voice  florence could not but assent again  he was older than you my lady lass pursued the captain but you was like two children together at first wamt you  florence answered yes  and walrs drownded said the captain aint he  the repetition of this inquiry was a curious source of consolation but it seemed to be one to captain cuttle for he came back to it again and again florence fain to push from her her untasted dinner and to lie back on her sofa gave him her hand feeling that she had disappointed him though truly wishing to have pleased him after all his trouble but he held it in his own which shook as he held it and appearing to have quite forgotten all about the dinner and her want of appetite went on growling at intervals in a ruminating tone of sympathy poor walr ay ay drownded aint he and always waited for her answer in which the great point of these singular reflections appeared to consist  the fowl and sausages were cold and the gravy and the eggsauce stagnant before the captain remembered that they were on the board and fell to with the assistance of diogenes whose united efforts quickly dispatched the banquet the captains delight and wonder at the quiet housewifery of florence in assisting to clear the table arrange the parlour and sweep up the hearthonly to be equalled by the fervency of his protest when she began to assist himwere gradually raised to that degree that at last he could not choose but do nothing himself and stand looking at her as if she were some fairy daintily performing these offices for him the red rim on his forehead glowing again in his unspeakable admiration  but when florence taking down his pipe from the mantelshelf gave it into his hand and entreated him to smoke it the good captain was so bewildered by her attention that he held it as if he had never held a pipe in all his life likewise when florence looking into the little cupboard took out the casebottle and mixed a perfect glass of grog for him unasked and set it at his elbow his ruddy nose turned pale he felt himself so graced and honoured when he had filled his pipe in an absolute reverie of satisfaction florence lighted it for himthe captain having no power to object or to prevent herand resuming her place on the old sofa looked at him with a smile so loving and so grateful a smile that showed him so plainly how her forlorn heart turned to him as her face did through grief that the smoke of the pipe got into the captains throat and made him cough and got into the captains eyes and made them blink and water  the manner in which the captain tried to make believe that the cause of these effects lay hidden in the pipe itself and the way in which he looked into the bowl for it and not finding it there pretended to blow it out of the stem was wonderfully pleasant the pipe soon getting into better condition he fell into that state of repose becoming a good smoker but sat with his eyes fixed on florence and with a beaming placidity not to be described and stopping every now and then to discharge a little cloud from his lips slowly puffed it forth as if it were a scroll coming out of his mouth bearing the legend poor walr ay ay drownded aint he after which he would resume his smoking with infinite gentleness  unlike as they were externallyand there could scarcely be a more decided contrast than between florence in her delicate youth and beauty and captain cuttle with his knobby face his great broad weatherbeaten person and his gruff voicein simple innocence of the worlds ways and the worlds perplexities and dangers they were nearly on a level no child could have surpassed captain cuttle in inexperience of everything but wind and weather in simplicity credulity and generous trustfulness faith hope and charity shared his whole nature among them an odd sort of romance perfectly unimaginative yet perfectly unreal and subject to no considerations of worldly prudence or practicability was the only partner they had in his character as the captain sat and smoked and looked at florence god knows what impossible pictures in which she was the principal figure presented themselves to his mind equally vague and uncertain though not so sanguine were her own thoughts of the life before her and even as her tears made prismatic colours in the light she gazed at so through her new and heavy grief she already saw a rainbow faintly shining in the faroff sky a wandering princess and a good monster in a storybook might have sat by the fireside and talked as captain cuttle and poor florence talkedand not have looked very much unlike them  the captain was not troubled with the faintest idea of any difficulty in retaining florence or of any responsibility thereby incurred having put up the shutters and locked the door he was quite satisfied on this head if she had been a ward in chancery it would have made no difference at all to captain cuttle he was the last man in the world to be troubled by any such considerations  so the captain smoked his pipe very comfortably and florence and he meditated after their own manner when the pipe was out they had some tea and then florence entreated him to take her to some neighbouring shop where she could buy the few necessaries she immediately wanted it being quite dark the captain consented peeping carefully out first as he had been wont to do in his time of hiding from mrs macstinger and arming himself with his large stick in case of an appeal to arms being rendered necessary by any unforeseen circumstance  the pride captain cuttle had in giving his arm to florence and escorting her some two or three hundred yards keeping a bright lookout all the time and attracting the attention of everyone who passed them by his great vigilance and numerous precautions was extreme arrived at the shop the captain felt it a point of delicacy to retire during the making of the purchases as they were to consist of wearing apparel but he previously deposited his tin canister on the counter and informing the young lady of the establishment that it contained fourteen pound two requested her in case that amount of property should not be sufficient to defray the expenses of his nieces little outfitat the word niece he bestowed a most significant look on florence accompanied with pantomime expressive of sagacity and mysteryto have the goodness to sing out and he would make up the difference from his pocket casually consulting his big watch as a deep means of dazzling the establishment and impressing it with a sense of property the captain then kissed his hook to his niece and retired outside the window where it was a choice sight to see his great face looking in from time to time among the silks and ribbons with an obvious misgiving that florence had been spirited away by a back door  dear captain cuttle said florence when she came out with a parcel the size of which greatly disappointed the captain who had expected to see a porter following with a bale of goods i dont want this money indeed i have not spent any of it i have money of my own  my lady lass returned the baffled captain looking straight down the street before them take care on it for me will you be so good till such time as i ask ye for it  may i put it back in its usual place said florence and keep it there  the captain was not at all gratified by this proposal but he answered ay ay put it anywheres my lady lass so long as you know where to find it again it aint o no use to me said the captain i wonder i havent chucked it away afore now  the captain was quite disheartened for the moment but he revived at the first touch of florences arm and they returned with the same precautions as they had come the captain opening the door of the little midshipmans berth and diving in with a suddenness which his great practice only could have taught him during florences slumber in the morning he had engaged the daughter of an elderly lady who usually sat under a blue umbrella in leadenhall market selling poultry to come and put her room in order and render her any little services she required and this damsel now appearing florence found everything about her as convenient and orderly if not as handsome as in the terrible dream she had once called home  when they were alone again the captain insisted on her eating a slice of dry toast and drinking a glass of spiced negus which he made to perfection and encouraging her with every kind word and inconsequential quotation he could possibly think of led her upstairs to her bedroom but he too had something on his mind and was not easy in his manner  goodnight dear heart said captain cuttle to her at her chamberdoor  florence raised her lips to his face and kissed him  at any other time the captain would have been overbalanced by such a token of her affection and gratitude but now although he was very sensible of it he looked in her face with even more uneasiness than he had testified before and seemed unwilling to leave her  poor walr said the captain  poor poor walter sighed florence  drownded aint he said the captain  florence shook her head and sighed  goodnight my lady lass said captain cuttle putting out his hand  god bless you dear kind friend  but the captain lingered still  is anything the matter dear captain cuttle said florence easily alarmed in her then state of mind have you anything to tell me  to tell you lady lass replied the captain meeting her eyes in confusion no no what should i have to tell you pretty you dont expect as ive got anything good to tell you sure  no said florence shaking her head  the captain looked at her wistfully and repeated no still lingering and still showing embarrassment  poor walr said the captain my walr as i used to call you old sol gillss nevy welcome to all as knowed you as the flowers in may where are you got to brave boy drownded aint he  concluding his apostrophe with this abrupt appeal to florence the captain bade her goodnight and descended the stairs while florence remained at the top holding the candle out to light him down he was lost in the obscurity and judging from the sound of his receding footsteps was in the act of turning into the little parlour when his head and shoulders unexpectedly emerged again as from the deep apparently for no other purpose than to repeat drownded aint he pretty for when he had said that in a tone of tender condolence he disappeared  florence was very sorry that she should unwittingly though naturally have awakened these associations in the mind of her protector by taking refuge there and sitting down before the little table where the captain had arranged the telescope and songbook and those other rarities thought of walter and of all that was connected with him in the past until she could have almost wished to lie down on her bed and fade away but in her lonely yearning to the dead whom she had loved no thought of homeno possibility of going backno presentation of it as yet existing or as sheltering her fatheronce entered her thoughts she had seen the murder done in the last lingering natural aspect in which she had cherished him through so much he had been torn out of her heart defaced and slain the thought of it was so appalling to her that she covered her eyes and shrunk trembling from the least remembrance of the deed or of the cruel hand that did it if her fond heart could have held his image after that it must have broken but it could not and the void was filled with a wild dread that fled from all confronting with its shattered fragmentswith such a dread as could have risen out of nothing but the depths of such a love so wronged  she dared not look into the glass for the sight of the darkening mark upon her bosom made her afraid of herself as if she bore about her something wicked she covered it up with a hasty faltering hand and in the dark and laid her weary head down weeping  the captain did not go to bed for a long time he walked to and fro in the shop and in the little parlour for a full hour and appearing to have composed himself by that exercise sat down with a grave and thoughtful face and read out of a prayerbook the forms of prayer appointed to be used at sea these were not easily disposed of the good captain being a mighty slow gruff reader and frequently stopping at a hard word to give himself such encouragement as now my lad with a will or steady edard cuttle steady which had a great effect in helping him out of any difficulty moreover his spectacles greatly interfered with his powers of vision but notwithstanding these drawbacks the captain being heartily in earnest read the service to the very last line and with genuine feeling too and approving of it very much when he had done turned in under the counter but not before he had been upstairs and listened at florences door with a serene breast and a most benevolent visage  the captain turned out several times in the course of the night to assure himself that his charge was resting quietly and once at daybreak found that she was awake for she called to know if it were he on hearing footsteps near her door  yes my lady lass replied the captain in a growling whisper are you all right dimond  florence thanked him and said yes  the captain could not lose so favourable an opportunity of applying his mouth to the keyhole and calling through it like a hoarse breeze poor walr drownded aint he after which he withdrew and turning in again slept till seven oclock  nor was he free from his uneasy and embarrassed manner all that day though florence being busy with her needle in the little parlour was more calm and tranquil than she had been on the day preceding almost always when she raised her eyes from her work she observed the captain looking at her and thoughtfully stroking his chin and he so often hitched his armchair close to her as if he were going to say something very confidential and hitched it away again as not being able to make up his mind how to begin that in the course of the day he cruised completely round the parlour in that frail bark and more than once went ashore against the wainscot or the closet door in a very distressed condition  it was not until the twilight that captain cuttle fairly dropping anchor at last by the side of florence began to talk at all connectedly but when the light of the fire was shining on the walls and ceiling of the little room and on the teaboard and the cups and saucers that were ranged upon the table and on her calm face turned towards the flame and reflecting it in the tears that filled her eyes the captain broke a long silence thus  you never was at sea my own  no replied florence  ay said the captain reverentially its a almighty element theres wonders in the deep my pretty think on it when the winds is roaring and the waves is rowling think on it when the stormy nights is so pitch dark said the captain solemnly holding up his hook as you cant see your hand afore you excepting when the wiwid lightning reweals the same and when you drive drive drive through the storm and dark as if you was a driving head on to the world without end evermore amen and when found making a note of thems the times my beauty when a man may say to his messmate previously a overhauling of the wollume a stiff norwesters blowing bill hark dont you hear it roar now lord help em how i pitys all unhappy folks ashore now which quotation as particularly applicable to the terrors of the ocean the captain delivered in a most impressive manner concluding with a sonorous stand by  were you ever in a dreadful storm asked florence  why ay my lady lass ive seen my share of bad weather said the captain tremulously wiping his head and ive had my share of knocking about butbut it aint of myself as i was a meaning to speak our dear boy drawing closer to her walr darling as was drownded  the captain spoke in such a trembling voice and looked at florence with a face so pale and agitated that she clung to his hand in affright  your face is changed cried florence you are altered in a moment what is it dear captain cuttle it turns me cold to see you  what lady lass returned the captain supporting her with his hand dont be took aback no no alls well alls well my dear as i was a sayingwalrheshes drownded aint he  florence looked at him intently her colour came and went and she laid her hand upon her breast  theres perils and dangers on the deep my beauty said the captain and over many a brave ship and many and many a bould heart the secret waters has closed up and never told no tales but theres escapes upon the deep too and sometimes one man out of a scoreah maybe out of a hundred prettyhas been saved by the mercy of god and come home after being given over for dead and told of all hands lost ii know a story hearts delight stammered the captain o this natur as was told to me once and being on this here tack and you and me sitting alone by the fire maybe youd like to hear me tell it would you deary  florence trembling with an agitation which she could not control or understand involuntarily followed his glance which went behind her into the shop where a lamp was burning the instant that she turned her head the captain sprung out of his chair and interposed his hand  theres nothing there my beauty said the captain dont look there  why not asked florence  the captain murmured something about its being dull that way and about the fire being cheerful he drew the door ajar which had been standing open until now and resumed his seat florence followed him with her eyes and looked intently in his face  the story was about a ship my lady lass began the captain as sailed out of the port of london with a fair wind and in fair weather bound fordont be took aback my lady lass she was only outard bound pretty only outard bound  the expression on florences face alarmed the captain who was himself very hot and flurried and showed scarcely less agitation than she did  shall i go on beauty said the captain  yes yes pray cried florence  the captain made a gulp as if to get down something that was sticking in his throat and nervously proceeded  that there unfortnate ship met with such foul weather out at sea as dont blow once in twenty year my darling there was hurricanes ashore as tore up forests and blowed down towns and there was gales at sea in them latitudes as not the stoutest wessel ever launched could live in day arter day that there unfortnate ship behaved noble im told and did her duty brave my pretty but at one blow amost her bulwarks was stove in her masts and rudder carved away her best man swept overboard and she left to the mercy of the storm as had no mercy but blowed harder and harder yet while the waves dashed over her and beat her in and every time they come a thundering at her broke her like a shell every black spot in every mountain of water that rolled away was a bit o the ships life or a living man and so she went to pieces beauty and no grass will never grow upon the graves of them as manned that ship  they were not all lost cried florence some were savedwas one  aboard o that there unfortnate wessel said the captain rising from his chair and clenching his hand with prodigious energy and exultation was a lad a gallant ladas ive heerd tellthat had loved when he was a boy to read and talk about brave actions in shipwrecksive heerd him ive heerd himand he remembered of em in his hour of need for when the stoutest and oldest hands was hove down he was firm and cheery it warnt the want of objects to like and love ashore that gave him courage it was his natral mind ive seen it in his face when he was no more than a childay many a timeand when i thought it nothing but his good looks bless him  and was he saved cried florence was he saved  that brave lad said the captainlook at me pretty dont look round  florence had hardly power to repeat why not  because theres nothing there my deary said the captain dont be took aback pretty creetur dont for the sake of walr as was dear to all on us that there lad said the captain arter working with the best and standing by the fainthearted and never making no complaint nor sign of fear and keeping up a spirit in all hands that made em honour him as if hed been a admiralthat lad along with the secondmate and one seaman was left of all the beatin hearts that went aboard that ship the only living creeturslashed to a fragment of the wreck and driftin on the stormy sea  were they saved cried florence  days and nights they drifted on them endless waters said the captain until at lastno dont look that way prettya sail bore down upon em and they was by the lords mercy took aboard two living and one dead  which of them was dead cried florence  not the lad i speak on said the captain  thank god oh thank god  amen returned the captain hurriedly dont be took aback a minute more my lady lass with a good heartaboard that ship they went a long voyage right away across the chart for there warnt no touching nowhere and on that voyage the seaman as was picked up with him died but he was spared and  the captain without knowing what he did had cut a slice of bread from the loaf and put it on his hook which was his usual toastingfork on which he now held it to the fire looking behind florence with great emotion in his face and suffering the bread to blaze and burn like fuel  was spared repeated florence and  and come home in that ship said the captain still looking in the same direction anddont be frightened prettyand landed and one morning come cautiously to his own door to take a obserwation knowing that his friends would think him drownded when he sheered off at the unexpected  at the unexpected barking of a dog cried florence quickly  yes roared the captain steady darling courage dont look round yet see there upon the wall  there was the shadow of a man upon the wall close to her she started up looked round and with a piercing cry saw walter gay behind her  she had no thought of him but as a brother a brother rescued from the grave a shipwrecked brother saved and at her side and rushed into his arms in all the world he seemed to be her hope her comfort refuge natural protector take care of walter i was fond of walter the dear remembrance of the plaintive voice that said so rushed upon her soul like music in the night oh welcome home dear walter welcome to this stricken breast she felt the words although she could not utter them and held him in her pure embrace  captain cuttle in a fit of delirium attempted to wipe his head with the blackened toast upon his hook and finding it an uncongenial substance for the purpose put it into the crown of his glazed hat put the glazed hat on with some difficulty essayed to sing a verse of lovely peg broke down at the first word and retired into the shop whence he presently came back express with a face all flushed and besmeared and the starch completely taken out of his shirtcollar to say these words  walr my lad here is a little bit of property as i should wish to make over jintly  the captain hastily produced the big watch the teaspoons the sugartongs and the canister and laying them on the table swept them with his great hand into walters hat but in handing that singular strong box to walter he was so overcome again that he was fain to make another retreat into the shop and absent himself for a longer space of time than on his first retirement  but walter sought him out and brought him back and then the captains great apprehension was that florence would suffer from this new shock he felt it so earnestly that he turned quite rational and positively interdicted any further allusion to walters adventures for some days to come captain cuttle then became sufficiently composed to relieve himself of the toast in his hat and to take his place at the teaboard but finding walters grasp upon his shoulder on one side and florence whispering her tearful congratulations on the other the captain suddenly bolted again and was missing for a good ten minutes  but never in all his life had the captains face so shone and glistened as when at last he sat stationary at the teaboard looking from florence to walter and from walter to florence nor was this effect produced or at all heightened by the immense quantity of polishing he had administered to his face with his coatsleeve during the last halfhour it was solely the effect of his internal emotions there was a glory and delight within the captain that spread itself over his whole visage and made a perfect illumination there  the pride with which the captain looked upon the bronzed cheek and the courageous eyes of his recovered boy with which he saw the generous fervour of his youth and all its frank and hopeful qualities shining once more in the fresh wholesome manner and the ardent face would have kindled something of this light in his countenance the admiration and sympathy with which he turned his eyes on florence whose beauty grace and innocence could have won no truer or more zealous champion than himself would have had an equal influence upon him but the fulness of the glow he shed around him could only have been engendered in his contemplation of the two together and in all the fancies springing out of that association that came sparkling and beaming into his head and danced about it  how they talked of poor old uncle sol and dwelt on every little circumstance relating to his disappearance how their joy was moderated by the old mans absence and by the misfortunes of florence how they released diogenes whom the captain had decoyed upstairs some time before lest he should bark again the captain though he was in one continual flutter and made many more short plunges into the shop fully comprehended but he no more dreamed that walter looked on florence as it were from a new and faroff place that while his eyes often sought the lovely face they seldom met its open glance of sisterly affection but withdrew themselves when hers were raised towards him than he believed that it was walters ghost who sat beside him he saw them together in their youth and beauty and he knew the story of their younger days and he had no inch of room beneath his great blue waistcoat for anything save admiration of such a pair and gratitude for their being reunited  they sat thus until it grew late the captain would have been content to sit so for a week but walter rose to take leave for the night  going walter said florence where  he slings his hammock for the present lady lass said captain cuttle round at brogleys within hail hearts delight  i am the cause of your going away walter said florence there is a houseless sister in your place  dear miss dombey replied walter hesitatingif it is not too bold to call you so  walter she exclaimed surprised  if anything could make me happier in being allowed to see and speak to you would it not be the discovery that i had any means on earth of doing you a moments service where would i not go what would i not do for your sake  she smiled and called him brother  you are so changed said walter  i changed she interrupted  to me said walter softly as if he were thinking aloud changed to me i left you such a child and find youoh something so different  but your sister walter you have not forgotten what we promised to each other when we parted  forgotten but he said no more  and if you hadif suffering and danger had driven it from your thoughtswhich it has notyou would remember it now walter when you find me poor and abandoned with no home but this and no friends but the two who hear me speak  i would heaven knows i would said walter  oh walter exclaimed florence through her sobs and tears dear brother show me some way through the worldsome humble path that i may take alone and labour in and sometimes think of you as one who will protect and care for me as for a sister oh help me walter for i need help so much  miss dombey florence i would die to help you but your friends are proud and rich your father  no no walter she shrieked and put her hands up to her head in an attitude of terror that transfixed him where he stood dont say that word  he never from that hour forgot the voice and look with which she stopped him at the name he felt that if he were to live a hundred years he never could forget it  somewhereanywherebut never home all past all gone all lost and broken up the whole history of her untold slight and suffering was in the cry and look and he felt he never could forget it and he never did  she laid her gentle face upon the captains shoulder and related how and why she had fled if every sorrowing tear she shed in doing so had been a curse upon the head of him she never named or blamed it would have been better for him walter thought with awe than to be renounced out of such a strength and might of love  there precious said the captain when she ceased and deep attention the captain had paid to her while she spoke listening with his glazed hat all awry and his mouth wide open awast awast my eyes walr dear lad sheer off for tonight and leave the pretty one to me  walter took her hand in both of his and put it to his lips and kissed it he knew now that she was indeed a homeless wandering fugitive but richer to him so than in all the wealth and pride of her right station she seemed farther off than even on the height that had made him giddy in his boyish dreams  captain cuttle perplexed by no such meditations guarded florence to her room and watched at intervals upon the charmed ground outside her doorfor such it truly was to himuntil he felt sufficiently easy in his mind about her to turn in under the counter on abandoning his watch for that purpose he could not help calling once rapturously through the keyhole drownded aint he prettyor when he got downstairs making another trial at that verse of lovely peg but it stuck in his throat somehow and he could make nothing of it so he went to bed and dreamed that old sol gills was married to mrs macstinger and kept prisoner by that lady in a secret chamber on a short allowance of victuals    chapter 50 mr tootss complaint   there was an empty room abovestairs at the wooden midshipmans which in days of yore had been walters bedroom walter rousing up the captain betimes in the morning proposed that they should carry thither such furniture out of the little parlour as would grace it best so that florence might take possession of it when she rose as nothing could be more agreeable to captain cuttle than making himself very red and short of breath in such a cause he turned to as he himself said with a will and in a couple of hours this garret was transformed into a species of landcabin adorned with all the choicest moveables out of the parlour inclusive even of the tartar frigate which the captain hung up over the chimneypiece with such extreme delight that he could do nothing for halfanhour afterwards but walk backward from it lost in admiration  the captain could be indueed by no persuasion of walters to wind up the big watch or to take back the canister or to touch the sugartongs and teaspoons no no my lad was the captains invariable reply to any solicitation of the kind ive made that there little property over jintly these words he repeated with great unction and gravity evidently believing that they had the virtue of an act of parliament and that unless he committed himself by some new admission of ownership no flaw could be found in such a form of conveyance  it was an advantage of the new arrangement that besides the greater seclusion it afforded florence it admitted of the midshipman being restored to his usual post of observation and also of the shop shutters being taken down the latter ceremony however little importance the unconscious captain attached to it was not wholly superfluous for on the previous day so much excitement had been occasioned in the neighbourhood by the shutters remaining unopened that the instrumentmakers house had been honoured with an unusual share of public observation and had been intently stared at from the opposite side of the way by groups of hungry gazers at any time between sunrise and sunset the idlers and vagabonds had been particularly interested in the captains fate constantly grovelling in the mud to apply their eyes to the cellargrating under the shopwindow and delighting their imaginations with the fancy that they could see a piece of his coat as he hung in a corner though this settlement of him was stoutly disputed by an opposite faction who were of opinion that he lay murdered with a hammer on the stairs it was not without exciting some discontent therefore that the subject of these rumours was seen early in the morning standing at his shopdoor as hale and hearty as if nothing had happened and the beadle of that quarter a man of an ambitious character who had expected to have the distinction of being present at the breaking open of the door and of giving evidence in full uniform before the coroner went so far as to say to an opposite neighbour that the chap in the glazed hat had better not try it on therewithout more particularly mentioning whatand further that he the beadle would keep his eye upon him  captain cuttle said walter musing when they stood resting from their labours at the shopdoor looking down the old familiar street it being still early in the morning nothing at all of uncle sol in all that time  nothing at all my lad replied the captain shaking his head  gone in search of me dear kind old man said walter yet never write to you but why not he says in effect in this packet that you gave me taking the paper from his pocket which had been opened in the presence of the enlightened bunsby that if you never hear from him before opening it you may believe him dead heaven forbid but you would have heard of him even if he were dead someone would have written surely by his desire if he could not and have said on such a day there died in my house or under my care or so forth mr solomon gills of london who left this last remembrance and this last request to you  the captain who had never climbed to such a clear height of probability before was greatly impressed by the wide prospect it opened and answered with a thoughtful shake of his head well said my lad wery well said  i have been thinking of this or at least said walter colouring i have been thinking of one thing and another all through a sleepless night and i cannot believe captain cuttle but that my uncle sol lord bless him is alive and will return i dont so much wonder at his going away because leaving out of consideration that spice of the marvellous which was always in his character and his great affection for me before which every other consideration of his life became nothing as no one ought to know so well as i who had the best of fathers in himwalters voice was indistinct and husky here and he looked away along the streetleaving that out of consideration i say i have often read and heard of people who having some near and dear relative who was supposed to be shipwrecked at sea have gone down to live on that part of the seashore where any tidings of the missing ship might be expected to arrive though only an hour or two sooner than elsewhere or have even gone upon her track to the place whither she was bound as if their going would create intelligence i think i should do such a thing myself as soon as another or sooner than many perhaps but why my uncle shouldnt write to you when he so clearly intended to do so or how he should die abroad and you not know it through some other hand i cannot make out  captain cuttle observed with a shake of his head that jack bunsby himself hadnt made it out and that he was a man as could give a pretty taut opinion too  if my uncle had been a heedless young man likely to be entrapped by jovial company to some drinkingplace where he was to be got rid of for the sake of what money he might have about him said walter or if he had been a reckless sailor going ashore with two or three months pay in his pocket i could understand his disappearing and leaving no trace behind but being what he wasand is i hopei cant believe it  walr my lad inquired the captain wistfully eyeing him as he pondered and pondered what do you make of it then  captain cuttle returned walter i dont know what to make of it i suppose he never has written there is no doubt about that  if so be as sol gills wrote my lad replied the captain argumentatively wheres his dispatch  say that he entrusted it to some private hand suggested walter and that it has been forgotten or carelessly thrown aside or lost even that is more probable to me than the other event in short i not only cannot bear to contemplate that other event captain cuttle but i cant and wont  hope you see walr said the captain sagely hope its that as animates you hope is a buoy for which you overhaul your little warbler sentimental diwision but lord my lad like any other buoy it only floats it cant be steered nowhere along with the figurehead of hope said the captain theres a anchor but whats the good of my having a anchor if i cant find no bottom to let it go in  captain cuttle said this rather in his character of a sagacious citizen and householder bound to impart a morsel from his stores of wisdom to an inexperienced youth than in his own proper person indeed his face was quite luminous as he spoke with new hope caught from walter and he appropriately concluded by slapping him on the back and saying with enthusiasm hooroar my lad indiwidually im o your opinion walter with his cheerful laugh returned the salutation and said  only one word more about my uncle at present captain cuttle i suppose it is impossible that he can have written in the ordinary courseby mail packet or ship letter you understand  ay ay my lad said the captain approvingly  and that you have missed the letter anyhow  why walr said the captain turning his eyes upon him with a faint approach to a severe expression aint i been on the lookout for any tidings of that man o science old sol gills your uncle day and night ever since i lost him aint my heart been heavy and watchful always along of him and you sleeping and waking aint i been upon my post and wouldnt i scorn to quit it while this here midshipman held together  yes captain cuttle replied walter grasping his hand i know you would and i know how faithful and earnest all you say and feel is i am sure of it you dont doubt that i am as sure of it as i am that my foot is again upon this doorstep or that i again have hold of this true hand do you  no no walr returned the captain with his beaming  ill hazard no more conjectures said walter fervently shaking the hard hand of the captain who shook his with no less goodwill all i will add is heaven forbid that i should touch my uncles possessions captain cuttle everything that he left here shall remain in the care of the truest of stewards and kindest of menand if his name is not cuttle he has no name now best of friends aboutmiss dombey  there was a change in walters manner as he came to these two words and when he uttered them all his confidence and cheerfulness appeared to have deserted him  i thought before miss dombey stopped me when i spoke of her father last night said walter you remember how  the captain well remembered and shook his head  i thought said walter before that that we had but one hard duty to perform and that it was to prevail upon her to communicate with her friends and to return home  the captain muttered a feeble awast or a stand by or something or other equally pertinent to the occasion but it was rendered so extremely feeble by the total discomfiture with which he received this announcement that what it was is mere matter of conjecture  but said walter that is over i think so no longer i would sooner be put back again upon that piece of wreck on which i have so often floated since my preservation in my dreams and there left to drift and drive and die  hooroar my lad exclaimed the captain in a burst of uncontrollable satisfaction hooroar hooroar hooroar  to think that she so young so good and beautiful said walter so delicately brought up and born to such a different fortune should strive with the rough world but we have seen the gulf that cuts off all behind her though no one but herself can know how deep it is and there is no return  captain cuttle without quite understanding this greatly approved of it and observed in a tone of strong corroboration that the wind was quite abaft  she ought not to be alone here ought she captain cuttle said walter anxiously  well my lad replied the captain after a little sagacious consideration i dont know you being here to keep her company you see and you two being jintly  dear captain cuttle remonstrated walter i being here miss dombey in her guileless innocent heart regards me as her adopted brother but what would the guile and guilt of my heart be if i pretended to believe that i had any right to approach her familiarly in that characterif i pretended to forget that i am bound in honour not to do it  walr my lad hinted the captain with some revival of his discomfiture aint there no other character as  oh returned walter would you have me die in her esteemin such esteem as hersand put a veil between myself and her angels face for ever by taking advantage of her being here for refuge so trusting and so unprotected to endeavour to exalt myself into her lover what do i say there is no one in the world who would be more opposed to me if i could do so than you  walr my lad said the captain drooping more and more prowiding as there is any just cause or impediment why two persons should not be jined together in the house of bondage for which youll overhaul the place and make a note i hope i should declare it as promised and wowed in the banns so there aint no other character aint there my lad  walter briskly waved his hand in the negative  well my lad growled the captain slowly i wont deny but what i find myself wery much down by the head along o this here or but what ive gone clean about but as to lady lass walr mind you wots respect and duty to her is respect and duty in my articles howsumever disapinting and therefore i follows in your wake my lad and feel as you are no doubt acting up to yourself and there aint no other character aint there said the captain musing over the ruins of his fallen castle with a very despondent face  now captain cuttle said walter starting a fresh point with a gayer air to cheer the captain upbut nothing could do that he was too much concernedi think we should exert ourselves to find someone who would be a proper attendant for miss dombey while she remains here and who may be trusted none of her relations may its clear miss dombey feels that they are all subservient to her father what has become of susan  the young woman returned the captain its my belief as she was sent away again the will of hearts delight i made a signal for her when lady lass first come and she rated of her wery high and said she had been gone a long time  then said walter do you ask miss dombey where shes gone and well try to find her the mornings getting on and miss dombey will soon be rising you are her best friend wait for her upstairs and leave me to take care of all down here  the captain very crestfallen indeed echoed the sigh with which walter said this and complied florence was delighted with her new room anxious to see walter and overjoyed at the prospect of greeting her old friend susan but florence could not say where susan was gone except that it was in essex and no one could say she remembered unless it were mr toots  with this information the melancholy captain returned to walter and gave him to understand that mr toots was the young gentleman whom he had encountered on the doorstep and that he was a friend of his and that he was a young gentleman of property and that he hopelessly adored miss dombey the captain also related how the intelligence of walters supposed fate had first made him acquainted with mr toots and how there was solemn treaty and compact between them that mr toots should be mute upon the subject of his love  the question then was whether florence could trust mr toots and florence saying with a smile oh yes with her whole heart it became important to find out where mr toots lived this florence didnt know and the captain had forgotten and the captain was telling walter in the little parlour that mr toots was sure to be there soon when in came mr toots himself  captain gills said mr toots rushing into the parlour without any ceremony im in a state of mind bordering on distraction  mr toots had discharged those words as from a mortar before he observed walter whom he recognised with what may be described as a chuckle of misery  youll excuse me sir said mr toots holding his forehead but im at present in that state that my brain is going if not gone and anything approaching to politeness in an individual so situated would be a hollow mockery captain gills i beg to request the favour of a private interview  why brother returned the captain taking him by the hand you are the man as we was on the lookout for  oh captain gills said mr toots what a lookout that must be of which i am the object i havent dared to shave im in that rash state i havent had my clothes brushed my hair is matted together i told the chicken that if he offered to clean my boots id stretch him a corpse before me  all these indications of a disordered mind were verified in mr tootss appearance which was wild and savage  see here brother said the captain this heres old sol gillss nevy walr him as was supposed to have perished at sea  mr toots took his hand from his forehead and stared at walter  good gracious me stammered mr toots what a complication of misery howdedo iiim afraid you must have got very wet captain gills will you allow me a word in the shop  he took the captain by the coat and going out with him whispered  that then captain gills is the party you spoke of when you said that he and miss dombey were made for one another  why ay my lad replied the disconsolate captain i was of that mind once  and at this time exclaimed mr toots with his hand to his forehead again of all othersa hated rival at least he aint a hated rival said mr toots stopping short on second thoughts and taking away his hand what should i hate him for no if my affection has been truly disinterested captain gills let me prove it now  mr toots shot back abruptly into the parlour and said wringing walter by the hand  howdedo i hope you didnt take any cold ii shall be very glad if youll give me the pleasure of your acquaintance i wish you many happy returns of the day upon my word and honour said mr toots warming as he became better acquainted with walters face and figure im very glad to see you  thank you heartily said walter i couldnt desire a more genuine and genial welcome  couldnt you though said mr toots still shaking his hand its very kind of you im much obliged to you howdedo i hope you left everybody quite well over thethat is upon thei mean wherever you came from last you know  all these good wishes and better intentions walter responded to manfully  captain gills said mr toots i should wish to be strictly honourable but i trust i may be allowed now to allude to a certain subject that  ay ay my lad returned the captain freely freely  then captain gills said mr toots and lieutenant waltersare you aware that the most dreadful circumstances have been happening at mr dombeys house and that miss dombey herself has left her father who in my opinion said mr toots with great excitement is a brute that it would be a flattery to call aa marble monument or a bird of preyand that she is not to be found and has gone no one knows where  may i ask how you heard this inquired walter  lieutenant walters said mr toots who had arrived at that appellation by a process peculiar to himself probably by jumbling up his christian name with the seafaring profession and supposing some relationship between him and the captain which would extend as a matter of course to their titles lieutenant walters i can have no objection to make a straightforward reply the fact is that feeling extremely interested in everything that relates to miss dombeynot for any selfish reason lieutenant walters for i am well aware that the most able thing i could do for all parties would be to put an end to my existence which can only be regarded as an inconveniencei have been in the habit of bestowing a trifle now and then upon a footman a most respectable young man of the name of towlinson who has lived in the family some time and towlinson informed me yesterday evening that this was the state of things since which captain gillsand lieutenant waltersi have been perfectly frantic and have been lying down on the sofa all night the ruin you behold  mr toots said walter i am happy to be able to relieve your mind pray calm yourself miss dombey is safe and well  sir cried mr toots starting from his chair and shaking hands with him anew the relief is so excessive and unspeakable that if you were to tell me now that miss dombey was married even i could smile yes captain gills said mr toots appealing to him upon my soul and body i really think whatever i might do to myself immediately afterwards that i could smile i am so relieved  it will be a greater relief and delight still to such a generous mind as yours said walter not at all slow in returning his greeting to find that you can render service to miss dombey captain cuttle will you have the kindness to take mr toots upstairs  the captain beckoned to mr toots who followed him with a bewildered countenance and ascending to the top of the house was introduced without a word of preparation from his conductor into florences new retreat  poor mr tootss amazement and pleasure at sight of her were such that they could find a vent in nothing but extravagance he ran up to her seized her hand kissed it dropped it seized it again fell upon one knee shed tears chuckled and was quite regardless of his danger of being pinned by diogenes who inspired by the belief that there was something hostile to his mistress in these demonstrations worked round and round him as if only undecided at what particular point to go in for the assault but quite resolved to do him a fearful mischief  oh di you bad forgetful dog dear mr toots i am so rejoiced to see you  thankee said mr toots i am pretty well im much obliged to you miss dombey i hope all the family are the same  mr toots said this without the least notion of what he was talking about and sat down on a chair staring at florence with the liveliest contention of delight and despair going on in his face that any face could exhibit  captain gills and lieutenant walters have mentioned miss dombey gasped mr toots that i can do you some service if i could by any means wash out the remembrance of that day at brighton when i conducted myselfmuch more like a parricide than a person of independent property said mr toots with severe selfaccusation i should sink into the silent tomb with a gleam of joy  pray mr toots said florence do not wish me to forget anything in our acquaintance i never can believe me you have been far too kind and good to me always  miss dombey returned mr toots your consideration for my feelings is a part of your angelic character thank you a thousand times its of no consequence at all  what we thought of asking you said florence is whether you remember where susan whom you were so kind as to accompany to the coachoffice when she left me is to be found  why i do not certainly miss dombey said mr toots after a little consideration remember the exact name of the place that was on the coach and i do recollect that she said she was not going to stop there but was going farther on but miss dombey if your object is to find her and to have her here myself and the chicken will produce her with every dispatch that devotion on my part and great intelligence on the chickens can ensure  mr toots was so manifestly delighted and revived by the prospect of being useful and the disinterested sincerity of his devotion was so unquestionable that it would have been cruel to refuse him florence with an instinctive delicacy forbore to urge the least obstacle though she did not forbear to overpower him with thanks and mr toots proudly took the commission upon himself for immediate execution  miss dombey said mr toots touching her proffered hand with a pang of hopeless love visibly shooting through him and flashing out in his face goodbye allow me to take the liberty of saying that your misfortunes make me perfectly wretched and that you may trust me next to captain gills himself i am quite aware miss dombey of my own deficienciestheyre not of the least consequence thank youbut i am entirely to be relied upon i do assure you miss dombey  with that mr toots came out of the room again accompanied by the captain who standing at a little distance holding his hat under his arm and arranging his scattered locks with his hook had been a not uninterested witness of what passed and when the door closed behind them the light of mr tootss life was darkly clouded again  captain gills said that gentleman stopping near the bottom of the stairs and turning round to tell you the truth i am not in a frame of mind at the present moment in which i could see lieutenant walters with that entirely friendly feeling towards him that i should wish to harbour in my breast we cannot always command our feelings captain gills and i should take it as a particular favour if youd let me out at the private door  brother returned the captain you shall shape your own course wotever course you take is plain and seamanlike im wery sure  captain gills said mr toots youre extremely kind your good opinion is a consolation to me there is one thing said mr toots standing in the passage behind the halfopened door that i hope youll bear in mind captain gills and that i should wish lieutenant walters to be made acquainted with i have quite come into my property now you know andand i dont know what to do with it if i could be at all useful in a pecuniary point of view i should glide into the silent tomb with ease and smoothness  mr toots said no more but slipped out quietly and shut the door upon himself to cut the captain off from any reply  florence thought of this good creature long after he had left her with mingled emotions of pain and pleasure he was so honest and warmhearted that to see him again and be assured of his truth to her in her distress was a joy and comfort beyond all price but for that very reason it was so affecting to think that she caused him a moments unhappiness or ruffled by a breath the harmless current of his life that her eyes filled with tears and her bosom overflowed with pity captain cuttle in his different way thought much of mr toots too and so did walter and when the evening came and they were all sitting together in florences new room walter praised him in a most impassioned manner and told florence what he had said on leaving the house with every graceful settingoff in the way of comment and appreciation that his own honesty and sympathy could surround it with  mr toots did not return upon the next day or the next or for several days and in the meanwhile florence without any new alarm lived like a quiet bird in a cage at the top of the old instrumentmakers house but florence drooped and hung her head more and more plainly as the days went on and the expression that had been seen in the face of the dead child was often turned to the sky from her high window as if it sought his angel out on the bright shore of which he had spoken lying on his little bed  florence had been weak and delicate of late and the agitation she had undergone was not without its influences on her health but it was no bodily illness that affected her now she was distressed in mind and the cause of her distress was walter  interested in her anxious for her proud and glad to serve her and showing all this with the enthusiasm and ardour of his character florence saw that he avoided her all the long day through he seldom approached her room if she asked for him he came again for the moment as earnest and as bright as she remembered him when she was a lost child in the staring streets but he soon became constrainedher quick affection was too watchful not to know itand uneasy and soon left her unsought he never came all day between the morning and the night when the evening closed in he was always there and that was her happiest time for then she half believed that the old walter of her childhood was not changed but even then some trivial word look or circumstance would show her that there was an indefinable division between them which could not be passed  and she could not but see that these revealings of a great alteration in walter manifested themselves in despite of his utmost efforts to hide them in his consideration for her she thought and in the earnestness of his desire to spare her any wound from his kind hand he resorted to innumerable little artifices and disguises so much the more did florence feel the greatness of the alteration in him so much the oftener did she weep at this estrangement of her brother  the good captainher untiring tender ever zealous friendsaw it too florence thought and it pained him he was less cheerful and hopeful than he had been at first and would steal looks at her and walter by turns when they were all three together of an evening with quite a sad face  florence resolved at last to speak to walter she believed she knew now what the cause of his estrangement was and she thought it would be a relief to her full heart and would set him more at ease if she told him she had found it out and quite submitted to it and did not reproach him  it was on a certain sunday afternoon that florence took this resolution the faithful captain in an amazing shirtcollar was sitting by her reading with his spectacles on and she asked him where walter was  i think hes down below my lady lass returned the captain  i should like to speak to him said florence rising hurriedly as if to go downstairs  ill rouse him up here beauty said the captain in a trice  thereupon the captain with much alacrity shouldered his bookfor he made it a point of duty to read none but very large books on a sunday as having a more staid appearance and had bargained years ago for a prodigious volume at a bookstall five lines of which utterly confounded him at any time insomuch that he had not yet ascertained of what subject it treatedand withdrew walter soon appeared  captain cuttle tells me miss dombey he eagerly began on coming inbut stopped when he saw her face  you are not so well today you look distressed you have been weeping  he spoke so kindly and with such a fervent tremor in his voice that the tears gushed into her eyes at the sound of his words  walter said florence gently i am not quite well and i have been weeping i want to speak to you  he sat down opposite to her looking at her beautiful and innocent face and his own turned pale and his lips trembled  you said upon the night when i knew that you were savedand oh dear walter what i felt that night and what i hoped  he put his trembling hand upon the table between them and sat looking at herthat i was changed i was surprised to hear you say so but i understand now that i am dont be angry with me walter i was too much overjoyed to think of it then  she seemed a child to him again it was the ingenuous confiding loving child he saw and heard not the dear woman at whose feet he would have laid the riches of the earth  you remember the last time i saw you walter before you went away  he put his hand into his breast and took out a little purse  i have always worn it round my neck if i had gone down in the deep it would have been with me at the bottom of the sea  and you will wear it still walter for my old sake  until i die  she laid her hand on his as fearlessly and simply as if not a day had intervened since she gave him the little token of remembrance  i am glad of that i shall be always glad to think so walter do you recollect that a thought of this change seemed to come into our minds at the same time that evening when we were talking together  no he answered in a wondering tone  yes walter i had been the means of injuring your hopes and prospects even then i feared to think so then but i know it now if you were able then in your generosity to hide from me that you knew it too you cannot do so now although you try as generously as before you do i thank you for it walter deeply truly but you cannot succeed you have suffered too much in your own hardships and in those of your dearest relation quite to overlook the innocent cause of all the peril and affliction that has befallen you you cannot quite forget me in that character and we can be brother and sister no longer but dear walter do not think that i complain of you in this i might have known itought to have known itbut forgot it in my joy all i hope is that you may think of me less irksomely when this feeling is no more a secret one and all i ask is walter in the name of the poor child who was your sister once that you will not struggle with yourself and pain yourself for my sake now that i know all  walter had looked upon her while she said this with a face so full of wonder and amazement that it had room for nothing else now he caught up the hand that touched his so entreatingly and held it between his own  oh miss dombey he said is it possible that while i have been suffering so much in striving with my sense of what is due to you and must be rendered to you i have made you suffer what your words disclose to me never never before heaven have i thought of you but as the single bright pure blessed recollection of my boyhood and my youth never have i from the first and never shall i to the last regard your part in my life but as something sacred never to be lightly thought of never to be esteemed enough never until death to be forgotten again to see you look and hear you speak as you did on that night when we parted is happiness to me that there are no words to utter and to be loved and trusted as your brother is the next gift i could receive and prize  walter said florence looking at him earnestly but with a changing face what is that which is due to me and must be rendered to me at the sacrifice of all this  respect said walter in a low tone reverence  the colour dawned in her face and she timidly and thoughtfully withdrew her hand still looking at him with unabated earnestness  i have not a brothers right said walter i have not a brothers claim i left a child i find a woman  the colour overspread her face she made a gesture as if of entreaty that he would say no more and her face dropped upon her hands  they were both silent for a time she weeping  i owe it to a heart so trusting pure and good said walter even to tear myself from it though i rend my own how dare i say it is my sisters  she was weeping still  if you had been happy surrounded as you should be by loving and admiring friends and by all that makes the station you were born to enviable said walter and if you had called me brother then in your affectionate remembrance of the past i could have answered to the name from my distant place with no inward assurance that i wronged your spotless truth by doing so but hereand now  oh thank you thank you walter forgive my having wronged you so much i had no one to advise me i am quite alone  florence said walter passionately i am hurried on to say what i thought but a few moments ago nothing could have forced from my lips if i had been prosperous if i had any means or hope of being one day able to restore you to a station near your own i would have told you that there was one name you might bestow uponmea right above all others to protect and cherish youthat i was worthy of in nothing but the love and honour that i bore you and in my whole heart being yours i would have told you that it was the only claim that you could give me to defend and guard you which i dare accept and dare assert but that if i had that right i would regard it as a trust so precious and so priceless that the undivided truth and fervour of my life would poorly acknowledge its worth  the head was still bent down the tears still falling and the bosom swelling with its sobs  dear florence dearest florence whom i called so in my thoughts before i could consider how presumptuous and wild it was one last time let me call you by your own dear name and touch this gentle hand in token of your sisterly forgetfulness of what i have said  she raised her head and spoke to him with such a solemn sweetness in her eyes with such a calm bright placid smile shining on him through her tears with such a low soft tremble in her frame and voice that the innermost chords of his heart were touched and his sight was dim as he listened  no walter i cannot forget it i would not forget it for the world are youare you very poor  i am but a wanderer said walter making voyages to live across the sea that is my calling now  are you soon going away again walter  very soon  she sat looking at him for a moment then timidly put her trembling hand in his  if you will take me for your wife walter i will love you dearly if you will let me go with you walter i will go to the worlds end without fear i can give up nothing for youi have nothing to resign and no one to forsake but all my love and life shall be devoted to you and with my last breath i will breathe your name to god if i have sense and memory left  he caught her to his heart and laid her cheek against his own and now no more repulsed no more forlorn she wept indeed upon the breast of her dear lover  blessed sunday bells ringing so tranquilly in their entranced and happy ears blessed sunday peace and quiet harmonising with the calmness in their souls and making holy air around them blessed twilight stealing on and shading her so soothingly and gravely as she falls asleep like a hushed child upon the bosom she has clung to  oh load of love and trustfulness that lies to lightly there ay look down on the closed eyes walter with a proudly tender gaze for in all the wide wide world they seek but thee nowonly thee   the captain remained in the little parlour until it was quite dark he took the chair on which walter had been sitting and looked up at the skylight until the day by little and little faded away and the stars peeped down he lighted a candle lighted a pipe smoked it out and wondered what on earth was going on upstairs and why they didnt call him to tea  florence came to his side while he was in the height of his wonderment  ay lady lass cried the captain why you and walr have had a long spell o talk my beauty  florence put her little hand round one of the great buttons of his coat and said looking down into his face  dear captain i want to tell you something if you please  the captain raised his head pretty smartly to hear what it was catching by this means a more distinct view of florence he pushed back his chair and himself with it as far as they could go  what hearts delight cried the captain suddenly elated is it that  yes said florence eagerly  walr husband that roared the captain tossing up his glazed hat into the skylight  yes cried florence laughing and crying together  the captain immediately hugged her and then picking up the glazed hat and putting it on drew her arm through his and conducted her upstairs again where he felt that the great joke of his life was now to be made  what walr my lad said the captain looking in at the door with his face like an amiable warmingpan so there aint no other character aint there  he had like to have suffocated himself with this pleasantry which he repeated at least forty times during tea polishing his radiant face with the sleeve of his coat and dabbing his head all over with his pockethandkerchief in the intervals but he was not without a graver source of enjoyment to fall back upon when so disposed for he was repeatedly heard to say in an undertone as he looked with ineffable delight at walter and florence  edard cuttle my lad you never shaped a better course in your life than when you made that there little property over jintly    chapter 51 mr dombey and the world   what is the proud man doing while the days go by does he ever think of his daughter or wonder where she is gone does he suppose she has come home and is leading her old life in the weary house no one can answer for him he has never uttered her name since his household dread him too much to approach a subject on which he is resolutely dumb and the only person who dares question him he silences immediately  my dear paul murmurs his sister sidling into the room on the day of florences departure your wife that upstart woman is it possible that what i hear confusedly is true and that this is her return for your unparalleled devotion to her extending i am sure even to the sacrifice of your own relations to her caprices and haughtiness my poor brother  with this speech feelingly reminiscent of her not having been asked to dinner on the day of the first party mrs chick makes great use of her pockethandkerchief and falls on mr dombeys neck but mr dombey frigidly lifts her off and hands her to a chair  i thank you louisa he says for this mark of your affection but desire that our conversation may refer to any other subject when i bewail my fate louisa or express myself as being in want of consolation you can offer it if you will have the goodness  my dear paul rejoins his sister with her handkerchief to her face and shaking her head i know your great spirit and will say no more upon a theme so painful and revolting on the heads of which two adjectives mrs chick visits scathing indignation but pray let me ask youthough i dread to hear something that will shock and distress methat unfortunate child florence  louisa says her brother sternly silence not another word of this  mrs chick can only shake her head and use her handkerchief and moan over degenerate dombeys who are no dombeys but whether florence has been inculpated in the flight of edith or has followed her or has done too much or too little or anything or nothing she has not the least idea  he goes on without deviation keeping his thoughts and feelings close within his own breast and imparting them to no one he makes no search for his daughter he may think that she is with his sister or that she is under his own roof he may think of her constantly or he may never think about her it is all one for any sign he makes  but this is sure he does not think that he has lost her he has no suspicion of the truth he has lived too long shut up in his towering supremacy seeing her a patient gentle creature in the path below it to have any fear of that shaken as he is by his disgrace he is not yet humbled to the level earth the root is broad and deep and in the course of years its fibres have spread out and gathered nourishment from everything around it the tree is struck but not down  though he hide the world within him from the world withoutwhich he believes has but one purpose for the time and that to watch him eagerly wherever he goeshe cannot hide those rebel traces of it which escape in hollow eyes and cheeks a haggard forehead and a moody brooding air impenetrable as before he is still an altered man and proud as ever he is humbled or those marks would not be there  the world what the world thinks of him how it looks at him what it sees in him and what it saysthis is the haunting demon of his mind it is everywhere where he is and worse than that it is everywhere where he is not it comes out with him among his servants and yet he leaves it whispering behind he sees it pointing after him in the street it is waiting for him in his countinghouse it leers over the shoulders of rich men among the merchants it goes beckoning and babbling among the crowd it always anticipates him in every place and is always busiest he knows when he has gone away when he is shut up in his room at night it is in his house outside it audible in footsteps on the pavement visible in print upon the table steaming to and fro on railroads and in ships restless and busy everywhere with nothing else but him  it is not a phantom of his imagination it is as active in other peoples minds as in his witness cousin feenix who comes from badenbaden purposely to talk to him witness major bagstock who accompanies cousin feenix on that friendly mission  mr dombey receives them with his usual dignity and stands erect in his old attitude before the fire he feels that the world is looking at him out of their eyes that it is in the stare of the pictures that mr pitt upon the bookcase represents it that there are eyes in its own map hanging on the wall  an unusually cold spring says mr dombeyto deceive the world  damme sir says the major in the warmth of friendship joseph bagstock is a bad hand at a counterfeit if you want to hold your friends off dombey and to give them the cold shoulder j b is not the man for your purpose joe is rough and tough sir blunt sir blunt is joe his royal highness the late duke of york did me the honour to say deservedly or undeservedlynever mind thatif there is a man in the service on whom i can depend for coming to the point that man is joejoe bagstock  mr dombey intimates his acquiescence  now dombey says the major i am a man of the world our friend feenixif i may presume to  honoured i am sure says cousin feenix  is proceeds the major with a wag of his head also a man of the world dombey you are a man of the world now when three men of the world meet together and are friendsas i believe again appealing to cousin feenix  i am sure says cousin feenix most friendly  and are friends resumes the major old joes opinion is i may be wrong that the opinion of the world on any particular subject is very easily got at  undoubtedly says cousin feenix in point of fact its quite a selfevident sort of thing i am extremely anxious major that my friend dombey should hear me express my very great astonishment and regret that my lovely and accomplished relative who was possessed of every qualification to make a man happy should have so far forgotten what was due toin point of fact to the worldas to commit herself in such a very extraordinary manner i have been in a devilish state of depression ever since and said indeed to long saxby last nightman of six foot ten with whom my friend dombey is probably acquaintedthat it had upset me in a confounded way and made me bilious it induces a man to reflect this kind of fatal catastrophe says cousin feenix that events do occur in quite a providential manner for if my aunt had been living at the time i think the effect upon a devilish lively woman like herself would have been prostration and that she would have fallen in point of fact a victim  now dombey says the major resuming his discourse with great energy  i beg your pardon interposes cousin feenix allow me another word my friend dombey will permit me to say that if any circumstance could have added to the most infernal state of pain in which i find myself on this occasion it would be the natural amazement of the world at my lovely and accomplished relative as i must still beg leave to call her being supposed to have so committed herself with a personman with white teeth in point of factof very inferior station to her husband but while i must rather peremptorily request my friend dombey not to criminate my lovely and accomplished relative until her criminality is perfectly established i beg to assure my friend dombey that the family i represent and which is now almost extinct devilish sad reflection for a man will interpose no obstacle in his way and will be happy to assent to any honourable course of proceeding with a view to the future that he may point out i trust my friend dombey will give me credit for the intentions by which i am animated in this very melancholy affair andain point of fact i am not aware that i need trouble my friend dombey with any further observations  mr dombey bows without raising his eyes and is silent  now dombey says the major our friend feenix having with an amount of eloquence that old joe b has never heard surpassedno by the lord sir neversays the major very blue indeed and grasping his cane in the middlestated the case as regards the lady i shall presume upon our friendship dombey to offer a word on another aspect of it sir says the major with the horses cough the world in these things has opinions which must be satisfied  i know it rejoins mr dombey  of course you know it dombey says the major damme sir i know you know it a man of your calibre is not likely to be ignorant of it  i hope not replies mr dombey  dombey says the major you will guess the rest i speak outprematurely perhapsbecause the bagstock breed have always spoke out little sir have they ever got by doing it but its in the bagstock blood a shot is to be taken at this man you have j b at your elbow he claims the name of friend god bless you  major returns mr dombey i am obliged i shall put myself in your hands when the time comes the time not being come i have forborne to speak to you  where is the fellow dombey inquires the major after gasping and looking at him for a minute  i dont know  any intelligence of him asks the major  yes  dombey i am rejoiced to hear it says the major i congratulate you  you will excuseeven you major replies mr dombey my entering into any further detail at present the intelligence is of a singular kind and singularly obtained it may turn out to be valueless it may turn out to be true i cannot say at present my explanation must stop here  although this is but a dry reply to the majors purple enthusiasm the major receives it graciously and is delighted to think that the world has such a fair prospect of soon receiving its due cousin feenix is then presented with his meed of acknowledgment by the husband of his lovely and accomplished relative and cousin feenix and major bagstock retire leaving that husband to the world again and to ponder at leisure on their representation of its state of mind concerning his affairs and on its just and reasonable expectations  but who sits in the housekeepers room shedding tears and talking to mrs pipchin in a low tone with uplifted hands it is a lady with her face concealed in a very close black bonnet which appears not to belong to her it is miss tox who has borrowed this disguise from her servant and comes from princesss place thus secretly to revive her old acquaintance with mrs pipchin in order to get certain information of the state of mr dombey  how does he bear it my dear creature asks miss tox  well says mrs pipchin in her snappish way hes pretty much as usual  externally suggests miss tox but what he feels within  mrs pipchins hard grey eye looks doubtful as she answers in three distinct jerks ah perhaps i suppose so  to tell you my mind lucretia says mrs pipchin she still calls miss tox lucretia on account of having made her first experiments in the childquelling line of business on that lady when an unfortunate and weazen little girl of tender years to tell you my mind lucretia i think its a good riddance i dont want any of your brazen faces here myself  brazen indeed well may you say brazen mrs pipchin returned miss tox to leave him such a noble figure of a man and here miss tox is overcome  i dont know about noble im sure observes mrs pipchin irascibly rubbing her nose but i know thisthat when people meet with trials they must bear em hoity toity i have had enough to bear myself in my time what a fuss there is shes gone and well got rid of nobody wants her back i should think this hint of the peruvian mines causes miss tox to rise to go away when mrs pipchin rings the bell for towlinson to show her out mr towlinson not having seen miss tox for ages grins and hopes shes well observing that he didnt know her at first in that bonnet  pretty well towlinson i thank you says miss tox i beg youll have the goodness when you happen to see me here not to mention it my visits are merely to mrs pipchin  very good miss says towlinson  shocking circumstances occur towlinson says miss tox  very much so indeed miss rejoins towlinson  i hope towlinson says miss tox who in her instruction of the toodle family has acquired an admonitorial tone and a habit of improving passing occasions that what has happened here will be a warning to you towlinson  thank you miss im sure says towlinson  he appears to be falling into a consideration of the manner in which this warning ought to operate in his particular case when the vinegary mrs pipchin suddenly stirring him up with a what are you doing why dont you show the lady to the door he ushers miss tox forth as she passes mr dombeys room she shrinks into the inmost depths of the black bonnet and walks on tiptoe and there is not another atom in the world which haunts him so that feels such sorrow and solicitude about him as miss tox takes out under the black bonnet into the street and tries to carry home shadowed it from the newlylighted lamps  but miss tox is not a part of mr dombeys world she comes back every evening at dusk adding clogs and an umbrella to the bonnet on wet nights and bears the grins of towlinson and the huffs and rebuffs of mrs pipchin and all to ask how he does and how he bears his misfortune but she has nothing to do with mr dombeys world exacting and harassing as ever it goes on without her and she a by no means bright or particular star moves in her little orbit in the corner of another system and knows it quite well and comes and cries and goes away and is satisfied verily miss tox is easier of satisfaction than the world that troubles mr dombey so much  at the counting house the clerks discuss the great disaster in all its lights and shades but chiefly wonder who will get mr carkers place they are generally of opinion that it will be shorn of some of its emoluments and made uncomfortable by newlydevised checks and restrictions and those who are beyond all hope of it are quite sure they would rather not have it and dont at all envy the person for whom it may prove to be reserved nothing like the prevailing sensation has existed in the counting house since mr dombeys little son died but all such excitements there take a social not to say a jovial turn and lead to the cultivation of good fellowship a reconciliation is established on this propitious occasion between the acknowledged wit of the counting house and an aspiring rival with whom he has been at deadly feud for months and a little dinner being proposed in commemoration of their happily restored amity takes place at a neighbouring tavern the wit in the chair the rival acting as vicepresident the orations following the removal of the cloth are opened by the chair who says gentlemen he cant disguise from himself that this is not a time for private dissensions recent occurrences to which he need not more particularly allude but which have not been altogether without notice in some sunday papers and in a daily paper which he need not name here every other member of the company names it in an audible murmur have caused him to reflect and he feels that for him and robinson to have any personal differences at such a moment would be for ever to deny that good feeling in the general cause for which he has reason to think and hope that the gentlemen in dombeys house have always been distinguished robinson replies to this like a man and a brother and one gentleman who has been in the office three years under continual notice to quit on account of lapses in his arithmetic appears in a perfectly new light suddenly bursting out with a thrilling speech in which he says may their respected chief never again know the desolation which has fallen on his hearth and says a great variety of things beginning with may he never again which are received with thunders of applause in short a most delightful evening is passed only interrupted by a difference between two juniors who quarrelling about the probable amount of mr carkers late receipts per annum defy each other with decanters and are taken out greatly excited soda water is in general request at the office next day and most of the party deem the bill an imposition  as to perch the messenger he is in a fair way of being ruined for life he finds himself again constantly in bars of publichouses being treated and lying dreadfully it appears that he met everybody concerned in the late transaction everywhere and said to them sir or madam as the case was why do you look so pale at which each shuddered from head to foot and said oh perch and ran away either the consciousness of these enormities or the reaction consequent on liquor reduces mr perch to an extreme state of low spirits at that hour of the evening when he usually seeks consolation in the society of mrs perch at balls pond and mrs perch frets a good deal for she fears his confidence in woman is shaken now and that he half expects on coming home at night to find her gone off with some viscountwhich as she observes to an intimate female friend is what these wretches in the form of woman have to answer for mrs p it aint the harm they do themselves so much as what they reflect upon us maam and i see it in perchs eye  mr dombeys servants are becoming at the same time quite dissipated and unfit for other service they have hot suppers every night and talk it over with smoking drinks upon the board mr towlinson is always maudlin after halfpast ten and frequently begs to know whether he didnt say that no good would ever come of living in a corner house they whisper about miss florence and wonder where she is but agree that if mr dombey dont know mrs dombey does this brings them to the latter of whom cook says she had a stately way though hadnt she but she was too high they all agree that she was too high and mr towlinsons old flame the housemaid who is very virtuous entreats that you will never talk to her any more about people who hold their heads up as if the ground wasnt good enough for em  everything that is said and done about it except by mr dombey is done in chorus mr dombey and the world are alone together    chapter 52 secret intelligence   good mrs brown and her daughter alice kept silent company together in their own dwelling it was early in the evening and late in the spring but a few days had elapsed since mr dombey had told major bagstock of his singular intelligence singularly obtained which might turn out to be valueless and might turn out to be true and the world was not satisfied yet  the mother and daughter sat for a long time without interchanging a word almost without motion the old womans face was shrewdly anxious and expectant that of her daughter was expectant too but in a less sharp degree and sometimes it darkened as if with gathering disappointment and incredulity the old woman without heeding these changes in its expression though her eyes were often turned towards it sat mumbling and munching and listening confidently  their abode though poor and miserable was not so utterly wretched as in the days when only good mrs brown inhabited it some few attempts at cleanliness and order were manifest though made in a reckless gipsy way that might have connected them at a glance with the younger woman the shades of evening thickened and deepened as the two kept silence until the blackened walls were nearly lost in the prevailing gloom  then alice broke the silence which had lasted so long and said  you may give him up mother hell not come here  death give him up returned the old woman impatiently he will come here  we shall see said alice  we shall see him returned her mother  and doomsday said the daughter  you think im in my second childhood i know croaked the old woman thats the respect and duty that i get from my own gal but im wiser than you take me for hell come tother day when i touched his coat in the street he looked round as if i was a toad but lord to see him when i said their names and asked him if hed like to find out where they was  was it so angry asked her daughter roused to interest in a moment  angry ask if it was bloody thats more like the word angry ha ha to call that only angry said the old woman hobbling to the cupboard and lighting a candle which displayed the workings of her mouth to ugly advantage as she brought it to the table i might as well call your face only angry when you think or talk about em  it was something different from that truly as she sat as still as a crouched tigress with her kindling eyes  hark said the old woman triumphantly i hear a step coming its not the tread of anyone that lives about here or comes this way often we dont walk like that we should grow proud on such neighbours do you hear him  i believe you are right mother replied alice in a low voice peace open the door  as she drew herself within her shawl and gathered it about her the old woman complied and peering out and beckoning gave admission to mr dombey who stopped when he had set his foot within the door and looked distrustfully around  its a poor place for a great gentleman like your worship said the old woman curtseying and chattering i told you so but theres no harm in it  who is that asked mr dombey looking at her companion  thats my handsome daughter said the old woman your worship wont mind her she knows all about it  a shadow fell upon his face not less expressive than if he had groaned aloud who does not know all about it but he looked at her steadily and she without any acknowledgment of his presence looked at him the shadow on his face was darker when he turned his glance away from her and even then it wandered back again furtively as if he were haunted by her bold eyes and some remembrance they inspired  woman said mr dombey to the old witch who was chuckling and leering close at his elbow and who when he turned to address her pointed stealthily at her daughter and rubbed her hands and pointed again woman i believe that i am weak and forgetful of my station in coming here but you know why i come and what you offered when you stopped me in the street the other day what is it that you have to tell me concerning what i want to know and how does it happen that i can find voluntary intelligence in a hovel like this with a disdainful glance about him when i have exerted my power and means to obtain it in vain i do not think he said after a moments pause during which he had observed her sternly that you are so audacious as to mean to trifle with me or endeavour to impose upon me but if you have that purpose you had better stop on the threshold of your scheme my humour is not a trifling one and my acknowledgment will be severe  oh a proud hard gentleman chuckled the old woman shaking her head and rubbing her shrivelled hands oh hard hard hard but your worship shall see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears not with oursand if your worships put upon their track you wont mind paying something for it will you honourable deary  money returned mr dombey apparently relieved and assured by this inquiry will bring about unlikely things i know it may turn even means as unexpected and unpromising as these to account yes for any reliable information i receive i will pay but i must have the information first and judge for myself of its value  do you know nothing more powerful than money asked the younger woman without rising or altering her attitude  not here i should imagine said mr dombey  you should know of something that is more powerful elsewhere as i judge she returned do you know nothing of a womans anger  you have a saucy tongue jade said mr dombey  not usually she answered without any show of emotion i speak to you now that you may understand us better and rely more on us a womans anger is pretty much the same here as in your fine house i am angry i have been so many years i have as good cause for my anger as you have for yours and its object is the same man  he started in spite of himself and looked at her with astonishment  yes she said with a kind of laugh wide as the distance may seem between us it is so how it is so is no matter that is my story and i keep my story to myself i would bring you and him together because i have a rage against him my mother there is avaricious and poor and she would sell any tidings she could glean or anything or anybody for money it is fair enough perhaps that you should pay her some if she can help you to what you want to know but that is not my motive i have told you what mine is and it would be as strong and allsufficient with me if you haggled and bargained with her for a sixpence i have done my saucy tongue says no more if you wait here till sunrise tomorrow  the old woman who had shown great uneasiness during this speech which had a tendency to depreciate her expected gains pulled mr dombey softly by the sleeve and whispered to him not to mind her he glared at them both by turns with a haggard look and said in a deeper voice than was usual with him  go onwhat do you know  oh not so fast your worship we must wait for someone answered the old woman its to be got from someone elsewormed outscrewed and twisted from him  what do you mean said mr dombey  patience she croaked laying her hand like a claw upon his arm patience ill get at it i know i can if he was to hold it back from me said good mrs brown crooking her ten fingers id tear it out of him  mr dombey followed her with his eyes as she hobbled to the door and looked out again and then his glance sought her daughter but she remained impassive silent and regardless of him  do you tell me woman he said when the bent figure of mrs brown came back shaking its head and chattering to itself that there is another person expected here  yes said the old woman looking up into his face and nodding  from whom you are to exact the intelligence that is to be useful to me  yes said the old woman nodding again  a stranger  chut said the old woman with a shrill laugh what signifies well well no no stranger to your worship but he wont see you hed be afraid of you and wouldnt talk youll stand behind that door and judge him for yourself we dont ask to be believed on trust what your worship doubts the room behind the door oh the suspicion of you rich gentlefolks look at it then  her sharp eye had detected an involuntary expression of this feeling on his part which was not unreasonable under the circumstances in satisfaction of it she now took the candle to the door she spoke of mr dombey looked in assured himself that it was an empty crazy room and signed to her to put the light back in its place  how long he asked before this person comes  not long she answered would your worship sit down for a few odd minutes  he made no answer but began pacing the room with an irresolute air as if he were undecided whether to remain or depart and as if he had some quarrel with himself for being there at all but soon his tread grew slower and heavier and his face more sternly thoughtful as the object with which he had come fixed itself in his mind and dilated there again  while he thus walked up and down with his eyes on the ground mrs brown in the chair from which she had risen to receive him sat listening anew the monotony of his step or the uncertainty of age made her so slow of hearing that a footfall without had sounded in her daughters ears for some moments and she had looked up hastily to warn her mother of its approach before the old woman was roused by it but then she started from her seat and whispering here he is hurried her visitor to his place of observation and put a bottle and glass upon the table with such alacrity as to be ready to fling her arms round the neck of rob the grinder on his appearance at the door  and heres my bonny boy cried mrs brown at lastoho oho youre like my own son robby  oh misses brown remonstrated the grinder dont cant you be fond of a cove without squeedging and throttling of him take care of the birdcage in my hand will you  thinks of a birdcage afore me cried the old woman apostrophizing the ceiling me that feels more than a mother for him  well im sure im very much obliged to you misses brown said the unfortunate youth greatly aggravated but youre so jealous of a cove im very fond of you myself and all that of course but i dont smother you do i misses brown  he looked and spoke as if he would have been far from objecting to do so however on a favourable occasion  and to talk about birdcages too whimpered the grinder as if that was a crime why lookee here do you know who this belongs to  to master dear said the old woman with a grin  ah replied the grinder lifting a large cage tied up in a wrapper on the table and untying it with his teeth and hands its our parrot this is  mr carkers parrot rob  will you hold your tongue misses brown returned the goaded grinder what do you go naming names for im blest said rob pulling his hair with both hands in the exasperation of his feelings if she aint enough to make a cove run wild  what do you snub me thankless boy cried the old woman with ready vehemence  good gracious misses brown no returned the grinder with tears in his eyes was there ever such a dont i dote upon you misses brown  do you sweet rob do you truly chickabiddy with that mrs brown held him in her fond embrace once more and did not release him until he had made several violent and ineffectual struggles with his legs and his hair was standing on end all over his head  oh returned the grinder what a thing it is to be perfectly pitched into with affection like this here i wish she washow have you been misses brown  ah not here since this night week said the old woman contemplating him with a look of reproach  good gracious misses brown returned the grinder i said tonights a week that id come tonight didnt i and here i am how you do go on i wish youd be a little rational misses brown im hoarse with saying things in my defence and my very face is shiny with being hugged he rubbed it hard with his sleeve as if to remove the tender polish in question  drink a little drop to comfort you my robin said the old woman filling the glass from the bottle and giving it to him  thankee misses brown returned the grinder heres your health and long may youet ceterer which to judge from the expression of his face did not include any very choice blessings and heres her health said the grinder glancing at alice who sat with her eyes fixed as it seemed to him on the wall behind him but in reality on mr dombeys face at the door and wishing her the same and many of em  he drained the glass to these two sentiments and set it down  well i say misses brown he proceeded to go on a little rational now youre a judge of birds and up to their ways as i know to my cost  cost repeated mrs brown  satisfaction i mean returned the grinder how you do take up a cove misses brown youve put it all out of my head again  judge of birds robby suggested the old woman  ah said the grinder well ive got to take care of this parrotcertain things being sold and a certain establishment broke upand as i dont want no notice took at present i wish youd attend to her for a week or so and give her board and lodging will you if i must come backwards and forwards mused the grinder with a dejected face i may as well have something to come for  something to come for screamed the old woman  besides you i mean misses brown returned the craven rob not that i want any inducement but yourself misses brown im sure dont begin again for goodness sake  he dont care for me he dont care for me as i care for him cried mrs brown lifting up her skinny hands but ill take care of his bird  take good care of it too you know mrs brown said rob shaking his head if you was so much as to stroke its feathers once the wrong way i believe it would be found out  ah so sharp as that rob said mrs brown quickly  sharp misses brown repeated rob but this is not to be talked about  checking himself abruptly and not without a fearful glance across the room rob filled the glass again and having slowly emptied it shook his head and began to draw his fingers across and across the wires of the parrots cage by way of a diversion from the dangerous theme that had just been broached  the old woman eyed him slily and hitching her chair nearer his and looking in at the parrot who came down from the gilded dome at her call said  out of place now robby  never you mind misses brown returned the grinder shortly  board wages perhaps rob said mrs brown  pretty polly said the grinder  the old woman darted a glance at him that might have warned him to consider his ears in danger but it was his turn to look in at the parrot now and however expressive his imagination may have made her angry scowl it was unseen by his bodily eyes  i wonder master didnt take you with him rob said the old woman in a wheedling voice but with increased malignity of aspect  rob was so absorbed in contemplation of the parrot and in trolling his forefinger on the wires that he made no answer  the old woman had her clutch within a hairs breadth of his shock of hair as it stooped over the table but she restrained her fingers and said in a voice that choked with its efforts to be coaxing  robby my child  well misses brown returned the grinder  i say i wonder master didnt take you with him dear  never you mind misses brown returned the grinder  mrs brown instantly directed the clutch of her right hand at his hair and the clutch of her left hand at his throat and held on to the object of her fond affection with such extraordinary fury that his face began to blacken in a moment  misses brown exclaimed the grinder let go will you what are you doing of help young woman misses browbrow  the young woman however equally unmoved by his direct appeal to her and by his inarticulate utterance remained quite neutral until after struggling with his assailant into a corner rob disengaged himself and stood there panting and fenced in by his own elbows while the old woman panting too and stamping with rage and eagerness appeared to be collecting her energies for another swoop upon him at this crisis alice interposed her voice but not in the grinders favour by saying  well done mother tear him to pieces  what young woman blubbered rob are you against me too what have i been and done what am i to be tore to pieces for i should like to know why do you take and choke a cove who has never done you any harm neither of you call yourselves females too said the frightened and afflicted grinder with his coatcuff at his eye im surprised at you wheres your feminine tenderness  you thankless dog gasped mrs brown you impudent insulting dog  what have i been and done to go and give you offence misses brown retorted the fearful rob you was very much attached to me a minute ago  to cut me off with his short answers and his sulky words said the old woman me because i happen to be curious to have a little bit of gossip about master and the lady to dare to play at fast and loose with me but ill talk to you no more my lad now go  im sure misses brown returned the abject grinder i never insiniwated that i wished to go dont talk like that misses brown if you please  i wont talk at all said mrs brown with an action of her crooked fingers that made him shrink into half his natural compass in the corner not another word with him shall pass my lips hes an ungrateful hound i cast him off now let him go and ill slip those after him that shall talk too much that wont be shook away thatll hang to him like leeches and slink arter him like foxes what he knows em he knows his old games and his old ways if hes forgotten em theyll soon remind him now let him go and see how hell do masters business and keep masters secrets with such company always following him up and down ha ha ha hell find em a different sort from you and me ally close as he is with you and me now let him go now let him go  the old woman to the unspeakable dismay of the grinder walked her twisted figure round and round in a ring of some four feet in diameter constantly repeating these words and shaking her fist above her head and working her mouth about  misses brown pleaded rob coming a little out of his corner im sure you wouldnt injure a cove on second thoughts and in cold blood would you  dont talk to me said mrs brown still wrathfully pursuing her circle now let him go now let him go  misses brown urged the tormented grinder i didnt mean tooh what a thing it is for a cove to get into such a line as thisi was only careful of talking misses brown because i always am on account of his being up to everything but i might have known it wouldnt have gone any further im sure im quite agreeable with a wretched face for any little bit of gossip misses brown dont go on like this if you please oh couldnt you have the goodness to put in a word for a miserable cove here said the grinder appealing in desperation to the daughter  come mother you hear what he says she interposed in her stern voice and with an impatient action of her head try him once more and if you fall out with him again ruin him if you like and have done with him  mrs brown moved as it seemed by this very tender exhortation presently began to howl and softening by degrees took the apologetic grinder to her arms who embraced her with a face of unutterable woe and like a victim as he was resumed his former seat close by the side of his venerable friend whom he suffered not without much constrained sweetness of countenance combating very expressive physiognomical revelations of an opposite character to draw his arm through hers and keep it there  and hows master deary dear said mrs brown when sitting in this amicable posture they had pledged each other  hush if youd be so good misses brown as to speak a little lower rob implored why hes pretty well thankee i suppose  youre not out of place robby said mrs brown in a wheedling tone  why im not exactly out of place nor in faltered rob iim still in pay misses brown  and nothing to do rob  nothing particular to do just now misses brown but tokeep my eyes open said the grinder rolling them in a forlorn way  master abroad rob  oh for goodness sake misses brown couldnt you gossip with a cove about anything else cried the grinder in a burst of despair  the impetuous mrs brown rising directly the tortured grinder detained her stammering yees misses brown i believe hes abroad whats she staring at he added in allusion to the daughter whose eyes were fixed upon the face that now again looked out behind  dont mind her lad said the old woman holding him closer to prevent his turning round its her wayher way tell me rob did you ever see the lady deary  oh misses brown what lady cried the grinder in a tone of piteous supplication  what lady she retorted the lady mrs dombey  yes i believe i see her once replied rob  the night she went away robby eh said the old woman in his ear and taking note of every change in his face aha i know it was that night  well if you know it was that night you know misses brown replied rob its no use putting pinchers into a cove to make him say so  where did they go that night rob straight away how did they go where did you see her did she laugh did she cry tell me all about it cried the old hag holding him closer yet patting the hand that was drawn through his arm against her other hand and searching every line in his face with her bleared eyes come begin i want to be told all about it what rob boy you and me can keep a secret together eh weve done so before now where did they go first rob  the wretched grinder made a gasp and a pause  are you dumb said the old woman angrily  lord misses brown no you expect a cove to be a flash of lightning i wish i was the electric fluency muttered the bewildered grinder id have a shock at somebody that would settle their business  what do you say asked the old woman with a grin  im wishing my love to you misses brown returned the false rob seeking consolation in the glass where did they go to first was it him and her do you mean  ah said the old woman eagerly them two  why they didnt go nowherenot together i mean answered rob  the old woman looked at him as though she had a strong impulse upon her to make another clutch at his head and throat but was restrained by a certain dogged mystery in his face  that was the art of it said the reluctant grinder thats the way nobody saw em go or has been able to say how they did go they went different ways i tell you misses brown  ay ay ay to meet at an appointed place chuckled the old woman after a moments silent and keen scrutiny of his face  why if they werent a going to meet somewhere i suppose they might as well have stayed at home mightnt they brown returned the unwilling grinder  well rob well said the old woman drawing his arm yet tighter through her own as if in her eagerness she were afraid of his slipping away  what havent we talked enough yet misses brown returned the grinder who between his sense of injury his sense of liquor and his sense of being on the rack had become so lachrymose that at almost every answer he scooped his coats into one or other of his eyes and uttered an unavailing whine of remonstrance did she laugh that night was it didnt you ask if she laughed misses brown  or cried added the old woman nodding assent  neither said the grinder she kept as steady when she and meoh i see you will have it out of me misses brown but take your solemn oath now that youll never tell anybody  this mrs brown very readily did being naturally jesuitical and having no other intention in the matter than that her concealed visitor should hear for himself  she kept as steady then when she and me went down to southampton said the grinder as a image in the morning she was just the same misses brown and when she went away in the packet before daylight by herselfme pretending to be her servant and seeing her safe aboardshe was just the same now are you contented misses brown  no rob not yet answered mrs brown decisively  oh heres a woman for you cried the unfortunate rob in an outburst of feeble lamentation over his own helplessness  what did you wish to know next misses brown  what became of master where did he go she inquired still holding him tight and looking close into his face with her sharp eyes  upon my soul i dont know misses brown answered rob  upon my soul i dont know what he did nor where he went nor anything about him i only know what he said to me as a caution to hold my tongue when we parted and i tell you this misses brown as a friend that sooner than ever repeat a word of what were saying now you had better take and shoot yourself or shut yourself up in this house and set it afire for theres nothing he wouldnt do to be revenged upon you you dont know him half as well as i do misses brown youre never safe from him i tell you  havent i taken an oath retorted the old woman and wont i keep it  well im sure i hope you will misses brown returned rob somewhat doubtfully and not without a latent threatening in his manner for your own sake quite as much as mine  he looked at her as he gave her this friendly caution and emphasized it with a nodding of his head but finding it uncomfortable to encounter the yellow face with its grotesque action and the ferret eyes with their keen old wintry gaze so close to his own he looked down uneasily and sat skulking in his chair as if he were trying to bring himself to a sullen declaration that he would answer no more questions the old woman still holding him as before took this opportunity of raising the forefinger of her right hand in the air as a stealthy signal to the concealed observer to give particular attention to what was about to follow  rob she said in her most coaxing tone  good gracious misses brown whats the matter now returned the exasperated grinder  rob where did the lady and master appoint to meet  rob shuffled more and more and looked up and looked down and bit his thumb and dried it on his waistcoat and finally said eyeing his tormentor askance how should i know misses brown  the old woman held up her finger again as before and replying come lad its no use leading me to that and there leaving me i want to know waited for his answer rob after a discomfited pause suddenly broke out with how can i pronounce the names of foreign places mrs brown what an unreasonable woman you are  but you have heard it said robby she retorted firmly and you know what it sounded like come  i never heard it said misses brown returned the grinder  then retorted the old woman quickly you have seen it written and you can spell it  rob with a petulant exclamation between laughing and cryingfor he was penetrated with some admiration of mrs browns cunning even through this persecutionafter some reluctant fumbling in his waistcoat pocket produced from it a little piece of chalk the old womans eyes sparkled when she saw it between his thumb and finger and hastily clearing a space on the deal table that he might write the word there she once more made her signal with a shaking hand  now i tell you beforehand what it is misses brown said rob its no use asking me anything else i wont answer anything else i cant how long it was to be before they met or whose plan it was that they was to go away alone i dont know no more than you do i dont know any more about it if i was to tell you how i found out this word youd believe that shall i tell you misses brown  yes rob  well then misses brown the waynow you wont ask any more you know said rob turning his eyes which were now fast getting drowsy and stupid upon her  not another word said mrs brown  well then the way was this when a certain person left the lady with me he put a piece of paper with a direction written on it in the ladys hand saying it was in case she should forget she wasnt afraid of forgetting for she tore it up as soon as his back was turned and when i put up the carriage steps i shook out one of the piecesshe sprinkled the rest out of the window i suppose for there was none there afterwards though i looked for em there was only one word on it and that was this if you must and will know but remember youre upon your oath misses brown  mrs brown knew that she said rob having nothing more to say began to chalk slowly and laboriously on the table  d the old woman read aloud when he had formed the letter  will you hold your tongue misses brown he exclaimed covering it with his hand and turning impatiently upon her i wont have it read out be quiet will you  then write large rob she returned repeating her secret signal for my eyes are not good even at print  muttering to himself and returning to his work with an ill will rob went on with the word as he bent his head down the person for whose information he so unconsciously laboured moved from the door behind him to within a short stride of his shoulder and looked eagerly towards the creeping track of his hand upon the table at the same time alice from her opposite chair watched it narrowly as it shaped the letters and repeated each one on her lips as he made it without articulating it aloud at the end of every letter her eyes and mr dombeys met as if each of them sought to be confirmed by the other and thus they both spelt dijon  there said the grinder moistening the palm of his hand hastily to obliterate the word and not content with smearing it out rubbing and planing all trace of it away with his coatsleeve until the very colour of the chalk was gone from the table now i hope youre contented misses brown  the old woman in token of her being so released his arm and patted his back and the grinder overcome with mortification crossexamination and liquor folded his arms on the table laid his head upon them and fell asleep  not until he had been heavily asleep some time and was snoring roundly did the old woman turn towards the door where mr dombey stood concealed and beckon him to come through the room and pass out even then she hovered over rob ready to blind him with her hands or strike his head down if he should raise it while the secret step was crossing to the door but though her glance took sharp cognizance of the sleeper it was sharp too for the waking man and when he touched her hand with his and in spite of all his caution made a chinking golden sound it was as bright and greedy as a ravens  the daughters dark gaze followed him to the door and noted well how pale he was and how his hurried tread indicated that the least delay was an insupportable restraint upon him and how he was burning to be active and away as he closed the door behind him she looked round at her mother the old woman trotted to her opened her hand to show what was within and tightly closing it again in her jealousy and avarice whispered  what will he do ally  mischief said the daughter  murder asked the old woman  hes a madman in his wounded pride and may do that for anything we can say or he either  her glance was brighter than her mothers and the fire that shone in it was fiercer but her face was colourless even to her lips  they said no more but sat apart the mother communing with her money the daughter with her thoughts the glance of each shining in the gloom of the feebly lighted room rob slept and snored the disregarded parrot only was in action it twisted and pulled at the wires of its cage with its crooked beak and crawled up to the dome and along its roof like a fly and down again head foremost and shook and bit and rattled at every slender bar as if it knew its masters danger and was wild to force a passage out and fly away to warn him of it    chapter 53 more intelligence   there were two of the traitors own bloodhis renounced brother and sisteron whom the weight of his guilt rested almost more heavily at this time than on the man whom he had so deeply injured prying and tormenting as the world was it did mr dombey the service of nerving him to pursuit and revenge it roused his passion stung his pride twisted the one idea of his life into a new shape and made some gratification of his wrath the object into which his whole intellectual existence resolved itself all the stubbornness and implacability of his nature all its hard impenetrable quality all its gloom and moroseness all its exaggerated sense of personal importance all its jealous disposition to resent the least flaw in the ample recognition of his importance by others set this way like many streams united into one and bore him on upon their tide the most impetuously passionate and violently impulsive of mankind would have been a milder enemy to encounter than the sullen mr dombey wrought to this a wild beast would have been easier turned or soothed than the grave gentleman without a wrinkle in his starched cravat  but the very intensity of his purpose became almost a substitute for action in it while he was yet uninformed of the traitors retreat it served to divert his mind from his own calamity and to entertain it with another prospect the brother and sister of his false favourite had no such relief everything in their history past and present gave his delinquency a more afflicting meaning to them  the sister may have sometimes sadly thought that if she had remained with him the companion and friend she had been once he might have escaped the crime into which he had fallen if she ever thought so it was still without regret for what she had done without the least doubt of her duty without any pricing or enhancing of her selfdevotion but when this possibility presented itself to the erring and repentant brother as it sometimes did it smote upon his heart with such a keen reproachful touch as he could hardly bear no idea of retort upon his cruel brother came into his mind new accusation of himself fresh inward lamentings over his own unworthiness and the ruin in which it was at once his consolation and his selfreproach that he did not stand alone were the sole kind of reflections to which the discovery gave rise in him  it was on the very same day whose evening set upon the last chapter and when mr dombeys world was busiest with the elopement of his wife that the window of the room in which the brother and sister sat at their early breakfast was darkened by the unexpected shadow of a man coming to the little porch which man was perch the messenger  ive stepped over from balls pond at a early hour said mr perch confidentially looking in at the room door and stopping on the mat to wipe his shoes all round which had no mud upon them agreeable to my instructions last night they was to be sure and bring a note to you mr carker before you went out in the morning i should have been here a good hour and a half ago said mr perch meekly but for the state of health of mrs p who i thought i should have lost in the night i do assure you five distinct times  is your wife so ill asked harriet  why you see said mr perch first turning round to shut the door carefully she takes what has happened in our house so much to heart miss her nerves is so very delicate you see and soon unstrung not but what the strongest nerves had good need to be shook im sure you feel it very much yourself no doubts  harriet repressed a sigh and glanced at her brother  im sure i feel it myself in my humble way mr perch went on to say with a shake of his head in a manner i couldnt have believed if i hadnt been called upon to undergo it has almost the effect of drink upon me i literally feels every morning as if i had been taking more than was good for me overnight  mr perchs appearance corroborated this recital of his symptoms there was an air of feverish lassitude about it that seemed referable to drams and which in fact might no doubt have been traced to those numerous discoveries of himself in the bars of publichouses being treated and questioned which he was in the daily habit of making  therefore i can judge said mr perch shaking his head and speaking in a silvery murmur of the feelings of such as is at all peculiarly sitiwated in this most painful rewelation  here mr perch waited to be confided in and receiving no confidence coughed behind his hand this leading to nothing he coughed behind his hat and that leading to nothing he put his hat on the ground and sought in his breast pocket for the letter  if i rightly recollect there was no answer said mr perch with an affable smile but perhaps youll be so good as cast your eye over it sir  john carker broke the seal which was mr dombeys and possessing himself of the contents which were very brief replied  no no answer is expected  then i shall wish you good morning miss said perch taking a step toward the door and hoping im sure that youll not permit yourself to be more reduced in mind than you can help by the late painful rewelation the papers said mr perch taking two steps back again and comprehensively addressing both the brother and sister in a whisper of increased mystery is more eager for news of it than youd suppose possible one of the sunday ones in a blue cloak and a white hat that had previously offered for to bribe meneed i say with what successwas dodging about our court last night as late as twenty minutes after eight oclock i see him myself with his eye at the countinghouse keyhole which being patent is impervious another one said mr perch with military frogs is in the parlour of the kings arms all the blessed day i happened last week to let a little obserwation fall there and next morning which was sunday i see it worked up in print in a most surprising manner  mr perch resorted to his breast pocket as if to produce the paragraph but receiving no encouragement pulled out his beaver gloves picked up his hat and took his leave and before it was high noon mr perch had related to several select audiences at the kings arms and elsewhere how miss carker bursting into tears had caught him by both hands and said oh dear dear perch the sight of you is all the comfort i have left and how mr john carker had said in an awful voice perch i disown him never let me hear him mentioned as a brother more  dear john said harriet when they were left alone and had remained silent for some few moments there are bad tidings in that letter  yes but nothing unexpected he replied i saw the writer yesterday  the writer  mr dombey he passed twice through the counting house while i was there i had been able to avoid him before but of course could not hope to do that long i know how natural it was that he should regard my presence as something offensive i felt it must be so myself  he did not say so  no he said nothing but i saw that his glance rested on me for a moment and i was prepared for what would happenfor what has happened i am dismissed  she looked as little shocked and as hopeful as she could but it was distressing news for many reasons  i need not tell you said john carker reading the letter why your name would henceforth have an unnatural sound in however remote a connexion with mine or why the daily sight of anyone who bears it would be unendurable to me i have to notify the cessation of all engagements between us from this date and to request that no renewal of any communication with me or my establishment be ever attempted by youenclosed is an equivalent in money to a generously long notice and this is my discharge heaven knows harriet it is a lenient and considerate one when we remember all  if it be lenient and considerate to punish you at all john for the misdeed of another she replied gently yes  we have been an illomened race to him said john carker he has reason to shrink from the sound of our name and to think that there is something cursed and wicked in our blood i should almost think it too harriet but for you  brother dont speak like this if you have any special reason as you say you have and think you havethough i say noto love me spare me the hearing of such wild mad words  he covered his face with both his hands but soon permitted her coming near him to take one in her own  after so many years this parting is a melancholy thing i know said his sister and the cause of it is dreadful to us both we have to live too and must look about us for the means well well we can do so undismayed it is our pride not our trouble to strive john and to strive together  a smile played on her lips as she kissed his cheek and entreated him to be of of good cheer  oh dearest sister tied of your own noble will to a ruined man whose reputation is blighted who has no friend himself and has driven every friend of yours away  john she laid her hand hastily upon his lips for my sake in remembrance of our long companionship he was silent now let me tell you dear quietly sitting by his side i have as you have expected this and when i have been thinking of it and fearing that it would happen and preparing myself for it as well as i could i have resolved to tell you if it should be so that i have kept a secret from you and that we have a friend  whats our friends name harriet he answered with a sorrowful smile  indeed i dont know but he once made a very earnest protestation to me of his friendship and his wish to serve us and to this day i believe him  harriet exclaimed her wondering brother where does this friend live  neither do i know that she returned but he knows us both and our historyall our little history john that is the reason why at his own suggestion i have kept the secret of his coming here from you lest his acquaintance with it should distress you  here has he been here harriet  here in this room once  what kind of man  not young greyheaded as he said and fast growing greyer but generous and frank and good i am sure  and only seen once harriet  in this room only once said his sister with the slightest and most transient glow upon her cheek but when here he entreated me to suffer him to see me once a week as he passed by in token of our being well and continuing to need nothing at his hands for i told him when he proffered us any service he could renderwhich was the object of his visitthat we needed nothing  and once a week  once every week since then and always on the same day and at the same hour he his gone past always on foot always going in the same directiontowards london and never pausing longer than to bow to me and wave his hand cheerfully as a kind guardian might he made that promise when he proposed these curious interviews and has kept it so faithfully and pleasantly that if i ever felt any trifling uneasiness about them in the beginning which i dont think i did john his manner was so plain and true it very soon vanished and left me quite glad when the day was coming last mondaythe first since this terrible eventhe did not go by and i have wondered whether his absence can have been in any way connected with what has happened  how inquired her brother  i dont know how i have only speculated on the coincidence i have not tried to account for it i feel sure he will return when he does dear john let me tell him that i have at last spoken to you and let me bring you together he will certainly help us to a new livelihood his entreaty was that he might do something to smooth my life and yours and i gave him my promise that if we ever wanted a friend i would remember him  then his name was to be no secret harriet said her brother who had listened with close attention describe this gentleman to me i surely ought to know one who knows me so well  his sister painted as vividly as she could the features stature and dress of her visitor but john carker either from having no knowledge of the original or from some fault in her description or from some abstraction of his thoughts as he walked to and fro pondering could not recognise the portrait she presented to him  however it was agreed between them that he should see the original when he next appeared this concluded the sister applied herself with a less anxious breast to her domestic occupations and the greyhaired man late junior of dombeys devoted the first day of his unwonted liberty to working in the garden  it was quite late at night and the brother was reading aloud while the sister plied her needle when they were interrupted by a knocking at the door in the atmosphere of vague anxiety and dread that lowered about them in connexion with their fugitive brother this sound unusual there became almost alarming the brother going to the door the sister sat and listened timidly someone spoke to him and he replied and seemed surprised and after a few words the two approached together  harriet said her brother lighting in their late visitor and speaking in a low voice mr morfinthe gentleman so long in dombeys house with james  his sister started back as if a ghost had entered in the doorway stood the unknown friend with the dark hair sprinkled with grey the ruddy face the broad clear brow and hazel eyes whose secret she had kept so long  john she said halfbreathless it is the gentleman i told you of today  the gentleman miss harriet said the visitor coming infor he had stopped a moment in the doorwayis greatly relieved to hear you say that he has been devising ways and means all the way here of explaining himself and has been satisfied with none mr john i am not quite a stranger here you were stricken with astonishment when you saw me at your door just now i observe you are more astonished at present well thats reasonable enough under existing circumstances if we were not such creatures of habit as we are we shouldnt have reason to be astonished half so often  by this time he had greeted harriet with that able mingling of cordiality and respect which she recollected so well and had sat down near her pulled off his gloves and thrown them into his hat upon the table  theres nothing astonishing he said in my having conceived a desire to see your sister mr john or in my having gratified it in my own way as to the regularity of my visits since which she may have mentioned to you there is nothing extraordinary in that they soon grew into a habit and we are creatures of habitcreatures of habit  putting his hands into his pockets and leaning back in his chair he looked at the brother and sister as if it were interesting to him to see them together and went on to say with a kind of irritable thoughtfulness  its this same habit that confirms some of us who are capable of better things in lucifers own pride and stubbornnessthat confirms and deepens others of us in villainymore of us in indifferencethat hardens us from day to day according to the temper of our clay like images and leaves us as susceptible as images to new impressions and convictions you shall judge of its influence on me john for more years than i need name i had my small and exactly defined share in the management of dombeys house and saw your brother who has proved himself a scoundrel your sister will forgive my being obliged to mention it extending and extending his influence until the business and its owner were his football and saw you toiling at your obscure desk every day and was quite content to be as little troubled as i might be out of my own strip of duty and to let everything about me go on day by day unquestioned like a great machinethat was its habit and mineand to take it all for granted and consider it all right my wednesday nights came regularly round our quartette parties came regularly off my violoncello was in good tune and there was nothing wrong in my worldor if anything not muchor little or much it was no affair of mine  i can answer for your being more respected and beloved during all that time than anybody in the house sir said john carker  pooh goodnatured and easy enough i daresayreturned the other a habit i had it suited the manager it suited the man he managed it suited me best of all i did what was allotted to me to do made no court to either of them and was glad to occupy a station in which none was required so i should have gone on till now but that my room had a thin wall you can tell your sister that it was divided from the managers room by a wainscot partition  they were adjoining rooms had been one perhaps originally and were separated as mr morfin says said her brother looking back to him for the resumption of his explanation  i have whistled hummed tunes gone accurately through the whole of beethovens sonata in b to let him know that i was within hearing said mr morfin but he never heeded me it happened seldom enough that i was within hearing of anything of a private nature certainly but when i was and couldnt otherwise avoid knowing something of it i walked out i walked out once john during a conversation between two brothers to which in the beginning young walter gay was a party but i overheard some of it before i left the room you remember it sufficiently perhaps to tell your sister what its nature was  it referred harriet said her brother in a low voice to the past and to our relative positions in the house  its matter was not new to me but was presented in a new aspect it shook me in my habitthe habit of ninetenths of the worldof believing that all was right about me because i was used to it said their visitor and induced me to recall the history of the two brothers and to ponder on it i think it was almost the first time in my life when i fell into this train of reflectionhow will many things that are familiar and quite matters of course to us now look when we come to see them from that new and distant point of view which we must all take up one day or other i was something less goodnatured as the phrase goes after that morning less easy and complacent altogether  he sat for a minute or so drumming with one hand on the table and resumed in a hurry as if he were anxious to get rid of his confession  before i knew what to do or whether i could do anything there was a second conversation between the same two brothers in which their sister was mentioned i had no scruples of conscience in suffering all the waifs and strays of that conversation to float to me as freely as they would i considered them mine by right after that i came here to see the sister for myself the first time i stopped at the garden gate i made a pretext of inquiring into the character of a poor neighbour but i wandered out of that tract and i think miss harriet mistrusted me the second time i asked leave to come in came in and said what i wished to say your sister showed me reasons which i dared not dispute for receiving no assistance from me then but i established a means of communication between us which remained unbroken until within these few days when i was prevented by important matters that have lately devolved upon me from maintaining them  how little i have suspected this said john carker when i have seen you every day sir if harriet could have guessed your name  why to tell you the truth john interposed the visitor i kept it to myself for two reasons i dont know that the first might have been binding alone but one has no business to take credit for good intentions and i made up my mind at all events not to disclose myself until i should be able to do you some real service or other my second reason was that i always hoped there might be some lingering possibility of your brothers relenting towards you both and in that case i felt that where there was the chance of a man of his suspicious watchful character discovering that you had been secretly befriended by me there was the chance of a new and fatal cause of division i resolved to be sure at the risk of turning his displeasure against myselfwhich would have been no matterto watch my opportunity of serving you with the head of the house but the distractions of death courtship marriage and domestic unhappiness have left us no head but your brother for this long long time and it would have been better for us said the visitor dropping his voice to have been a lifeless trunk  he seemed conscious that these latter words had escaped him against his will and stretching out a hand to the brother and a hand to the sister continued all i could desire to say and more i have now said all i mean goes beyond words as i hope you understand and believe the time has come johnthough most unfortunately and unhappily comewhen i may help you without interfering with that redeeming struggle which has lasted through so many years since you were discharged from it today by no act of your own it is late i need say no more tonight you will guard the treasure you have here without advice or reminder from me  with these words he rose to go  but go you first john he said goodhumouredly with a light without saying what you want to say whatever that maybe john carkers heart was full and he would have relieved it in speech if he could and let me have a word with your sister we have talked alone before and in this room too though it looks more natural with you here  following him out with his eyes he turned kindly to harriet and said in a lower voice and with an altered and graver manner  you wish to ask me something of the man whose sister it is your misfortune to be  i dread to ask said harriet  you have looked so earnestly at me more than once rejoined the visitor that i think i can divine your question has he taken money is it that  yes  he has not  i thank heaven said harriet for the sake of john  that he has abused his trust in many ways said mr morfin that he has oftener dealt and speculated to advantage for himself than for the house he represented that he has led the house on to prodigious ventures often resulting in enormous losses that he has always pampered the vanity and ambition of his employer when it was his duty to have held them in check and shown as it was in his power to do to what they tended here or there will not perhaps surprise you now undertakings have been entered on to swell the reputation of the house for vast resources and to exhibit it in magnificent contrast to other merchants houses of which it requires a steady head to contemplate the possiblya few disastrous changes of affairs might render them the probablyruinous consequences in the midst of the many transactions of the house in most parts of the world a great labyrinth of which only he has held the clue he has had the opportunity and he seems to have used it of keeping the various results afloat when ascertained and substituting estimates and generalities for facts but latterlyyou follow me miss harriet  perfectly perfectly she answered with her frightened face fixed on his pray tell me all the worst at once  latterly he appears to have devoted the greatest pains to making these results so plain and clear that reference to the private books enables one to grasp them numerous and varying as they are with extraordinary ease as if he had resolved to show his employer at one broad view what has been brought upon him by ministration to his ruling passion that it has been his constant practice to minister to that passion basely and to flatter it corruptly is indubitable in that his criminality as it is connected with the affairs of the house chiefly consists  one other word before you leave me dear sir said harriet there is no danger in all this  how danger he returned with a little hesitation  to the credit of the house  i cannot help answering you plainly and trusting you completely said mr morfin after a moments survey of her face  you may indeed you may  i am sure i may danger to the houses credit no none there may be difficulty greater or less difficulty but no danger unlessunless indeedthe head of the house unable to bring his mind to the reduction of its enterprises and positively refusing to believe that it is or can be in any position but the position in which he has always represented it to himself should urge it beyond its strength then it would totter  but there is no apprehension of that said harriet  there shall be no halfconfidence he replied shaking her hand between us mr dombey is unapproachable by anyone and his state of mind is haughty rash unreasonable and ungovernable now but he is disturbed and agitated now beyond all common bounds and it may pass you now know all both worst and best no more tonight and goodnight  with that he kissed her hand and passing out to the door where her brother stood awaiting his coming put him cheerfully aside when he essayed to speak told him that as they would see each other soon and often he might speak at another time if he would but there was no leisure for it then and went away at a round pace in order that no word of gratitude might follow him  the brother and sister sat conversing by the fireside until it was almost day made sleepless by this glimpse of the new world that opened before them and feeling like two people shipwrecked long ago upon a solitary coast to whom a ship had come at last when they were old in resignation and had lost all thought of any other home but another and different kind of disquietude kept them waking too the darkness out of which this light had broken on them gathered around and the shadow of their guilty brother was in the house where his foot had never trod  nor was it to be driven out nor did it fade before the sun next morning it was there at noon at night darkest and most distinct at night as is now to be told  john carker had gone out in pursuance of a letter of appointment from their friend and harriet was left in the house alone she had been alone some hours a dull grave evening and a deepening twilight were not favourable to the removal of the oppression on her spirits the idea of this brother long unseen and unknown flitted about her in frightful shapes he was dead dying calling to her staring at her frowning on her the pictures in her mind were so obtrusive and exact that as the twilight deepened she dreaded to raise her head and look at the dark corners of the room lest his wraith the offspring of her excited imagination should be waiting there to startle her once she had such a fancy of his being in the next room hidingthough she knew quite well what a distempered fancy it was and had no belief in itthat she forced herself to go there for her own conviction but in vain the room resumed its shadowy terrors the moment she left it and she had no more power to divest herself of these vague impressions of dread than if they had been stone giants rooted in the solid earth  it was almost dark and she was sitting near the window with her head upon her hand looking down when sensible of a sudden increase in the gloom of the apartment she raised her eyes and uttered an involuntary cry close to the glass a pale scared face gazed in vacantly for an instant as searching for an object then the eyes rested on herself and lighted up  let me in let me in i want to speak to you and the hand rattled on the glass  she recognised immediately the woman with the long dark hair to whom she had given warmth food and shelter one wet night naturally afraid of her remembering her violent behaviour harriet retreating a little from the window stood undecided and alarmed  let me in let me speak to you i am thankfulquiethumbleanything you like but let me speak to you  the vehement manner of the entreaty the earnest expression of the face the trembling of the two hands that were raised imploringly a certain dread and terror in the voice akin to her own condition at the moment prevailed with harriet she hastened to the door and opened it  may i come in or shall i speak here said the woman catching at her hand  what is it that you want what is it that you have to say  not much but let me say it out or i shall never say it i am tempted now to go away there seem to be hands dragging me from the door let me come in if you can trust me for this once  her energy again prevailed and they passed into the firelight of the little kitchen where she had before sat and ate and dried her clothes  sit there said alice kneeling down beside her and look at me you remember me  i do  you remember what i told you i had been and where i came from ragged and lame with the fierce wind and weather beating on my head  yes  you know how i came back that night and threw your money in the dirt and you and your race now see me here upon my knees am i less earnest now than i was then  if what you ask said harriet gently is forgiveness  but its not returned the other with a proud fierce look what i ask is to be believed now you shall judge if i am worthy of belief both as i was and as i am  still upon her knees and with her eyes upon the fire and the fire shining on her ruined beauty and her wild black hair one long tress of which she pulled over her shoulder and wound about her hand and thoughtfully bit and tore while speaking she went on  when i was young and pretty and this plucking contemptuously at the hair she held was only handled delicately and couldnt be admired enough my mother who had not been very mindful of me as a child found out my merits and was fond of me and proud of me she was covetous and poor and thought to make a sort of property of me no great lady ever thought that of a daughter yet im sure or acted as if she didits never done we all knowand that shows that the only instances of mothers bringing up their daughters wrong and evil coming of it are among such miserable folks as us  looking at the fire as if she were forgetful for the moment of having any auditor she continued in a dreamy way as she wound the long tress of hair tight round and round her hand  what came of that i neednt say wretched marriages dont come of such things in our degree only wretchedness and ruin wretchedness and ruin came on mecame on me  raising her eyes swiftly from their moody gaze upon the fire to harriets face she said  i am wasting time and there is none to spare yet if i hadnt thought of all i shouldnt be here now wretchedness and ruin came on me i say i was made a shortlived toy and flung aside more cruelly and carelessly than even such things are by whose hand do you think  why do you ask me said harriet  why do you tremble rejoined alice with an eager look his usage made a devil of me i sunk in wretchedness and ruin lower and lower yet i was concerned in a robberyin every part of it but the gainsand was found out and sent to be tried without a friend without a penny though i was but a girl i would have gone to death sooner than ask him for a word if a word of his could have saved me i would to any death that could have been invented but my mother covetous always sent to him in my name told the true story of my case and humbly prayed and petitioned for a small last giftfor not so many pounds as i have fingers on this hand who was it do you think who snapped his fingers at me in my misery lying as he believed at his feet and left me without even this poor sign of remembrance well satisfied that i should be sent abroad beyond the reach of farther trouble to him and should die and rot there who was this do you think  why do you ask me repeated harriet  why do you tremble said alice laying her hand upon her arm and looking in her face but that the answer is on your lips it was your brother james  harriet trembled more and more but did not avert her eyes from the eager look that rested on them  when i knew you were his sisterwhich was on that nighti came back weary and lame to spurn your gift i felt that night as if i could have travelled weary and lame over the whole world to stab him if i could have found him in a lonely place with no one near do you believe that i was earnest in all that  i do good heaven why are you come again  since then said alice with the same grasp of her arm and the same look in her face i have seen him i have followed him with my eyes in the broad day if any spark of my resentment slumbered in my bosom it sprung into a blaze when my eyes rested on him you know he has wronged a proud man and made him his deadly enemy what if i had given information of him to that man  information repeated harriet  what if i had found out one who knew your brothers secret who knew the manner of his flight who knew where he and the companion of his flight were gone what if i had made him utter all his knowledge word by word before his enemy concealed to hear it what if i had sat by at the time looking into this enemys face and seeing it change till it was scarcely human what if i had seen him rush away mad in pursuit what if i knew now that he was on his road more fiend than man and must in so many hours come up with him  remove your hand said harriet recoiling go away your touch is dreadful to me  i have done this pursued the other with her eager look regardless of the interruption do i speak and look as if i really had do you believe what i am saying  i fear i must let my arm go  not yet a moment more you can think what my revengeful purpose must have been to last so long and urge me to do this  dreadful said harriet  then when you see me now said alice hoarsely here again kneeling quietly on the ground with my touch upon your arm with my eyes upon your face you may believe that there is no common earnestness in what i say and that no common struggle has been battling in my breast i am ashamed to speak the words but i relent i despise myself i have fought with myself all day and all last night but i relent towards him without reason and wish to repair what i have done if it is possible i wouldnt have them come together while his pursuer is so blind and headlong if you had seen him as he went out last night you would know the danger better  how can it be prevented what can i do cried harriet  all night long pursued the other hurriedly i had dreams of himand yet i didnt sleepin his blood all day i have had him near me  what can i do cried harriet shuddering at these words  if there is anyone wholl write or send or go to him let them lose no time he is at dijon do you know the name and where it is  yes  warn him that the man he has made his enemy is in a frenzy and that he doesnt know him if he makes light of his approach tell him that he is on the roadi know he isand hurrying on urge him to get away while there is timeif there is timeand not to meet him yet a month or so will make years of difference let them not encounter through me anywhere but there any time but now let his foe follow him and find him for himself but not through me there is enough upon my head without  the fire ceased to be reflected in her jet black hair uplifted face and eager eyes her hand was gone from harriets arm and the place where she had been was empty    chapter 54 the fugitives   teatime an hour short of midnight the place a french apartment comprising some halfdozen roomsa dull cold hall or corridor a diningroom a drawingroom a bedroom and an inner drawingroom or boudoir smaller and more retired than the rest all these shut in by one large pair of doors on the main staircase but each room provided with two or three pairs of doors of its own establishing several means of communication with the remaining portion of the apartment or with certain small passages within the wall leading as is not unusual in such houses to some back stairs with an obscure outlet below the whole situated on the first floor of so large an hotel that it did not absorb one entire row of windows upon one side of the square courtyard in the centre upon which the whole four sides of the mansion looked  an air of splendour sufficiently faded to be melancholy and sufficiently dazzling to clog and embarrass the details of life with a show of state reigned in these rooms the walls and ceilings were gilded and painted the floors were waxed and polished crimson drapery hung in festoons from window door and mirror and candelabra gnarled and intertwisted like the branches of trees or horns of animals stuck out from the panels of the wall but in the daytime when the latticeblinds now closely shut were opened and the light let in traces were discernible among this finery of wear and tear and dust of sun and damp and smoke and lengthened intervals of want of use and habitation when such shows and toys of life seem sensitive like life and waste as men shut up in prison do even night and clusters of burning candles could not wholly efface them though the general glitter threw them in the shade  the glitter of bright tapers and their reflection in lookingglasses scraps of gilding and gay colours were confined on this night to one roomthat smaller room within the rest just now enumerated seen from the hall where a lamp was feebly burning through the dark perspective of open doors it looked as shining and precious as a gem in the heart of its radiance sat a beautiful womanedith  she was alone the same defiant scornful woman still the cheek a little worn the eye a little larger in appearance and more lustrous but the haughty bearing just the same no shame upon her brow no late repentance bending her disdainful neck imperious and stately yet and yet regardless of herself and of all else she sat with her dark eyes cast down waiting for someone  no book no work no occupation of any kind but her own thought beguiled the tardy time some purpose strong enough to fill up any pause possessed her with her lips pressed together and quivering if for a moment she released them from her control with her nostril inflated her hands clasped in one another and her purpose swelling in her breast she sat and waited  at the sound of a key in the outer door and a footstep in the hall she started up and cried whos that the answer was in french and two men came in with jingling trays to make preparation for supper  who had bade them to do so she asked  monsieur had commanded it when it was his pleasure to take the apartment monsieur had said when he stayed there for an hour en route and left the letter for madamemadame had received it surely  yes  a thousand pardons the sudden apprehension that it might have been forgotten had struck him a bald man with a large beard from a neighbouring restaurant with despair monsieur had said that supper was to be ready at that hour also that he had forewarned madame of the commands he had given in his letter monsieur had done the golden head the honour to request that the supper should be choice and delicate monsieur would find that his confidence in the golden head was not misplaced  edith said no more but looked on thoughtfully while they prepared the table for two persons and set the wine upon it she arose before they had finished and taking a lamp passed into the bedchamber and into the drawingroom where she hurriedly but narrowly examined all the doors particularly one in the former room that opened on the passage in the wall from this she took the key and put it on the outer side she then came back  the menthe second of whom was a dark bilious subject in a jacket close shaved and with a black head of hair close croppedhad completed their preparation of the table and were standing looking at it he who had spoken before inquired whether madame thought it would be long before monsieur arrived  she couldnt say it was all one  pardon there was the supper it should be eaten on the instant monsieur who spoke french like an angelor a frenchmanit was all the same had spoken with great emphasis of his punctuality but the english nation had so grand a genius for punctuality ah what noise great heaven here was monsieur behold him  in effect monsieur admitted by the other of the two came with his gleaming teeth through the dark rooms like a mouth and arriving in that sanctuary of light and colour a figure at full length embraced madame and addressed her in the french tongue as his charming wife  my god madame is going to faint madame is overcome with joy the bald man with the beard observed it and cried out  madame had only shrunk and shivered before the words were spoken she was standing with her hand upon the velvet back of a great chair her figure drawn up to its full height and her face immoveable  francois has flown over to the golden head for supper he flies on these occasions like an angel or a bird the baggage of monsieur is in his room all is arranged the supper will be here this moment these facts the bald man notified with bows and smiles and presently the supper came  the hot dishes were on a chafingdish the cold already set forth with the change of service on a sideboard monsieur was satisfied with this arrangement the supper table being small it pleased him very well let them set the chafingdish upon the floor and go he would remove the dishes with his own hands  pardon said the bald man politely it was impossible  monsieur was of another opinion he required no further attendance that night  but madame the bald man hinted  madame replied monsieur had her own maid it was enough  a million pardons no madame had no maid  i came here alone said edith it was my choice to do so i am well used to travelling i want no attendance they need send nobody to me  monsieur accordingly persevering in his first proposed impossibility proceeded to follow the two attendants to the outer door and secure it after them for the night the bald man turning round to bow as he went out observed that madame still stood with her hand upon the velvet back of the great chair and that her face was quite regardless of him though she was looking straight before her  as the sound of carkers fastening the door resounded through the intermediate rooms and seemed to come hushed and stilled into that last distant one the sound of the cathedral clock striking twelve mingled with it in ediths ears she heard him pause as if he heard it too and listened and then came back towards her laying a long train of footsteps through the silence and shutting all the doors behind him as he came along her hand for a moment left the velvet chair to bring a knife within her reach upon the table then she stood as she had stood before  how strange to come here by yourself my love he said as he entered  what she returned  her tone was so harsh the quick turn of her head so fierce her attitude so repellent and her frown so black that he stood with the lamp in his hand looking at her as if she had struck him motionless  i say he at length repeated putting down the lamp and smiling his most courtly smile how strange to come here alone it was unnecessarty caution surely and might have defeated itself you were to have engaged an attendant at havre or rouen and have had abundance of time for the purpose though you had been the most capricious and difficult as you are the most beautiful my love of women  her eyes gleamed strangely on him but she stood with her hand resting on the chair and said not a word  i have never resumed carker seen you look so handsome as you do tonight even the picture i have carried in my mind during this cruel probation and which i have contemplated night and day is exceeded by the reality  not a word not a look her eyes completely hidden by their drooping lashes but her head held up  hard unrelenting terms they were said carker with a smile but they are all fulfilled and passed and make the present more delicious and more safe sicily shall be the place of our retreat in the idlest and easiest part of the world my soul well both seek compensation for old slavery  he was coming gaily towards her when in an instant she caught the knife up from the table and started one pace back  stand still she said or i shall murder you  the sudden change in her the towering fury and intense abhorrence sparkling in her eyes and lighting up her brow made him stop as if a fire had stopped him  stand still she said come no nearer me upon your life  they both stood looking at each other rage and astonishment were in his face but he controlled them and said lightly  come come tush we are alone and out of everybodys sight and hearing do you think to frighten me with these tricks of virtue  do you think to frighten me she answered fiercely from any purpose that i have and any course i am resolved upon by reminding me of the solitude of this place and there being no help near me who am here alone designedly if i feared you should i not have avoided you if i feared you should i be here in the dead of night telling you to your face what i am going to tell  and what is that he said you handsome shrew handsomer so than any other woman in her best humour  i tell you nothing she returned until you go back to that chairexcept this once againdont come near me not a step nearer i tell you if you do as heaven sees us i shall murder you  do you mistake me for your husband he retorted with a grin  disdaining to reply she stretched her arm out pointing to the chair he bit his lip frowned laughed and sat down in it with a baffled irresolute impatient air he was unable to conceal and biting his nail nervously and looking at her sideways with bitter discomfiture even while he feigned to be amused by her caprice  she put the knife down upon the table and touching her bosom with her hand said  i have something lying here that is no love trinket and sooner than endure your touch once more i would use it on youand you know it while i speakwith less reluctance than i would on any other creeping thing that lives  he affected to laugh jestingly and entreated her to act her play out quickly for the supper was growing cold but the secret look with which he regarded her was more sullen and lowering and he struck his foot once upon the floor with a muttered oath  how many times said edith bending her darkest glance upon him has your bold knavery assailed me with outrage and insult how many times in your smooth manner and mocking words and looks have i been twitted with my courtship and my marriage how many times have you laid bare my wound of love for that sweet injured girl and lacerated it how often have you fanned the fire on which for two years i have writhed and tempted me to take a desperate revenge when it has most tortured me  i have no doubt maam he replied that you have kept a good account and that its pretty accurate come edith to your husband poor wretch this was well enough  why if she said surveying him with a haughty contempt and disgust that he shrunk under let him brave it as he would if all my other reasons for despising him could have been blown away like feathers his having you for his counsellor and favourite would have almost been enough to hold their place  is that a reason why you have run away with me he asked her tauntingly  yes and why we are face to face for the last time wretch we meet tonight and part tonight for not one moment after i have ceased to speak will i stay here  he turned upon her with his ugliest look and gripped the table with his hand but neither rose nor otherwise answered or threatened her  i am a woman she said confronting him steadfastly who from her childhood has been shamed and steeled i have been offered and rejected put up and appraised until my very soul has sickened i have not had an accomplishment or grace that might have been a resource to me but it has been paraded and vended to enhance my value as if the common crier had called it through the streets my poor proud friends have looked on and approved and every tie between us has been deadened in my breast there is not one of them for whom i care as i could care for a pet dog i stand alone in the world remembering well what a hollow world it has been to me and what a hollow part of it i have been myself you know this and you know that my fame with it is worthless to me  yes i imagined that he said  and calculated on it she rejoined and so pursued me grown too indifferent for any opposition but indifference to the daily working of the hands that had moulded me to this and knowing that my marriage would at least prevent their hawking of me up and down i suffered myself to be sold as infamously as any woman with a halter round her neck is sold in any marketplace you know that  yes he said showing all his teeth i know that  and calculated on it she rejoined once more and so pursued me from my marriage day i found myself exposed to such new shameto such solicitation and pursuit expressed as clearly as if it had been written in the coarsest words and thrust into my hand at every turn from one mean villain that i felt as if i had never known humiliation till that time this shame my husband fixed upon me hemmed me round with himself steeped me in with his own hands and of his own act repeated hundreds of times and thusforced by the two from every point of rest i hadforced by the two to yield up the last retreat of love and gentleness within me or to be a new misfortune on its innocent objectdriven from each to each and beset by one when i escaped the othermy anger rose almost to distraction against both i do not know against which it rose higherthe master or the man  he watched her closely as she stood before him in the very triumph of her indignant beauty she was resolute he saw undauntable with no more fear of him than of a worm  what should i say of honour or of chastity to you she went on what meaning would it have to you what meaning would it have from me but if i tell you that the lightest touch of your hand makes my blood cold with antipathy that from the hour when i first saw and hated you to now when my instinctive repugnance is enhanced by every minutes knowledge of you i have since had you have been a loathsome creature to me which has not its like on earth how then  he answered with a faint laugh ay how then my queen  on that night when emboldened by the scene you had assisted at you dared come to my room and speak to me she said what passed  he shrugged his shoulders and laughed  what passed she said  your memory is so distinct he said that i have no doubt you can recall it  i can she said hear it proposing then this flightnot this flight but the flight you thought ityou told me that in the having given you that meeting and leaving you to be discovered there if you so thought fit and in the having suffered you to be alone with me many times beforeand having made the opportunities you saidand in the having openly avowed to you that i had no feeling for my husband but aversion and no care for myselfi was lost i had given you the power to traduce my name and i lived in virtuous reputation at the pleasure of your breath  all stratagems in love he interrupted smiling the old adage  on that night said edith and then the struggle that i long had had with something that was not respect for my good famethat was i know not whatperhaps the clinging to that last retreatwas ended on that night and then i turned from everything but passion and resentment i struck a blow that laid your lofty master in the dust and set you there before me looking at me now and knowing what i mean  he sprung up from his chair with a great oath she put her hand into her bosom and not a finger trembled not a hair upon her head was stirred he stood still she too the table and chair between them  when i forget that this man put his lips to mine that night and held me in his arms as he has done again tonight said edith pointing at him when i forget the taint of his kiss upon my cheekthe cheek that florence would have laid her guiltless face againstwhen i forget my meeting with her while that taint was hot upon me and in what a flood the knowledge rushed upon me when i saw her that in releasing her from the persecution i had caused by my love i brought a shame and degradation on her name through mine and in all time to come should be the solitary figure representing in her mind her first avoidance of a guilty creaturethen husband from whom i stand divorced henceforth i will forget these last two years and undo what i have done and undeceive you  her flashing eyes uplifted for a moment lighted again on carker and she held some letters out in her left hand  see these she said contemptuously you have addressed these to me in the false name you go by one here some elsewhere on my road the seals are unbroken take them back  she crunched them in her hand and tossed them to his feet and as she looked upon him now a smile was on her face  we meet and part tonight she said you have fallen on sicilian days and sensual rest too soon you might have cajoled and fawned and played your traitors part a little longer and grown richer you purchase your voluptuous retirement dear  edith he retorted menacing her with his hand sit down have done with this what devil possesses you  their name is legion she replied uprearing her proud form as if she would have crushed him you and your master have raised them in a fruitful house and they shall tear you both false to him false to his innocent child false every way and everywhere go forth and boast of me and gnash your teeth for once to know that you are lying  he stood before her muttering and menacing and scowling round as if for something that would help him to conquer her but with the same indomitable spirit she opposed him without faltering  in every vaunt you make she said i have my triumph i single out in you the meanest man i know the parasite and tool of the proud tyrant that his wound may go the deeper and may rankle more boast and revenge me on him you know how you came here tonight you know how you stand cowering there you see yourself in colours quite as despicable if not as odious as those in which i see you boast then and revenge me on yourself  the foam was on his lips the wet stood on his forehead if she would have faltered once for only one halfmoment he would have pinioned her but she was as firm as rock and her searching eyes never left him  we dont part so he said do you think i am drivelling to let you go in your mad temper  do you think she answered that i am to be stayed  ill try my dear he said with a ferocious gesture of his head  gods mercy on you if you try by coming near me she replied  and what he said if there are none of these same boasts and vaunts on my part what if i were to turn too come and his teeth fairly shone again we must make a treaty of this or i may take some unexpected course sit down sit down  too late she cried with eyes that seemed to sparkle fire i have thrown my fame and good name to the winds i have resolved to bear the shame that will attach to meresolved to know that it attaches falselythat you know it tooand that he does not never can and never shall ill die and make no sign for this i am here alone with you at the dead of night for this i have met you here in a false name as your wife for this i have been seen here by those men and left here nothing can save you now  he would have sold his soul to root her in her beauty to the floor and make her arms drop at her sides and have her at his mercy but he could not look at her and not be afraid of her he saw a strength within her that was resistless he saw that she was desperate and that her unquenchable hatred of him would stop at nothing his eyes followed the hand that was put with such rugged uncongenial purpose into her white bosom and he thought that if it struck at him and failed it would strike there just as soon  he did not venture therefore to advance towards her but the door by which he had entered was behind him and he stepped back to lock it  lastly take my warning look to yourself she said and smiled again you have been betrayed as all betrayers are it has been made known that you are in this place or were to be or have been if i live i saw my husband in a carriage in the street tonight  strumpet its false cried carker  at the moment the bell rang loudly in the hall he turned white as she held her hand up like an enchantress at whose invocation the sound had come  hark do you hear it  he set his back against the door for he saw a change in her and fancied she was coming on to pass him but in a moment she was gone through the opposite doors communicating with the bedchamber and they shut upon her  once turned once changed in her inflexible unyielding look he felt that he could cope with her he thought a sudden terror occasioned by this nightalarm had subdued her not the less readily for her overwrought condition throwing open the doors he followed almost instantly  but the room was dark and as she made no answer to his call he was fain to go back for the lamp he held it up and looked round everywhere expecting to see her crouching in some corner but the room was empty so into the drawingroom and diningroom he went in succession with the uncertain steps of a man in a strange place looking fearfully about and prying behind screens and couches but she was not there no nor in the hall which was so bare that he could see that at a glance  all this time the ringing at the bell was constantly renewed and those without were beating at the door he put his lamp down at a distance and going near it listened there were several voices talking together at least two of them in english and though the door was thick and there was great confusion he knew one of these too well to doubt whose voice it was  he took up his lamp again and came back quickly through all the rooms stopping as he quitted each and looking round for her with the light raised above his head he was standing thus in the bedchamber when the door leading to the little passage in the wall caught his eye he went to it and found it fastened on the other side but she had dropped a veil in going through and shut it in the door  all this time the people on the stairs were ringing at the bell and knocking with their hands and feet  he was not a coward but these sounds what had gone before the strangeness of the place which had confused him even in his return from the hall the frustration of his schemes for strange to say he would have been much bolder if they had succeeded the unseasonable time the recollection of having no one near to whom he could appeal for any friendly office above all the sudden sense which made even his heart beat like lead that the man whose confidence he had outraged and whom he had so treacherously deceived was there to recognise and challenge him with his mask plucked off his face struck a panic through him he tried the door in which the veil was shut but couldnt force it he opened one of the windows and looked down through the lattice of the blind into the courtyard but it was a high leap and the stones were pitiless  the ringing and knocking still continuinghis panic toohe went back to the door in the bedchamber and with some new efforts each more stubborn than the last wrenched it open seeing the little staircase not far off and feeling the nightair coming up he stole back for his hat and coat made the door as secure after him as he could crept down lamp in hand extinguished it on seeing the street and having put it in a corner went out where the stars were shining    chapter 55 rob the grinder loses his place   the porter at the iron gate which shut the courtyard from the street had left the little wicket of his house open and was gone away no doubt to mingle in the distant noise at the door of the great staircase lifting the latch softly carker crept out and shutting the jangling gate after him with as little noise as possible hurried off  in the fever of his mortification and unavailing rage the panic that had seized upon him mastered him completely it rose to such a height that he would have blindly encountered almost any risk rather than meet the man of whom two hours ago he had been utterly regardless his fierce arrival which he had never expected the sound of his voice their having been so near a meeting face to face he would have braved out this after the first momentary shock of alarm and would have put as bold a front upon his guilt as any villain but the springing of his mine upon himself seemed to have rent and shivered all his hardihood and selfreliance spurned like any reptile entrapped and mocked turned upon and trodden down by the proud woman whose mind he had slowly poisoned as he thought until she had sunk into the mere creature of his pleasure undeceived in his deceit and with his foxs hide stripped off he sneaked away abashed degraded and afraid  some other terror came upon him quite removed from this of being pursued suddenly like an electric shock as he was creeping through the streets some visionary terror unintelligible and inexplicable asssociated with a trembling of the grounda rush and sweep of something through the air like death upon the wing he shrunk as if to let the thing go by it was not gone it never had been there yet what a startling horror it had left behind  he raised his wicked face so full of trouble to the night sky where the stars so full of peace were shining on him as they had been when he first stole out into the air and stopped to think what he should do the dread of being hunted in a strange remote place where the laws might not protect himthe novelty of the feeling that it was strange and remote originating in his being left alone so suddenly amid the ruins of his planshis greater dread of seeking refuge now in italy or in sicily where men might be hired to assissinate him he thought at any dark street cornerthe waywardness of guilt and fearperhaps some sympathy of action with the turning back of all his schemesimpelled him to turn back too and go to england  i am safer there in any case if i should not decide he thought to give this fool a meeting i am less likely to be traced there than abroad here now and if i should this cursed fit being over at least i shall not be alone with out a soul to speak to or advise with or stand by me i shall not be run in upon and worried like a rat  he muttered ediths name and clenched his hand as he crept along in the shadow of the massive buildings he set his teeth and muttered dreadful imprecations on her head and looked from side to side as if in search of her thus he stole on to the gate of an innyard the people were abed but his ringing at the bell soon produced a man with a lantern in company with whom he was presently in a dim coachhouse bargaining for the hire of an old phaeton to paris  the bargain was a short one and the horses were soon sent for leaving word that the carriage was to follow him when they came he stole away again beyond the town past the old ramparts out on the open road which seemed to glide away along the dark plain like a stream  whither did it flow what was the end of it as he paused with some such suggestion within him looking over the gloomy flat where the slender trees marked out the way again that flight of death came rushing up again went on impetuous and resistless again was nothing but a horror in his mind dark as the scene and undefined as its remotest verge  there was no wind there was no passing shadow on the deep shade of the night there was no noise the city lay behind him lighted here and there and starry worlds were hidden by the masonry of spire and roof that hardly made out any shapes against the sky dark and lonely distance lay around him everywhere and the clocks were faintly striking two  he went forward for what appeared a long time and a long way often stopping to listen at last the ringing of horses bells greeted his anxious ears now softer and now louder now inaudible now ringing very slowly over bad ground now brisk and merry it came on until with a loud shouting and lashing a shadowy postillion muffled to the eyes checked his four struggling horses at his side  who goes there monsieur  yes  monsieur has walked a long way in the dark midnight  no matter everyone to his task were there any other horses ordered at the posthouse  a thousand devilsand pardons other horses at this hour no  listen my friend i am much hurried let us see how fast we can travel the faster the more money there will be to drink off we go then quick  halloa whoop halloa hi away at a gallop over the black landscape scattering the dust and dirt like spray  the clatter and commotion echoed to the hurry and discordance of the fugitives ideas nothing clear without and nothing clear within objects flitting past merging into one another dimly descried confusedly lost sight of gone beyond the changing scraps of fence and cottage immediately upon the road a lowering waste beyond the shifting images that rose up in his mind and vanished as they showed themselves a black expanse of dread and rage and baffled villainy occasionally a sigh of mountain air came from the distant jura fading along the plain sometimes that rush which was so furious and horrible again came sweeping through his fancy passed away and left a chill upon his blood  the lamps gleaming on the medley of horses heads jumbled with the shadowy driver and the fluttering of his cloak made a thousand indistinct shapes answering to his thoughts shadows of familiar people stooping at their desks and books in their remembered attitudes strange apparitions of the man whom he was flying from or of edith repetitions in the ringing bells and rolling wheels of words that had been spoken confusions of time and place making last night a month ago a month ago last nighthome now distant beyond hope now instantly accessible commotion discord hurry darkness and confusion in his mind and all around himhallo hi away at a gallop over the black landscape dust and dirt flying like spray the smoking horses snorting and plunging as if each of them were ridden by a demon away in a frantic triumph on the dark roadwhither  again the nameless shock comes speeding up and as it passes the bells ring in his ears whither the wheels roar in his ears whither all the noise and rattle shapes itself into that cry the lights and shadows dance upon the horses heads like imps no stopping now no slackening on on away with him upon the dark road wildly  he could not think to any purpose he could not separate one subject of reflection from another sufficiently to dwell upon it by itself for a minute at a time the crash of his project for the gaining of a voluptuous compensation for past restraint the overthrow of his treachery to one who had been true and generous to him but whose least proud word and look he had treasured up at interest for yearsfor false and subtle men will always secretly despise and dislike the object upon which they fawn and always resent the payment and receipt of homage that they know to be worthless these were the themes uppermost in his mind a lurking rage against the woman who had so entrapped him and avenged herself was always there crude and misshapen schemes of retaliation upon her floated in his brain but nothing was distinct a hurry and contradiction pervaded all his thoughts even while he was so busy with this fevered ineffectual thinking his one constant idea was that he would postpone reflection until some indefinite time  then the old days before the second marriage rose up in his remembrance he thought how jealous he had been of the boy how jealous he had been of the girl how artfully he had kept intruders at a distance and drawn a circle round his dupe that none but himself should cross and then he thought had he done all this to be flying now like a scared thief from only the poor dupe  he could have laid hands upon himself for his cowardice but it was the very shadow of his defeat and could not be separated from it to have his confidence in his own knavery so shattered at a blowto be within his own knowledge such a miserable toolwas like being paralysed with an impotent ferocity he raged at edith and hated mr dombey and hated himself but still he fled and could do nothing else  again and again he listened for the sound of wheels behind again and again his fancy heard it coming on louder and louder at last he was so persuaded of this that he cried out stop preferring even the loss of ground to such uncertainty  the word soon brought carriage horses driver all in a heap together across the road  the devil cried the driver looking over his shoulder whats the matter  hark whats that  what  that noise  ah heaven be quiet cursed brigand to a horse who shook his bells what noise  behind is it not another carriage at a gallop there whats that miscreant with a pigs head stand still to another horse who bit another who frightened the other two who plunged and backed there is nothing coming  nothing  no nothing but the day yonder  you are right i think i hear nothing now indeed go on  the entangled equipage half hidden in the reeking cloud from the horses goes on slowly at first for the driver checked unnecessarily in his progress sulkily takes out a pocketknife and puts a new lash to his whip then hallo whoop hallo hi away once more savagely  and now the stars faded and the day glimmered and standing in the carriage looking back he could discern the track by which he had come and see that there was no traveller within view on all the heavy expanse and soon it was broad day and the sun began to shine on cornfields and vineyards and solitary labourers risen from little temporary huts by heaps of stones upon the road were here and there at work repairing the highway or eating bread by and by there were peasants going to their daily labour or to market or lounging at the doors of poor cottages gazing idly at him as he passed and then there was a postyard ankledeep in mud with steaming dunghills and vast outhouses half ruined and looking on this dainty prospect an immense old shadeless glaring stone chateau with half its windows blinded and green damp crawling lazily over it from the balustraded terrace to the taper tips of the extinguishers upon the turrets  gathered up moodily in a corner of the carriage and only intent on going fastexcept when he stood up for a mile together and looked back which he would do whenever there was a piece of open countryhe went on still postponing thought indefinitely and still always tormented with thinking to no purpose  shame disappointment and discomfiture gnawed at his heart a constant apprehension of being overtaken or metfor he was groundlessly afraid even of travellers who came towards him by the way he was goingoppressed him heavily the same intolerable awe and dread that had come upon him in the night returned unweakened in the day the monotonous ringing of the bells and tramping of the horses the monotony of his anxiety and useless rage the monotonous wheel of fear regret and passion he kept turning round and round made the journey like a vision in which nothing was quite real but his own torment  it was a vision of long roads that stretched away to an horizon always receding and never gained of illpaved towns up hill and down where faces came to dark doors and illglazed windows and where rows of mudbespattered cows and oxen were tied up for sale in the long narrow streets butting and lowing and receiving blows on their blunt heads from bludgeons that might have beaten them in of bridges crosses churches postyards new horses being put in against their wills and the horses of the last stage reeking panting and laying their drooping heads together dolefully at stable doors of little cemeteries with black crosses settled sideways in the graves and withered wreaths upon them dropping away again of long long roads dragging themselves out up hill and down to the treacherous horizon  of morning noon and sunset night and the rising of an early moon of long roads temporarily left behind and a rough pavement reached of battering and clattering over it and looking up among houseroofs at a great churchtower of getting out and eating hastily and drinking draughts of wine that had no cheering influence of coming forth afoot among a host of beggarsblind men with quivering eyelids led by old women holding candles to their faces idiot girls the lame the epileptic and the palsiedof passing through the clamour and looking from his seat at the upturned countenances and outstretched hands with a hurried dread of recognising some pursuer pressing forwardof galloping away again upon the long long road gathered up dull and stunned in his corner or rising to see where the moon shone faintly on a patch of the same endless road miles away or looking back to see who followed  of never sleeping but sometimes dozing with unclosed eyes and springing up with a start and a reply aloud to an imaginary voice of cursing himself for being there for having fled for having let her go for not having confronted and defied him of having a deadly quarrel with the whole world but chiefly with himself of blighting everything with his black mood as he was carried on and away  it was a fevered vision of things past and present all confounded together of his life and journey blended into one of being madly hurried somewhere whither he must go of old scenes starting up among the novelties through which he travelled of musing and brooding over what was past and distant and seeming to take no notice of the actual objects he encountered but with a wearisome exhausting consciousness of being bewildered by them and having their images all crowded in his hot brain after they were gone  a vision of change upon change and still the same monotony of bells and wheels and horses feet and no rest of town and country postyards horses drivers hill and valley light and darkness road and pavement height and hollow wet weather and dry and still the same monotony of bells and wheels and horses feet and no rest a vision of tending on at last towards the distant capital by busier roads and sweeping round by old cathedrals and dashing through small towns and villages less thinly scattered on the road than formerly and sitting shrouded in his corner with his cloak up to his face as people passing by looked at him  of rolling on and on always postponing thought and always racked with thinking of being unable to reckon up the hours he had been upon the road or to comprehend the points of time and place in his journey of being parched and giddy and half mad of pressing on in spite of all as if he could not stop and coming into paris where the turbid river held its swift course undisturbed between two brawling streams of life and motion  a troubled vision then of bridges quays interminable streets of wineshops watercarriers great crowds of people soldiers coaches military drums arcades of the monotony of bells and wheels and horses feet being at length lost in the universal din and uproar of the gradual subsidence of that noise as he passed out in another carriage by a different barrier from that by which he had entered of the restoration as he travelled on towards the seacoast of the monotony of bells and wheels and horses feet and no rest  of sunset once again and nightfall of long roads again and dead of night and feeble lights in windows by the roadside and still the old monotony of bells and wheels and horses feet and no rest of dawn and daybreak and the rising of the sun of tolling slowly up a hill and feeling on its top the fresh seabreeze and seeing the morning light upon the edges of the distant waves of coming down into a harbour when the tide was at its full and seeing fishingboats float on and glad women and children waiting for them of nets and seamens clothes spread out to dry upon the shore of busy sailors and their voices high among ships masts and rigging of the buoyancy and brightness of the water and the universal sparkling  of receding from the coast and looking back upon it from the deck when it was a haze upon the water with here and there a little opening of bright land where the sun struck of the swell and flash and murmur of the calm sea of another grey line on the ocean on the vessels track fast growing clearer and higher of cliffs and buildings and a windmill and a church becoming more and more visible upon it of steaming on at last into smooth water and mooring to a pier whence groups of people looked down greeting friends on board of disembarking passing among them quickly shunning every one and of being at last again in england  he had thought in his dream of going down into a remote countryplace he knew and lying quiet there while he secretly informed himself of what transpired and determined how to act still in the same stunned condition he remembered a certain station on the railway where he would have to branch off to his place of destination and where there was a quiet inn here he indistinctly resolved to tarry and rest  with this purpose he slunk into a railway carriage as quickly as he could and lying there wrapped in his cloak as if he were asleep was soon borne far away from the sea and deep into the inland green arrived at his destination he looked out and surveyed it carefully he was not mistaken in his impression of the place it was a retired spot on the borders of a little wood only one house newlybuilt or altered for the purpose stood there surrounded by its neat garden the small town that was nearest was some miles away here he alighted then and going straight into the tavern unobserved by anyone secured two rooms upstairs communicating with each other and sufficiently retired  his object was to rest and recover the command of himself and the balance of his mind imbecile discomfiture and rageso that as he walked about his room he ground his teethhad complete possession of him his thoughts not to be stopped or directed still wandered where they would and dragged him after them he was stupefied and he was wearied to death  but as if there were a curse upon him that he should never rest again his drowsy senses would not lose their consciousness he had no more influence with them in this regard than if they had been another mans it was not that they forced him to take note of present sounds and objects but that they would not be diverted from the whole hurried vision of his journey it was constantly before him all at once she stood there with her dark disdainful eyes again upon him and he was riding on nevertheless through town and country light and darkness wet weather and dry over road and pavement hill and valley height and hollow jaded and scared by the monotony of bells and wheels and horses feet and no rest  what day is this he asked of the waiter who was making preparations for his dinner  day sir  is it wednesday  wednesday sir no sir thursday sir  i forgot how goes the time my watch is unwound  wants a few minutes of five oclock sir been travelling a long time sir perhaps  yes  by rail sir  yes  very confusing sir not much in the habit of travelling by rail myself sir but gentlemen frequently say so  do many gentlemen come here  pretty well sir in general nobody here at present rather slack just now sir everything is slack sir  he made no answer but had risen into a sitting posture on the sofa where he had been lying and leaned forward with an arm on each knee staring at the ground he could not master his own attention for a minute together it rushed away where it would but it never for an instant lost itself in sleep  he drank a quantity of wine after dinner in vain no such artificial means would bring sleep to his eyes his thoughts more incoherent dragged him more unmercifully after themas if a wretch condemned to such expiation were drawn at the heels of wild horses no oblivion and no rest  how long he sat drinking and brooding and being dragged in imagination hither and thither no one could have told less correctly than he but he knew that he had been sitting a long time by candlelight when he started up and listened in a sudden terror  for now indeed it was no fancy the ground shook the house rattled the fierce impetuous rush was in the air he felt it come up and go darting by and even when he had hurried to the window and saw what it was he stood shrinking from it as if it were not safe to look  a curse upon the fiery devil thundering along so smoothly tracked through the distant valley by a glare of light and lurid smoke and gone he felt as if he had been plucked out of its path and saved from being torn asunder it made him shrink and shudder even now when its faintest hum was hushed and when the lines of iron road he could trace in the moonlight running to a point were as empty and as silent as a desert  unable to rest and irresistibly attractedor he thought soto this road he went out and lounged on the brink of it marking the way the train had gone by the yet smoking cinders that were lying in its track after a lounge of some half hour in the direction by which it had disappeared he turned and walked the other waystill keeping to the brink of the roadpast the inn garden and a long way down looking curiously at the bridges signals lamps and wondering when another devil would come by  a trembling of the ground and quick vibration in his ears a distant shriek a dull light advancing quickly changed to two red eyes and a fierce fire dropping glowing coals an irresistible bearing on of a great roaring and dilating mass a high wind and a rattleanother come and gone and he holding to a gate as if to save himself  he waited for another and for another he walked back to his former point and back again to that and still through the wearisome vision of his journey looked for these approaching monsters he loitered about the station waiting until one should stay to call there and when one did and was detached for water he stood parallel with it watching its heavy wheels and brazen front and thinking what a cruel power and might it had ugh to see the great wheels slowly turning and to think of being run down and crushed  disordered with wine and want of restthat want which nothing although he was so weary would appeasethese ideas and objects assumed a diseased importance in his thoughts when he went back to his room which was not until near midnight they still haunted him and he sat listening for the coming of another  so in his bed whither he repaired with no hope of sleep he still lay listening and when he felt the trembling and vibration got up and went to the window to watch as he could from its position the dull light changing to the two red eyes and the fierce fire dropping glowing coals and the rush of the giant as it fled past and the track of glare and smoke along the valley then he would glance in the direction by which he intended to depart at sunrise as there was no rest for him there and would lie down again to be troubled by the vision of his journey and the old monotony of bells and wheels and horses feet until another came this lasted all night so far from resuming the mastery of himself he seemed if possible to lose it more and more as the night crept on when the dawn appeared he was still tormented with thinking still postponing thought until he should be in a better state the past present and future all floated confusedly before him and he had lost all power of looking steadily at any one of them  at what time he asked the man who had waited on him overnight now entering with a candle do i leave here did you say  about a quarter after four sir express comes through at four sirit dont stop  he passed his hand across his throbbing head and looked at his watch nearly halfpast three  nobody going with you sir probably observed the man two gentlemen here sir but theyre waiting for the train to london  i thought you said there was nobody here said carker turning upon him with the ghost of his old smile when he was angry or suspicious  not then sir two gentlemen came in the night by the short train that stops here sir warm water sir  no and take away the candle theres day enough for me  having thrown himself upon the bed halfdressed he was at the window as the man left the room the cold light of morning had succeeded to night and there was already in the sky the red suffusion of the coming sun he bathed his head and face with waterthere was no cooling influence in it for himhurriedly put on his clothes paid what he owed and went out  the air struck chill and comfortless as it breathed upon him there was a heavy dew and hot as he was it made him shiver after a glance at the place where he had walked last night and at the signallights burning in the morning and bereft of their significance he turned to where the sun was rising and beheld it in its glory as it broke upon the scene  so awful so transcendent in its beauty so divinely solemn as he cast his faded eyes upon it where it rose tranquil and serene unmoved by all the wrong and wickedness on which its beams had shone since the beginning of the world who shall say that some weak sense of virtue upon earth and its in heaven did not manifest itself even to him if ever he remembered sister or brother with a touch of tenderness and remorse who shall say it was not then  he needed some such touch then death was on him he was marked offthe living world and going down into his grave  he paid the money for his journey to the countryplace he had thought of and was walking to and fro alone looking along the lines of iron across the valley in one direction and towards a dark bridge near at hand in the other when turning in his walk where it was bounded by one end of the wooden stage on which he paced up and down he saw the man from whom he had fled emerging from the door by which he himself had entered  and their eyes met  in the quick unsteadiness of the surprise he staggered and slipped on to the road below him but recovering his feet immediately he stepped back a pace or two upon that road to interpose some wider space between them and looked at his pursuer breathing short and quick  he heard a shoutanothersaw the face change from its vindictive passion to a faint sickness and terrorfelt the earth trembleknew in a moment that the rush was comeuttered a shrieklooked roundsaw the red eyes bleared and dim in the daylight close upon himwas beaten down caught up and whirled away upon a jagged mill that spun him round and round and struck him limb from limb and licked his stream of life up with its fiery heat and cast his mutilated fragments in the air  when the traveller who had been recognised recovered from a swoon he saw them bringing from a distance something covered that lay heavy and still upon a board between four men and saw that others drove some dogs away that sniffed upon the road and soaked his blood up with a train of ashes    chapter 56 several people delighted and the game chicken disgusted   the midshipman was all alive mr toots and susan had arrived at last susan had run upstairs like a young woman bereft of her senses and mr toots and the chicken had gone into the parlour  oh my own pretty darling sweet miss floy cried the nipper running into florences room to think that it should come to this and i should find you here my own dear dove with nobody to wait upon you and no home to call your own but never never will i go away again miss floy for though i may not gather moss im not a rolling stone nor is my heart a stone or else it wouldnt bust as it is busting now oh dear oh dear  pouring out these words without the faintest indication of a stop of any sort miss nipper on her knees beside her mistress hugged her close  oh love cried susan i know all thats past i know it all my tender pet and im a choking give me air  susan dear good susan said florence oh bless her i that was her little maid when she was a little child and is she really really truly going to be marriedexclaimed susan in a burst of pain and pleasure pride and grief and heaven knows how many other conflicting feelings  who told you so said florence  oh gracious me that innocentest creetur toots returned susan hysterically i knew he must be right my dear because he took on so hes the devotedest and innocentest infant and is my darling pursued susan with another close embrace and burst of tears really really going to be married  the mixture of compassion pleasure tenderness protection and regret with which the nipper constantly recurred to this subject and at every such once raised her head to look in the young face and kiss it and then laid her head again upon her mistresss shoulder caressing her and sobbing was as womanly and good a thing in its way as ever was seen in the world  there there said the soothing voice of florence presently now youre quite yourself dear susan  miss nipper sitting down upon the floor at her mistresss feet laughing and sobbing holding her pockethandkerchief to her eyes with one hand and patting diogenes with the other as he licked her face confessed to being more composed and laughed and cried a little more in proof of it  iii never did see such a creetur as that toots said susan in all my born days never  so kind suggested florence  and so comic susan sobbed the way hes been going on inside with me with that disrespectable chicken on the box  about what susan inquired florence timidly  oh about lieutenant walters and captain gills and you my dear miss floy and the silent tomb said susan  the silent tomb repeated florence  he says here susan burst into a violent hysterical laugh that hell go down into it now immediately and quite comfortable but bless your heart my dear miss floy he wont hes a great deal too happy in seeing other people happy for that he may not be a solomon pursued the nipper with her usual volubility nor do i say he is but this i do say a less selfish human creature human nature never knew miss nipper being still hysterical laughed immoderately after making this energetic declaration and then informed florence that he was waiting below to see her which would be a rich repayment for the trouble he had had in his late expedition  florence entreated susan to beg of mr toots as a favour that she might have the pleasure of thanking him for his kindness and susan in a few moments produced that young gentleman still very much dishevelled in appearance and stammering exceedingly  miss dombey said mr toots to be again permitted totogazeat least not to gaze buti dont exactly know what i was going to say but its of no consequence  i have to thank you so often returned florence giving him both her hands with all her innocent gratitude beaming in her face that i have no words left and dont know how to do it  miss dombey said mr toots in an awful voice if it was possible that you could consistently with your angelic nature curse me you wouldif i may be allowed to say sofloor me infinitely less than by these undeserved expressions of kindness their effect upon meisbut said mr toots abruptly this is a digression and of no consequence at all  as there seemed to be no means of replying to this but by thanking him again florence thanked him again  i could wish said mr toots to take this opportunity miss dombey if i might of entering into a word of explanation i should have had the pleasure ofof returning with susan at an earlier period but in the first place we didnt know the name of the relation to whose house she had gone and in the second as she had left that relations and gone to another at a distance i think that scarcely anything short of the sagacity of the chicken would have found her out in the time  florence was sure of it  this however said mr toots is not the point the company of susan has been i assure you miss dombey a consolation and satisfaction to me in my state of mind more easily conceived than described the journey has been its own reward that however still is not the point miss dombey i have before observed that i know i am not what is considered a quick person i am perfectly aware of that i dont think anybody could be better acquainted with his ownif it was not too strong an expression i should say with the thickness of his own headthan myself but miss dombey i do notwithstanding perceive the state ofof thingswith lieutenant walters whatever agony that state of things may have caused me which is of no consequence at all i am bound to say that lieutenant walters is a person who appears to be worthy of the blessing that has fallen on hison his brow may he wear it long and appreciate it as a very different and very unworthy individual that it is of no consequence to name would have done that however still is not the point miss dombey captain gills is a friend of mine and during the interval that is now elapsing i believe it would afford captain gills pleasure to see me occasionally coming backwards and forwards here it would afford me pleasure so to come but i cannot forget that i once committed myself fatally at the corner of the square at brighton and if my presence will be in the least degree unpleasant to you i only ask you to name it to me now and assure you that i shall perfectly understand you i shall not consider it at all unkind and shall only be too delighted and happy to be honoured with your confidence  mr toots returned florence if you who are so old and true a friend of mine were to stay away from this house now you would make me very unhappy it can never never give me any feeling but pleasure to see you  miss dombey said mr toots taking out his pockethandkerchief if i shed a tear it is a tear of joy it is of no consequence and i am very much obliged to you i may be allowed to remark after what you have so kindly said that it is not my intention to neglect my person any longer  florence received this intimation with the prettiest expression of perplexity possible  i mean said mr toots that i shall consider it my duty as a fellowcreature generally until i am claimed by the silent tomb to make the best of myself and toto have my boots as brightly polished asascircumstances will admit of this is the last time miss dombey of my intruding any observation of a private and personal nature i thank you very much indeed if i am not in a general way as sensible as my friends could wish me to be or as i could wish myself i really am upon my word and honour particularly sensible of what is considerate and kind i feel said mr toots in an impassioned tone as if i could express my feelings at the present moment in a most remarkable manner ififi could only get a start  appearing not to get it after waiting a minute or two to see if it would come mr toots took a hasty leave and went below to seek the captain whom he found in the shop  captain gills said mr toots what is now to take place between us takes place under the sacred seal of confidence it is the sequel captain gills of what has taken place between myself and miss dombey upstairs  alow and aloft eh my lad murmured the captain  exactly so captain gills said mr toots whose fervour of acquiescence was greatly heightened by his entire ignorance of the captains meaning miss dombey i believe captain gills is to be shortly united to lieutenant walters  why ay my lad were all shipmets herewalr and sweetheart will be jined together in the house of bondage as soon as the askings is over whispered captain cuttle in his ear  the askings captain gills repeated mr toots  in the church down yonder said the captain pointing his thumb over his shoulder  oh yes returned mr toots  and then said the captain in his hoarse whisper and tapping mr toots on the chest with the back of his hand and falling from him with a look of infinite admiration what follers that there pretty creetur as delicately brought up as a foreign bird goes away upon the roaring main with walr on a woyage to china  lord captain gills said mr toots  ay nodded the captain the ship as took him up when he was wrecked in the hurricane that had drove her clean out of her course was a china trader and walr made the woyage and got into favour aboard and ashorebeing as smart and good a lad as ever steppedand so the supercargo dying at canton he got made having acted as clerk afore and now hes supercargo aboard another ship same owners and so you see repeated the captain thoughtfully the pretty creetur goes away upon the roaring main with walr on a woyage to china  mr toots and captain cuttle heaved a sigh in concert what then said the captain she loves him true he loves her true them as should have loved and tended of her treated of her like the beasts as perish when she cast out of home come here to me and dropped upon them planks her wownded heart was broke i know it i edard cuttle see it theres nowt but true kind steady love as can ever piece it up again if so be i didnt know that and didnt know as walr was her true love brother and she his id have these here blue arms and legs chopped off afore id let her go but i know it and what then why then i say heaven go with em both and so it will amen  captain gills said mr toots let me have the pleasure of shaking hands youve a way of saying things that gives me an agreeable warmth all up my back i say amen you are aware captain gills that i too have adored miss dombey  cheer up said the captain laying his hand on mr tootss shoulder stand by boy  it is my intention captain gills returned the spirited mr toots to cheer up also to standby as much as possible when the silent tomb shall yawn captain gills i shall be ready for burial not before but not being certain just at present of my power over myself what i wish to say to you and what i shall take it as a particular favour if you will mention to lieutenant walters is as follows  is as follers echoed the captain steady  miss dombey being so inexpressably kind continued mr toots with watery eyes as to say that my presence is the reverse of disagreeable to her and you and everybody here being no less forbearing and tolerant towards one whowho certainly said mr toots with momentary dejection would appear to have been born by mistake i shall come backwards and forwards of an evening during the short time we can all be together but what i ask is this if at any moment i find that i cannot endure the contemplation of lieutenant walterss bliss and should rush out i hope captain gills that you and he will both consider it as my misfortune and not my fault or the want of inward conflict that youll feel convinced i bear no malice to any living creatureleast of all to lieutenant walters himselfand that youll casually remark that i have gone out for a walk or probably to see what oclock it is by the royal exchange captain gills if you could enter into this arrangement and could answer for lieutenant walters it would be a relief to my feelings that i should think cheap at the sacrifice of a considerable portion of my property  my lad returned the captain say no more there aint a colour you can run up as wont be made out and answered to by walr and self  captain gills said mr toots my mind is greatly relieved i wish to preserve the good opinion of all here iimean well upon my honour however badly i may show it you know said mr toots its as exactly as burgess and co wished to oblige a customer with a most extraordinary pair of trousers and could not cut out what they had in their minds  with this apposite illustration of which he seemed a little proud mr toots gave captain cuttle his blessing and departed  the honest captain with his hearts delight in the house and susan tending her was a beaming and a happy man as the days flew by he grew more beaming and more happy every day after some conferences with susan for whose wisdom the captain had a profound respect and whose valiant precipitation of herself on mrs macstinger he could never forget he proposed to florence that the daughter of the elderly lady who usually sat under the blue umbrella in leadenhall market should for prudential reasons and considerations of privacy be superseded in the temporary discharge of the household duties by someone who was not unknown to them and in whom they could safely confide susan being present then named in furtherance of a suggestion she had previously offered to the captain mrs richards florence brightened at the name and susan setting off that very afternoon to the toodle domicile to sound mrs richards returned in triumph the same evening accompanied by the identical rosycheeked applefaced polly whose demonstrations when brought into florences presence were hardly less affectionate than those of susan nipper herself  this piece of generalship accomplished from which the captain derived uncommon satisfaction as he did indeed from everything else that was done whatever it happened to be florence had next to prepare susan for their approaching separation this was a much more difficult task as miss nipper was of a resolute disposition and had fully made up her mind that she had come back never to be parted from her old mistress any more  as to wages dear miss floy she said you wouldnt hint and wrong me so as think of naming them for ive put money by and wouldnt sell my love and duty at a time like this even if the savings banks and me were total strangers or the banks were broke to pieces but youve never been without me darling from the time your poor dear ma was took away and though im nothing to be boasted of youre used to me and oh my own dear mistress through so many years dont think of going anywhere without me for it mustnt and cant be  dear susan i am going on a long long voyage  well miss floy and what of that the more youll want me lengths of voyages aint an object in my eyes thank god said the impetuous susan nipper  but susan i am going with walter and i would go with walter anywhereeverywhere walter is poor and i am very poor and i must learn now both to help myself and help him  dear miss floy cried susan bursting out afresh and shaking her head violently its nothing new to you to help yourself and others too and be the patientest and truest of noble hearts but let me talk to mr walter gay and settle it with him for suffer you to go away across the world alone i cannot and i wont  alone susan returned florence alone and walter taking me with him ah what a bright amazed enraptured smile was on her facehe should have seen it i am sure you will not speak to walter if i ask you not she added tenderly and pray dont dear  susan sobbed why not miss floy  because said florence i am going to be his wife to give him up my whole heart and to live with him and die with him he might think if you said to him what you have said to me that i am afraid of what is before me or that you have some cause to be afraid for me why susan dear i love him  miss nipper was so much affected by the quiet fervour of these words and the simple heartfelt allpervading earnestness expressed in them and making the speakers face more beautiful and pure than ever that she could only cling to her again crying was her little mistress really really going to be married and pitying caressing and protecting her as she had done before but the nipper though susceptible of womanly weaknesses was almost as capable of putting constraint upon herself as of attacking the redoubtable macstinger from that time she never returned to the subject but was always cheerful active bustling and hopeful she did indeed inform mr toots privately that she was only keeping up for the time and that when it was all over and miss dombey was gone she might be expected to become a spectacle distressful and mr toots did also express that it was his case too and that they would mingle their tears together but she never otherwise indulged her private feelings in the presence of florence or within the precincts of the midshipman  limited and plain as florences wardrobe waswhat a contrast to that prepared for the last marriage in which she had taken partthere was a good deal to do in getting it ready and susan nipper worked away at her side all day with the concentrated zeal of fifty sempstresses the wonderful contributions captain cuttle would have made to this branch of the outfit if he had been permittedas pink parasols tinted silk stockings blue shoes and other articles no less necessary on shipboardwould occupy some space in the recital he was induced however by various fraudulent representations to limit his contributions to a workbox and dressing case of each of which he purchased the very largest specimen that could be got for money for ten days or a fortnight afterwards he generally sat during the greater part of the day gazing at these boxes divided between extreme admiration of them and dejected misgivings that they were not gorgeous enough and frequently diving out into the street to purchase some wild article that he deemed necessary to their completeness but his masterstroke was the bearing of them both off suddenly one morning and getting the two words florence gay engraved upon a brass heart inlaid over the lid of each after this he smoked four pipes successively in the little parlour by himself and was discovered chuckling at the expiration of as many hours  walter was busy and away all day but came there every morning early to see florence and always passed the evening with her florence never left her high rooms but to steal downstairs to wait for him when it was his time to come or sheltered by his proud encircling arm to bear him company to the door again and sometimes peep into the street in the twilight they were always together oh blessed time oh wandering heart at rest oh deep exhaustless mighty well of love in which so much was sunk  the cruel mark was on her bosom yet it rose against her father with the breath she drew it lay between her and her lover when he pressed her to his heart but she forgot it in the beating of that heart for her and in the beating of her own for him all harsher music was unheard all stern unloving hearts forgotten fragile and delicate she was but with a might of love within her that could and did create a world to fly to and to rest in out of his one image  how often did the great house and the old days come before her in the twilight time when she was sheltered by the arm so proud so fond and creeping closer to him shrunk within it at the recollection how often from remembering the night when she went down to that room and met the nevertobe forgotten look did she raise her eyes to those that watched her with such loving earnestness and weep with happiness in such a refuge the more she clung to it the more the dear dead child was in her thoughts but as if the last time she had seen her father had been when he was sleeping and she kissed his face she always left him so and never in her fancy passed that hour  walter dear said florence one evening when it was almost darkdo you know what i have been thinking today  thinking how the time is flying on and how soon we shall be upon the sea sweet florence  i dont mean that walter though i think of that too i have been thinking what a charge i am to you  a precious sacred charge dear heart why i think that sometimes  you are laughing walter i know thats much more in your thoughts than mine but i mean a cost  a cost my own  in money dear all these preparations that susan and i are so busy withi have been able to purchase very little for myself you were poor before but how much poorer i shall make you walter  and how much richer florence  florence laughed and shook her head  besides said walter long agobefore i went to seai had a little purse presented to me dearest which had money in it  ah returned florence laughing sorrowfully very little very little walter but you must not think and here she laid her light hand on his shoulder and looked into his face that i regret to be this burden on you no dear love i am glad of it i am happy in it i wouldnt have it otherwise for all the world  nor i indeed dear florence  ay but walter you can never feel it as i do i am so proud of you it makes my heart swell with such delight to know that those who speak of you must say you married a poor disowned girl who had taken shelter here who had no other home no other friends who had nothingnothing oh walter if i could have brought you millions i never could have been so happy for your sake as i am  and you dear florence are you nothing he returned  no nothing walter nothing but your wife the light hand stole about his neck and the voice came nearernearer i am nothing any more that is not you i have no earthly hope any more that is not you i have nothing dear to me any more that is not you  oh well might mr toots leave the little company that evening and twice go out to correct his watch by the royal exchange and once to keep an appointment with a banker which he suddenly remembered and once to take a little turn to aldgate pump and back  but before he went upon these expeditions or indeed before he came and before lights were brought walter said  florence love the lading of our ship is nearly finished and probably on the very day of our marriage she will drop down the river shall we go away that morning and stay in kent until we go on board at gravesend within a week  if you please walter i shall be happy anywhere but  yes my life  you know said florence that we shall have no marriage party and that nobody will distinguish us by our dress from other people as we leave the same day will youwill you take me somewhere that morning walterearlybefore we go to church  walter seemed to understand her as so true a lover so truly loved should and confirmed his ready promise with a kisswith more than one perhaps or two or threes or five or six and in the grave peaceful evening florence was very happy  then into the quiet room came susan nipper and the candles shortly afterwards the tea the captain and the excursive mr toots who as above mentioned was frequently on the move afterwards and passed but a restless evening this however was not his habit for he generally got on very well by dint of playing at cribbage with the captain under the advice and guidance of miss nipper and distracting his mind with the calculations incidental to the game which he found to be a very effectual means of utterly confounding himself  the captains visage on these occasions presented one of the finest examples of combination and succession of expression ever observed his instinctive delicacy and his chivalrous feeling towards florence taught him that it was not a time for any boisterous jollity or violent display of satisfaction floating reminiscences of lovely peg on the other hand were constantly struggling for a vent and urging the captain to commit himself by some irreparable demonstration anon his admiration of florence and walterwellmatched truly and full of grace and interest in their youth and love and good looks as they sat apartwould take such complete possession of him that he would lay down his cards and beam upon them dabbing his head all over with his pockethandkerchief until warned perhaps by the sudden rushing forth of mr toots that he had unconsciously been very instrumental indeed in making that gentleman miserable this reflection would make the captain profoundly melancholy until the return of mr toots when he would fall to his cards again with many side winks and nods and polite waves of his hook at miss nipper importing that he wasnt going to do so any more the state that ensued on this was perhaps his best for then endeavouring to discharge all expression from his face he would sit staring round the room with all these expressions conveyed into it at once and each wrestling with the other delighted admiration of florence and walter always overthrew the rest and remained victorious and undisguised unless mr toots made another rush into the air and then the captain would sit like a remorseful culprit until he came back again occasionally calling upon himself in a low reproachful voice to stand by or growling some remonstrance to edard cuttle my lad on the want of caution observabl in his behaviour  one of mr tootss hardest trials however was of his own seeking on the approach of the sunday which was to witness the last of those askings in church of which the captain had spoken mr toots thus stated his feelings to susan nipper  susan said mr toots i am drawn towards the building the words which cut me off from miss dombey for ever will strike upon my ears like a knell you know but upon my word and honour i feel that i must hear them therefore said mr toots will you accompany me tomorrow to the sacred edifice  miss nipper expressed her readiness to do so if that would be any satisfaction to mr toots but besought him to abandon his idea of going  susan returned mr toots with much solemnity before my whiskers began to be observed by anybody but myself i adored miss dombey while yet a victim to the thraldom of blimber i adored miss dombey when i could no longer be kept out of my property in a legal point of view andand accordingly came into iti adored miss dombey the banns which consign her to lieutenant walters and me toto gloom you know said mr toots after hesitating for a strong expression may be dreadful will be dreadful but i feel that i should wish to hear them spoken i feel that i should wish to know that the ground was certainly cut from under me and that i hadnt a hope to cherish or aor a leg in short toto go upon  susan nipper could only commiserate mr tootss unfortunate condition and agree under these circumstances to accompany him which she did next morning  the church walter had chosen for the purpose was a mouldy old church in a yard hemmed in by a labyrinth of back streets and courts with a little buryingground round it and itself buried in a kind of vault formed by the neighbouring houses and paved with echoing stones it was a great dim shabby pile with high old oaken pews among which about a score of people lost themselves every sunday while the clergymans voice drowsily resounded through the emptiness and the organ rumbled and rolled as if the church had got the colic for want of a congregation to keep the wind and damp out but so far was this city church from languishing for the company of other churches that spires were clustered round it as the masts of shipping cluster on the river it would have been hard to count them from its steepletop they were so many in almost every yard and blindplace near there was a church the confusion of bells when susan and mr toots betook themselves towards it on the sunday morning was deafening there were twenty churches close together clamouring for people to come in  the two stray sheep in question were penned by a beadle in a commodious pew and being early sat for some time counting the congregation listening to the disappointed bell high up in the tower or looking at a shabby little old man in the porch behind the screen who was ringing the same like the bull in cock robin with his foot in a stirrup mr toots after a lengthened survey of the large books on the readingdesk whispered miss nipper that he wondered where the banns were kept but that young lady merely shook her head and frowned repelling for the time all approaches of a temporal nature  mr toots however appearing unable to keep his thoughts from the banns was evidently looking out for them during the whole preliminary portion of the service as the time for reading them approached the poor young gentleman manifested great anxiety and trepidation which was not diminished by the unexpected apparition of the captain in the front row of the gallery when the clerk handed up a list to the clergyman mr toots being then seated held on by the seat of the pew but when the names of walter gay and florence dombey were read aloud as being in the third and last stage of that association he was so entirley conquered by his feelings as to rush from the church without his hat followed by the beadle and pewopener and two gentlemen of the medical profeesion who happened to be present of whom the firstnamed presently returned for that article informing miss nipper in a whisper that she was not to make herself uneasy about the gentleman as the gentleman said his indisposition was of no consequence  miss nipper feeling that the eyes of that integral portion of europe which lost itself weekly among the highbacked pews were upon her would have been sufficient embarrassed by this incident though it had terminated here the more so as the captain in the front row of the gallery was in a state of unmitigated consciousness which could hardly fail to express to the congregation that he had some mysterious connection with it but the extreme restlessness of mr toots painfully increased and protracted the delicacy of her situation that young gentleman incapable in his state of mind of remaining alone in the churchyard a prey to solitary meditation and also desirous no doubt of testifying his respect for the offices he had in some measure interrupted suddenly returnednot coming back to the pew but stationing himself on a free seat in the aisle between two elderly females who were in the habit of receiving their portion of a weekly dole of bread then set forth on a shelf in the porch in this conjunction mr toots remained greatly disturbing the congregation who felt it impossible to avoid looking at him until his feelings overcame him again when he departed silently and suddenly not venturing to trust himself in the church any more and yet wishing to have some social participation in what was going on there mr toots was after this seen from time to time looking in with a lorn aspect at one or other of the windows and as there were several windows accessible to him from without and as his restlessness was very great it not only became difficult to conceive at which window he would appear next but likewise became necessary as it were for the whole congregation to speculate upon the chances of the different windows during the comparative leisure afforded them by the sermon mr tootss movements in the churchyard were so eccentric that he seemed generally to defeat all calculation and to appear like the conjurors figure where he was least expected and the effect of these mysterious presentations was much increased by its being difficult to him to see in and easy to everybody else to see out which occasioned his remaining every time longer than might have been expected with his face close to the glass until he all at once became aware that all eyes were upon him and vanished  these proceedings on the part of mr toots and the strong individual consciousness of them that was exhibited by the captain rendered miss nippers position so responsible a one that she was mightily relieved by the conclusion of the service and was hardly so affable to mr toots as usual when he informed her and the captain on the way back that now he was sure he had no hope you know he felt more comfortableat least not exactly more comfortable but more comfortably and completely miserable  swiftly now indeed the time flew by until it was the evening before the day appointed for the marriage they were all assembled in the upper room at the midshipmans and had no fear of interruption for there were no lodgers in the house now and the midshipman had it all to himself they were grave and quiet in the prospect of tomorrow but moderately cheerful too florence with walter close beside her was finishing a little piece of work intended as a parting gift to the captain the captain was playing cribbage with mr toots mr toots was taking counsel as to his hand of susan nipper miss nipper was giving it with all due secrecy and circumspection diogenes was listening and occasionally breaking out into a gruff halfsmothered fragment of a bark of which he afterwards seemed halfashamed as if he doubted having any reason for it  steady steady said the captain to diogenes whats amiss with you you dont seem easy in your mind tonight my boy  diogenes wagged his tail but pricked up his ears immediately afterwards and gave utterance to another fragment of a bark for which he apologised to the captain by again wagging his tail  its my opinion di said the captain looking thoughtfully at his cards and stroking his chin with his hook as you have your doubts of mrs richards but if youre the animal i take you to be youll think better o that for her looks is her commission now brother to mr toots if so be as youre ready heave ahead  the captain spoke with all composure and attention to the game but suddenly his cards dropped out of his hand his mouth and eyes opened wide his legs drew themselves up and stuck out in front of his chair and he sat staring at the door with blank amazement looking round upon the company and seeing that none of them observed him or the cause of his astonishment the captain recovered himself with a great gasp struck the table a tremendous blow cried in a stentorian roar sol gills ahoy and tumbled into the arms of a weatherbeaten peacoat that had come with polly into the room  in another moment walter was in the arms of the weatherbeaten peacoat in another moment florence was in the arms of the weatherbeaten peacoat in another moment captain cuttle had embraced mrs richards and miss nipper and was violently shaking hands with mr toots exclaiming as he waved his hook above his head hooroar my lad hooroar to which mr toots wholly at a loss to account for these proceedings replied with great politeness certainly captain gills whatever you think proper  the weatherbeaten peacoat and a no less weatherbeaten cap and comforter belonging to it turned from the captain and from florence back to walter and sounds came from the weatherbeaten peacoat cap and comforter as of an old man sobbing underneath them while the shaggy sleeves clasped walter tight during this pause there was an universal silence and the captain polished his nose with great diligence but when the peacoat cap and comforter lifted themselves up again florence gently moved towards them and she and walter taking them off disclosed the old instrumentmaker a little thinner and more careworn than of old in his old welsh wig and his old coffeecoloured coat and basket buttons with his old infallible chronometer ticking away in his pocket  chock full o science said the radiant captain as ever he was sol gills sol gills what have you been up to for this many a long day my ould boy  im half blind ned said the old man and almost deaf and dumb with joy  his wery woice said the captain looking round with an exultation to which even his face could hardly render justicehis wery woice as chock full o science as ever it was sol gills lay to my lad upon your own wines and figtrees like a taut ould patriark as you are and overhaul them there adwentures o yourn in your own formilior woice tis the woice said the captain impressively and announcing a quotation with his hook of the sluggard i heerd him complain you have woke me too soon i must slumber again scatter his enemies and make em fall  the captain sat down with the air of a man who had happily expressed the feeling of everybody present and immediately rose again to present mr toots who was much disconcerted by the arrival of anybody appearing to prefer a claim to the name of gills  although stammered mr toots i had not the pleasure of your acquaintance sir before you wereyou were  lost to sight to memory dear suggested the captain in a low voice  exactly so captain gills assented mr toots although i had not the pleasure of your acquaintance mrmr sols said toots hitting on that name in the inspiration of a bright idea before that happened i have the greatest pleasure i assure you inyou know in knowing you i hope said mr toots that youre as well as can be expected  with these courteous words mr toots sat down blushing and chuckling  the old instrumentmaker seated in a corner between walter and florence and nodding at polly who was looking on all smiles and delight answered the captain thus  ned cuttle my dear boy although i have heard something of the changes of events here from my pleasant friend therewhat a pleasant face she has to be sure to welcome a wanderer home said the old man breaking off and rubbing his hands in his old dreamy way  hear him cried the captain gravely tis woman as seduces all mankind for which aside to mr toots youll overhaul your adam and eve brother  i shall make a point of doing so captain gills said mr toots  although i have heard something of the changes of events from her resumed the instrumentmaker taking his old spectacles from his pocket and putting them on his forehead in his old manner they are so great and unexpected and i am so overpowered by the sight of my dear boy and by theglancing at the downcast eyes of florence and not attempting to finish the sentencethat ii cant say much tonight but my dear ned cuttle why didnt you write  the astonishment depicted in the captains features positively frightened mr toots whose eyes were quite fixed by it so that he could not withdraw them from his face  write echoed the captain write sol gills  ay said the old man either to barbados or jamaica or demerara that was what i asked  what you asked sol gills repeated the captain  ay said the old man dont you know ned sure you have not forgotten every time i wrote to you  the captain took off his glazed hat hung it on his hook and smoothing his hair from behind with his hand sat gazing at the group around him a perfect image of wondering resignation  you dont appear to understand me ned observed old sol  sol gills returned the captain after staring at him and the rest for a long time without speaking im gone about and adrift pay out a word or two respecting them adwenturs will you cant i bring up nohows nohows said the captain ruminating and staring all round  you know ned said sol gills why i left here did you open my packet ned  why ay ay said the captain to be sure i opened the packet  and read it said the old man  and read it answered the captain eyeing him attentively and proceeding to quote it from memory my dear ned cuttle when i left home for the west indies in forlorn search of intelligence of my dear there he sits theres walr said the captain as if he were relieved by getting hold of anything that was real and indisputable  well ned now attend a moment said the old man when i wrote firstthat was from barbadosi said that though you would receive that letter long before the year was out i should be glad if you would open the packet as it explained the reason of my going away very good ned when i wrote the second third and perhaps the fourth timesthat was from jamaicai said i was in just the same state couldnt rest and couldnt come away from that part of the world without knowing that my boy was lost or saved when i wrote nextthat i think was from demerara wasnt it  that he thinks was from demerara warnt it said the captain looking hopelessly round  i said proceeded old sol that still there was no certain information got yet that i found many captains and others in that part of the world who had known me for years and who assisted me with a passage here and there and for whom i was able now and then to do a little in return in my own craft that everyone was sorry for me and seemed to take a sort of interest in my wanderings and that i began to think it would be my fate to cruise about in search of tidings of my boy until i died  began to think as how he was a scientific flying dutchman said the captain as before and with great seriousness  but when the news come one day nedthat was to barbados after i got back therethat a china trader homeard bound had been spoke that had my boy aboard then ned i took passage in the next ship and came home arrived at home tonight to find it true thank god said the old man devoutly  the captain after bowing his head with great reverence stared all round the circle beginning with mr toots and ending with the instrumentmaker then gravely said  sol gills the observation as im agoing to make is calclated to blow every stitch of sail as you can carry clean out of the boltropes and bring you on your beam ends with a lurch not one of them letters was ever delivered to edard cuttle not one o them letters repeated the captain to make his declaration the more solemn and impressive was ever delivered unto edard cuttle mariner of england as lives at home at ease and doth improve each shining hour  and posted by my own hand and directed by my own hand number nine brig place exclaimed old sol  the colour all went out of the captains face and all came back again in a glow  what do you mean sol gills my friend by number nine brig place inquired the captain  mean your lodgings ned returned the old man mrs whatshername i shall forget my own name next but i am behind the present timei always was you recollectand very much confused mrs  sol gills said the captain as if he were putting the most improbable case in the world it aint the name of macstinger as youre a trying to remember  of course it is exclaimed the instrumentmaker to be sure ned mrs macstinger  captain cuttle whose eyes were now as wide open as they would be and the knobs upon whose face were perfectly luminous gave a long shrill whistle of a most melancholy sound and stood gazing at everybody in a state of speechlessness  overhaul that there again sol gills will you be so kind he said at last  all these letters returned uncle sol beating time with the forefinger of his right hand upon the palm of his left with a steadiness and distinctness that might have done honour even to the infallible chronometer in his pocket i posted with my own hand and directed with my own hand to captain cuttle at mrs macstingers number nine brig place  the captain took his glazed hat off his hook looked into it put it on and sat down  why friends all said the captain staring round in the last state of discomfiture i cut and run from there  and no one knew where you were gone captain cuttle cried walter hastily  bless your heart walr said the captain shaking his head shed never have allowed o my coming to take charge o this here property nothing could be done but cut and run lord love you walr said the captain youve only seen her in a calm but see her when her angry passions riseand make a note on  id give it her remarked the nipper softly  would you do you think my dear returned the captain with feeble admiration well my dear it does you credit but there aint no wild animal i wouldnt sooner face myself i only got my chest away by means of a friend as nobodys a match for it was no good sending any letter there she wouldnt take in any letter bless you said the captain under them circumstances why you could hardly make it worth a mans while to be the postman  then its pretty clear captain cuttle that all of us and you and uncle sol especially said walter may thank mrs macstinger for no small anxiety  the general obligation in this wise to the determined relict of the late mr macstinger was so apparent that the captain did not contest the point but being in some measure ashamed of his position though nobody dwelt upon the subject and walter especially avoided it remembering the last conversation he and the captain had held together respecting it he remained under a cloud for nearly five minutesan extraordinary period for him when that sun his face broke out once more shining on all beholders with extraordinary brilliancy and he fell into a fit of shaking hands with everybody over and over again  at an early hour but not before uncle sol and walter had questioned each other at some length about their voyages and dangers they all except walter vacated florences room and went down to the parlour here they were soon afterwards joined by walter who told them florence was a little sorrowful and heavyhearted and had gone to bed though they could not have disturbed her with their voices down there they all spoke in a whisper after this and each in his different way felt very lovingly and gently towards walters fair young bride and a long explanation there was of everything relating to her for the satisfaction of uncle sol and very sensible mr toots was of the delicacy with which walter made his name and services important and his presence necessary to their little council  mr toots said walter on parting with him at the house door we shall see each other tomorrow morning  lieutenant walters returned mr toots grasping his hand fervently i shall certainly be present  this is the last night we shall meet for a long timethe last night we may ever meet said walter such a noble heart as yours must feel i think when another heart is bound to it i hope you know that i am very grateful to you  walters replied mr toots quite touched i should be glad to feel that you had reason to be so  florence said walter on this last night of her bearing her own name has made me promiseit was only just now when you left us togetherthat i would tell youwith her dear love  mr toots laid his hand upon the doorpost and his eyes upon his handwith her dear love said walter that she can never have a friend whom she will value above you that the recollection of your true consideration for her always can never be forgotten by her that she remembers you in her prayers tonight and hopes that you will think of her when she is far away shall i say anything for you  say walter replied mr toots indistinctly that i shall think of her every day but never without feeling happy to know that she is married to the man she loves and who loves her say if you please that i am sure her husband deserves hereven herand that i am glad of her choice  mr toots got more distinct as he came to these last words and raising his eyes from the doorpost said them stoutly he then shook walters hand again with a fervour that walter was not slow to return and started homeward  mr toots was accompanied by the chicken whom he had of late brought with him every evening and left in the shop with an idea that unforeseen circumstances might arise from without in which the prowess of that distinguished character would be of service to the midshipman the chicken did not appear to be in a particularly good humour on this occasion either the gaslamps were treacherous or he cocked his eye in a hideous manner and likewise distorted his nose when mr toots crossing the road looked back over his shoulder at the room where florence slept on the road home he was more demonstrative of aggressive intentions against the other footpassengers than comported with a professor of the peaceful art of selfdefence arrived at home instead of leaving mr toots in his apartments when he had escorted him thither he remained before him weighing his white hat in both hands by the brim and twitching his head and nose both of which had been many times broken and but indifferently repaired with an air of decided disrespect  his patron being much engaged with his own thoughts did not observe this for some time nor indeed until the chicken determined not to be overlooked had made divers clicking sounds with his tongue and teeth to attract attention  now master said the chicken doggedly when he at length caught mr tootss eye i want to know whether this here gammon is to finish it or whether youre a going in to win  chicken returned mr toots explain yourself  why then heres all about it master said the chicken i aint a cove to chuck a word away heres wot it is are any on em to be doubled up  when the chicken put this question he dropped his hat made a dodge and a feint with his left hand hit a supposed enemy a violent blow with his right shook his head smartly and recovered himself  come master said the chicken is it to be gammon or pluck which  chicken returned mr toots your expressions are coarse and your meaning is obscure  why then i tell you what master said the chicken this is where it is its mean  what is mean chicken asked mr toots  it is said the chicken with a frightful corrugation of his broken nose there now master wot when you could go and blow on this here match to the stiffun by which depreciatory appellation it has been since supposed that the game one intended to signify mr dombey and when you could knock the winner and all the kit of em dead out o wind and time are you going to give in to give in said the chicken with contemptuous emphasis wy its mean  chicken said mr toots severely youre a perfect vulture your sentiments are atrocious  my sentiments is game and fancy master returned the chicken thats wot my sentiments is i cant abear a meanness im afore the public im to be heerd on at the bar of the little helephant and no govner o mine mustnt go and do whats mean wy its mean said the chicken with increased expression thats where it is its mean  chicken said mr toots you disgust me  master returned the chicken putting on his hat theres a pair on us then come heres a offer youve spoke to me more than oncet or twicet about the public line never mind give me a fitypunnote tomorrow and let me go  chicken returned mr toots after the odious sentiments you have expressed i shall be glad to part on such terms  done then said the chicken its a bargain this here conduct of yourn wont suit my book master wy its mean said the chicken who seemed equally unable to get beyond that point and to stop short of it thats where it is its mean  so mr toots and the chicken agreed to part on this incompatibility of moral perception and mr toots lying down to sleep dreamed happily of florence who had thought of him as her friend upon the last night of her maiden life and who had sent him her dear love    chapter 57 another wedding   mr sownds the beadle and mrs miff the pewopener are early at their posts in the fine church where mr dombey was married a yellowfaced old gentleman from india is going to take unto himself a young wife this morning and six carriages full of company are expected and mrs miff has been informed that the yellowfaced old gentleman could pave the road to church with diamonds and hardly miss them the nuptial benediction is to be a superior one proceeding from a very reverend a dean and the lady is to be given away as an extraordinary present by somebody who comes express from the horse guards  mrs miff is more intolerant of common people this morning than she generally is and she his always strong opinions on that subject for it is associated with free sittings mrs miff is not a student of political economy she thinks the science is connected with dissenters baptists or wesleyans or some o them she says but she can never understand what business your common folks have to be married drat em says mrs miff you read the same things over em and instead of sovereigns get sixpences  mr sownds the beadle is more liberal than mrs miffbut then he is not a pewopener it must be done maam he says we must marry em we must have our national schools to walk at the head of and we must have our standing armies we must marry em maam says mr sownds and keep the country going  mr sownds is sitting on the steps and mrs miff is dusting in the church when a young couple plainly dressed come in the mortified bonnet of mrs miff is sharply turned towards them for she espies in this early visit indications of a runaway match but they dont want to be marriedonly says the gentleman to walk round the church and as he slips a genteel compliment into the palm of mrs miff her vinegary face relaxes and her mortified bonnet and her spare dry figure dip and crackle  mrs miff resumes her dusting and plumps up her cushionsfor the yellowfaced old gentleman is reported to have tender kneesbut keeps her glazed pewopening eye on the young couple who are walking round the church ahem coughs mrs miff whose cough is drier than the hay in any hassock in her charge youll come to us one of these mornings my dears unless im much mistaken  they are looking at a tablet on the wall erected to the memory of someone dead they are a long way off from mrs miff but mrs miff can see with half an eye how she is leaning on his arm and how his head is bent down over her well well says mrs miff you might do worse for youre a tidy pair  there is nothing personal in mrs miffs remark she merely speaks of stockintrade she is hardly more curious in couples than in coffins she is such a spare straight dry old ladysuch a pew of a womanthat you should find as many individual sympathies in a chip mr sownds now who is fleshy and has scarlet in his coat is of a different temperament he says as they stand upon the steps watching the young couple away that she has a pretty figure hasnt she and as well as he could see for she held her head down coming out an uncommon pretty face altogether mrs miff says mr sownds with a relish she is what you may call a rosebud  mrs miff assents with a spare nod of her mortified bonnet but approves of this so little that she inwardly resolves she wouldnt be the wife of mr sownds for any money he could give her beadle as he is  and what are the young couple saying as they leave the church and go out at the gate  dear walter thank you i can go away now happy  and when we come back florence we will come and see his grave again  florence lifts her eyes so bright with tears to his kind face and clasps her disengaged hand on that other modest little hand which clasps his arm  it is very early walter and the streets are almost empty yet let us walk  but you will be so tired my love  oh no i was very tired the first time that we ever walked together but i shall not be so today and thusnot much changedshe as innocent and earnestheartedhe as frank as hopeful and more proud of herflorence and walter on their bridal morning walk through the streets together  not even in that childish walk of long ago were they so far removed from all the world about them as today the childish feet of long ago did not tread such enchanted ground as theirs do now the confidence and love of children may be given many times and will spring up in many places but the womans heart of florence with its undivided treasure can be yielded only once and under slight or change can only droop and die  they take the streets that are the quietest and do not go near that in which her old home stands it is a fair warm summer morning and the sun shines on them as they walk towards the darkening mist that overspreads the city riches are uncovering in shops jewels gold and silver flash in the goldsmiths sunny windows and great houses cast a stately shade upon them as they pass but through the light and through the shade they go on lovingly together lost to everything around thinking of no other riches and no prouder home than they have now in one another  gradually they come into the darker narrower streets where the sun now yellow and now red is seen through the mist only at street corners and in small open spaces where there is a tree or one of the innumerable churches or a paved way and a flight of steps or a curious little patch of garden or a buryingground where the few tombs and tombstones are almost black lovingly and trustfully through all the narrow yards and alleys and the shady streets florence goes clinging to his arm to be his wife  her heart beats quicker now for walter tells her that their church is very near they pass a few great stacks of warehouses with waggons at the doors and busy carmen stopping up the waybut florence does not see or hear themand then the air is quiet and the day is darkened and she is trembling in a church which has a strange smell like a cellar  the shabby little old man ringer of the disappointed bell is standing in the porch and has put his hat in the fontfor he is quite at home there being sexton he ushers them into an old brown panelled dusty vestry like a cornercupboard with the shelves taken out where the wormy registers diffuse a smell like faded snuff which has set the tearful nipper sneezing  youthful and how beautiful the young bride looks in this old dusty place with no kindred object near her but her husband there is a dusty old clerk who keeps a sort of evaporated news shop underneath an archway opposite behind a perfect fortification of posts there is a dusty old pewopener who only keeps herself and finds that quite enough to do there is a dusty old beadle these are mr tootss beadle and pewopener of last sunday who has something to do with a worshipful company who have got a hall in the next yard with a stainedglass window in it that no mortal ever saw there are dusty wooden ledges and cornices poked in and out over the altar and over the screen and round the gallery and over the inscription about what the master and wardens of the worshipful company did in one thousand six hundred and ninetyfour there are dusty old soundingboards over the pulpit and readingdesk looking like lids to be let down on the officiating ministers in case of their giving offence there is every possible provision for the accommodation of dust except in the churchyard where the facilities in that respect are very limited the captain uncle sol and mr toots are come the clergyman is putting on his surplice in the vestry while the clerk walks round him blowing the dust off it and the bride and bridegroom stand before the altar there is no bridesmaid unless susan nipper is one and no better father than captain cuttle a man with a wooden leg chewing a faint apple and carrying a blue bag in has hand looks in to see what is going on but finding it nothing entertaining stumps off again and pegs his way among the echoes out of doors  no gracious ray of light is seen to fall on florence kneeling at the altar with her timid head bowed down the morning luminary is built out and dont shine there there is a meagre tree outside where the sparrows are chirping a little and there is a blackbird in an eyelethole of sun in a dyers garret over against the window who whistles loudly whilst the service is performing and there is the man with the wooden leg stumping away the amens of the dusty clerk appear like macbeths to stick in his throat a little but captain cuttle helps him out and does it with so much goodwill that he interpolates three entirely new responses of that word never introduced into the service before  they are married and have signed their names in one of the old sneezy registers and the clergymans surplice is restored to the dust and the clergymam is gone home in a dark corner of the dark church florence has turned to susan nipper and is weeping in her arms mr tootss eyes are red the captain lubricates his nose uncle sol has pulled down his spectacles from his forehead and walked out to the door  god bless you susan dearest susan if you ever can bear witness to the love i have for walter and the reason that i have to love him do it for his sake goodbye goodbye  they have thought it better not to go back to the midshipman but to part so a coach is waiting for them near at hand  miss nipper cannot speak she only sobs and chokes and hugs her mistress mr toots advances urges her to cheer up and takes charge of her florence gives him her handgives him in the fulness of her heart her lipskisses uncle sol and captain cuttle and is borne away by her young husband  but susan cannot bear that florence should go away with a mournful recollection of her she had meant to be so different that she reproaches herself bitterly intent on making one last effort to redeem her character she breaks from mr toots and runs away to find the coach and show a parting smile the captain divining her object sets off after her for he feels it his duty also to dismiss them with a cheer if possible uncle sol and mr toots are left behind together outside the church to wait for them  the coach is gone but the street is steep and narrow and blocked up and susan can see it at a standstill in the distance she is sure captain cuttle follows her as she flies down the hill and waves his glazed hat as a general signal which may attract the right coach and which may not  susan outstrips the captain and comes up with it she looks in at the window sees walter with the gentle face beside him and claps her hands and screams  miss floy my darling look at me we are all so happy now dear one more goodbye my precious one more  how susan does it she dont know but she reaches to the window kisses her and has her arms about her neck in a moment  we are all so happy now my dear miss floy says susan with a suspicious catching in her breath you you wont be angry with me now now will you  angry susan  no no i am sure you wont i say you wont my pet my dearest exclaims susan and heres the captain tooyour friend the captain you knowto say goodbye once more  hooroar my hearts delight vociferates the captain with a countenance of strong emotion hooroar walr my lad hooroar hooroar  what with the young husband at one window and the young wife at the other the captain hanging on at this door and susan nipper holding fast by that the coach obliged to go on whether it will or no and all the other carts and coaches turbulent because it hesitates there never was so much confusion on four wheels but susan nipper gallantly maintains her point she keeps a smiling face upon her mistress smiling through her tears until the last even when she is left behind the captain continues to appear and disappear at the door crying hooroar my lad hooroar my hearts delight with his shirtcollar in a violent state of agitation until it is hopeless to attempt to keep up with the coach any longer finally when the coach is gone susan nipper being rejoined by the captain falls into a state of insensibility and is taken into a bakers shop to recover  uncle sol and mr toots wait patiently in the churchyard sitting on the copingstone of the railings until captain cuttle and susan come back neither being at all desirous to speak or to be spoken to they are excellent company and quite satisfied when they all arrive again at the little midshipman and sit down to breakfast nobody can touch a morsel captain cuttle makes a feint of being voracious about toast but gives it up as a swindle mr toots says after breakfast he will come back in the evening and goes wandering about the town all day with a vague sensation upon him as if he hadnt been to bed for a fortnight  there is a strange charm in the house and in the room in which they have been used to be together and out of which so much is gone it aggravates and yet it soothes the sorrow of the separation mr toots tells susan nipper when he comes at night that he hasnt been so wretched all day long and yet he likes it he confides in susan nipper being alone with her and tells her what his feelings were when she gave him that candid opinion as to the probability of miss dombeys ever loving him in the vein of confidence engendered by these common recollections and their tears mr toots proposes that they shall go out together and buy something for supper miss nipper assenting they buy a good many little things and with the aid of mrs richards set the supper out quite showily before the captain and old sol came home  the captain and old sol have been on board the ship and have established di there and have seen the chests put aboard they have much to tell about the popularity of walter and the comforts he will have about him and the quiet way in which it seems he has been working early and late to make his cabin what the captain calls a picter to surprise his little wife a admirals cabin mind you says the captain aint more trim  but one of the captains chief delights is that he knows the big watch and the sugartongs and teaspoons are on board and again and again he murmurs to himself edard cuttle my lad you never shaped a better course in your life than when you made that there little property over jintly you see how the land bore edard says the captain and it does you credit my lad  the old instrumentmaker is more distraught and misty than he used to be and takes the marriage and the parting very much to heart but he is greatly comforted by having his old ally ned cuttle at his side and he sits down to supper with a grateful and contented face  my boy has been preserved and thrives says old sol gills rubbing his hands what right have i to be otherwise than thankful and happy  the captain who has not yet taken his seat at the table but who has been fidgeting about for some time and now stands hesitating in his place looks doubtfully at mr gills and says  sol theres the last bottle of the old madeira down below would you wish to have it up tonight my boy and drink to walr and his wife  the instrumentmaker looking wistfully at the captain puts his hand into the breastpocket of his coffeecoloured coat brings forth his pocketbook and takes a letter out  to mr dombey says the old man from walter to be sent in three weeks time ill read it  sir i am married to your daughter she is gone with me upon a distant voyage to be devoted to her is to have no claim on her or you but god knows that i am  why loving her beyond all earthly things i have yet without remorse united her to the uncertainties and dangers of my life i will not say to you you know why and you are her father  do not reproach her she has never reproached you  i do not think or hope that you will ever forgive me there is nothing i expect less but if an hour should come when it will comfort you to believe that florence has someone ever near her the great charge of whose life is to cancel her remembrance of past sorrow i solemnly assure you you may in that hour rest in that belief  solomon puts back the letter carefully in his pocketbook and puts back his pocketbook in his coat  we wont drink the last bottle of the old madeira yet ned says the old man thoughtfully not yet  not yet assents the captain no not yet  susan and mr toots are of the same opinion after a silence they all sit down to supper and drink to the young husband and wife in something else and the last bottle of the old madeira still remains among its dust and cobwebs undisturbed   a few days have elapsed and a stately ship is out at sea spreading its white wings to the favouring wind  upon the deck image to the roughest man on board of something that is graceful beautiful and harmlesssomething that it is good and pleasant to have there and that should make the voyage prosperousis florence it is night and she and walter sit alone watching the solemn path of light upon the sea between them and the moon  at length she cannot see it plainly for the tears that fill her eyes and then she lays her head down on his breast and puts her arms around his neck saying oh walter dearest love i am so happy  her husband holds her to his heart and they are very quiet and the stately ship goes on serenely  as i hear the sea says florence and sit watching it it brings so many days into my mind it makes me think so much  of paul my love i know it does  of paul and walter and the voices in the waves are always whispering to florence in their ceaseless murmuring of loveof love eternal and illimitable not bounded by the confines of this world or by the end of time but ranging still beyond the sea beyond the sky to the invisible country far away    chapter 58 after a lapse   the sea had ebbed and flowed through a whole year through a whole year the winds and clouds had come and gone the ceaseless work of time had been performed in storm and sunshine through a whole year the tides of human chance and change had set in their allotted courses through a whole year the famous house of dombey and son had fought a fight for life against cross accidents doubtful rumours unsuccessful ventures unpropitious times and most of all against the infatuation of its head who would not contract its enterprises by a hairs breadth and would not listen to a word of warning that the ship he strained so hard against the storm was weak and could not bear it the year was out and the great house was down  one summer afternoon a year wanting some odd days after the marriage in the city church there was a buzz and whisper upon change of a great failure a certain cold proud man well known there was not there nor was he represented there next day it was noised abroad that dombey and son had stopped and next night there was a list of bankrupts published headed by that name  the world was very busy now in sooth and had a deal to say it was an innocently credulous and a much illused world it was a world in which there was no other sort of bankruptcy whatever there were no conspicuous people in it trading far and wide on rotten banks of religion patriotism virtue honour there was no amount worth mentioning of mere paper in circulation on which anybody lived pretty handsomely promising to pay great sums of goodness with no effects there were no shortcomings anywhere in anything but money the world was very angry indeed and the people especially who in a worse world might have been supposed to be apt traders themselves in shows and pretences were observed to be mightily indignant  here was a new inducement to dissipation presented to that sport of circumstances mr perch the messenger it was apparently the fate of mr perch to be always waking up and finding himself famous he had but yesterday as one might say subsided into private life from the celebrity of the elopement and the events that followed it and now he was made a more important man than ever by the bankruptcy gliding from his bracket in the outer office where he now sat watching the strange faces of accountants and others who quickly superseded nearly all the old clerks mr perch had but to show himself in the court outside or at farthest in the bar of the kings arms to be asked a multitude of questions almost certain to include that interesting question what would he take to drink then would mr perch descant upon the hours of acute uneasiness he and mrs perch had suffered out at balls pond when they first suspected things was going wrong then would mr perch relate to gaping listeners in a low voice as if the corpse of the deceased house were lying unburied in the next room how mrs perch had first come to surmise that things was going wrong by hearing him perch moaning in his sleep twelve and ninepence in the pound twelve and ninepence in the pound which act of somnambulism he supposed to have originated in the impression made upon him by the change in mr dombeys face then would he inform them how he had once said might i make so bold as ask sir are you unhappy in your mind and how mr dombey had replied my faithful perchbut no it cannot be and with that had struck his hand upon his forehead and said leave me perch then in short would mr perch a victim to his position tell all manner of lies affecting himself to tears by those that were of a moving nature and really believing that the inventions of yesterday had on repetition a sort of truth about them today  mr perch always closed these conferences by meekly remarking that of course whatever his suspicions might have been as if he had ever had any it wasnt for him to betray his trust was it which sentiment there never being any creditors present was received as doing great honour to his feelings thus he generally brought away a soothed conscience and left an agreeable impression behind him when he returned to his bracket again to sit watching the strange faces of the accountants and others making so free with the great mysteries the books or now and then to go on tiptoe into mr dombeys empty room and stir the fire or to take an airing at the door and have a little more doleful chat with any straggler whom he knew or to propitiate with various small attentions the head accountant from whom mr perch had expectations of a messengership in a fire office when the affairs of the house should be wound up  to major bagstock the bankruptcy was quite a calamity the major was not a sympathetic characterhis attention being wholly concentrated on j bnor was he a man subject to lively emotions except in the physical regards of gasping and choking but he had so paraded his friend dombey at the club had so flourished him at the heads of the members in general and so put them down by continual assertion of his riches that the club being but human was delighted to retort upon the major by asking him with a show of great concern whether this tremendous smash had been at all expected and how his friend dombey bore it to such questions the major waxing very purple would reply that it was a bad world sir altogether that joey knew a thing or two but had been done sir done like an infant that if you had foretold this sir to j bagstock when he went abroad with dombey and was chasing that vagabond up and down france j bagstock would have poohpoohd youwould have poohpoohd you sir by the lord that joe had been deceived sir taken in hoodwinked blindfolded but was broad awake again and staring insomuch sir that if joes father were to rise up from the grave tomorrow he wouldnt trust the old blade with a penny piece but would tell him that his son josh was too old a soldier to be done again sir that he was a suspicious crabbed cranky usedup j b infidel sir and that if it were consistent with the dignity of a rough and tough old major of the old school who had had the honour of being personally known to and commended by their late royal highnesses the dukes of kent and york to retire to a tub and live in it by gad sir hed have a tub in pall mall tomorrow to show his contempt for mankind  of all this and many variations of the same tune the major would deliver himself with so many apoplectic symptoms such rollings of his head and such violent growls of ill usage and resentment that the younger members of the club surmised he had invested money in his friend dombeys house and lost it though the older soldiers and deeper dogs who knew joe better wouldnt hear of such a thing the unfortunate native expressing no opinion suffered dreadfully not merely in his moral feelings which were regularly fusilladed by the major every hour in the day and riddled through and through but in his sensitiveness to bodily knocks and bumps which was kept continually on the stretch for six entire weeks after the bankruptcy this miserable foreigner lived in a rainy season of bootjacks and brushes  mrs chick had three ideas upon the subject of the terrible reverse the first was that she could not understand it the second that her brother had not made an effort the third that if she had been invited to dinner on the day of that first party it never would have happened and that she had said so at the time  nobodys opinion stayed the misfortune lightened it or made it heavier it was understood that the affairs of the house were to be wound up as they best could be that mr dombey freely resigned everything he had and asked for no favour from anyone that any resumption of the business was out of the question as he would listen to no friendly negotiation having that compromise in view that he had relinquished every post of trust or distinction he had held as a man respected among merchants that he was dying according to some that he was going melancholy mad according to others that he was a broken man according to all  the clerks dispersed after holding a little dinner of condolence among themselves which was enlivened by comic singing and went off admirably some took places abroad and some engaged in other houses at home some looked up relations in the country for whom they suddenly remembered they had a particular affection and some advertised for employment in the newspapers mr perch alone remained of all the late establishment sitting on his bracket looking at the accountants or starting off it to propitiate the head accountant who was to get him into the fire office the counting house soon got to be dirty and neglected the principal slipper and dogs collar seller at the corner of the court would have doubted the propriety of throwing up his forefinger to the brim of his hat any more if mr dombey had appeared there now and the ticket porter with his hands under his white apron moralised good sound morality about ambition which he observed was not in his opinion made to rhyme to perdition for nothing  mr morfin the hazeleyed bachelor with the hair and whiskers sprinkled with grey was perhaps the only person within the atmosphere of the houseits head of course exceptedwho was heartily and deeply affected by the disaster that had befallen it he had treated mr dombey with due respect and deference through many years but he had never disguised his natural character or meanly truckled to him or pampered his master passion for the advancement of his own purposes he had therefore no selfdisrespect to avenge no longtightened springs to release with a quick recoil he worked early and late to unravel whatever was complicated or difficult in the records of the transactions of the house was always in attendance to explain whatever required explanation sat in his old room sometimes very late at night studying points by his mastery of which he could spare mr dombey the pain of being personally referred to and then would go home to islington and calm his mind by producing the most dismal and forlorn sounds out of his violoncello before going to bed  he was solacing himself with this melodious grumbler one evening and having been much dispirited by the proceedings of the day was scraping consolation out of its deepest notes when his landlady who was fortunately deaf and had no other consciousness of these performances than a sensation of something rumbling in her bones announced a lady  in mourning she said  the violoncello stopped immediately and the performer laying it on the sofa with great tenderness and care made a sign that the lady was to come in he followed directly and met harriet carker on the stair  alone he said and john here this morning is there anything the matter my dear but no he added your face tells quite another story  i am afraid it is a selfish revelation that you see there then she answered  it is a very pleasant one said he and if selfish a novelty too worth seeing in you but i dont believe that  he had placed a chair for her by this time and sat down opposite the violoncello lying snugly on the sofa between them  you will not be surprised at my coming alone or at johns not having told you i was coming said harriet and you will believe that when i tell you why i have come may i do so now  you can do nothing better  you were not busy  he pointed to the violoncello lying on the sofa and said i have been all day heres my witness i have been confiding all my cares to it i wish i had none but my own to tell  is the house at an end said harriet earnestly  completely at an end  will it never be resumed  never  the bright expression of her face was not overshadowed as her lips silently repeated the word he seemed to observe this with some little involuntary surprise and said again  never you remember what i told you it has been all along impossible to convince him impossible to reason with him sometimes impossible even to approach him the worst has happened and the house has fallen never to be built up any more  and mr dombey is he personally ruined  ruined  will he have no private fortune left nothing  a certain eagerness in her voice and something that was almost joyful in her look seemed to surprise him more and more to disappoint him too and jar discordantly against his own emotions he drummed with the fingers of one hand on the table looking wistfully at her and shaking his head said after a pause  the extent of mr dombeys resources is not accurately within my knowledge but though they are doubtless very large his obligations are enormous he is a gentleman of high honour and integrity any man in his position could and many a man in his position would have saved himself by making terms which would have very slightly almost insensibly increased the losses of those who had had dealings with him and left him a remnant to live upon but he is resolved on payment to the last farthing of his means his own words are that they will clear or nearly clear the house and that no one can lose much ah miss harriet it would do us no harm to remember oftener than we do that vices are sometimes only virtues carried to excess his pride shows well in this  she heard him with little or no change in her expression and with a divided attention that showed her to be busy with something in her own mind when he was silent she asked him hurriedly  have you seen him lately  no one sees him when this crisis of his affairs renders it necessary for him to come out of his house he comes out for the occasion and again goes home and shuts himself up and will sea no one he has written me a letter acknowledging our past connexion in higher terms than it deserved and parting from me i am delicate of obtruding myself upon him now never having had much intercourse with him in better times but i have tried to do so i have written gone there entreated quite in vain  he watched her as in the hope that she would testify some greater concern than she had yet shown and spoke gravely and feelingly as if to impress her the more but there was no change in her  well well miss harriet he said with a disappointed air this is not to the purpose you have not come here to hear this some other and pleasanter theme is in your mind let it be in mine too and we shall talk upon more equal terms come  no it is the same theme returned harriet with frank and quick surprise is it not likely that it should be is it not natural that john and i should have been thinking and speaking very much of late of these great changes mr dombey whom he served so many yearsyou know upon what termsreduced as you describe and we quite rich  good true face as that face of hers was and pleasant as it had been to him mr morfin the hazeleyed bachelor since the first time he had ever looked upon it it pleased him less at that moment lighted with a ray of exultation than it had ever pleased him before  i need not remind you said harriet casting down her eyes upon her black dress through what means our circumstances changed you have not forgotten that our brother james upon that dreadful day left no will no relations but ourselves  the face was pleasanter to him now though it was pale and melancholy than it had been a moment since he seemed to breathe more cheerily  you know she said our history the history of both my brothers in connexion with the unfortunate unhappy gentleman of whom you have spoken so truly you know how few our wants arejohns and mineand what little use we have for money after the life we have led together for so many years and now that he is earning an income that is ample for us through your kindness you are not unprepared to hear what favour i have come to ask of you  i hardly know i was a minute ago now i think i am not  of my dead brother i say nothing if the dead know what we dobut you understand me of my living brother i could say much but what need i say more than that this act of duty in which i have come to ask your indispensable assistance is his own and that he cannot rest until it is performed  she raised her eyes again and the light of exultation in her face began to appear beautiful in the observant eyes that watched her  dear sir she went on to say it must be done very quietly and secretly your experience and knowledge will point out a way of doing it mr dombey may perhaps be led to believe that it is something saved unexpectedly from the wreck of his fortunes or that it is a voluntary tribute to his honourable and upright character from some of those with whom he has had great dealings or that it is some old lost debt repaid there must be many ways of doing it i know you will choose the best the favour i have come to ask is that you will do it for us in your own kind generous considerate manner that you will never speak of it to john whose chief happiness in this act of restitution is to do it secretly unknown and unapproved of that only a very small part of the inheritance may be reserved to us until mr dombey shall have possessed the interest of the rest for the remainder of his life that you will keep our secret faithfullybut that i am sure you will and that from this time it may seldom be whispered even between you and me but may live in my thoughts only as a new reason for thankfulness to heaven and joy and pride in my brother  such a look of exultation there may be on angels faces when the one repentant sinner enters heaven among ninetynine just men it was not dimmed or tarnished by the joyful tears that filled her eyes but was the brighter for them  my dear harriet said mr morfin after a silence i was not prepared for this do i understand you that you wish to make your own part in the inheritance available for your good purpose as well as johns  oh yes she returned when we have shared everything together for so long a time and have had no care hope or purpose apart could i bear to be excluded from my share in this may i not urge a claim to be my brothers partner and companion to the last  heaven forbid that i should dispute it he replied  we may rely on your friendly help she said i knew we might  i should be a worse man thanthan i hope i am or would willingly believe myself if i could not give you that assurance from my heart and soul you may implicitly upon my honour i will keep your secret and if it should be found that mr dombey is so reduced as i fear he will be acting on a determination that there seem to be no means of influencing i will assist you to accomplish the design on which you and john are jointly resolved  she gave him her hand and thanked him with a cordial happy face  harriet he said detaining it in his to speak to you of the worth of any sacrifice that you can make nowabove all of any sacrifice of mere moneywould be idle and presumptuous to put before you any appeal to reconsider your purpose or to set narrow limits to it would be i feel not less so i have no right to mar the great end of a great history by any obtrusion of my own weak self i have every right to bend my head before what you confide to me satisfied that it comes from a higher and better source of inspiration than my poor worldly knowledge i will say only this i am your faithful steward and i would rather be so and your chosen friend than i would be anybody in the world except yourself  she thanked him again cordially and wished him goodnight are you going home he said let me go with you  not tonight i am not going home now i have a visit to make alone will you come tomorrow  well well said he ill come tomorrow in the meantime ill think of this and how we can best proceed and perhaps ill think of it dear harriet andandthink of me a little in connexion with it  he handed her down to a coach she had in waiting at the door and if his landlady had not been deaf she would have heard him muttering as he went back upstairs when the coach had driven off that we were creatures of habit and it was a sorrowful habit to be an old bachelor  the violoncello lying on the sofa between the two chairs he took it up without putting away the vacant chair and sat droning on it and slowly shaking his head at the vacant chair for a long long time the expression he communicated to the instrument at first though monstrously pathetic and bland was nothing to the expression he communicated to his own face and bestowed upon the empty chair which was so sincere that he was obliged to have recourse to captain cuttles remedy more than once and to rub his face with his sleeve by degrees however the violoncello in unison with his own frame of mind glided melodiously into the harmonious blacksmith which he played over and over again until his ruddy and serene face gleamed like true metal on the anvil of a veritable blacksmith in fine the violoncello and the empty chair were the companions of his bachelorhood until nearly midnight and when he took his supper the violoncello set up on end in the sofa corner big with the latent harmony of a whole foundry full of harmonious blacksmiths seemed to ogle the empty chair out of its crooked eyes with unutterable intelligence  when harriet left the house the driver of her hired coach taking a course that was evidently no new one to him went in and out by byeways through that part of the suburbs until he arrived at some open ground where there were a few quiet little old houses standing among gardens at the gardengate of one of these he stopped and harriet alighted  her gentle ringing at the bell was responded to by a dolorouslooking woman of light complexion with raised eyebrows and head drooping on one side who curtseyed at sight of her and conducted her across the garden to the house  how is your patient nurse tonight said harriet  in a poor way miss i am afraid oh how she do remind me sometimes of my uncles betsey jane returned the woman of the light complexion in a sort of doleful rapture  in what respect asked harriet  miss in all respects replied the other except that shes grown up and betsey jane when at deaths door was but a child  but you have told me she recovered observed harriet mildly so there is the more reason for hope mrs wickam  ah miss hope is an excellent thing for such as has the spirits to bear it said mrs wickam shaking her head my own spirits is not equal to it but i dont owe it any grudge i envys them that is so blest  you should try to be more cheerful remarked harriet  thank you miss im sure said mrs wickam grimly if i was so inclined the loneliness of this situationyoull excuse my speaking so freewould put it out of my power in four and twenty hours but i aint at all id rather not the little spirits that i ever had i was bereaved of at brighton some few years ago and i think i feel myself the better for it  in truth this was the very mrs wickam who had superseded mrs richards as the nurse of little paul and who considered herself to have gained the loss in question under the roof of the amiable pipchin the excellent and thoughtful old system hallowed by long prescription which has usually picked out from the rest of mankind the most dreary and uncomfortable people that could possibly be laid hold of to act as instructors of youth fingerposts to the virtues matrons monitors attendants on sick beds and the like had established mrs wickam in very good business as a nurse and had led to her serious qualities being particularly commended by an admiring and numerous connexion  mrs wickam with her eyebrows elevated and her head on one side lighted the way upstairs to a clean neat chamber opening on another chamber dimly lighted where there was a bed in the first room an old woman sat mechanically staring out at the open window on the darkness in the second stretched upon the bed lay the shadow of a figure that had spurned the wind and rain one wintry night hardly to be recognised now but by the long black hair that showed so very black against the colourless face and all the white things about it  oh the strong eyes and the weak frame the eyes that turned so eagerly and brightly to the door when harriet came in the feeble head that could not raise itself and moved so slowly round upon its pillow  alice said the visitors mild voice am i late tonight  you always seem late but are always early  harriet had sat down by the bedside now and put her hand upon the thin hand lying there  you are better  mrs wickam standing at the foot of the bed like a disconsolate spectre most decidedly and forcibly shook her head to negative this position  it matters very little said alice with a faint smile better or worse today is but a days differenceperhaps not so much  mrs wickam as a serious character expressed her approval with a groan and having made some cold dabs at the bottom of the bedclothes as feeling for the patients feet and expecting to find them stony went clinking among the medicine bottles on the table as who should say while we are here let us repeat the mixture as before  no said alice whispering to her visitor evil courses and remorse travel want and weather storm within and storm without have worn my life away it will not last much longer  she drew the hand up as she spoke and laid her face against it  i lie here sometimes thinking i should like to live until i had had a little time to show you how grateful i could be it is a weakness and soon passes better for you as it is better for me  how different her hold upon the hand from what it had been when she took it by the fireside on the bleak winter evening scorn rage defiance recklessness look here this is the end  mrs wickam having clinked sufficiently among the bottles now produced the mixture mrs wickam looked hard at her patient in the act of drinking screwed her mouth up tight her eyebrows also and shook her head expressing that tortures shouldnt make her say it was a hopeless case mrs wickam then sprinkled a little coolingstuff about the room with the air of a female gravedigger who was strewing ashes on ashes dust on dustfor she was a serious characterand withdrew to partake of certain funeral baked meats downstairs  how long is it asked alice since i went to you and told you what i had done and when you were advised it was too late for anyone to follow  it is a year and more said harriet  a year and more said alice thoughtfully intent upon her face months upon months since you brought me here  harriet answered yes  brought me here by force of gentleness and kindness me said alice shrinking with her face behind her hand and made me human by womans looks and words and angels deeds  harriet bending over her composed and soothed her by and bye alice lying as before with the hand against her face asked to have her mother called  harriet called to her more than once but the old woman was so absorbed looking out at the open window on the darkness that she did not hear it was not until harriet went to her and touched her that she rose up and came  mother said alice taking the hand again and fixing her lustrous eyes lovingly upon her visitor while she merely addressed a motion of her finger to the old woman tell her what you know  tonight my deary  ay mother answered alice faintly and solemnly tonight  the old woman whose wits appeared disorderly by alarm remorse or grief came creeping along the side of the bed opposite to that on which harriet sat and kneeling down so as to bring her withered face upon a level with the coverlet and stretching out her hand so as to touch her daughters arm began  my handsome gal  heaven what a cry was that with which she stopped there gazing at the poor form lying on the bed  changed long ago mother withered long ago said alice without looking at her dont grieve for that now  my daughter faltered the old woman my gal wholl soon get better and shame em all with her good looks  alice smiled mournfully at harriet and fondled her hand a little closer but said nothing  wholl soon get better i say repeated the old woman menacing the vacant air with her shrivelled fist and wholl shame em all with her good looksshe will i say she will she shallas if she were in passionate contention with some unseen opponent at the bedside who contradicted hermy daughter has been turned away from and cast out but she could boast relationship to proud folks too if she chose ah to proud folks theres relationship without your clergy and your wedding ringsthey may make it but they cant break itand my daughters well related show me mrs dombey and ill show you my alices first cousin  harriet glanced from the old woman to the lustrous eyes intent upon her face and derived corroboration from them  what cried the old woman her nodding head bridling with a ghastly vanity though i am old and ugly nowmuch older by life and habit than years thoughi was once as young as any ah as pretty too as many i was a fresh country wench in my time darling stretching out her arm to harriet across the bed and looked it too down in my country mrs dombeys father and his brother were the gayest gentlemen and the bestliked that came a visiting from londonthey have long been dead though lord lord this long while the brother who was my allys father longest of the two  she raised her head a little and peered at her daughters face as if from the remembrance of her own youth she had flown to the remembrance of her childs then suddenly she laid her face down on the bed and shut her head up in her hands and arms  they were as like said the old woman without looking up as you could see two brothers so near an agethere wasnt much more than a year between them as i recollectand if you could have seen my gal as i have seen her once side by side with the others daughter youd have seen for all the difference of dress and life that they were like each other oh is the likeness gone and is it my galonly my galthats to change so  we shall all change mother in our turn said alice  turn cried the old woman but why not hers as soon as my gals the mother must have changedshe looked as old as me and full as wrinkled through her paintbut she was handsome what have i done i what have i done worse than her that only my gal is to lie there fading with another of those wild cries she went running out into the room from which she had come but immediately in her uncertain mood returned and creeping up to harriet said  thats what alice bade me tell you deary thats all i found it out when i began to ask who she was and all about her away in warwickshire there one summertime such relations was no good to me then they wouldnt have owned me and had nothing to give me i should have asked em maybe for a little money afterwards if it hadnt been for my alice shed amost have killed me if i had i think she was as proud as tother in her way said the old woman touching the face of her daughter fearfully and withdrawing her hand for all shes so quiet now but shell shame em with her good looks yet ha ha shell shame em will my handsome daughter  her laugh as she retreated was worse than her cry worse than the burst of imbecile lamentation in which it ended worse than the doting air with which she sat down in her old seat and stared out at the darkness  the eyes of alice had all this time been fixed on harriet whose hand she had never released she said now  i have felt lying here that i should like you to know this it might explain i have thought something that used to help to harden me i had heard so much in my wrongdoing of my neglected duty that i took up with the belief that duty had not been done to me and that as the seed was sown the harvest grew i somehow made it out that when ladies had bad homes and mothers they went wrong in their way too but that their way was not so foul a one as mine and they had need to bless god for it that is all past it is like a dream now which i cannot quite remember or understand it has been more and more like a dream every day since you began to sit here and to read to me i only tell it you as i can recollect it will you read to me a little more  harriet was withdrawing her hand to open the book when alice detained it for a moment  you will not forget my mother i forgive her if i have any cause i know that she forgives me and is sorry in her heart you will not forget her  never alice  a moment yet lay your head so dear that as you read i may see the words in your kind face  harriet complied and readread the eternal book for all the weary and the heavyladen for all the wretched fallen and neglected of this earthread the blessed history in which the blind lame palsied beggar the criminal the woman stained with shame the shunned of all our dainty clay has each a portion that no human pride indifference or sophistry through all the ages that this world shall last can take away or by the thousandth atom of a grain reduceread the ministry of him who through the round of human life and all its hopes and griefs from birth to death from infancy to age had sweet compassion for and interest in its every scene and stage its every suffering and sorrow  i shall come said harriet when she shut the book very early in the morning  the lustrous eyes yet fixed upon her face closed for a moment then opened and alice kissed and blest her  the same eyes followed her to the door and in their light and on the tranquil face there was a smile when it was closed  they never turned away she laid her hand upon her breast murmuring the sacred name that had been read to her and life passed from her face like light removed  nothing lay there any longer but the ruin of the mortal house on which the rain had beaten and the black hair that had fluttered in the wintry wind    chapter 59 retribution   changes have come again upon the great house in the long dull street once the scene of florences childhood and loneliness it is a great house still proof against wind and weather without breaches in the roof or shattered windows or dilapidated walls but it is a ruin none the less and the rats fly from it  mr towlinson and company are at first incredulous in respect of the shapeless rumours that they hear cook says our peoples credit aint so easy shook as that comes to thank god and mr towlinson expects to hear it reported next that the bank of englands agoing to break or the jewels in the tower to be sold up but next come the gazette and mr perch and mr perch brings mrs perch to talk it over in the kitchen and to spend a pleasant evening  as soon as there is no doubt about it mr towlinsons main anxiety is that the failure should be a good round onenot less than a hundred thousand pound mr perch dont think himself that a hundred thousand pound will nearly cover it the women led by mrs perch and cook often repeat a hundred thousand pound with awful satisfactionas if handling the words were like handling the money and the housemaid who has her eye on mr towlinson wishes she had only a hundredth part of the sum to bestow on the man of her choice mr towlinson still mindful of his old wrong opines that a foreigner would hardly know what to do with so much money unless he spent it on his whiskers which bitter sarcasm causes the housemaid to withdraw in tears  but not to remain long absent for cook who has the reputation of being extremely goodhearted says whatever they do let em stand by one another now towlinson for theres no telling how soon they may be divided they have been in that house says cook through a funeral a wedding and a runningaway and let it not be said that they couldnt agree among themselves at such a time as the present mrs perch is immensely affected by this moving address and openly remarks that cook is an angel mr towlinson replies to cook far be it from him to stand in the way of that good feeling which he could wish to see and adjourning in quest of the housemaid and presently returning with that young lady on his arm informs the kitchen that foreigners is only his fun and that him and anne have now resolved to take one another for better for worse and to settle in oxford market in the general greengrocery and herb and leech line where your kind favours is particular requested this announcement is received with acclamation and mrs perch projecting her soul into futurity says girls in cooks ear in a solemn whisper  misfortune in the family without feasting in these lower regions couldnt be therefore cook tosses up a hot dish or two for supper and mr towlinson compounds a lobster salad to be devoted to the same hospitable purpose even mrs pipchin agitated by the occasion rings her bell and sends down word that she requests to have that little bit of sweetbread that was left warmed up for her supper and sent to her on a tray with about a quarter of a tumblerfull of mulled sherry for she feels poorly  there is a little talk about mr dombey but very little it is chiefly speculation as to how long he has known that this was going to happen cook says shrewdly oh a long time bless you take your oath of that and reference being made to mr perch he confirms her view of the case somebody wonders what hell do and whether hell go out in any situation mr towlinson thinks not and hints at a refuge in one of them genteel almshouses of the better kind ah where hell have his little garden you know says cook plaintively and bring up sweet peas in the spring exactly so says mr towlinson and be one of the brethren of something or another we are all brethren says mrs perch in a pause of her drink except the sisters says mr perch how are the mighty fallen remarks cook pride shall have a fall and it always was and will be so observes the housemaid  it is wonderful how good they feel in making these reflections and what a christian unanimity they are sensible of in bearing the common shock with resignation there is only one interruption to this excellent state of mind which is occasioned by a young kitchenmaid of inferior rankin black stockingswho having sat with her mouth open for a long time unexpectedly discharges from it words to this effect suppose the wages shouldnt be paid the company sit for a moment speechless but cook recovering first turns upon the young woman and requests to know how she dares insult the family whose bread she eats by such a dishonest supposition and whether she thinks that anybody with a scrap of honour left could deprive poor servants of their pittance because if that is your religious feelings mary daws says cook warmly i dont know where you mean to go to  mr towlinson dont know either nor anybody and the young kitchenmaid appearing not to know exactly herself and scouted by the general voice is covered with confusion as with a garment  after a few days strange people begin to call at the house and to make appointments with one another in the diningroom as if they lived there especially there is a gentleman of a mosaic arabian cast of countenance with a very massive watchguard who whistles in the drawingroom and while he is waiting for the other gentleman who always has pen and ink in his pocket asks mr towlinson by the easy name of old cock if he happens to know what the figure of them crimson and gold hangings might have been when new bought the callers and appointments in the diningroom become more numerous every day and every gentleman seems to have pen and ink in his pocket and to have some occasion to use it at last it is said that there is going to be a sale and then more people arrive with pen and ink in their pockets commanding a detachment of men with carpet caps who immediately begin to pull up the carpets and knock the furniture about and to print off thousands of impressions of their shoes upon the hall and staircase  the council downstairs are in full conclave all this time and having nothing to do perform perfect feats of eating at length they are one day summoned in a body to mrs pipchins room and thus addressed by the fair peruvian  your masters in difficulties says mrs pipchin tartly you know that i suppose  mr towlinson as spokesman admits a general knowledge of the fact  and youre all on the lookout for yourselves i warrant you says mrs pipchin shaking her head at them  a shrill voice from the rear exclaims no more than yourself  thats your opinion mrs impudence is it says the ireful pipchin looking with a fiery eye over the intermediate heads  yes mrs pipchin it is replies cook advancing and what then pray  why then you may go as soon as you like says mrs pipchin the sooner the better and i hope i shall never see your face again  with this the doughty pipchin produces a canvas bag and tells her wages out to that day and a month beyond it and clutches the money tight until a receipt for the same is duly signed to the last upstroke when she grudgingly lets it go this form of proceeding mrs pipchin repeats with every member of the household until all are paid  now those that choose can go about their business says mrs pipchin and those that choose can stay here on board wages for a week or so and make themselves useful except says the inflammable pipchin that slut of a cook wholl go immediately  that says cook she certainly will i wish you good day mrs pipchin and sincerely wish i could compliment you on the sweetness of your appearance  get along with you says mrs pipchin stamping her foot  cook sails off with an air of beneficent dignity highly exasperating to mrs pipchin and is shortly joined below stairs by the rest of the confederation  mr towlinson then says that in the first place he would beg to propose a little snack of something to eat and over that snack would desire to offer a suggestion which he thinks will meet the position in which they find themselves the refreshment being produced and very heartily partaken of mr towlinsons suggestion is in effect that cook is going and that if we are not true to ourselves nobody will be true to us that they have lived in that house a long time and exerted themselves very much to be sociable together at this cook says with emotion hear hear and mrs perch who is there again and full to the throat sheds tears and that he thinks at the present time the feeling ought to be go one go all the housemaid is much affected by this generous sentiment and warmly seconds it cook says she feels its right and only hopes its not done as a compliment to her but from a sense of duty mr towlinson replies from a sense of duty and that now he is driven to express his opinions he will openly say that he does not think it overrespectable to remain in a house where sales and suchlike are carrying forwards the housemaid is sure of it and relates in confirmation that a strange man in a carpet cap offered this very morning to kiss her on the stairs hereupon mr towlinson is starting from his chair to seek and smash the offender when he is laid hold on by the ladies who beseech him to calm himself and to reflect that it is easier and wiser to leave the scene of such indecencies at once mrs perch presenting the case in a new light even shows that delicacy towards mr dombey shut up in his own rooms imperatively demands precipitate retreat for what says the good woman must his feelings be if he was to come upon any of the poor servants that he once deceived into thinking him immensely rich cook is so struck by this moral consideration that mrs perch improves it with several pious axioms original and selected it becomes a clear case that they must all go boxes are packed cabs fetched and at dusk that evening there is not one member of the party left  the house stands large and weatherproof in the long dull street but it is a ruin and the rats fly from it  the men in the carpet caps go on tumbling the furniture about and the gentlemen with the pens and ink make out inventories of it and sit upon pieces of furniture never made to be sat upon and eat bread and cheese from the publichouse on other pieces of furniture never made to be eaten on and seem to have a delight in appropriating precious articles to strange uses chaotic combinations of furniture also take place mattresses and bedding appear in the diningroom the glass and china get into the conservatory the great dinner service is set out in heaps on the long divan in the large drawingroom and the stairwires made into fasces decorate the marble chimneypieces finally a rug with a printed bill upon it is hung out from the balcony and a similar appendage graces either side of the hall door  then all day long there is a retinue of mouldy gigs and chaisecarts in the street and herds of shabby vampires jew and christian overrun the house sounding the plateglass minors with their knuckles striking discordant octaves on the grand piano drawing wet forefingers over the pictures breathing on the blades of the best dinnerknives punching the squabs of chairs and sofas with their dirty fists touzling the feather beds opening and shutting all the drawers balancing the silver spoons and forks looking into the very threads of the drapery and linen and disparaging everything there is not a secret place in the whole house fluffy and snuffy strangers stare into the kitchenrange as curiously as into the attic clothespress stout men with napless hats on look out of the bedroom windows and cut jokes with friends in the street quiet calculating spirits withdraw into the dressingrooms with catalogues and make marginal notes thereon with stumps of pencils two brokers invade the very fireescape and take a panoramic survey of the neighbourhood from the top of the house the swarm and buzz and going up and down endure for days the capital modern household furniture c is on view  then there is a palisade of tables made in the best drawingroom and on the capital frenchpolished extending telescopic range of spanish mahogany diningtables with turned legs the pulpit of the auctioneer is erected and the herds of shabby vampires jew and christian the strangers fluffy and snuffy and the stout men with the napless hats congregate about it and sit upon everything within reach mantelpieces included and begin to bid hot humming and dusty are the rooms all day andhigh above the heat hum and dustthe head and shoulders voice and hammer of the auctioneer are ever at work the men in the carpet caps get flustered and vicious with tumbling the lots about and still the lots are going going gone still coming on sometimes there is joking and a general roar this lasts all day and three days following the capital modern household furniture c is on sale  then the mouldy gigs and chaisecarts reappear and with them come springvans and waggons and an army of porters with knots all day long the men with carpet caps are screwing at screwdrivers and bedwinches or staggering by the dozen together on the staircase under heavy burdens or upheaving perfect rocks of spanish mahogany best rosewood or plateglass into the gigs and chaisecarts vans and waggons all sorts of vehicles of burden are in attendance from a tilted waggon to a wheelbarrow poor pauls little bedstead is carried off in a donkeytandem for nearly a whole week the capital modern household furniture  c is in course of removal  at last it is all gone nothing is left about the house but scattered leaves of catalogues littered scraps of straw and hay and a battery of pewter pots behind the halldoor the men with the carpetcaps gather up their screwdrivers and bedwinches into bags shoulder them and walk off one of the penandink gentlemen goes over the house as a last attention sticking up bills in the windows respecting the lease of this desirable family mansion and shutting the shutters at length he follows the men with the carpet caps none of the invaders remain the house is a ruin and the rats fly from it  mrs pipchins apartments together with those locked rooms on the groundfloor where the windowblinds are drawn down close have been spared the general devastation mrs pipchin has remained austere and stony during the proceedings in her own room or has occasionally looked in at the sale to see what the goods are fetching and to bid for one particular easy chair mrs pipchin has been the highest bidder for the easy chair and sits upon her property when mrs chick comes to see her  how is my brother mrs pipchin says mrs chick  i dont know any more than the deuce says mrs pipchin he never does me the honour to speak to me he has his meat and drink put in the next room to his own and what he takes he comes out and takes when theres nobody there its no use asking me i know no more about him than the man in the south who burnt his mouth by eating cold plum porridge  this the acrimonious pipchin says with a flounce  but good gracious me cries mrs chick blandly how long is this to last if my brother will not make an effort mrs pipchin what is to become of him i am sure i should have thought he had seen enough of the consequences of not making an effort by this time to be warned against that fatal error  hoity toity says mrs pipchin rubbing her nose theres a great fuss i think about it it aint so wonderful a case people have had misfortunes before now and been obliged to part with their furniture im sure i have  my brother pursues mrs chick profoundly is so peculiarso strange a man he is the most peculiar man i ever saw would anyone believe that when he received news of the marriage and emigration of that unnatural childits a comfort to me now to remember that i always said there was something extraordinary about that child but nobody minds mewould anybody believe i say that he should then turn round upon me and say he had supposed from my manner that she had come to my house why my gracious and would anybody believe that when i merely say to him paul i may be very foolish and i have no doubt i am but i cannot understand how your affairs can have got into this state he should actually fly at me and request that i will come to see him no more until he asks me why my goodness  ah says mrs pipchin its a pity he hadnt a little more to do with mines theyd have tried his temper for him  and what resumes mrs chick quite regardless of mrs pipchins observations is it to end in thats what i want to know what does my brother mean to do he must do something its of no use remaining shut up in his own rooms business wont come to him no he must go to it then why dont he go he knows where to go i suppose having been a man of business all his life very good then why not go there  mrs chick after forging this powerful chain of reasoning remains silent for a minute to admire it  besides says the discreet lady with an argumentative air who ever heard of such obstinacy as his staying shut up here through all these dreadful disagreeables its not as if there was no place for him to go to of course he could have come to our house he knows he is at home there i suppose mr chick has perfectly bored about it and i said with my own lips why surely paul you dont imagine that because your affairs have got into this state you are the less at home to such near relatives as ourselves you dont imagine that we are like the rest of the world but no here he stays all through and here he is why good gracious me suppose the house was to be let what would he do then he couldnt remain here then if he attempted to do so there would be an ejectment an action for doe and all sorts of things and then he must go then why not go at first instead of at last and that brings me back to what i said just now and i naturally ask what is to be the end of it  i know whats to be the end of it as far as i am concerned replies mrs pipchin and thats enough for me im going to take myself off in a jiffy  in a which mrs pipchin says mrs chick  in a jiffy retorts mrs pipchin sharply  ah well really i cant blame you mrs pipchin says mrs chick with frankness  it would be pretty much the same to me if you could replies the sardonic pipchin at any rate im going i cant stop here i should be dead in a week i had to cook my own pork chop yesterday and im not used to it my constitution will be giving way next besides i had a very fair connexion at brighton when i came herelittle pankeys folks alone were worth a good eighty pounds ayear to meand i cant afford to throw it away ive written to my niece and she expects me by this time  have you spoken to my brother inquires mrs chick  oh yes its very easy to say speak to him retorts mrs pipchin how is it done i called out to him yesterday that i was no use here and that he had better let me send for mrs richards he grunted something or other that meant yes and i sent grunt indeed if he had been mr pipchin hed have had some reason to grunt yah ive no patience with it  here this exemplary female who has pumped up so much fortitude and virtue from the depths of the peruvian mines rises from her cushioned property to see mrs chick to the door mrs chick deploring to the last the peculiar character of her brother noiselessly retires much occupied with her own sagacity and clearness of head  in the dusk of the evening mr toodle being off duty arrives with polly and a box and leaves them with a sounding kiss in the hall of the empty house the retired character of which affects mr toodles spirits strongly  i tell you what polly me dear says mr toodle being now an inginedriver and well to do in the world i shouldnt allow of your coming here to be made dulllike if it warnt for favours past but favours past polly is never to be forgot to them which is in adversity besides your face is a cordl so lets have another kiss on it my dear you wish no better than to do a right act i know and my views is that its right and dutiful to do this goodnight polly  mrs pipchin by this time looms dark in her black bombazeen skirts black bonnet and shawl and has her personal property packed up and has her chair late a favourite chair of mr dombeys and the dead bargain of the sale ready near the street door and is only waiting for a flyvan going tonight to brighton on private service which is to call for her by private contract and convey her home  presently it comes mrs pipchins wardrobe being handed in and stowed away mrs pipchins chair is next handed in and placed in a convenient corner among certain trusses of hay it being the intention of the amiable woman to occupy the chair during her journey mrs pipchin herself is next handed in and grimly takes her seat there is a snaky gleam in her hard grey eye as of anticipated rounds of buttered toast relays of hot chops worryings and quellings of young children sharp snappings at poor berry and all the other delights of her ogresss castle mrs pipchin almost laughs as the flyvan drives off and she composes her black bombazeen skirts and settles herself among the cushions of her easy chair  the house is such a ruin that the rats have fled and there is not one left  but polly though alone in the deserted mansionfor there is no companionship in the shutup rooms in which its late master hides his headis not alone long it is night and she is sitting at work in the housekeepers room trying to forget what a lonely house it is and what a history belongs to it when there is a knock at the hall door as loud sounding as any knock can be striking into such an empty place opening it she returns across the echoing hall accompanied by a female figure in a close black bonnet it is miss tox and miss toxs eyes are red  oh polly says miss tox when i looked in to have a little lesson with the children just now i got the message that you left for me and as soon as i could recover my spirits at all i came on after you is there no one here but you  ah not a soul says polly  have you seen him whispers miss tox  bless you returns polly no he has not been seen this many a day they tell me he never leaves his room  is he said to be ill inquires miss tox  no maam not that i know of returns polly except in his mind he must be very bad there poor gentleman  miss toxs sympathy is such that she can scarcely speak she is no chicken but she has not grown tough with age and celibacy her heart is very tender her compassion very genuine her homage very real beneath the locket with the fishy eye in it miss tox bears better qualities than many a less whimsical outside such qualities as will outlive by many courses of the sun the best outsides and brightest husks that fall in the harvest of the great reaper  it is long before miss tox goes away and before polly with a candle flaring on the blank stairs looks after her for company down the street and feels unwilling to go back into the dreary house and jar its emptiness with the heavy fastenings of the door and glide away to bed but all this polly does and in the morning sets in one of those darkened rooms such matters as she has been advised to prepare and then retires and enters them no more until next morning at the same hour there are bells there but they never ring and though she can sometimes hear a footfall going to and fro it never comes out  miss tox returns early in the day it then begins to be miss toxs occupation to prepare little daintiesor what are such to herto be carried into these rooms next morning she derives so much satisfaction from the pursuit that she enters on it regularly from that time and brings daily in her little basket various choice condiments selected from the scanty stores of the deceased owner of the powdered head and pigtail she likewise brings in sheets of curlpaper morsels of cold meats tongues of sheep halves of fowls for her own dinner and sharing these collations with polly passes the greater part of her time in the ruined house that the rats have fled from hiding in a fright at every sound stealing in and out like a criminal only desiring to be true to the fallen object of her admiration unknown to him unknown to all the world but one poor simple woman  the major knows it but no one is the wiser for that though the major is much the merrier the major in a fit of curiosity has charged the native to watch the house sometimes and find out what becomes of dombey the native has reported miss toxs fidelity and the major has nearly choked himself dead with laughter he is permanently bluer from that hour and constantly wheezes to himself his lobster eyes starting out of his head damme sir the womans a born idiot  and the ruined man how does he pass the hours alone  let him remember it in that room years to come he did remember it it was heavy on his mind now heavier than all the rest  let him remember it in that room years to come the rain that falls upon the roof the wind that mourns outside the door may have foreknowledge in their melancholy sound let him remember it in that room years to come  he did remember it in the miserable night he thought of it in the dreary day the wretched dawn the ghostly memoryhaunted twilight he did remember it in agony in sorrow in remorse in despair papa papa speak to me dear papa he heard the words again and saw the face he saw it fall upon the trembling hands and heard the one prolonged low cry go upward  he was fallen never to be raised up any more for the night of his worldly ruin there was no tomorrows sun for the stain of his domestic shame there was no purification nothing thank heaven could bring his dead child back to life but that which he might have made so different in all the pastwhich might have made the past itself so different though this he hardly thought of nowthat which was his own work that which he could so easily have wrought into a blessing and had set himself so steadily for years to form into a curse that was the sharp grief of his soul  oh he did remember it the rain that fell upon the roof the wind that mourned outside the door that night had had foreknowledge in their melancholy sound he knew now what he had done he knew now that he had called down that upon his head which bowed it lower than the heaviest stroke of fortune he knew now what it was to be rejected and deserted now when every loving blossom he had withered in his innocent daughters heart was snowing down in ashes on him  he thought of her as she had been that night when he and his bride came home he thought of her as she had been in all the homeevents of the abandoned house he thought now that of all around him she alone had never changed his boy had faded into dust his proud wife had sunk into a polluted creature his flatterer and friend had been transformed into the worst of villains his riches had melted away the very walls that sheltered him looked on him as a stranger she alone had turned the same mild gentle look upon him always yes to the latest and the last she had never changed to himnor had he ever changed to herand she was lost  as one by one they fell away before his mindhis babyhope his wife his friend his fortuneoh how the mist through which he had seen her cleared and showed him her true self oh how much better than this that he had loved her as he had his boy and lost her as he had his boy and laid them in their early grave together  in his pridefor he was proud yethe let the world go from him freely as it fell away he shook it off whether he imagined its face as expressing pity for him or indifference to him he shunned it alike it was in the same degree to be avoided in either aspect he had no idea of any one companion in his misery but the one he had driven away what he would have said to her or what consolation submitted to receive from her he never pictured to himself but he always knew she would have been true to him if he had suffered her he always knew she would have loved him better now than at any other time he was as certain that it was in her nature as he was that there was a sky above him and he sat thinking so in his loneliness from hour to hour day after day uttered this speech night after night showed him this knowledge  it began beyond all doubt however slow it advanced for some time in the receipt of her young husbands letter and the certainty that she was gone and yetso proud he was in his ruin or so reminiscent of her only as something that might have been his but was lost beyond redemptionthat if he could have heard her voice in an adjoining room he would not have gone to her if he could have seen her in the street and she had done no more than look at him as she had been used to look he would have passed on with his old cold unforgiving face and not addressed her or relaxed it though his heart should have broken soon afterwards however turbulent his thoughts or harsh his anger had been at first concerning her marriage or her husband that was all past now he chiefly thought of what might have been and what was not what was was all summed up in this that she was lost and he bowed down with sorrow and remorse  and now he felt that he had had two children born to him in that house and that between him and the bare wide empty walls there was a tie mournful but hard to rend asunder connected with a double childhood and a double loss he had thought to leave the houseknowing he must go not knowing whitherupon the evening of the day on which this feeling first struck root in his breast but he resolved to stay another night and in the night to ramble through the rooms once more  he came out of his solitude when it was the dead of night and with a candle in his hand went softly up the stairs of all the footmarks there making them as common as the common street there was not one he thought but had seemed at the time to set itself upon his brain while he had kept close listening he looked at their number and their hurry and contentionfoot treading foot out and upward track and downward jostling one anotherand thought with absolute dread and wonder how much he must have suffered during that trial and what a changed man he had cause to be he thought besides oh was there somewhere in the world a light footstep that might have worn out in a moment half those marksand bent his head and wept as he went up  he almost saw it going on before he stopped looking up towards the skylight and a figure childish itself but carrying a child and singing as it went seemed to be there again anon it was the same figure alone stopping for an instant with suspended breath the bright hair clustering loosely round its tearful face and looking back at him  he wandered through the rooms lately so luxurious now so bare and dismal and so changed apparently even in their shape and size the press of footsteps was as thick here and the same consideration of the suffering he had had perplexed and terrified him he began to fear that all this intricacy in his brain would drive him mad and that his thoughts already lost coherence as the footprints did and were pieced on to one another with the same trackless involutions and varieties of indistinct shapes  he did not so much as know in which of these rooms she had lived when she was alone he was glad to leave them and go wandering higher up abundance of associations were here connected with his false wife his false friend and servant his false grounds of pride but he put them all by now and only recalled miserably weakly fondly his two children  everywhere the footsteps they had had no respect for the old room high up where the little bed had been he could hardly find a clear space there to throw himself down on the floor against the wall poor broken man and let his tears flow as they would he had shed so many tears here long ago that he was less ashamed of his weakness in this place than in any otherperhaps with that consciousness had made excuses to himself for coming here here with stooping shoulders and his chin dropped on his breast he had come here thrown upon the bare boards in the dead of night he wept alonea proud man even then who if a kind hand could have been stretched out or a kind face could have looked in would have risen up and turned away and gone down to his cell  when the day broke he was shut up in his rooms again he had meant to go away today but clung to this tie in the house as the last and only thing left to him he would go tomorrow tomorrow came he would go tomorrow every night within the knowledge of no human creature he came forth and wandered through the despoiled house like a ghost many a morning when the day broke his altered face drooping behind the closed blind in his window imperfectly transparent to the light as yet pondered on the loss of his two children it was one child no more he reunited them in his thoughts and they were never asunder oh that he could have united them in his past love and in death and that one had not been so much worse than dead  strong mental agitation and disturbance was no novelty to him even before his late sufferings it never is to obstinate and sullen natures for they struggle hard to be such ground long undermined will often fall down in a moment what was undermined here in so many ways weakened and crumbled little by little more and more as the hand moved on the dial  at last he began to think he need not go at all he might yet give up what his creditors had spared him that they had not spared him more was his own act and only sever the tie between him and the ruined house by severing that other link  it was then that his footfall was audible in the late housekeepers room as he walked to and fro but not audible in its true meaning or it would have had an appalling sound  the world was very busy and restless about him he became aware of that again it was whispering and babbling it was never quiet this and the intricacy and complication of the footsteps harassed him to death objects began to take a bleared and russet colour in his eyes dombey and son was no morehis children no more this must be thought of well tomorrow  he thought of it tomorrow and sitting thinking in his chair saw in the glass from time to time this picture  a spectral haggard wasted likeness of himself brooded and brooded over the empty fireplace now it lifted up its head examining the lines and hollows in its face now hung it down again and brooded afresh now it rose and walked about now passed into the next room and came back with something from the dressingtable in its breast now it was looking at the bottom of the door and thinking  hush what it was thinking that if blood were to trickle that way and to leak out into the hall it must be a long time going so far it would move so stealthily and slowly creeping on with here a lazy little pool and there a start and then another little pool that a desperately wounded man could only be discovered through its means either dead or dying when it had thought of this a long while it got up again and walked to and fro with its hand in its breast he glanced at it occasionally very curious to watch its motions and he marked how wicked and murderous that hand looked  now it was thinking again what was it thinking  whether they would tread in the blood when it crept so far and carry it about the house among those many prints of feet or even out into the street  it sat down with its eyes upon the empty fireplace and as it lost itself in thought there shone into the room a gleam of light a ray of sun it was quite unmindful and sat thinking suddenly it rose with a terrible face and that guilty hand grasping what was in its breast then it was arrested by a crya wild loud piercing loving rapturous cryand he only saw his own reflection in the glass and at his knees his daughter  yes his daughter look at her look here down upon the ground clinging to him calling to him folding her hands praying to him  papa dearest papa pardon me forgive me i have come back to ask forgiveness on my knees i never can be happy more without it  unchanged still of all the world unchanged raising the same face to his as on that miserable night asking his forgiveness  dear papa oh dont look strangely on me i never meant to leave you i never thought of it before or afterwards i was frightened when i went away and could not think papa dear i am changed i am penitent i know my fault i know my duty better now papa dont cast me off or i shall die  he tottered to his chair he felt her draw his arms about her neck he felt her put her own round his he felt her kisses on his face he felt her wet cheek laid against his own he feltoh how deeplyall that he had done  upon the breast that he had bruised against the heart that he had almost broken she laid his face now covered with his hands and said sobbing  papa love i am a mother i have a child who will soon call walter by the name by which i call you when it was born and when i knew how much i loved it i knew what i had done in leaving you forgive me dear papa oh say god bless me and my little child  he would have said it if he could he would have raised his hands and besought her for pardon but she caught them in her own and put them down hurriedly  my little child was born at sea papa i prayed to god and so did walter for me to spare me that i might come home the moment i could land i came back to you never let us be parted any more papa never let us be parted any more  his head now grey was encircled by her arm and he groaned to think that never never had it rested so before  you will come home with me papa and see my baby a boy papa his name is paul i thinki hopehes like  her tears stopped her  dear papa for the sake of my child for the sake of the name we have given him for my sake pardon walter he is so kind and tender to me i am so happy with him it was not his fault that we were married it was mine i loved him so much  she clung closer to him more endearing and more earnest  he is the darling of my heart papa i would die for him he will love and honour you as i will we will teach our little child to love and honour you and we will tell him when he can understand that you had a son of that name once and that he died and you were very sorry but that he is gone to heaven where we all hope to see him when our time for resting comes kiss me papa as a promise that you will be reconciled to walterto my dearest husbandto the father of the little child who taught me to come back papa who taught me to come back  as she clung closer to him in another burst of tears he kissed her on her lips and lifting up his eyes said oh my god forgive me for i need it very much  with that he dropped his head again lamenting over and caressing her and there was not a sound in all the house for a long long time they remaining clasped in one anothers arms in the glorious sunshine that had crept in with florence  he dressed himself for going out with a docile submission to her entreaty and walking with a feeble gait and looking back with a tremble at the room in which he had been so long shut up and where he had seen the picture in the glass passed out with her into the hall florence hardly glancing round her lest she should remind him freshly of their last partingfor their feet were on the very stones where he had struck her in his madnessand keeping close to him with her eyes upon his face and his arm about her led him out to a coach that was waiting at the door and carried him away  then miss tox and polly came out of their concealment and exulted tearfully and then they packed his clothes and books and so forth with great care and consigned them in due course to certain persons sent by florence in the evening to fetch them and then they took a last cup of tea in the lonely house  and so dombey and son as i observed upon a certain sad occasion said miss tox winding up a host of recollections is indeed a daughter polly after all  and a good one exclaimed polly  you are right said miss tox and its a credit to you polly that you were always her friend when she was a little child you were her friend long before i was polly said miss tox and youre a good creature robin  miss tox addressed herself to a bulletheaded young man who appeared to be in but indifferent circumstances and in depressed spirits and who was sitting in a remote corner rising he disclosed to view the form and features of the grinder  robin said miss tox i have just observed to your mother as you may have heard that she is a good creature  and so she is miss quoth the grinder with some feeling  very well robin said miss tox i am glad to hear you say so now robin as i am going to give you a trial at your urgent request as my domestic with a view to your restoration to respectability i will take this impressive occasion of remarking that i hope you will never forget that you have and have always had a good mother and that you will endeavour so to conduct yourself as to be a comfort to her  upon my soul i will miss returned the grinder i have come through a good deal and my intentions is now as straightforard miss as a coves  i must get you to break yourself of that word robin if you please interposed miss tox politely  if you please miss as a chaps  thankee robin no returned miss tox i should prefer individual  as a indiwiddles said the grinder  much better remarked miss tox complacently infinitely more expressive  can be pursued rob if i hadnt been and got made a grinder on miss and mother which was a most unfortunate circumstance for a young coindiwiddle  very good indeed observed miss tox approvingly  and if i hadnt been led away by birds and then fallen into a bad service said the grinder i hope i might have done better but its never too late for a  indi suggested miss tox  widdle said the grinder to mend and i hope to mend miss with your kind trial and wishing mother my love to father and brothers and sisters and saying of it  i am very glad indeed to hear it observed miss tox will you take a little bread and butter and a cup of tea before we go robin  thankee miss returned the grinder who immediately began to use his own personal grinders in a most remarkable manner as if he had been on very short allowance for a considerable period  miss tox being in good time bonneted and shawled and polly too rob hugged his mother and followed his new mistress away so much to the hopeful admiration of polly that something in her eyes made luminous rings round the gaslamps as she looked after him polly then put out her light locked the housedoor delivered the key at an agents hard by and went home as fast as she could go rejoicing in the shrill delight that her unexpected arrival would occasion there the great house dumb as to all that had been suffered in it and the changes it had witnessed stood frowning like a dark mute on the street baulking any nearer inquiries with the staring announcement that the lease of this desirable family mansion was to be disposed of    chapter 60 chiefly matrimonial   the grand halfyearly festival holden by doctor and mrs blimber on which occasion they requested the pleasure of the company of every young gentleman pursuing his studies in that genteel establishment at an early party when the hour was halfpast seven oclock and when the object was quadrilles had duly taken place about this time and the young gentlemen with no unbecoming demonstrations of levity had betaken themselves in a state of scholastic repletion to their own homes mr skettles had repaired abroad permanently to grace the establishment of his father sir barnet skettles whose popular manners had obtained him a diplomatic appointment the honours of which were discharged by himself and lady skettles to the satisfaction even of their own countrymen and countrywomen which was considered almost miraculous mr tozer now a young man of lofty stature in wellington boots was so extremely full of antiquity as to be nearly on a par with a genuine ancient roman in his knowledge of english a triumph that affected his good parents with the tenderest emotions and caused the father and mother of mr briggs whose learning like illarranged luggage was so tightly packed that he couldnt get at anything he wanted to hide their diminished heads the fruit laboriously gathered from the tree of knowledge by this latter young gentleman in fact had been subjected to so much pressure that it had become a kind of intellectual norfolk biffin and had nothing of its original form or flavour remaining master bitherstone now on whom the forcing system had the happier and not uncommon effect of leaving no impression whatever when the forcing apparatus ceased to work was in a much more comfortable plight and being then on shipboard bound for bengal found himself forgetting with such admirable rapidity that it was doubtful whether his declensions of nounsubstantives would hold out to the end of the voyage  when doctor blimber in pursuance of the usual course would have said to the young gentlemen on the morning of the party gentlemen we will resume our studies on the twentyfifth of next month he departed from the usual course and said gentlemen when our friend cincinnatus retired to his farm he did not present to the senate any roman who he sought to nominate as his successor but there is a roman here said doctor blimber laying his hand on the shoulder of mr feeder ba adolescens imprimis gravis et doctus gentlemen whom i a retiring cincinnatus wish to present to my little senate as their future dictator gentlemen we will resume our studies on the twentyfifth of next month under the auspices of mr feeder ba at this which doctor blimber had previously called upon all the parents and urbanely explained the young gentlemen cheered and mr tozer on behalf of the rest instantly presented the doctor with a silver inkstand in a speech containing very little of the mothertongue but fifteen quotations from the latin and seven from the greek which moved the younger of the young gentlemen to discontent and envy they remarking oh ah it was all very well for old tozer but they didnt subscribe money for old tozer to show off with they supposed did they what business was it of old tozers more than anybody elses it wasnt his inkstand why couldnt he leave the boys property alone and murmuring other expressions of their dissatisfaction which seemed to find a greater relief in calling him old tozer than in any other available vent  not a word had been said to the young gentlemen nor a hint dropped of anything like a contemplated marriage between mr feeder ba and the fair cornelia blimber doctor blimber especially seemed to take pains to look as if nothing would surprise him more but it was perfectly well known to all the young gentlemen nevertheless and when they departed for the society of their relations and friends they took leave of mr feeder with awe  mr feeders most romantic visions were fulfilled the doctor had determined to paint the house outside and put it in thorough repair and to give up the business and to give up cornelia the painting and repairing began upon the very day of the young gentlemens departure and now behold the wedding morning was come and cornelia in a new pair of spectacles was waiting to be led to the hymeneal altar  the doctor with his learned legs and mrs blimber in a lilac bonnet and mr feeder ba with his long knuckles and his bristly head of hair and mr feeders brother the reverend alfred feeder ma who was to perform the ceremony were all assembled in the drawingroom and cornelia with her orangeflowers and bridesmaids had just come down and looked as of old a little squeezed in appearance but very charming when the door opened and the weakeyed young man in a loud voice made the following proclamation  mr and mrs toots  upon which there entered mr toots grown extremely stout and on his arm a lady very handsomely and becomingly dressed with very bright black eyes mrs blimber said mr toots allow me to present my wife  mrs blimber was delighted to receive her mrs blimber was a little condescending but extremely kind  and as youve known me for a long time you know said mr toots let me assure you that she is one of the most remarkable women that ever lived  my dear remonstrated mrs toots  upon my word and honour she is said mr toots ii assure you mrs blimber shes a most extraordinary woman  mrs toots laughed merrily and mrs blimber led her to cornelia mr toots having paid his respects in that direction and having saluted his old preceptor who said in allusion to his conjugal state well toots well toots so you are one of us are you tootsretired with mr feeder ba into a window  mr feeder ba being in great spirits made a spar at mr toots and tapped him skilfully with the back of his hand on the breastbone  well old buck said mr feeder with a laugh well here we are taken in and done for eh  feeder returned mr toots i give you joy if youre asasas perfectly blissful in a matrimonial life as i am myself youll have nothing to desire  i dont forget my old friends you see said mr feeder i ask em to my wedding toots  feeder replied mr toots gravely the fact is that there were several circumstances which prevented me from communicating with you until after my marriage had been solemnised in the first place i had made a perfect brute of myself to you on the subject of miss dombey and i felt that if you were asked to any wedding of mine you would naturally expect that it was with miss dombey which involved explanations that upon my word and honour at that crisis would have knocked me completely over in the second place our wedding was strictly private there being nobody present but one friend of myself and mrs tootss who is a captain ini dont exactly know in what said mr toots but its of no consequence i hope feeder that in writing a statement of what had occurred before mrs toots and myself went abroad upon our foreign tour i fully discharged the offices of friendship  toots my boy said mr feeder shaking his hands i was joking  and now feeder said mr toots i should be glad to know what you think of my union  capital returned mr feeder  you think its capital do you feedersaid mr toots solemnly then how capital must it be to me for you can never know what an extraordinary woman that is  mr feeder was willing to take it for granted but mr toots shook his head and wouldnt hear of that being possible  you see said mr toots what i wanted in a wife wasin short was sense money feeder i had sense ii had not particularly  mr feeder murmured oh yes you had toots but mr toots said  no feeder i had not why should i disguise it i had not i knew that sense was there said mr toots stretching out his hand towards his wife in perfect heaps i had no relation to object or be offended on the score of station for i had no relation i have never had anybody belonging to me but my guardian and him feeder i have always considered as a pirate and a corsair therefore you know it was not likely said mr toots that i should take his opinion  no said mr feeder  accordingly resumed mr toots i acted on my own bright was the day on which i did so feeder nobody but myself can tell what the capacity of that womans mind is if ever the rights of women and all that kind of thing are properly attended to it will be through her powerful intellectsusan my dear said mr toots looking abruptly out of the windows pray do not exert yourself  my dear said mrs toots i was only talking  but my love said mr toots pray do not exert yourself you really must be careful do not my dear susan exert yourself shes so easily excited said mr toots apart to mrs blimber and then she forgets the medical man altogether  mrs blimber was impressing on mrs toots the necessity of caution when mr feeder ba offered her his arm and led her down to the carriages that were waiting to go to church doctor blimber escorted mrs toots mr toots escorted the fair bride around whose lambent spectacles two gauzy little bridesmaids fluttered like moths mr feeders brother mr alfred feeder ma had already gone on in advance to assume his official functions  the ceremony was performed in an admirable manner cornelia with her crisp little curls went in as the chicken might have said with great composure and doctor blimber gave her away like a man who had quite made up his mind to it the gauzy little bridesmaids appeared to suffer most mrs blimber was affected but gently so and told the reverend mr alfred feeder ma on the way home that if she could only have seen cicero in his retirement at tusculum she would not have had a wish now ungratified  there was a breakfast afterwards limited to the same small party at which the spirits of mr feeder ba were tremendous and so communicated themselves to mrs toots that mr toots was several times heard to observe across the table my dear susan dont exert yourself the best of it was that mr toots felt it incunbent on him to make a speech and in spite of a whole code of telegraphic dissuasions from mrs toots appeared on his legs for the first time in his life  i really said mr toots in this house where whatever was done to me in the way ofof any mental confusion sometimeswhich is of no consequence and i impute to nobodyi was always treated like one of doctor blimbers family and had a desk to myself for a considerable periodcannotallowmy friend feeder to be  mrs toots suggested married  it may not be inappropriate to the occasion or altogether uninteresting said mr toots with a delighted face to observe that my wife is a most extraordinary woman and would do this much better than myselfallow my friend feeder to be marriedespecially to  mrs toots suggested to miss blimber  to mrs feeder my love said mr toots in a subdued tone of private discussion whom god hath joined you know let no mandont you know i cannot allow my friend feeder to be marriedespecially to mrs feederwithout proposing theirtheirtoasts and may said mr toots fixing his eyes on his wife as if for inspiration in a high flight may the torch of hymen be the beacon of joy and may the flowers we have this day strewed in their path be thethe banishers ofof gloom  doctor blimber who had a taste for metaphor was pleased with this and said very good toots very well said indeed toots and nodded his head and patted his hands mr feeder made in reply a comic speech chequered with sentiment mr alfred feeder ma was afterwards very happy on doctor and mrs blimber mr feeder ba scarcely less so on the gauzy little bridesmaids doctor blimber then in a sonorous voice delivered a few thoughts in the pastoral style relative to the rushes among which it was the intention of himself and mrs blimber to dwell and the bee that would hum around their cot shortly after which as the doctors eyes were twinkling in a remarkable manner and his soninlaw had already observed that time was made for slaves and had inquired whether mrs toots sang the discreet mrs blimber dissolved the sitting and sent cornelia away very cool and comfortable in a postchaise with the man of her heart  mr and mrs toots withdrew to the bedford mrs toots had been there before in old times under her maiden name of nipper and there found a letter which it took mr toots such an enormous time to read that mrs toots was frightened  my dear susan said mr toots fright is worse than exertion pray be calm  who is it from asked mrs toots  why my love said mr toots its from captain gills do not excite yourself walters and miss dombey are expected home  my dear said mrs toots raising herself quickly from the sofa very pale dont try to deceive me for its no use theyre come homei see it plainly in your face  shes a most extraordinary woman exclaimed mr toots in rapturous admiration youre perfectly right my love they have come home miss dombey has seen her father and they are reconciled  reconciled cried mrs toots clapping her hands  my dear said mr toots pray do not exert yourself do remember the medical man captain gills saysat least he dont say but i imagine from what i can make out he meansthat miss dombey has brought her unfortunate father away from his old house to one where she and walters are living that he is lying very ill theresupposed to be dying and that she attends upon him night and day  mrs toots began to cry quite bitterly  my dearest susan replied mr toots do do if you possibly can remember the medical man if you cant its of no consequencebut do endeavour to  his wife with her old manner suddenly restored so pathetically entreated him to take her to her precious pet her little mistress her own darling and the like that mr toots whose sympathy and admiration were of the strongest kind consented from his very heart of hearts and they agreed to depart immediately and present themselves in answer to the captains letter  now some hidden sympathies of things or some coincidences had that day brought the captain himself toward whom mr and mrs toots were soon journeying into the flowery train of wedlock not as a principal but as an accessory it happened accidentally and thus  the captain having seen florence and her baby for a moment to his unbounded content and having had a long talk with walter turned out for a walk feeling it necessary to have some solitary meditation on the changes of human affairs and to shake his glazed hat profoundly over the fall of mr dombey for whom the generosity and simplicity of his nature were awakened in a lively manner the captain would have been very low indeed on the unhappy gentlemans account but for the recollection of the baby which afforded him such intense satisfaction whenever it arose that he laughed aloud as he went along the street and indeed more than once in a sudden impulse of joy threw up his glazed hat and caught it again much to the amazement of the spectators the rapid alternations of light and shade to which these two conflicting subjects of reflection exposed the captain were so very trying to his spirits that he felt a long walk necessary to his composure and as there is a great deal in the influence of harmonious associations he chose for the scene of this walk his old neighbourhood down among the mast oar and block makers shipbiscuit bakers coalwhippers pitchkettles sailors canals docks swingbridges and other soothing objects  these peaceful scenes and particularly the region of limehouse hole and thereabouts were so influential in calming the captain that he walked on with restored tranquillity and was in fact regaling himself under his breath with the ballad of lovely peg when on turning a corner he was suddenly transfixed and rendered speechless by a triumphant procession that he beheld advancing towards him  this awful demonstration was headed by that determined woman mrs macstinger who preserving a countenance of inexorable resolution and wearing conspicuously attached to her obdurate bosom a stupendous watch and appendages which the captain recognised at a glance as the property of bunsby conducted under her arm no other than that sagacious mariner he with the distraught and melancholy visage of a captive borne into a foreign land meekly resigning himself to her will behind them appeared the young macstingers in a body exulting behind them two ladies of a terrible and steadfast aspect leading between them a short gentleman in a tall hat who likewise exulted in the wake appeared bunsbys boy bearing umbrellas the whole were in good marching order and a dreadful smartness that pervaded the party would have sufficiently announced if the intrepid countenances of the ladies had been wanting that it was a procession of sacrifice and that the victim was bunsby  the first impulse of the captain was to run away this also appeared to be the first impulse of bunsby hopeless as its execution must have proved but a cry of recognition proceeding from the party and alexander macstinger running up to the captain with open arms the captain struck  well capen cuttle said mrs macstinger this is indeed a meeting i bear no malice now capen cuttleyou neednt fear that im a going to cast any reflections i hope to go to the altar in another spirit here mrs macstinger paused and drawing herself up and inflating her bosom with a long breath said in allusion to the victim my usband capen cuttle  the abject bunsby looked neither to the right nor to the left nor at his bride nor at his friend but straight before him at nothing the captain putting out his hand bunsby put out his but in answer to the captains greeting spake no word  capen cuttle said mrs macstinger if you would wish to heal up past animosities and to see the last of your friend my usband as a single person we should be appy of your company to chapel here is a lady here said mrs macstinger turning round to the more intrepid of the two my bridesmaid that will be glad of your protection capen cuttle  the short gentleman in the tall hat who it appeared was the husband of the other lady and who evidently exulted at the reduction of a fellow creature to his own condition gave place at this and resigned the lady to captain cuttle the lady immediately seized him and observing that there was no time to lose gave the word in a strong voice to advance  the captains concern for his friend not unmingled at first with some concern for himselffor a shadowy terror that he might be married by violence possessed him until his knowledge of the service came to his relief and remembering the legal obligation of saying i will he felt himself personally safe so long as he resolved if asked any question distinctly to reply i wontthrew him into a profuse perspiration and rendered him for a time insensible to the movements of the procession of which he now formed a feature and to the conversation of his fair companion but as he became less agitated he learnt from this lady that she was the widow of a mr bokum who had held an employment in the custom house that she was the dearest friend of mrs macstinger whom she considered a pattern for her sex that she had often heard of the captain and now hoped he had repented of his past life that she trusted mr bunsby knew what a blessing he had gained but that she feared men seldom did know what such blessings were until they had lost them with more to the same purpose  all this time the captain could not but observe that mrs bokum kept her eyes steadily on the bridegroom and that whenever they came near a court or other narrow turning which appeared favourable for flight she was on the alert to cut him off if he attempted escape the other lady too as well as her husband the short gentleman with the tall hat were plainly on guard according to a preconcerted plan and the wretched man was so secured by mrs macstinger that any effort at selfpreservation by flight was rendered futile this indeed was apparent to the mere populace who expressed their perception of the fact by jeers and cries to all of which the dread macstinger was inflexibly indifferent while bunsby himself appeared in a state of unconsciousness  the captain made many attempts to accost the philosopher if only in a monosyllable or a signal but always failed in consequence of the vigilance of the guard and the difficulty at all times peculiar to bunsbys constitution of having his attention aroused by any outward and visible sign whatever thus they approached the chapel a neat whitewashed edifice recently engaged by the reverend melchisedech howler who had consented on very urgent solicitation to give the world another two years of existence but had informed his followers that then it must positively go  while the reverend melchisedech was offering up some extemporary orisons the captain found an opportunity of growling in the bridegrooms ear  what cheer my lad what cheer  to which bunsby replied with a forgetfulness of the reverend melchisedech which nothing but his desperate circumstances could have excused  dd bad  jack bunsby whispered the captain do you do this here of your own free will  mr bunsby answered no  why do you do it then my lad inquired the captain not unnaturally  bunsby still looking and always looking with an immovable countenance at the opposite side of the world made no reply  why not sheer off said the captain eh whispered bunsby with a momentary gleam of hope sheer off said the captain  wheres the good retorted the forlorn sage shed capter me agen  try replied the captain cheer up come nows your time sheer off jack bunsby  jack bunsby however instead of profiting by the advice said in a doleful whisper  it all began in that there chest o yourn why did i ever conwoy her into port that night  my lad faltered the captain i thought as you had come over her not as she had come over you a man as has got such opinions as you have  mr bunsby merely uttered a suppressed groan  come said the captain nudging him with his elbow nows your time sheer off ill cover your retreat the times a flying bunsby its for liberty will you once  bunsby was immovable bunsby whispered the captain will you twice bunsby wouldnt twice  bunsby urged the captain its for liberty will you three times now or never  bunsby didnt then and didnt ever for mrs macstinger immediately afterwards married him  one of the most frightful circumstances of the ceremony to the captain was the deadly interest exhibited therein by juliana macstinger and the fatal concentration of her faculties with which that promising child already the image of her parent observed the whole proceedings the captain saw in this a succession of mantraps stretching out infinitely a series of ages of oppression and coercion through which the seafaring line was doomed it was a more memorable sight than the unflinching steadiness of mrs bokum and the other lady the exultation of the short gentleman in the tall hat or even the fell inflexibility of mrs macstinger the master macstingers understood little of what was going on and cared less being chiefly engaged during the ceremony in treading on one anothers halfboots but the contrast afforded by those wretched infants only set off and adorned the precocious woman in juliana another year or two the captain thought and to lodge where that child was would be destruction  the ceremony was concluded by a general spring of the young family on mr bunsby whom they hailed by the endearing name of father and from whom they solicited halfpence these gushes of affection over the procession was about to issue forth again when it was delayed for some little time by an unexpected transport on the part of alexander macstinger that dear child it seemed connecting a chapel with tombstones when it was entered for any purpose apart from the ordinary religious exercises could not be persuaded but that his mother was now to be decently interred and lost to him for ever in the anguish of this conviction he screamed with astonishing force and turned black in the face however touching these marks of a tender disposition were to his mother it was not in the character of that remarkable woman to permit her recognition of them to degenerate into weakness therefore after vainly endeavouring to convince his reason by shakes pokes bawlingsout and similar applications to his head she led him into the air and tried another method which was manifested to the marriage party by a quick succession of sharp sounds resembling applause and subsequently by their seeing alexander in contact with the coolest pavingstone in the court greatly flushed and loudly lamenting  the procession being then in a condition to form itself once more and repair to brig place where a marriage feast was in readiness returned as it had come not without the receipt by bunsby of many humorous congratulations from the populace on his recentlyacquired happiness the captain accompanied it as far as the housedoor but being made uneasy by the gentler manner of mrs bokum who now that she was relieved from her engrossing dutyfor the watchfulness and alacrity of the ladies sensibly diminished when the bridegroom was safely marriedhad greater leisure to show an interest in his behalf there left it and the captive faintly pleading an appointment and promising to return presently the captain had another cause for uneasiness in remorsefully reflecting that he had been the first means of bunsbys entrapment though certainly without intending it and through his unbounded faith in the resources of that philosopher  to go back to old sol gills at the wooden midshipmans and not first go round to ask how mr dombey wasalbeit the house where he lay was out of london and away on the borders of a fresh heathwas quite out of the captains course so he got a lift when he was tired and made out the journey gaily  the blinds were pulled down and the house so quiet that the captain was almost afraid to knock but listening at the door he heard low voices within very near it and knocking softly was admitted by mr toots mr toots and his wife had in fact just arrived there having been at the midshipmans to seek him and having there obtained the address  they were not so recently arrived but that mrs toots had caught the baby from somebody taken it in her arms and sat down on the stairs hugging and fondling it florence was stooping down beside her and no one could have said which mrs toots was hugging and fondling most the mother or the child or which was the tenderer florence of mrs toots or mrs toots of her or both of the baby it was such a little group of love and agitation  and is your pa very ill my darling dear miss floy asked susan  he is very very ill said florence but susan dear you must not speak to me as you used to speak and whats this said florence touching her clothes in amazement your old dress dear your old cap curls and all  susan burst into tears and showered kisses on the little hand that had touched her so wonderingly  my dear miss dombey said mr toots stepping forward ill explain shes the most extraordinary woman there are not many to equal her she has always saidshe said before we were married and has said to this daythat whenever you came home shed come to you in no dress but the dress she used to serve you in for fear she might seem strange to you and you might like her less i admire the dress myself said mr toots of all things i adore her in it my dear miss dombey shell be your maid again your nurse all that she ever was and more theres no change in her but susan my dear said mr toots who had spoken with great feeling and high admiration all i ask is that youll remember the medical man and not exert yourself too much    chapter 61 relenting   florence had need of help her fathers need of it was sore and made the aid of her old friend invaluable death stood at his pillow a shade already of what he had been shattered in mind and perilously sick in body he laid his weary head down on the bed his daughters hands prepared for him and had never raised it since  she was always with him he knew her generally though in the wandering of his brain he often confused the circumstances under which he spoke to her thus he would address her sometimes as if his boy were newly dead and would tell her that although he had said nothing of her ministering at the little bedside yet he had seen ithe had seen it and then would hide his face and sob and put out his worn hand sometimes he would ask her for herself where is florence i am here papa i am here i dont know her he would cry we have been parted so long that i dont know her and then a staring dread would be upon him until she could soothe his perturbation and recall the tears she tried so hard at other times to dry  he rambled through the scenes of his old pursuitsthrough many where florence lost him as she listenedsometimes for hours he would repeat that childish question what is money and ponder on it and think about it and reason with himself more or less connectedly for a good answer as if it had never been proposed to him until that moment he would go on with a musing repetition of the title of his old firm twenty thousand times and at every one of them would turn his head upon his pillow he would count his childrenonetwostop and go back and begin again in the same way  but this was when his mind was in its most distracted state in all the other phases of its illness and in those to which it was most constant it always turned on florence what he would oftenest do was this he would recall that night he had so recently remembered the night on which she came down to his room and would imagine that his heart smote him and that he went out after her and up the stairs to seek her then confounding that time with the later days of the many footsteps he would be amazed at their number and begin to count them as he followed her here of a sudden was a bloody footstep going on among the others and after it there began to be at intervals doors standing open through which certain terrible pictures were seen in mirrors of haggard men concealing something in their breasts still among the many footsteps and the bloody footsteps here and there was the step of florence still she was going on before still the restless mind went following and counting ever farther ever higher as to the summit of a mighty tower that it took years to climb  one day he inquired if that were not susan who had spoken a long while ago  florence said yes dear papa and asked him would he like to see her  he said very much and susan with no little trepidation showed herself at his bedside  it seemed a great relief to him he begged her not to go to understand that he forgave her what she had said and that she was to stay florence and he were very different now he said and very happy let her look at this he meant his drawing the gentle head down to his pillow and laying it beside him  he remained like this for days and weeks at length lying the faint feeble semblance of a man upon his bed and speaking in a voice so low that they could only hear him by listening very near to his lips he became quiet it was dimly pleasant to him now to lie there with the window open looking out at the summer sky and the trees and in the evening at the sunset to watch the shadows of the clouds and leaves and seem to feel a sympathy with shadows it was natural that he should to him life and the world were nothing else  he began to show now that he thought of florences fatigue and often taxed his weakness to whisper to her go and walk my dearest in the sweet air go to your good husband one time when walter was in his room he beckoned him to come near and to stoop down and pressing his hand whispered an assurance to him that he knew he could trust him with his child when he was dead  it chanced one evening towards sunset when florence and walter were sitting in his room together as he liked to see them that florence having her baby in her arms began in a low voice to sing to the little fellow and sang the old tune she had so often sung to the dead child he could not bear it at the time he held up his trembling hand imploring her to stop but next day he asked her to repeat it and to do so often of an evening which she did he listening with his face turned away  florence was sitting on a certain time by his window with her workbasket between her and her old attendant who was still her faithful companion he had fallen into a doze it was a beautiful evening with two hours of light to come yet and the tranquillity and quiet made florence very thoughtful she was lost to everything for the moment but the occasion when the so altered figure on the bed had first presented her to her beautiful mama when a touch from walter leaning on the back of her chair made her start  my dear said walter there is someone downstairs who wishes to speak to you  she fancied walter looked grave and asked him if anything had happened  no no my love said walter i have seen the gentleman myself and spoken with him nothing has happened will you come  florence put her arm through his and confiding her father to the blackeyed mrs toots who sat as brisk and smart at her work as blackeyed woman could accompanied her husband downstairs in the pleasant little parlour opening on the garden sat a gentleman who rose to advance towards her when she came in but turned off by reason of some peculiarity in his legs and was only stopped by the table  florence then remembered cousin feenix whom she had not at first recognised in the shade of the leaves cousin feenix took her hand and congratulated her upon her marriage  i could have wished i am sure said cousin feenix sitting down as florence sat to have had an earlier opportunity of offering my congratulations but in point of fact so many painful occurrences have happened treading as a man may say on one anothers heels that i have been in a devil of a state myself and perfectly unfit for every description of society the only description of society i have kept has been my own and it certainly is anything but flattering to a mans good opinion of his own sources to know that in point of fact he has the capacity of boring himself to a perfectly unlimited extent  florence divined from some indefinable constraint and anxiety in this gentlemans mannerwhich was always a gentlemans in spite of the harmless little eccentricities that attached to itand from walters manner no less that something more immediately tending to some object was to follow this  i have been mentioning to my friend mr gay if i may be allowed to have the honour of calling him so said cousin feenix that i am rejoiced to hear that my friend dombey is very decidedly mending i trust my friend dombey will not allow his mind to be too much preyed upon by any mere loss of fortune i cannot say that i have ever experienced any very great loss of fortune myself never having had in point of fact any great amount of fortune to lose but as much as i could lose i have lost and i dont find that i particularly care about it i know my friend dombey to be a devilish honourable man and its calculated to console my friend dombey very much to know that this is the universal sentiment even tommy screwzera man of an extremely bilious habit with whom my friend gay is probably acquaintedcannot say a syllable in disputation of the fact  florence felt more than ever that there was something to come and looked earnestly for it so earnestly that cousin feenix answered as if she had spoken  the fact is said cousin feenix that my friend gay and myself have been discussing the propriety of entreating a favour at your hands and that i have the consent of my friend gaywho has met me in an exceedingly kind and open manner for which i am very much indebted to himto solicit it i am sensible that so amiable a lady as the lovely and accomplished daughter of my friend dombey will not require much urging but i am happy to know that i am supported by my friend gays influence and approval as in my parliamentary time when a man had a motion to make of any sortwhich happened seldom in those days for we were kept very tight in hand the leaders on both sides being regular martinets which was a devilish good thing for the rank and file like myself and prevented our exposing ourselves continually as a great many of us had a feverish anxiety to doas in my parliamentary time i was about to say when a man had leave to let off any little private popgun it was always considered a great point for him to say that he had the happiness of believing that his sentiments were not without an echo in the breast of mr pitt the pilot in point of fact who had weathered the storm upon which a devilish large number of fellows immediately cheered and put him in spirits though the fact is that these fellows being under orders to cheer most excessively whenever mr pitts name was mentioned became so proficient that it always woke em and they were so entirely innocent of what was going on otherwise that it used to be commonly said by conversation brownfourbottle man at the treasury board with whom the father of my friend gay was probably acquainted for it was before my friend gays timethat if a man had risen in his place and said that he regretted to inform the house that there was an honourable member in the last stage of convulsions in the lobby and that the honourable members name was pitt the approbation would have been vociferous  this postponement of the point put florence in a flutter and she looked from cousin feenix to walter in increasing agitation  my love said walter there is nothing the matter  there is nothing the matter upon my honour said cousin feenix and i am deeply distressed at being the means of causing you a moments uneasiness i beg to assure you that there is nothing the matter the favour that i have to ask is simplybut it really does seem so exceedingly singular that i should be in the last degree obliged to my friend gay if he would have the goodness to break thein point of fact the ice said cousin feenix  walter thus appealed to and appealed to no less in the look that florence turned towards him said  my dearest it is no more than this that you will ride to london with this gentleman whom you know  and my friend gay alsoi beg your pardon interrupted cousin feenix  and with meand make a visit somewhere  to whom asked florence looking from one to the other  if i might entreat said cousin feenix that you would not press for an answer to that question i would venture to take the liberty of making the request  do you know walter  yes  and think it right  yes only because i am sure that you would too though there may be reasons i very well understand which make it better that nothing more should be said beforehand  if papa is still asleep or can spare me if he is awake i will go immediately said florence and rising quietly and glancing at them with a look that was a little alarmed but perfectly confiding left the room  when she came back ready to bear them company they were talking together gravely at the window and florence could not but wonder what the topic was that had made them so well acquainted in so short a time she did not wonder at the look of pride and love with which her husband broke off as she entered for she never saw him but that rested on her  i will leave said cousin feenix a card for my friend dombey sincerely trusting that he will pick up health and strength with every returning hour and i hope my friend dombey will do me the favour to consider me a man who has a devilish warm admiration of his character as in point of fact a british merchant and a devilish upright gentleman my place in the country is in a most confounded state of dilapidation but if my friend dombey should require a change of air and would take up his quarters there he would find it a remarkably healthy spotas it need be for its amazingly dull if my friend dombey suffers from bodily weakness and would allow me to recommend what has frequently done myself good as a man who has been extremely queer at times and who lived pretty freely in the days when men lived very freely i should say let it be in point of fact the yolk of an egg beat up with sugar and nutmeg in a glass of sherry and taken in the morning with a slice of dry toast jackson who kept the boxingrooms in bond streetman of very superior qualifications with whose reputation my friend gay is no doubt acquaintedused to mention that in training for the ring they substituted rum for sherry i should recommend sherry in this case on account of my friend dombey being in an invalided condition which might occasion rum to flyin point of fact to his headand throw him into a devil of a state  of all this cousin feenix delivered himself with an obviously nervous and discomposed air then giving his arm to florence and putting the strongest possible constraint upon his wilful legs which seemed determined to go out into the garden he led her to the door and handed her into a carriage that was ready for her reception  walter entered after him and they drove away  their ride was six or eight miles long when they drove through certain dull and stately streets lying westward in london it was growing dusk florence had by this time put her hand in walters and was looking very earnestly and with increasing agitation into every new street into which they turned  when the carriage stopped at last before that house in brook street where her fathers unhappy marriage had been celebrated florence said walter what is this who is here walter cheering her and not replying she glanced up at the housefront and saw that all the windows were shut as if it were uninhabited cousin feenix had by this time alighted and was offering his hand  are you not coming walter  no i will remain here dont tremble there is nothing to fear dearest florence  i know that walter with you so near i am sure of that but  the door was softly opened without any knock and cousin feenix led her out of the summer evening air into the close dull house more sombre and brown than ever it seemed to have been shut up from the weddingday and to have hoarded darkness and sadness ever since  florence ascended the dusky staircase trembling and stopped with her conductor at the drawingroom door he opened it without speaking and signed an entreaty to her to advance into the inner room while he remained there florence after hesitating an instant complied  sitting by the window at a table where she seemed to have been writing or drawing was a lady whose head turned away towards the dying light was resting on her hand florence advancing doubtfully all at once stood still as if she had lost the power of motion the lady turned her head  great heaven she said what is this  no no cried florence shrinking back as she rose up and putting out her hands to keep her off mama  they stood looking at each other passion and pride had worn it but it was the face of edith and beautiful and stately yet it was the face of florence and through all the terrified avoidance it expressed there was pity in it sorrow a grateful tender memory on each face wonder and fear were painted vividly each so still and silent looking at the other over the black gulf of the irrevocable past  florence was the first to change bursting into tears she said from her full heart oh mama mama why do we meet like this why were you ever kind to me when there was no one else that we should meet like this  edith stood before her dumb and motionless her eyes were fixed upon her face  i dare not think of that said florence i am come from papas sick bed we are never asunder now we never shall be any more if you would have me ask his pardon i will do it mama i am almost sure he will grant it now if i ask him may heaven grant it to you too and comfort you  she answered not a word  walteri am married to him and we have a son said florence timidlyis at the door and has brought me here i will tell him that you are repentant that you are changed said florence looking mournfully upon her and he will speak to papa with me i know is there anything but this that i can do  edith breaking her silence without moving eye or limb answered slowly  the stain upon your name upon your husbands on your childs will that ever be forgiven florence  will it ever be mama it is freely freely both by walter and by me if that is any consolation to you there is nothing that you may believe more certainly you do notyou do not faltered florence speak of papa but i am sure you wish that i should ask him for his forgiveness i am sure you do  she answered not a word  i will said florence i will bring it you if you will let me and then perhaps we may take leave of each other more like what we used to be to one another i have not said florence very gently and drawing nearer to her i have not shrunk back from you mama because i fear you or because i dread to be disgraced by you i only wish to do my duty to papa i am very dear to him and he is very dear to me but i never can forget that you were very good to me oh pray to heaven cried florence falling on her bosom pray to heaven mama to forgive you all this sin and shame and to forgive me if i cannot help doing this if it is wrong when i remember what you used to be  edith as if she fell beneath her touch sunk down on her knees and caught her round the neck  florence she cried my better angel before i am mad again before my stubbornness comes back and strikes me dumb believe me upon my soul i am innocent  mama  guilty of much guilty of that which sets a waste between us evermore guilty of what must separate me through the whole remainder of my life from purity and innocencefrom you of all the earth guilty of a blind and passionate resentment of which i do not cannot will not even now repent but not guilty with that dead man before god  upon her knees upon the ground she held up both her hands and swore it  florence she said purest and best of natureswhom i lovewho might have changed me long ago and did for a time work some change even in the woman that i ambelieve me i am innocent of that and once more on my desolate heart let me lay this dear head for the last time  she was moved and weeping had she been oftener thus in older days she had been happier now  there is nothing else in all the world she said that would have wrung denial from me no love no hatred no hope no threat i said that i would die and make no sign i could have done so and i would if we had never met florence  i trust said cousin feenix ambling in at the door and speaking half in the room and half out of it that my lovely and accomplished relative will excuse my having by a little stratagem effected this meeting i cannot say that i was at first wholly incredulous as to the possibility of my lovely and accomplished relative having very unfortunately committed herself with the deceased person with white teeth because in point of fact one does see in this worldwhich is remarkable for devilish strange arrangements and for being decidedly the most unintelligible thing within a mans experiencevery odd conjunctions of that sort but as i mentioned to my friend dombey i could not admit the criminality of my lovely and accomplished relative until it was perfectly established and feeling when the deceased person was in point of fact destroyed in a devilish horrible manner that her position was a very painful oneand feeling besides that our family had been a little to blame in not paying more attention to her and that we are a careless familyand also that my aunt though a devilish lively woman had perhaps not been the very best of mothersi took the liberty of seeking her in france and offering her such protection as a man very much out at elbows could offer upon which occasion my lovely and accomplished relative did me the honour to express that she believed i was in my way a devilish good sort of fellow and that therefore she put herself under my protection which in point of fact i understood to be a kind thing on the part of my lovely and accomplished relative as i am getting extremely shaky and have derived great comfort from her solicitude  edith who had taken florence to a sofa made a gesture with her hand as if she would have begged him to say no more  my lovely and accomplished relative resumed cousin feenix still ambling about at the door will excuse me if for her satisfaction and my own and that of my friend dombey whose lovely and accomplished daughter we so much admire i complete the thread of my observations she will remember that from the first she and i never alluded to the subject of her elopement my impression certainly has always been that there was a mystery in the affair which she could explain if so inclined but my lovely and accomplished relative being a devilish resolute woman i knew that she was not in point of fact to be trifled with and therefore did not involve myself in any discussions but observing lately that her accessible point did appear to be a very strong description of tenderness for the daughter of my friend dombey it occurred to me that if i could bring about a meeting unexpected on both sides it might lead to beneficial results therefore we being in london in the present private way before going to the south of italy there to establish ourselves in point of fact until we go to our long homes which is a devilish disagreeable reflection for a man i applied myself to the discovery of the residence of my friend gayhandsome man of an uncommonly frank disposition who is probably known to my lovely and accomplished relativeand had the happiness of bringing his amiable wife to the present place and now said cousin feenix with a real and genuine earnestness shining through the levity of his manner and his slipshod speech i do conjure my relative not to stop half way but to set right as far as she can whatever she has done wrongnot for the honour of her family not for her own fame not for any of those considerations which unfortunate circumstances have induced her to regard as hollow and in point of fact as approaching to humbugbut because it is wrong and not right  cousin feenixs legs consented to take him away after this and leaving them alone together he shut the door  edith remained silent for some minutes with florence sitting close beside her then she took from her bosom a sealed paper  i debated with myself a long time she said in a low voice whether to write this at all in case of dying suddenly or by accident and feeling the want of it upon me i have deliberated ever since when and how to destroy it take it florence the truth is written in it  is it for papa asked florence  it is for whom you will she answered it is given to you and is obtained by you he never could have had it otherwise  again they sat silent in the deepening darkness  mama said florence he has lost his fortune he has been at the point of death he may not recover even now is there any word that i shall say to him from you  did you tell me asked edith that you were very dear to him  yes said florence in a thrilling voice  tell him i am sorry that we ever met  no more said florence after a pause  tell him if he asks that i do not repent of what i have donenot yetfor if it were to do again tomorrow i should do it but if he is a changed man  she stopped there was something in the silent touch of florences hand that stopped her  but that being a changed man he knows now it would never be tell him i wish it never had been  may i say said florence that you grieved to hear of the afflictions he has suffered  not she replied if they have taught him that his daughter is very dear to him he will not grieve for them himself one day if they have brought that lesson florence  you wish well to him and would have him happy i am sure you would said florence oh let me be able if i have the occasion at some future time to say so  edith sat with her dark eyes gazing steadfastly before her and did not reply until florence had repeated her entreaty when she drew her hand within her arm and said with the same thoughtful gaze upon the night outside  tell him that if in his own present he can find any reason to compassionate my past i sent word that i asked him to do so tell him that if in his own present he can find a reason to think less bitterly of me i asked him to do so tell him that dead as we are to one another never more to meet on this side of eternity he knows there is one feeling in common between us now that there never was before  her sternness seemed to yield and there were tears in her dark eyes  i trust myself to that she said for his better thoughts of me and mine of him when he loves his florence most he will hate me least when he is most proud and happy in her and her children he will be most repentant of his own part in the dark vision of our married life at that time i will be repentant toolet him know it thenand think that when i thought so much of all the causes that had made me what i was i needed to have allowed more for the causes that had made him what he was i will try then to forgive him his share of blame let him try to forgive me mine  oh mama said florence how it lightens my heart even in such a strange meeting and parting to hear this  strange words in my own ears said edith and foreign to the sound of my own voice but even if i had been the wretched creature i have given him occasion to believe me i think i could have said them still hearing that you and he were very dear to one another let him when you are dearest ever feel that he is most forbearing in his thoughts of methat i am most forbearing in my thoughts of him those are the last words i send him now goodbye my life  she clasped her in her arms and seemed to pour out all her womans soul of love and tenderness at once  this kiss for your child these kisses for a blessing on your head my own dear florence my sweet girl farewell  to meet again cried florence  never again never again when you leave me in this dark room think that you have left me in the grave remember only that i was once and that i loved you  and florence left her seeing her face no more but accompanied by her embraces and caresses to the last  cousin feenix met her at the door and took her down to walter in the dingy dining room upon whose shoulder she laid her head weeping  i am devilish sorry said cousin feenix lifting his wristbands to his eyes in the simplest manner possible and without the least concealment that the lovely and accomplished daughter of my friend dombey and amiable wife of my friend gay should have had her sensitive nature so very much distressed and cut up by the interview which is just concluded but i hope and trust i have acted for the best and that my honourable friend dombey will find his mind relieved by the disclosures which have taken place i exceedingly lament that my friend dombey should have got himself in point of fact into the devils own state of conglomeration by an alliance with our family but am strongly of opinion that if it hadnt been for the infernal scoundrel barkerman with white teetheverything would have gone on pretty smoothly in regard to my relative who does me the honour to have formed an uncommonly good opinion of myself i can assure the amiable wife of my friend gay that she may rely on my being in point of fact a father to her and in regard to the changes of human life and the extraordinary manner in which we are perpetually conducting ourselves all i can say is with my friend shakespeareman who wasnt for an age but for all time and with whom my friend gay is no doubt acquaintedthat its like the shadow of a dream    chapter 62 final   a bottle that has been long excluded from the light of day and is hoary with dust and cobwebs has been brought into the sunshine and the golden wine within it sheds a lustre on the table  it is the last bottle of the old madiera  you are quite right mr gills says mr dombey this is a very rare and most delicious wine  the captain who is of the party beams with joy there is a very halo of delight round his glowing forehead  we always promised ourselves sir observes mr gills ned and myself i mean  mr dombey nods at the captain who shines more and more with speechless gratification  that we would drink this one day or other to walter safe at home though such a home we never thought of if you dont object to our old whim sir let us devote this first glass to walter and his wife  to walter and his wife says mr dombey florence my childand turns to kiss her  to walter and his wife says mr toots  to walr and his wife exclaims the captain hooroar and the captain exhibiting a strong desire to clink his glass against some other glass mr dombey with a ready hand holds out his the others follow and there is a blithe and merry ringing as of a little peal of marriage bells   other buried wine grows older as the old madeira did in its time and dust and cobwebs thicken on the bottles  mr dombey is a whitehaired gentleman whose face bears heavy marks of care and suffering but they are traces of a storm that has passed on for ever and left a clear evening in its track  ambitious projects trouble him no more his only pride is in his daughter and her husband he has a silent thoughtful quiet manner and is always with his daughter miss tox is not infrequently of the family party and is quite devoted to it and a great favourite her admiration of her once stately patron is and has been ever since the morning of her shock in princesss place platonic but not weakened in the least  nothing has drifted to him from the wreck of his fortunes but a certain annual sum that comes he knows not how with an earnest entreaty that he will not seek to discover and with the assurance that it is a debt and an act of reparation he has consulted with his old clerk about this who is clear it may be honourably accepted and has no doubt it arises out of some forgotten transaction in the times of the old house  that hazeleyed bachelor a bachelor no more is married now and to the sister of the greyhaired junior he visits his old chief sometimes but seldom there is a reason in the greyhaired juniors history and yet a stronger reason in his name why he should keep retired from his old employer and as he lives with his sister and her husband they participate in that retirement walter sees them sometimesflorence tooand the pleasant house resounds with profound duets arranged for the pianoforte and violoncello and with the labours of harmonious blacksmiths  and how goes the wooden midshipman in these changed days why here he still is right leg foremost hard at work upon the hackney coaches and more on the alert than ever being newly painted from his cocked hat to his buckled shoes and up above him in golden characters these names shine refulgent gills and cuttle  not another stroke of business does the midshipman achieve beyond his usual easy trade but they do say in a circuit of some halfmile round the blue umbrella in leadenhall market that some of mr gillss old investments are coming out wonderfully well and that instead of being behind the time in those respects as he supposed he was in truth a little before it and had to wait the fulness of the time and the design the whisper is that mr gillss money has begun to turn itself and that it is turning itself over and over pretty briskly certain it is that standing at his shopdoor in his coffeecoloured suit with his chronometer in his pocket and his spectacles on his forehead he dont appear to break his heart at customers not coming but looks very jovial and contented though full as misty as of yore  as to his partner captain cuttle there is a fiction of a business in the captains mind which is better than any reality the captain is as satisfied of the midshipmans importance to the commerce and navigation of the country as he could possibly be if no ship left the port of london without the midshipmans assistance his delight in his own name over the door is inexhaustible he crosses the street twenty times a day to look at it from the other side of the way and invariably says on these occasions edard cuttle my lad if your mother could ha knowd as you would ever be a man o science the good old creetur would ha been took aback indeed  but here is mr toots descending on the midshipman with violent rapidity and mr tootss face is very red as he bursts into the little parlour  captain gills says mr toots and mr sols i am happy to inform you that mrs toots has had an increase to her family  and it does her credit cries the captain  i give you joy mr toots says old sol  thankee chuckles mr toots im very much obliged to you i knew that youd be glad to hear and so i came down myself were positively getting on you know theres florence and susan and now heres another little stranger  a female stranger inquires the captain  yes captain gills says mr toots and im glad of it the oftener we can repeat that most extraordinary woman my opinion is the better  stand by says the captain turning to the old casebottle with no throatfor it is evening and the midshipmans usual moderate provision of pipes and glasses is on the board heres to her and may she have ever so many more  thankee captain gills says the delighted mr toots i echo the sentiment if youll allow me as my so doing cannot be unpleasant to anybody under the circumstances i think ill take a pipe  mr toots begins to smoke accordingly and in the openness of his heart is very loquacious  of all the remarkable instances that that delightful woman has given of her excellent sense captain gills and mr sols said mr toots i think none is more remarkable than the perfection with which she has understood my devotion to miss dombey  both his auditors assent  because you know says mr toots i have never changed my sentiments towards miss dombey they are the same as ever she is the same bright vision to me at present that she was before i made walterss acquaintance when mrs toots and myself first began to talk ofin short of the tender passion you know captain gills  ay ay my lad says the captain as makes us all slue roundfor which youll overhaul the book  i shall certainly do so captain gills says mr toots with great earnestness when we first began to mention such subjects i explained that i was what you may call a blighted flower you know  the captain approves of this figure greatly and murmurs that no flower as blows is like the rose  but lord bless me pursues mr toots she was as entirely conscious of the state of my feelings as i was myself there was nothing i could tell her she was the only person who could have stood between me and the silent tomb and she did it in a manner to command my everlasting admiration she knows that theres nobody in the world i look up to as i do to miss dombey knows that theres nothing on earth i wouldnt do for miss dombey she knows that i consider miss dombey the most beautiful the most amiable the most angelic of her sex what is her observation upon that the perfection of sense my dear youre right i think so too  and so do i says the captain  so do i says sol gills  then resumes mr toots after some contemplative pulling at his pipe during which his visage has expressed the most contented reflection what an observant woman my wife is what sagacity she possesses what remarks she makes it was only last night when we were sitting in the enjoyment of connubial blisswhich upon my word and honour is a feeble term to express my feelings in the society of my wifethat she said how remarkable it was to consider the present position of our friend walters here observes my wife he is released from seagoing after that first long voyage with his young brideas you know he was mr sols  quite true says the old instrumentmaker rubbing his hands  here he is says my wife released from that immediately appointed by the same establishment to a post of great trust and confidence at home showing himself again worthy mounting up the ladder with the greatest expedition beloved by everybody assisted by his uncle at the very best possible time of his fortuneswhich i think is the case mr sols my wife is always correct  why yes yessome of our lost ships freighted with gold have come home truly returns old sol laughing small craft mr toots but serviceable to my boy  exactly so says mr toots youll never find my wife wrong here he is says that most remarkable woman so situatedand what follows what follows observed mrs toots now pray remark captain gills and mr sols the depth of my wifes penetration why that under the very eye of mr dombey there is a foundation going on upon which aan edifice that was mrs tootss word says mr toots exultingly is gradually rising perhaps to equal perhaps excel that of which he was once the head and the small beginnings of which a common fault but a bad one mrs toots said escaped his memory thus said my wife from his daughter after all another dombey and son will ascendno rise that was mrs tootss wordtriumphant  mr toots with the assistance of his pipewhich he is extremely glad to devote to oratorical purposes as its proper use affects him with a very uncomfortable sensationdoes such grand justice to this prophetic sentence of his wifes that the captain throwing away his glazed hat in a state of the greatest excitement cries  sol gills you man of science and my ould pardner what did i tell walr to overhaul on that there night when he first took to business was it this here quotation turn again whittington lord mayor of london and when you are old you will never depart from it was it them words sol gills  it certainly was ned replied the old instrumentmaker i remember well  then i tell you what says the captain leaning back in his chair and composing his chest for a prodigious roar ill give you lovely peg right through and stand by both on you for the chorus   buried wine grows older as the old madeira did in its time and dust and cobwebs thicken on the bottles  autumn days are shining and on the seabeach there are often a young lady and a whitehaired gentleman with them or near them are two children boy and girl and an old dog is generally in their company  the whitehaired gentleman walks with the little boy talks with him helps him in his play attends upon him watches him as if he were the object of his life if he be thoughtful the whitehaired gentleman is thoughtful too and sometimes when the child is sitting by his side and looks up in his face asking him questions he takes the tiny hand in his and holding it forgets to answer then the child says  what grandpa am i so like my poor little uncle again  yes paul but he was weak and you are very strong  oh yes i am very strong  and he lay on a little bed beside the sea and you can run about  and so they range away again busily for the whitehaired gentleman likes best to see the child free and stirring and as they go about together the story of the bond between them goes about and follows them  but no one except florence knows the measure of the whitehaired gentlemans affection for the girl that story never goes about the child herself almost wonders at a certain secrecy he keeps in it he hoards her in his heart he cannot bear to see a cloud upon her face he cannot bear to see her sit apart he fancies that she feels a slight when there is none he steals away to look at her in her sleep it pleases him to have her come and wake him in the morning he is fondest of her and most loving to her when there is no creature by the child says then sometimes  dear grandpapa why do you cry when you kiss me  he only answers little florence little florence and smooths away the curls that shade her earnest eyes  the voices in the waves speak low to him of florence day and nightplainest when he his blooming daughter and her husband beside them in the evening or sit at an open window listening to their roar they speak to him of florence and his altered heart of florence and their ceaseless murmuring to her of the love eternal and illimitable extending still beyond the sea beyond the sky to the invisible country far away  never from the mighty sea may voices rise too late to come between us and the unseen region on the other shore better far better that they whispered of that region in our childish ears and the swift river hurried us away     preface of 1848  i cannot forego my usual opportunity of saying farewell to my readers in this greetingplace though i have only to acknowledge the unbounded warmth and earnestness of their sympathy in every stage of the journey we have just concluded  if any of them have felt a sorrow in one of the principal incidents on which this fiction turns i hope it may be a sorrow of that sort which endears the sharers in it one to another this is not unselfish in me i may claim to have felt it at least as much as anybody else and i would fain be remembered kindly for my part in the experience   devonshire terrace twentyfourth march 1848   preface of 1867  i make so bold as to believe that the faculty or the habit of correctly observing the characters of men is a rare one i have not even found within my experience that the faculty or the habit of correctly observing so much as the faces of men is a general one by any means the two commonest mistakes in judgement that i suppose to arise from the former default are the confounding of shyness with arrogancea very common mistake indeedand the not understanding that an obstinate nature exists in a perpetual struggle with itself  mr dombey undergoes no violent change either in this book or in real life a sense of his injustice is within him all along the more he represses it the more unjust he necessarily is internal shame and external circumstances may bring the contest to a close in a week or a day but it has been a contest for years and is only fought out after a long balance of victory  i began this book by the lake of geneva and went on with it for some months in france before pursuing it in england the association between the writing and the place of writing is so curiously strong in my mind that at this day although i know in my fancy every stair in the little midshipmans house and could swear to every pew in the church in which florence was married or to every young gentlemans bedstead in doctor blimbers establishment i yet confusedly imagine captain cuttle as secluding himself from mrs macstinger among the mountains of switzerland similarly when i am reminded by any chance of what it was that the waves were always saying my remembrance wanders for a whole winter night about the streets of parisas i restlessly did with a heavy heart on the night when i had written the chapter in which my little friend and i parted company
