29230479	indian summer  by  william d howells  author of the rise of silas lapham a modern instance womans reason etc        indian summer                                       i   midway of the ponte vecchio at florence where three arches break the lines of the little jewellers booths glittering on either hand and open an approach to the parapet colville lounged against the corner of a shop and stared out upon the river it was the late afternoon of a day in january which had begun bright and warm but had suffered a change of mood as its hours passed and now from a sky dimmed with flying grey clouds was threatening rain there must already have been rain in the mountains for the yellow torrent that seethed and swirled around the piers of the bridge was swelling momently on the wall of the lung arno and rolling a threatening flood toward the cascine where it lost itself under the ranks of the poplars that seemed to file across its course and let their delicate tops melt into the pallor of the low horizon  the city with the sweep of the lung arno on either hand and its domes and towers hung in the dull air and the country with its white villas and black cypresses breaking the grey stretches of the olive orchards on its hillsides had alike been growing more and more insufferable and colville was finding a sort of vindictive satisfaction in the power to ignore the surrounding frippery of landscape and architecture he isolated himself so perfectly from it as he brooded upon the river that for any sensible difference he might have been standing on the main street bridge at des vaches indiana looking down at the tawny sweep of the wabash he had no love for that stream nor for the ambitious town on its banks but ever since he woke that morning he had felt a growing conviction that he had been a great ass to leave them he had in fact taken the prodigious risk of breaking his life sharp off from the course in which it had been set for many years and of attempting to renew it in a direction from which it had long been diverted such an act could be precipitated only by a strong impulse of conscience or a profound disgust and with colville it sprang from disgust he had experienced a bitter disappointment in the city to whose prosperity he had given the energies of his best years and in whose favour he imagined that he had triumphantly established himself  he had certainly made the des vaches democratrepublican a very good paper its ability was recognised throughout the state and in des vaches people of all parties were proud of it they liked every morning to see what colville said they believed that in his way he was the smartest man in the state and they were fond of claiming that there was no such writer on any of the indianapolis papers they forgave some political heresies to the talent they admired they permitted him the whim of free trade they laughed tolerantly when he came out in favour of civil service reform and no one had much fault to find when the democratrepublican bolted the nomination of a certain politician of its party for congress but when colville permitted his own name to be used by the opposing party the people arose in their might and defeated him by a tremendous majority that was what the regular nominee said it was a withering rebuke to treason in the opinion of this gentleman it was a good joke anyway with the democratic managers who had taken colville up being all in the republican family whichever it was it was a mortification for colville which his pride could not brook he stood disgraced before the community not only as a theorist and unpractical doctrinaire but as a dangerous man and what was worse he could not wholly acquit himself of a measure of bad faith his conscience troubled him even more than his pride money was found and a printer bought up with it to start a paper in opposition to the democratrepublican then colville contemptuously offered to sell out to the republican committee in charge of the new enterprise and they accepted his terms  in private life he found much of the old kindness returning to him and his successful opponent took the first opportunity of heaping coals of fire on his head in the public street when he appeared to the outer eye to be shaking hands with colville during the months that he remained to close up his affairs after the sale of his paper the postdemocrat republican the newspaper had agglutinated the titles of two of its predecessors after the fashion of american journals was fulsome in its complimentary allusions to him it politely invented the fiction that he was going to europe for his health impaired by his journalistic labours and adventurously promised its readers that they might hope to hear from him from time to time in its columns in some of its allusions to him colville detected the point of a fine irony of which he had himself introduced the practice in the democratrepublican and he experienced with a sense of personal impoverishment the curious fact that a journalist of strong characteristics leaves the tradition of himself in such degree with the journal he has created that he seems to bring very little away he was obliged to confess in his own heart that the paper was as good as ever the assistants who had trained themselves to write like him seemed to be writing quite as well and his honesty would not permit him to receive the consolation offered him by the friends who told him that there was a great falling off in the postdemocratrepublican except that it was rather more stalwart in its republicanism and had turned quite round on the question of the tariff it was very much what it had always been it kept the old decency of tone which he had given it and it maintained the literary character which he was proud of the new management must have divined that its popularity with the women at least was largely due to its careful selections of verse and fiction its literary news and its full and piquant criticisms with their long extracts from new books it was some time since he had personally looked after this department and the young fellow in charge of it under him had remained with the paper its continued excellence which he could not have denied if he had wished seemed to leave him drained and feeble and it was partly from the sense of this that he declined the overtures well backed up with money to establish an independent paper in des vaches he felt that there was not fight enough in him for the work even if he had not taken that strong disgust for public life which included the place and its people he wanted to get away to get far away and with the abrupt and total change in his humour he reverted to a period in his life when journalism and politics and the ambition of congress were things undreamed of  at that period he was a very young architect with an inclination toward the literary side of his profession which made it seem profitable to linger with his ruskin in his hand among the masterpieces of italian gothic when perhaps he might have been better employed in designing redroofed manyverandaed consciously mullioned seaside cottages on the new england coast he wrote a magazine paper on the zoology of the lombardic pillars in verona very ruskinian very scornful of modern motive he visited every part of the peninsula but he gave the greater part of his time to north italy and in venice he met the young girl whom he followed to florence his love did not prosper when she went away she left him in possession of that treasure to a man of his temperament a broken heart from that time his vague dreams began to lift and to let him live in the clear light of common day but he was still lingering at florence ignorant of the good which had befallen him and cowering within himself under the sting of wounded vanity when he received a letter from his elder brother suggesting that he should come and see how he liked the architecture of des vaches his brother had been seven years at des vaches where he had lands and a leadmine and a scheme for a railroad and had lately added a daily newspaper to his other enterprises he had in fact added two newspapers for having unexpectedly and almost involuntarily become the owner of the des vaches republican the fancy of building up a great local journal seized him and he bought the wabash valley democrat uniting them under the name of the democratrepublican but he had trouble almost from the first with his editors and he naturally thought of the brother with a turn for writing who had been running to waste for the last year or two in europe his real purpose was to work colville into the management of his paper when he invited him to come out and look at the architecture of des vaches  colville went because he was at that moment in the humour to go anywhere and because his money was running low and he must begin work somehow he was still romantic enough to like the notion of the place a little because it bore the name given to it by the old french voyageurs from a herd of buffalo cows which they had seen grazing on the site of their camp there but when he came to the place itself he did not like it he hated it but he stayed and as an architect was the last thing any one wanted in des vaches since the jail and courthouse had been built he became half without his willing it a newspaper man he learned in time to relish the humorous intimacy of the life about him and when it was decided that he was no foolthere were doubts growing out of his eastern accent and the work of his new york tailor at firsthe found himself the object of a pleasing popularity in due time he bought his brother out he became very fond of newspaper life its constant excitements and its endless variety and six weeks before he sold his paper he would have scoffed at a prophecy of his return to europe for the resumption of any artistic purpose whatever but here he was lounging on the ponte vecchio at florence whither he had come with the intention of rubbing up his former studies and of perhaps getting back to put them in practice at new york ultimately he had said to himself before coming abroad that he was in no hurry that he should take it very easilyhe had money enough for that yet he would keep architecture before him as an object for he had lived long in a community where every one was intensely occupied and he unconsciously paid to des vaches the tribute of feeling that an objectless life was disgraceful to a man  in the meantime he suffered keenly and at every moment the loss of the occupation of which he had bereaved himself in thinking of quite other things in talk of totally different matters from the dreams of night he woke with a start to the realisation of the fact that he had no longer a newspaper he perceived now as never before that for fifteen years almost every breath of his life had been drawn with reference to his paper and that without it he was in some sort lost and as it were extinct a tide of ridiculous homesickness which was an expression of this passionate regret for the life he had put behind him rather than any longing for des vaches swept over him and the first passages of a letter to the postdemocratrepublican began to shape themselves in his mind he had always when he left home for new york or washington or for his few weeks of summer vacation on the canadian rivers or the new england coast written back to his readers in whom he knew he could count upon quick sympathy in all he saw and felt and he now found himself addressing them with that frank familiarity which comes to the journalist in minor communities from the habit of print he began by confessing to them the defeat of certain expectations with which he had returned to florence and told them that they must not look for anything like the ordinary letters of travel from him but he was not so singular in his attitude toward the place as he supposed for any tourist who comes to florence with the oldfashioned expectation of impressions will probably suffer a disappointment unless he arrives very young and for the first time it is a city superficially so well known that it affects one somewhat like a collection of views of itself they are from the most striking points of course but one has examined them before and is disposed to be critical of them certain emotions certain sensations failed to repeat themselves to colville at sight of the familiar monuments which seemed to wear a hardy and indifferent air as if being stared at so many years by so many thousands of travellers had extinguished in them that sensibility which one likes to fancy in objects of interest everywhere  the life which was as vivid all about him as if caught by the latest instantaneous process made the same comparatively ineffective appeal the operatic spectacle was still there the people with their cloaks statuesquely draped over their left shoulders moved down the street or posed in vehement dialogue on the sidewalks the drama of bargaining with the customers scorn the shopmans pathos came through the open shop door the handsome heavyeyed ladies the bareheaded girls thronged the ways the caffès were full of the wellremembered figures over their newspapers and little cups the officers were as splendid as of old with their long cigars in their mouths their swords kicking against their beautiful legs and their spurs jingling the dandies with their little dogs and their flowerlike smiles were still in front of the confectioners for the inspection of the ladies who passed the old beggar still crouched over her scaldino at the church door and the young man with one leg whom he thought to escape by walking fast had timed him to a second from the other side of the street there was the wonted warmth in the sunny squares and the old familiar damp and stench in the deep narrow streets but some charm had gone out of all this the artisans coming to the doors of their shallow booths for the light on some bit of carpentering or cobbling or tinkering the crowds swarming through the middle of the streets on perfect terms with the winecarts and cab horses the ineffective grandiosity of the palaces huddled upon the crooked thoroughfares the slight but insinuating cold of the southern winter gathering in the shade and dispersing in the sun and denied everywhere by the profusion of fruit and flowers and by the greenery of gardens showing through the grated portals and over the tops of high walls the groups of idle poor permanently or temporarily propped against the bases of edifices with a southern exposure the priests and monks and nuns in their gliding passage the impassioned snapping of the cabmens whips the clangour of bells that at some hours inundated the city and then suddenly subsided and left it to the banging of coppersmiths the openair frying of cakes with its primitive smell of burning fat the tramp of soldiery and the fanfare of bugles blown to gay measuresthese and a hundred other characteristic traits and facts still found a response in the consciousness where they were once a rapture of novelty but the response was faint and thin he could not warm over the old mood in which he once treasured them all away as of equal preciousness  of course there was a pleasure in recognising some details of former experience in florence as they recurred colville had been met at once by a festa when nothing could be done and he was more than consoled by the caressing sympathy with which he was assured that his broken trunk could not be mended till the day after tomorrow he had quite forgotten about the festas and the sympathy that night the piazza on which he lodged seemed full of snow to the casual glance he gave it then he saw that it was the white italian moonlight which he had also forgotten       ii   colville had readied this point in that sarcastic study of his own condition of mind for the advantage of his late readers in the postdemocratrepublican when he was aware of a polite rustling of draperies with an ensuing wellbred murmur which at once ignored him deprecated intrusion upon him and asserted a common right to the prospect on which he had been dwelling alone he looked round with an instinctive expectation of style and poise in which he was not disappointed the lady with a graceful lift of the head and a very erect carriage almost bernhardtesque in the backward fling of her shoulders and the strict compression of her elbows to her side was pointing out the different bridges to the little girl who was with her  that first one is the santa trinità and the next is the carraja and that one quite down by the cascine is the iron bridge the cascine you rememberthe park where we were drivingthat clump of woods there  a vagueness expressive of divided interest had crept into the ladys tone rather than her words colville could feel that she was waiting for the right moment to turn her delicate head sculpturesquely defined by its toque and steal an imperceptible glance at him and he involuntarily afforded her the coveted excuse by the slight noise he made in changing his position in order to be able to go away as soon as he had seen whether she was pretty or not at fortyone the question is still important to every man with regard to every woman  mr colville  the gentle surprise conveyed in the exclamation without time for recognition convinced colville upon a cool review of the facts that the lady had known him before their eyes met  why mrs bowen he said  she put out her round slender arm and gave him a frank clasp of her gloved hand the glove wrinkled richly up the sleeve of her dress halfway to her elbow she bent on his face a demand for just what quality and degree of change he found in hers and apparently she satisfied herself that his inspection was not to her disadvantage for she smiled brightly and devoted the rest of her glance to an electric summary of the facts of colvilles physiognomy the sufficiently good outline of his visage with its full rather closecut drabbishbrown beard and moustache both shaped a little by the ironical selfconscious smile that lurked under them the noncommittal rather wearylooking eyes the brown hair slightly frosted that showed while he stood with his hat still off he was a little above the middle height and if it must be confessed neither his face nor his figure had quite preserved their youthful lines they were both much heavier than when mrs bowen saw them last and the latter here and there swayed beyond the strict bounds of symmetry she was herself in that moment of life when to the middleaged observer at least a womans looks have a charm which is wanting to her earlier bloom by that time her character has wrought itself more clearly out in her face and her heart and mind confront you more directly there it is the youth of her spirit which has come to the surface  i should have known you anywhere she exclaimed with friendly pleasure in seeing him  you are very kind said colville i didnt know that i had preserved my youthful beauty to that degree but i can imagine itif you say so mrs bowen  oh i assure you that you have she protested and now she began gently to pursue him with one fine question after another about himself till she had mastered the main facts of his history since they had last met he would not have known so well how to possess himself of hers even if he had felt the same necessity but in fact it had happened that he had heard of her from time to time at not very long intervals she had married a leading lawyer of her western city who in due time had gone to congress and after his term was out had taken up his residence in washington as the newspapers said in his elegant mansion at the corner of  street and idaho avenue after that he remembered reading that mrs bowen was going abroad for the education of her daughter from which he made his own inferences concerning her marriage and you knew mr bowen was no longer living she said with fit obsequy of tone  yes i knew he answered with decent sympathy  this is my little effie said mrs bowen after a moment and now the child hitherto keeping herself discreetly in the background came forward and promptly gave her hand to colville who perceived that she was not so small as he had thought her at first an effect of infancy had possibly been studied in the brevity of her skirts and the immaturity of her corsage but both were in good taste and really to the advantage of her young figure there was reason and justice in her being dressed as she was for she really was not so old as she looked by two or three years and there was reason in mrs bowens carrying in the hollow of her left arm the india shawl sacque she had taken off and hung there the deep cherry silk lining gave life to the sombre tints prevailing in her dress which its removal left free to express all the grace of her extremely ladylike person ladylike was the word for mrs bowen throughoutfor the turn of her head the management of her arm from the elbow the curve of her hand from wrist to fingertips the smile subdued but sufficiently sweet playing about her little mouth which was yet not too little and the refined and indefinite perfume which exhaled from the ensemble of her silks her laces and her gloves like an odorous version of that otherwise impalpable quality which women call style she had with all her flexibility a certain charming stiffness like the stiffness of a very tall feather  and have you been here a great while she asked turning her head slowly toward colville and looking at him with a little difficulty she had in raising her eyelids when she was younger the glance that shyly stole from under the covert of their lashes was like a gleam of sunshine and it was still like a gleam of paler sunshine  colville whose mood was very susceptible to the weather brightened in the ray i only arrived last night he said with a smile  how glad you must be to get back did you ever see florence more beautiful than it was this morning  not for years said colville with another smile for her pretty enthusiasm not for seventeen years at the least calculation  is it so many cried mrs bowen with lovely dismay yes it is she sighed and she did not speak for an appreciable interval  he knew that she was thinking of that old love affair of his to which she was privy in some degree though he never could tell how much and when she spoke he perceived that she purposely avoided speaking of a certain person whom a woman of more tact or of less would have insisted upon naming at once i never can believe in the lapse of time when i get back to italy it always makes me feel as young as when i left it last  i could imagine youd never left it said colville  mrs bowen reflected a moment is that a compliment  i had an obscure intention of saying something fine but i dont think ive quite made it out he owned  mrs bowen gave her small sweet smile it was very nice of you to try but i havent really been away for some time ive taken a house in florence and ive been here two years palazzo pinti lung arno della zecca you must come and see me thursdays from four till six  thank you said colville  im afraid said mrs bowen remotely preparing to offer her hand in adieu that effie and i broke in upon some very important cogitations of yours she shifted the silken burden off her arm a little and the child stirred from the correct pose she had been keeping and smiled politely  i dont think they deserve a real dictionary word like that said colville i was simply mooning if there was anything definite in my mind i was wishing that i was looking down on the wabash in dos vaches instead of the arno in florence  oh and i supposed you must be indulging all sorts of historical associations with the place effie and i have been walking through the via de bardi where romola lived and i was bringing her back over the ponte vecchio so as to impress the origin of florence on her mind  is that what makes miss effie hate it asked colville looking at the child whose youthful resemblance to her mother was in all things so perfect that a fantastic question whether she could ever have had any other parent swept through him certainly if mrs bowen were to marry again there was nothing in this childs looks to suggest the idea of a predecessor to the second husband  effie doesnt hate any sort of useful knowledge said her mother half jestingly shes just come to me from school at vevay  oh then i think she might persisted colville dont you hate the origin of florence a little he asked of the child  i dont know enough about it she answered with a quick look of question at her mother and checking herself in a possibly indiscreet smile  ah that accounts for it said colville and he laughed it amused him to see the child referring even this point of propriety to her mother and his thoughts idled off to what mrs bowens own untrammelled girlhood must have been in her western city for her daughter there were to be no buggy rides or concerts or dances at the invitation of young men no picnics free and unchaperoned as the casing air no sitting on the steps at dusk with callers who never dreamed of asking for her mother no lingering at the gate with her youthful escort home from the ballnothing of that wild sweet liberty which once made american girlhood a long rapture but would she be any the better for her privations for referring not only every point of conduct but every thought and feeling to her mother he suppressed a sigh for the inevitable change but rejoiced that his own youth had fallen in the earlier time and said you will hate it as soon as youve read a little of it  the difficulty is to read a little of florentine history i cant find anything in less than ten or twelve volumes said mrs bowen effie and i were going to viesseuxs library again in desperation to see if there wasnt something shorter in french  she now offered colville her hand and he found himself very reluctant to let it go something in her looks did not forbid him and when she took her hand away he said let me go to viesseuxs with you mrs bowen and give you the advantage of my unprejudiced ignorance in the choice of a book on florence  oh i was longing to ask you said mrs bowen frankly it is really such a serious matter especially when the book is for a young person unless its very dry its so apt to beobjectionable  yes said colville with a smile at her perplexity he moved off down the slope of the bridge with her between the jewellers shops and felt a singular satisfaction in her company women of fashion always interested him he liked them it diverted him that they should take themselves seriously their resolution their suffering for their ideal such as it was their energy in dressing and adorning themselves the pains they were at to achieve the trivialities they passed their lives in were perpetually delightful to him he often found them people of great simplicity and sometimes of singularly good sense their frequent vein of piety was delicious  ten minutes earlier he would have said that nothing could have been less welcome to him than this encounter but now he felt unwilling to leave mrs bowen  go before effie she said and she added to colville how very florentine all this is if you dropped from the clouds on this spot without previous warning you would know that you were on the ponte vecchio and nowhere else  yes its very florentine colville assented the bridge is very well as a bridge but as a street i prefer the main street bridge at des vaches i was looking at the jewellery before you came up and i dont think its pretty even the old pieces of peasant jewellery why do people come here to look at it if you were going to buy something for a friend would you dream of coming here for it  oh no replied mrs bowen with the deepest feeling  they quitted the bridge and turning to the left moved down the street which with difficulty finds space between the parapet of the river and the shops of the mosaicists and dealers in statuary cramping it on the other hand  heres something distinctively florentine too said colville these tabletops and paperweights and caskets and photograph frames and lockets and breastpins and here this ghostly glare of undersized psyches and hebes and graces in alabaster  oh you mustnt think of any of them mrs bowen broke in with horror if your friend wishes you to get her something characteristically florentine and at the same time very tasteful you must go  colville gave a melancholy laugh my friend is an abstraction mrs bowen without sex or any sort of entity  oh said mrs bowen some fine drops had begun to sprinkle the pavement what a ridiculous blunder its raining effie im afraid we must give up your book for today were not dressed for damp weather and wed better hurry home as soon as possible she got promptly into the shelter of a doorway and gathered her daughter to her while she flung her sacque over her shoulder and caught her draperies from the ground for the next movement mr colville will you please stop the first closed carriage that comes in sight  a figure of primo tenore had witnessed the manoeuvre from the box of his cab he held up his whip and at a nod from colville he drove abreast of the doorway his brokenkneed tremulous little horse gay in brassmounted harness and with a stiff turkey feather stuck upright at one ear in his headstall  mrs bowen had no more scruple than another woman in stopping travel and traffic in a public street for her convenience she now entered into a brisk parting conversation with colville such as ladies love blocking the narrow sidewalk with herself her daughter and her open carriage door and making people walk round her cab in the road which they did meekly enough with the florentine submissiveness to the pretensions of any sort of vehicle she said a dozen important things that seemed to have just come into her head and why how stupid i am she called out making colville check the driver in his first start after she had got into the cab we are to have a few people tonight if you have no engagement i should be so glad to have you come cant you  yes i can said colville admiring the whole transaction and the parties to it with a passive smile  after finding her pocket she found that her cardcase was not in it but in the purse she had given effie to carry but she got her address at last and gave it to colville though he said he should remember it without any time between nine and eleven she said its so nice of you to promise  she questioned him from under her halflifted eyelids and he added with a laugh ill come and was rewarded with two pretty smiles just alike from mother and daughter as they drove away       iii   twenty years earlier when mrs bowen was miss lina ridgely she used to be the friend and confidante of the girl who jilted colville they were then both so young that they could scarcely have been a year out of school before they left home for the year they were spending in europe but to the young mans inexperience they seemed the wisest and maturest of society women his heart quaked in his breast when he saw them talking and laughing together for fear they should be talking and laughing about him he was even a little more afraid of miss ridgely than of her friend who was dashing and effective where miss ridgely was serene and elegant according to his feeling at that time but he never saw her after his rejection and it was not till he read of her marriage with the hon mr bowen that certain vague impressions began to define themselves he then remembered that lina ridgely in many fine little ways had shown a kindness almost a compassion for him as for one whose unconsciousness a hopeless doom impended over he perceived that she had always seemed to like hima thing that had not occurred to him in the stupid absorption of his passion for the otherand fragments of proof that she had probably defended and advocated him occurred to him and inspired a vain and retrospective gratitude he abandoned himself to regrets which were proper enough in regard to miss ridgely but were certainly a little unlawful concerning mrs bowen  as he walked away toward his hotel he amused himself with the conjecture whether he with his fortyone years and his hundred and eighty five pounds were not still a pathetic and even a romantic figure to this pretty and kindly woman who probably imagined him as heartbroken as ever he was very willing to see more of her if she wished but with the rain beginning to fall more thick and chill in the darkening street he could have postponed their next meeting till a pleasanter evening without great selfdenial he felt a little twinge of rheumatism in his shoulder when he got into his room for your room in a florentine hotel is always some degrees colder than outdoors unless you have fire in it and with the sun shining on his windows when he went out after lunch it had seemed to colville ridiculous to have his morning fire kept up the sun was what he had taken the room for it was in it the landlord assured him from ten in the morning till four in the afternoon and so in fact it was when it shone but even then it was not fully in it but had a trick of looking in at the sides of the window and painting the chamber wall with a delusive glow colville raked away the ashes of his fireplace and throwing on two or three fagots of broom and pine sprays he had a blaze that would be very pretty to dress by after dinner but that gave out no warmth for the present he left it and went down to the readingroom as it was labelled over the door in homage to a predominance of englishspeaking people among the guests but there was no fire there that was kindled only by request and he shivered at the bare aspect of the apartment with its cold piano its locked bookcases and its table where the london times the neue freie presse of vienna and the italie of rome exposed their titles one just beyond the margin of the other he turned from the door and went into the diningroom where the stove was ostentatiously roaring over its small logs and its lozenges of peat but even here the fire had been so recently lighted that the warmth was potential rather than actual by stooping down before the stove and pressing his shoulder against its brass doors colville managed to lull his enemy while he studied the figures of the womanheaded womanbreasted hounds developing into vines and foliage that covered the frescoed trellising of the quadrangularly vaulted ceiling the waiters in their veteran dresscoats were putting the final touches to the table and the sound of voices outside the door obliged colville to get up the effort involved made him still more reluctant about going out to mrs bowens  the door opened and some english ladies entered faintly acknowledging provisionally ignoring his presence and talking of what they had been doing since lunch they agreed that it was really too cold in the churches for any pleasure in the pictures and that the pitti gallery where they had those braziers was the only place you could go with comfort a french lady and her husband came in a russian lady followed an italian gentleman an american family and three or four detached men of the englishspeaking race whose language at once became the law of the table  as the dinner progressed from soup to fish and from the entrée to the roast and salad the combined effect of the pleasant cheer and the increasing earnestness of the stove made the room warmer and warmer they drank chianti wine from the wickercovered flasks tied with tufts of red and green silk in which they serve table wine at florence and said how pretty the bottles were but how the wine did not seem very good  it certainly isnt so good as it used to be said colville  ah then you have been in florhence before said the french lady whose english proved to be much better than the french that he began to talk to her in  yes a great while ago in a state of preexistence in fact he said  the lady looked a little puzzled but interested in a state of prheexistence she repeated  yes when i was young he added catching the gleam in her eye when i was twentyfour a great while ago  you must be an amerhican said the lady with a laugh  why do you think so from my accent  frhom your metaphysics too the amerhicans like to talk in that way  i didnt know it said colville  they like to strhike the key of personality they cant endure not being interhested they must rhelate everything to themselves or to those with whom they are talking  and the french no asked colville  the lady laughed again there is a large amerhican colony in parhis perhaps we have learned to be like you  the ladys husband did not speak english and it was probably what they had been saying that she interpreted to him for he smiled looking forward to catch colvilles eye in a friendly way and as if he would not have him take his wifes talk too seriously  the italian gentleman on colvilles right was politely offering him the salad which had been left for the guests to pass to one another colville thanked him in italian and they began to talk of italian affairs one thing led to another and he found that his new friend who was not yet his acquaintance was a member of parliament and a republican  that interests me as an american said colville but why do you want a republic in italy  when we have a constitutional king why should we have a king asked the italian  an englishman across the table relieved colville from the difficulty of answering this question by asking him another that formed talk about it between them he made his tacit observation that the english since he met them last seemed to have grown in the grace of facile speech with strangers it was the american family which kept its talk within itself and hushed to a tone so low that no one else could hear it colville did not like their mumbling for the honour of the country which we all have at heart however little we think it he would have preferred that they should speak up and not seem afraid or ashamed he thought the english manner was better in fact he found himself in an unexpectedly social mood he joined in helping to break the ice he laughed and hazarded comment with those who were newcomers like himself and was very respectful of the opinions of people who had been longer in the hotel when they spoke of the cooks habit of underdoing the vegetables the dinner at the hotel datene made an imposing show on the carte du jour it looked like ten or twelve courses but in fact it was five and even when eked out with roast chestnuts and butter into six it seemed somehow to stop very abruptly though one seemed to have had enough you could have coffee afterward if you ordered it colville ordered it and was sorry when the last of his commensals slightly bowing him a goodnight left him alone to it  he had decided that he need not fear the damp in a cab rapidly driven to mrs bowens when he went to his room he had his doubts about his dresscoat but he put it on and he took the crush hat with which he had provided himself in coming through london that was a part of the social panoply unknown in des vaches he had hardly been a dozen times in evening dress there in fifteen years and his suit was as new as his hat as he turned to the glass he thought himself personable enough and in fact he was one of those men who look better in evening dress than in any other the broad expanse of shirt bosom with its three small studs of gold dropping points of light one below the other softened his strong almost harsh face and balanced his rather large head in his morning coat people had to look twice at him to make sure that he did not look common but now he was not wrong in thinking that he had an air of distinction as he took his hat under his arm and stood before the pierglass in his room he was almost tempted to shave and wear his moustache alone as he used to do he had let his beard grow because he found that under the lax social regimen at des vaches he neglected shaving and went about days at a time with his face in an offensive stubble taking his chin between his fingers and peering closer into the mirror he wondered how mrs bowen should have known him she must have remembered him very vividly he would like to take off his beard and put on the youthfulness that comes of shaving and see what she would say perhaps he thought with a last glance at his toilet he was overdoing it if she were only to have a few people as she promised he put a thick neckerchief over his chest so as not to provoke that abominable rheumatism by any sort of exposure and he put on his ulster instead of the light spring overcoat that he had gone about with all day  he found that palazzo pinti when you came to it was rather a grand affair with a goldbanded porter eating salad in the lodge at the great doorway and a handsome gate of iron cutting you off from the regions above till you had rung the bell of mrs bowens apartment when it swung open of itself and you mounted at her door a man in modified livery received colville and helped him off with his overcoat so skilfully that he did not hurt his rheumatic shoulder at all there were half a dozen other hats and coats on the carved chests that stood at intervals along the wall and some gayer wraps that exhaled a faint fascinating fragrance on the chilly air colville experienced the slight exhilaration the mingled reluctance and eagerness of a man who formally reenters an assemblage of society after long absence from it and rubbing his hands a little nervously together he put aside the yellow abruzzi blanket portière and let himself into the brilliant interior  mrs bowen stood in front of the fire in a brown silk of subdued splendour and with her hands and fan and handkerchief tastefully composed before her at sight of colville she gave a slight start which would have betrayed to him if he had been another woman that she had not really believed he would come and came forward with a rustle and murmur of pleasure to meet him he had politely made a rush upon her so as to spare her this exertion and he was tempted to a longforgotten foppishness of attitude as he stood talking with her during the brief interval before she introduced him to any of the company she had been honest with him there were not more than twentyfive or thirty people there but if he had overdone it in dressing for so small an affair he was not alone and he was not sorry he was sensible of a better personal effect than the men in frockcoats and cutaways were making and he perceived with selfsatisfaction that his evening dress was of better style than that of the others who wore it at least no one else carried a crush hat  at fortyone a man is still very much of a boy and colville was obscurely willing that mrs bowen whose life since they last met at an evening party had been passed chiefly at new york and washington should see that he was a man of the world in spite of des vaches before she had decided which of the company she should first present him to her daughter came up to his elbow with a cup of tea and some bread and butter on a tray and gave him goodevening with charming correctness of manner really he said turning about to take the cup i thought it was you mrs bowen who had got round to my side with a sash on how do you and miss effie justify yourselves in looking so bewitchingly alike  you notice it then mrs bowen seemed delighted  i did every moment you were together today you dont mind my having been so personal in my observations  oh not at all said mrs bowen and colville laughed  it must be true he said what a french lady said to me at the tabledhôte dinner tonight the amerhicans always strhike the note of perhsonality he neatly imitated the french ladys guttural accent  i suppose we do mused mis bowen and that we dont mind it in each other i wish you would say which i shall introduce you to she said letting her glance stray invisibly over her company where all the people seemed comfortably talking  oh theres no hurry put it off till tomorrow said colville  oh no that wont do said mrs bowen like a woman who has public duties to perform and is resolute to sacrifice her private pleasure to them but she postponed them a moment longer i hope you got home before the rain she said  yes returned colville that is i dont mind a little sprinkling who is the junonian young person at the end of the room  ah said mrs bowen you cant be introduced to her first but isnt she lovely  yes its a wonderful effect of white and gold  you mustnt say that to her she was doubtful about her dress because she says that the ivory white with her hair makes her look just like white and gold furniture  present me at once then before i forget not to say it to her  no i must keep you for some other person anybody can talk to a pretty girl  colville said he did not know whether to smile or shed tears at this embittered compliment and pretended an eagerness for the acquaintance denied him  mrs bowen seemed disposed to intensify his misery did you ever see a more statuesque creaturewith those superb broad shoulders and that little head and that thick braid brought round over the top doesnt her face with that calm look in those starry eyes and that peculiar fall of the corners of the mouth remind you of some of those exquisite great du maurier women that style of face is very fashionable now you might think he had made it so  is there a fashion in faces asked colville  why certainly you must know that  then why arent all the ladies in the fashion  it isnt one that can be put on besides every one hasnt got imogene grahams figure to carry it off  thats her name thenimogene graham its a very pretty name  yes shes staying with me for the winter now thats all i can allow you to know for the present come you must  but this is worse than nothing he made a feint of protesting as she led him away and named him to the lady she wished him to know but he was not really sorry he had his modest misgivings whether he were equal to quite so much young lady as miss graham seemed when he no longer looked at her he had a whimsical impression of her being a heroic statue of herself  the lady whom mrs bowen left him with had not much to say and she made haste to introduce her husband who had a great deal to say he was an italian but master of that very efficient english which the italians get together with unimaginable sufferings from our orthography and colville repeated the republican deputys saying about a constitutional king which he had begun to think was neat  i might prefer a republic myself said the italian but i think that gentleman is wrong to be a republican where he is and for the present the monarchy is the condition of our unity nothing else could hold us together and we must remain united if we are to exist as a nation its a necessity like our army of half a million men we may not like it in itself but we know that it is our salvation he began to speak of the economic state of italy of the immense cost of freedom and independence to a people whose political genius enables them to bear quietly burdens of taxation that no other government would venture to impose he spoke with that fond that appealing patriotism which expresses so much to the sympathetic foreigner in italy the sense of great and painful uncertainty of italys future through the complications of diplomacy the memory of her sufferings in the past the spirit of quiet and inexhaustible patience for trials to come this resolution which is almost resignation poetises the attitude of the whole people it made colville feel as if he had done nothing and borne nothing yet  i am ashamed he said not without a remote resentment of the unworthiness of the republican voters of des vaches when i hear of such things to think of what we are at home with all our resources and opportunities  the italian would have politely excused us to him but colville would have no palliation of our political and moral nakedness and he framed a continuation of the letter he began on the ponte vecchio to the postdemocratrepublican in which he made a bitterly ironical comparison of the achievements of italy and america in the last ten years  he forgot about miss graham and had only a vague sense of her splendour as he caught sight of her in the long mirror which she stood before she was talking to a very handsome young clergyman and smiling upon him the company seemed to be mostly americans but there were a good many evident english also and colville was dimly aware of a question in his mind whether this clergyman was english or american there were three or four italians and there were some germans who spoke english  colville moved about from group to group as his enlarging acquaintance led and found himself more interested in society than he could ever have dreamed of being again it was certainly a defect of the life at des vaches that people after the dancing and lovemaking period went out rarely or never he began to see that the time he had spent so busily in that enterprising city had certainly been in some sense wasted  at a certain moment in the evening which perhaps marked its advancement the teaurn was replaced by a jug of the rum punch mild or strong according to the custom of the house which is served at most florentine receptions some of the people went immediately after but the young clergyman remained talking with miss graham  colville with his smoking glass in his hand found himself at the side of a friendly old gentleman who had refused the punch they joined in talk by a common impulse and the old gentleman said directly you are an american i presume  his accent had already established the fact of his own nationality but he seemed to think it the part of candour to say when colville had acknowledged his origin im an american myself  ive met several of our countrymen since i arrived suggested colville  the old gentleman seemed to like this way of putting it well yes were not unfairly represented here in numbers i must confess but im bound to say that i dont find our countrymen so aggressive so loud as our international novelists would make out i havent met any of their peculiar heroines as yet sir  colville could not help laughing i wish i had but perhaps they avoid people of our years and discretion or else take such a filial attitude toward us that we cant recognise them  perhaps perhaps cried the old gentleman with cheerful assent  i was talking with one of our german friends here just now and he complained that the american girlsespecially the rich onesseem very calculating and worldly and conventional i told him i didnt know how to account for that i tried to give him some notion of the ennobling influences of society in newport as ive had glimpses of it  the old gentleman caressed his elbows which he was holding in the palms of his hands in high enjoyment of colvilles sarcasm ah very good very good he said i quite agree with you and i think the other sort are altogether preferable  i think continued colville dropping his ironical tone that weve much less to regret in their unsuspecting unsophisticated freedom than in the type of hard materialism which we produce in young girls perfectly wide awake disenchanted unromantic who prefer the worldly vanities and advantages deliberately and on principle recognising something better merely to despise it ive sometimes seen them  mrs bowen came up in her gentle inquiring way im glad that you and mr colville have made acquaintance she said to the old gentleman  oh but we havent said colville were entire strangers  then ill introduce you to rev mr waters and take you away she added putting her hand through colvilles arm with a delicate touch that flattered his whole being for your times come at last and im going to present you to miss graham  i dont know he said of course as there is a miss graham i cant help being presented to her but i had almost worked myself up to the point of wishing there were none i believe im afraid  oh i dont believe that at all a simple schoolgirl like that mrs bowens sense of humour had not the national acuteness she liked joking in men but she did not know how to say funny things back youll see as you come up to her       iv   miss graham did indeed somehow diminish in the nearer perspective she ceased to be overwhelming when colville lifted his eyes from bowing before her he perceived that shewas neither so very tall nor so very large but possessed merely a generous amplitude of womanhood but she was even more beautiful with a sweet and youthful radiance of look that was very winning if she had ceased to be the goddess she looked across the length of the salon she had gained much by becoming an extremely lovely young girl and her teeth when she spoke showed a fascinating little irregularity that gave her the last charm  mrs bowen glided away with the young clergyman but effie remained at miss grahams side and seemed to have hold of the left hand which the girl let hang carelessly behind her in the volume of her robe the childs face expressed an adoration of miss graham far beyond her allegiance to her mother  i began to doubt whether mrs bowen was going to bring you at all she said frankly with an innocent nervous laugh which made favour for her with colville she promised it early in the evening  she has used me much worse miss graham said colville she has kept me waiting from the beginning of time so that i have grown grey on my way up to you he added by an inspiration i was a comparatively young man when mrs bowen first told me she was going to introduce me  oh how good said miss graham joyously and her companion after a moments hesitation permitted herself a polite little titter she had made a discovery she had discovered that mr colville was droll  im very glad you like it he said with a gravity that did not deceive them  oh yes sighed miss graham with generous ardour who but an american could say just such things theres the loveliest old lady here in florence whos lived here thirty years and shes always going back and never getting back and shes so homesick she doesnt know what to do and she always says that americans may not be better than other people but they are different  thats very pretty theyre different in everything but thinking themselves better their native modesty prevents that  i dont exactly know what you mean said miss graham after a little hesitation  well returned colville i havent thought it out very clearly myself yet i may mean that the americans differ from other people in not thinking well of themselves or they may differ from them in not thinking well enough but what i said had a very epigrammatic sound and i prefer not to investigate it too closely  this made miss graham and miss effie both cry out oh in delighted doubt of his intention they both insensibly drifted a little nearer to him  there was a french lady said to me at the tabledhote this evening that she knew i was an american because the americans always strike the key of personality he practised these economies of material in conversation quite recklessly and often made the same incident or suggestion do duty round a whole company  ah i dont believe that said miss graham  believe what  that the americans always talk about themselves  im not sure she meant that you never can tell what a person means by what he saysor she  how shocking  perhaps the french lady meant that we always talk about other people thats in the key of personality too  but i dont believe we do said miss graham at any rate she was talking about us then  oh she accounted for that by saying there was a large american colony in paris who had corrupted the french and taught them our pernicious habit of introspection  do you think were very introspective  do you  i know im not i hardly ever think about myself at all at any rate not till its too late thats the great trouble i wish i could but im always studying other people theyre so much more interesting  perhaps if you knew yourself better you wouldnt think so suggested colville  yes i know they are i dont think any young person can be interesting  then what becomes of all the novels theyre full of young persons  theyre ridiculous if i were going to write a novel i should take an old person for a herothirtyfive or forty she looked at colville and blushing a little hastened to add i dont believe that they begin to be interesting much before that time such flat things as young men are always saying dont you remember that passage somewhere in heines pictures of travel where he sees the hand of a lady coming out from under her mantle when shes confessing in a church and he knows that its the hand of a young person who has enjoyed nothing and suffered nothing its so smooth and flowerlike after i read that i hated the look of my handsi was only sixteen and it seemed as if i had had no more experience than a child oh i like people to go through something dont you  well yes i suppose i do other people  no but dont you like it for yourself  i cant tell i havent been through anything worth speaking of yet  miss graham looked at him dubiously but pursued with ardour why just getting back to florence after not having been here for so longi should think it would be so romantic oh dear i wish i were here for the second time  im afraid you wouldnt like it so well said colville i wish i were here for the first time theres nothing like the first time in everything  do you really think so  well theres nothing like the first time in florence  oh i cant imagine it i should think that recalling the old emotions would be perfectly fascinating  yes if theyd come when you do call them but theyre as contraryminded as spirits from the vasty deep ive been shouting around here for my old emotions all day and i havent had a responsive squeak  oh cried miss graham staring fulleyed at him how delightful effie bowen turned away her pretty little head and laughed as if it might not be quite kind to laugh at a persons joke to his face  stimulated by their appreciation colville went on with more nonsense no the only way to get at your old emotions in regard to florence is to borrow them from somebody whos having them fresh what do you think about florence miss graham  i ive been here two months  then its too late  no i dont know that it is i keep feeling the strangeness all the time but i cant tell you its very different from buffalo i can assure you  buffalo i can imagine the difference and its not altogether to the disadvantage of buffalo  oh have you been there asked miss graham with a touching little eagerness do you know anybody in buffalo  some of the newspaper men and i pass through there once a year on my way to new yorkor used to its a lively place  yes it is sighed miss graham fondly  do the girls of buffalo still come out at night and dance by the light of the moon  what  ah i see said colville peering at her under his thoughtfully knitted brows you do belong to another era you dont remember the old negro minstrel song  no said miss graham i can only remember the end of the war  how divinely young said colville well he added i wish that french lady could have overheard us miss graham i think she would have changed her mind about americans striking the note of personality in their talk  oh exclaimed the girl reproachfully after a moment of swift reflection and recognition i dont see how you could let me do it you dont suppose that i should have talked so with every one it was because you were another american and such an old friend of mrs bowens  that is what i shall certainly tell the french lady if she attacks me about it said colville he glanced carelessly toward the end of the room and saw the young clergyman taking leave of mrs bowen all the rest of the company were gone bless me he said i must be going  mrs bowen had so swiftly advanced upon him that she caught the last words why she asked  because its tomorrow i suspect and the invitation was for one day only  it was a season ticket said mrs bowen with gay hospitality and it isnt tomorrow for half an hour yet i cant think of letting you go come up to the fire all and lets sit down by it its at its very best  effie looked a pretty surprise and a pleasure in this girlish burst from her mother whose habitual serenity made it more striking in contrast and she forsook miss grahams hand and ran forward and disposed the easychairs comfortably about the hearth  colville and mrs bowen suddenly found themselves upon those terms which often succeed a long separation with people who have felt kindly toward each other at a former meeting and have parted friends they were much more intimate than they had supposed themselves to be or had really any reason for being  which one of your guests do you wish me to offer up mrs bowen he asked from the hollow of the armchair not too low which he had sunk into with mrs bowen in a higher chair at his right hand and miss graham intent upon him from the sofa on his left a sense of delicious satisfaction filled him from head to foot there isnt one i would spare if you said the word  and there isnt one i want destroyed im sorry to say answered mrs bowen dont you think they were all very agreeable  yes yes agreeable enoughagreeable enough i suppose but they stayed too long when i think we might have been sitting here for the last halfhour if theyd only gone sooner i find it pretty hard to forgive them  mrs bowen and miss graham exchanged glances above his heada glance which demanded didnt i tell you for a glance that answered oh he is effie bowens eyes widened she kept them fastened upon colville in silent worship  he asked who were certain of the company that he had noticed and mrs bowen let him make a little fun of them the fun was very goodnatured he repeated what the german had said about the worldly ambition of american girls but she would not allow him so great latitude in this she said they were no worldlier than other girls of course they were fond of society and some of them got a little spoiled but they were in no danger of becoming too conventional  colville did not insist i missed the military tonight mrs bowen he said i thought one couldnt get through an evening in florence without officers  we have them when there is dancing returned mrs bowen  yes but they dont know anything but dancing miss graham broke in i like some one who can talk something besides compliments  you are very peculiar you know imogene urged mrs bowen gently i dont think our young men at home do much better in conversation if you come to that though  oh young men yes theyre the same everywhere but here even when theyre away along in the thirties they think that girls can only enjoy flattery i should like a gentleman to talk to me without a single word or look to show that he thought i was goodlooking  ah how could he he colville insinuated and the young girl coloured  i mean if i were pretty this everlasting adulation is insulting  mr morton doesnt flatter said mrs bowen thoughtfully turning the feather screen she held at her face now edgewise now flatwise toward colville  oh no owned miss graham hes a clergyman  mrs bowen addressed herself to colville you must go to hear him some day hes very interesting if you dont mind his being rather low church  colville was going to pretend to an advanced degree of ritualism but it occurred to him that it might be a serious matter to mrs bowen and he asked instead who was the rev mr waters  oh isnt he lovely cried miss graham there mrs bowen mr waterss manner is what i call truly complimentary he always talks to you as if he expected you to be interested in serious matters and as if you were his intellectual equal and hes so happy here in florence he gives you the impression of feeling every breath he breathes here a privilege you ought to hear him talk about savonarola mr colville  well said colville ive heard a great many people talk about savonarola and im rather glad he talked to me about american girls  american girls uttered miss graham in a little scream did mr waters talk to you about girls  yes why not he was probably in love with one once  mr waters cried the girl what nonsense  well then with some old lady would you like that better  miss graham looked at mrs bowen for permission as it seemed and then laughed but did not attempt any reply to colville  you find even that incredible of such pyramidal antiquity he resumed well it is hard to believe i told him what that german said and we agreed beautifully about another type of american girl which we said we preferred  oh what could it be demanded miss graham  ah it wouldnt be so easy to say right offhand answered colville indolently  mrs bowen put her hand under the elbow of the arm holding her screen i dont believe i should agree with you so well she said apparently with a sort of didactic intention  they entered into a discussion which is always fruitful with americansthe discussion of american girlhood and colville contended for the old national ideal of girlish liberty as wide as the continent as fast as the mississippi mrs bowen withstood him with delicate firmness oh he said youre europeanised  i certainly prefer the european plan of bringing up girls she replied steadfastly i shouldnt think of letting a daughter of mine have the freedom i had  well perhaps it will come right in the next generation then she will let her daughter have the freedom she hadnt  not if im alive to prevent it cried mrs bowen  colville laughed which plan do you prefer miss graham  i dont think its quite the same now as it used to be answered the girl evasively  well then all i can say is that if i had died before this chance i had lived a blessed time i perceive more and more that im obsolete im in my dotage i prattle of the good old times and the new spirit of the age flouts me miss effie do you prefer the amer  no thank you said her mother quickly  effie is out of the question its time you were in bed effie  the child came with instant submissiveness and kissed her mother goodnight she kissed miss graham and gave her hand to colville he held it a moment letting her pull shyly away from him while he lolled back in his chair and laughed at her with his sad eyes its past the time i should be in bed my dear and im sitting up merely because theres nobody to send me its not that im really such a very bad boy good night dont put me into a disagreeable dream put me into a nice one the child bridled at the mild pleasantry and when colville released her hand she suddenly stooped forward and kissed him  youre so funny she cried and ran and escaped beyond the portière  mrs bowen stared in the same direction but not with severity really effie has been carried a little beyond herself  well said colville thats one conquest since i came to florence and merely by being funny when i was in florence before mrs bowen he continued after a moment there were two ladies here and i used to go about quite freely with either of them they were both very pretty and we were all very young dont you think it was charming mrs bowen coloured a lovely red and smiled but made no other response florence has changed very much for the worse since that time there used to be a pretty flowergirl with a wideflapping straw hat who flung a heavy bough full of roses into my lap when she met me driving across the carraja bridge i spent an hour looking for that girl today and couldnt find her the only flowergirl i could find was a fat one of fifty who kept me fifteen minutes in via tornabuoni while she was fumbling away at my buttonhole trying to poke three secondhand violets and a sickly daisy into it ah youth youth i suppose a young fellow could have found that other flowergirl at a glance but my old eyes no we belong each of us to our own generation mrs bowen he said with a touch of tragedywhether real or affected he did not well know himselfin his hardiness what has become of mrs pilsbury  mrs milbury you mean gasped mrs bowen in affright at his boldness  milbury bilbury pilsburyits all one so long as it isnt  theyre living in chicago she hastened to reply as if she were afraid he was going to say so long as it isnt colville and she could not have borne that  colville clasped his hands at the back of his head and looked at mrs bowen with eyes that let her know that he was perfectly aware she had been telling miss graham of his youthful romance and that he had now touched it purposely and you wouldnt he said as if that were quite relevant to what they had been talking aboutyou wouldnt let miss graham go out walking alone with a dotard like me  certainly not said mrs bowen  colville got to his feet by a surprising activity goodbye miss graham he offered his hand to her with burlesque despair and then turned to mrs bowen thank you for such a pleasant evening what was your day did you say  oh any day said mrs bowen cordially giving her hand  do you know whom you look like he asked holding it  no  lina ridgely  the ladies stirred softly in their draperies after he was gone they turned and faced the hearth where a log burned in a bed of hot ashes softly purring and ticking to itself and whilst they stood pressing their hands against the warm fronts of their dresses as the fashion of women is before a fire the clock on the mantel began to strike twelve  was that her name asked miss graham when the clock had had its say lina ridgely  no that was my name answered mrs bowen  oh yes murmured the young girl apologetically  she led him on she certainly encouraged him it was shocking he was quite wild about it  she must have been a cruel girl how could he speak of it so lightly  it was best to speak of it and have done with it said mrs bowen he knew that i must have been telling you something about it  yes how bold it was a young man couldnt have done it yes hes fascinating but how old and sad he looked as he lay back there in the chair  old i dont think he looked old he looked sad yes its left its mark on him  the log burned quite through to its core and fell asunder a bristling mass of embers they had been looking at it with downcast heads now they lifted their faces and saw the pity in each others eyes and the beautiful girl impulsively kissed the pretty woman goodnight       v   colville fell asleep with the flattered sense which abounds in the heart of a young man after his first successful evening in society but which can visit maturer life only upon some such conditions of long exile and return as had been realised in his the looks of these two charming women followed him into his dreams he knew he must have pleased them the dramatic homage of the child was evidence of that and though it had been many years since he had found it sufficient cause of happiness to have pleased a woman the desire to do so was by no means extinct in him the eyes of the girl hovered above him like stars he felt in their soft gaze that he was a romance to her young heart and this made him laugh it also made him sigh  he woke at dawn with a sharp twinge in his shoulder and he rose to give himself the pleasure of making his own fire with those fagots of broom and pine twigs which he had enjoyed the night before promising himself to get back into bed when the fire was well going and sleep late while he stood before the open stove the jangling of a small bell outside called him to the window and he saw a procession which had just issued from the church going to administer the extreme unction to some dying person across the piazza the parish priest went first bearing the consecrated wafer in its vessel and at his side an acolyte holding a yellow silk umbrella over the eucharist after them came a number of facchini in white robes and white hoods that hid their faces their tapers burned sallow and lifeless in the new morning light the bell jangled dismally  they even die dramatically in this country thought colville in whom the artist was taken with the effectiveness of the spectacle before his human pity was stirred for the poor soul who was passing he reproached himself for that and instead of getting back to bed he dressed and waited for the mature hour which he had ordered his breakfast for when it came at last picturesquely borne on the open hand of giovanni steaming coffee hot milk sweet butter in delicate disks and two white eggs coyly tucked in the fold of a napkin and all grouped upon the wide salver it brought him a measure of the consolation which good cheer imparts to the ridiculous human heart even in the house where death is but the sad incident tempered his mind with a sort of pensiveness that lasted throughout the morning and quite till lunch he spent the time in going about the churches but the sunshine which the day began with was overcast as it was the day before and the churches were rather too dark and cold in the afternoon he went to viesseuxs readingroom and looked over the english papers which he did not care for much and he also made a diligent search of the catalogue for some book about florence for little effie bowen he thought he would like to surprise her mother with his interest in the matter as the day waned toward dark he felt more and more tempted to take her at her word when she had said that any day was her day to him and go to see her if he had been a younger man he would have anxiously considered this indulgence and denied himself but after forty a man denies himself no reasonable and harmless indulgence he has learned by that time that it is a pity and a folly to do so  colville found mrs bowens room half full of arriving and departing visitors and then he remembered that it was this day she had named to him on the ponte vecchio and when miss graham thanked him for coming his first thursday he made a merit of not having forgotten it and said he was going to come every thursday during the winter miss graham drew him a cup of tea from the russian samovar which replaces in some florentine houses the teapot of occidental civilisation and colville smiled upon it and upon her bending over the brazen urn with a flowerlike tilt of her beautiful head she wore an aesthetic dress of creamy camelshair whose colour pleased the eye as its softness would have flattered the touch  what a very tourguéneffish effect the samovar gives he said taking a biscuit from the basket effie bowen brought him shrinking with redoubled shyness from the eyebrows which he arched at her i wonder you can keep from calling me fedor colvillitch where is your mother effie bowenovna he asked of the child with a temptation to say imogene grahamovna  they both looked mystified but miss graham said im sorry to say you wont see mrs bowen today she has a very bad headache and has left effie and me to receive we feel very incompetent but she says it will do us good  there were some people there of the night before and colville had to talk to them one of the ladies asked him if he had met the inglehart boys as he came in  the inglehart boys no what are the inglehart boys  they were here all last winter and theyve just got back its rather exciting for florence she gave him a rapid sketch of that interesting exodus of a score of young painters from the art school at munich under the head of the singular and fascinating genius by whose name they became known they had their own school for a while in munich and then they all came down into italy in a body they had their studio things with them and they travelled third class and they made the greatest excitement everywhere and had the greatest fun they were a great sensation in florence they went everywhere and were such favourites i hope they are going to stay  i hope so too said colville i should like to see them  dear me said the lady with a glance at the clock its five i must be going  the other ladies went and colville approached to take leave but miss graham detained him  what is tourguéneffish she demanded  the quality of the great russian novelist tourguéneff said colville perceiving that she had not heard of him  oh  you ought to read him the samovar sends up its agreeable odour all through his books read lisa if you want your heart really broken  im glad you approve of heartbreaks in books so many people wont read anything but cheerful books its the only quarrel i have with mrs bowen she says there are so many sad things in life that they ought to be kept out of books  ah there i perceive a divided duty said colville i should like to agree with both of you but if mrs bowen were here i should remind her that if there are so many sad things in life that is a very good reason for putting them in books too  of course i shall tell her what you said  why i dont object to a certain degree of cheerfulness in books only dont carry it too farthats all  this made the young girl laugh and colville was encouraged to go on he told her of the sight he had seen from his window at daybreak and he depicted it all very graphically and made her feel its pathos perhaps more keenly than he had felt it now that little incident kept with me all day tempering my boisterous joy in the giottos and reducing me to a decent composure in the presence of the cimabues and its pretty hard to keep from laughing at some of them dont you think  the young people perceived that he was making fun again but he continued with an air of greater seriousness dont you see what a very good thing that was to begin ones day with why even in santa croce with the thermometer ten degrees below zero in the shade of alfieris monument i was no gayer than i should have been in a church at home i suppose mrs bowen would object to having that procession go by under ones window in a book but i cant really see how it would hurt the reader or damp his spirits permanently a wholesome reaction would ensue such as you see now in me whom the thing happened to in real life  he stirred his tea and shook with an inward laugh as he carried it to his lips  yes said miss graham thoughtfully and she looked at him searchingly in the interval of silence that ensued but she only added i wish it would get warmer in the churches ive seen hardly anything of them yet  from the way i felt in them today sighed colville i should think the churches would begin to thaw out about the middle of may but if one goes well wrapped up in furs and has a friend along to rouse him and keep him walking when he is about to fall into that lethargy which precedes death by freezing i think they may be visited even now with safety have you been in santa maria novella yet  no said miss graham with a shake of the head that expressed her resolution to speak the whole truth if she died for it not even in santa maria novella  what a wonderful old place it is that curious façade with the dials and its layers of black and white marble soaked goldenred in a hundred thousand sunsets that exquisite grand portal he gesticulated with the hand that the teacup left free to suggest form and measurement as artists do then the inside the great cimabue with all that famous history on its backthe first divine madonna by the first divine master carried through the streets in a triumph of art and religion those frescoes of ghirlandajos with real florentine faces and figures in them and all lavished upon the eternal twilight of that choirbut i suppose that if the full day were let in on them once they would vanish like ghosts at cockcrow you must be sure to see the spanish chapel and the old cloister itself is such a pathetic place theres a boys school as well as a military college in the suppressed convent now and the colonnades were full of boys running and screaming and laughing and making a joyful racket it was so much more sorrowful than silence would have been there one of the little scamps came up to me and the young monk that was showing me round and bobbed us a mocking bow and bobbed his hat off then they all burst out laughing again and raced away and the monk looked after them and said so sweetly and wearily theyre at their diversions we must have patience there are only twelve monks left there all the rest are scattered and gone he gave his cup to miss graham for more tea  dont you think she asked drawing it from the samovar that it is very sad having the convents suppressed  it was very sad having slavery abolishedfor some people suggested colville he felt the unfairness of the point he had made  yes sighed miss graham  colville stood stirring his second cup of tea when the portière parted and showed mrs bowen wistfully pausing on the threshold her face was pale but she looked extremely pretty there  ah come in mrs bowen he called gaily to her i wont give you away to the other people a cup of tea will do you good  oh im a great deal better said mrs bowen coming forward to give him her hand i heard your voice and i couldnt resist looking in  that was very kind of you said colville gratefully and her eyes met his in a glance that flushed her face a deep red you find me herei dont know whyin my character of old family friend doing my best to make life a burden to the young ladies  i wish you would stay to a family dinner with us said mrs bowen and miss graham brightened in cordial support of the hospitality why cant you  i dont know unless its because im a humane person and have some consideration for your headache  oh thats all gone said mrs bowen it was one of those convenient headachesif you ever had them youd knowthat go off at sunset  but youd have another tomorrow  no im safe for a whole fortnight from another  then you leave me without an excuse and i was just wishing i had none said colville  after dinner mrs bowen sent effie to bed early to make up for the late hours of the night before but she sat before the fire with miss graham rather late talking colville over when he was gone  hes very puzzling to me said miss graham sometimes you think hes nothing but an old cynic from his talk and then something so sweet and fresh comes out that you dont know what to do dont you think he has really a very poetical mind and that hes putting all the rest on  i think he likes to make little effects said mrs bowen judiciously he always did rather  why was he like this when he was young  i dont consider him very old now  no of course not i meant when you knew him before miss graham had some needlework in her hand mrs bowen who never even pretended to work at that kind of thing had nothing in hers but the feather screen  he is old compared with you imogene but youll find as you live along that your contemporaries are always young mr colville is very much improved he used to be painfully shy but he put on a bold front and now the bold front seems to have become a second nature with him  i like it said miss graham to her needle  yes but i suspect hes still shy at heart he used to be very sentimental and was always talking ruskin i think if he hadnt talked ruskin so much jenny milbury might have treated him better it was very priggish in him  oh i cant imagine mr colvilles being priggish  hes very much improved he used to be quite a sloven in his dress you know how very slovenly most american gentlemen are in their dress at any rate i think that influenced her against him too  he isnt slovenly now suggested miss graham  oh no hes quite swell said mrs bowen depriving the adjective of slanginess by the refinement of her tone  well said miss graham i dont see how you could have endured her after that it was atrocious  it was better for her to break with him if she found out she didnt love him than to marry him that said mrs bowen with a depth of feeling uncommon for her would have been a thousand times worse  yes but she ought to have found out before she led him on so far  sometimes girls cant they dont know themselves they think theyre in love when theyre not she was very impulsive and of course she was flattered by it he was so intellectual but at last she found that she couldnt bear it and she had to tell him so  did she ever say why she didnt love him  no i dont suppose she could the only thing i remember her saying was that he was too much of a mixture  what did she mean by that  i dont know exactly  do you think hes insincere  oh no perhaps she meant that he wasnt singleminded  fickle  no he certainly wasnt that in her case  undecided  he was decided enough with herat last  imogene dropped the hopeless quest how can a man ever stand such a thing she sighed  he stood it very nobly that was the best thing about it he took it in the most delicate way she showed me his letter there wasnt a word or a hint of reproach in it he seemed to be anxious about nothing but her feeling badly for him of course he couldnt help showing that he was mortified for having pursued her with attentions that were disagreeable to her but that was delicate too yes it was a very largeminded letter  it was shocking in her to show it  it wasnt very nice but it was a letter that any girl might have been proud to show  oh she couldnt have done it to gratify her vanity  girls are very queer my dear said mrs bowen as if the fact were an abstraction she mused upon the flat of her screen while miss graham plied her needle in silence  the latter spoke first do you think he was very much broken by it  you never can tell he went out west then and there he has stayed ever since i suppose his life would have been very different if nothing of the kind had happened he had a great deal of talent i always thought i should hear of him in some way  well it was a heartless shameless thing i dont see how you can speak of it so leniently as you do mrs bowen it makes all sorts of coquetry and flirtation more detestable to me than ever why it has ruined his life  oh he was young enough then to outlive it after all they were a boy and girl  a boy and girl how old were they  he must have been twentythree or four and she was twenty  my age do you call that being a girl  she was old enough to know what she was about said mrs bowen justly  imogene fell back in her chair drawing out her needle the full length of its thread and then letting her hand fall i dont know it seems as if i never should be grown up or anything but a child yes when i think of the way young men talk they do seem boys why cant they talk like mr colville i wish i could talk like him it makes you forget how old and plain he is  she remained with her eyelids dropped in an absent survey of her sewing while mrs bowen regarded her with a look of vexation impatience resentment on the last refinement of these emotions which she banished from her face before miss graham looked up and said with a smile how funny it is to see effies infatuation with him she cant take her eyes off him for a moment and she follows him round the room so as not to lose a word he is saying it was heroic of her to go to bed without a murmur before he left tonight  yes she sees that he is good said mrs bowen  oh she sees that hes something very much more mr waters is good  miss graham had the best of the argument and so mrs bowen did not reply  i feel continued the young girl as if it were almost a shame to have asked him to go to that silly dancing party with us it seems as if we didnt appreciate him i think we ought to have kept him for high aesthetic occasions and historical researches  oh i dont think mr colville was very deeply offended at being asked to go with us  no said imogene with another sigh he didnt seem so i suppose theres always an undercurrent of sadnessof tragedyin everything for him  i dont suppose anything of the kind cried mrs bowen gaily hes had time enough to get over it  do people ever get over such things  yesmen  it must be because he was young as you say but if it had happened now  oh it couldnt happen now hes altogether too cool and calculating  do you think hes cool and calculating  no hes too old for a broken hearta new one  mrs bowen demanded the girl solemnly could you forgive yourself for such a thing if you had done it  yes perfectly well if i wasnt in love with him  but if youd made him think you were pursued the girl breathlessly  if i were a flirtyes  i couldnt said imogene with tragic depth  oh be done with your intensities and go to bed imogene said mrs bowen giving her a playful push       vi   it was so long since colville had been at a dancing party that mrs bowens offer to take him to madame uccellis had first struck his sense of the ludicrous then it had begun to flatter him it implied that he was still young enough to dance if he would though he had stipulated that they were not to expect anything of the kind from him he liked also the notion of being seen and accepted in florentine society as the old friend of mrs bowens for he had not been long in discovering that her position in florence was among the foreign residents rather authoritative she was one of the very few americans who were asked to italian houses and italian houses lying even beyond the neutral ground of englishspeaking intermarriages she was not of course asked to the great princess strozzi ball where the florentine nobility appeared in the mediaeval pompthe veritable costumesof their ancestors only a rich american banking family went and their distinction was spoken of under the breath but any glory short of this was within mrs bowens reach so an old lady who possessed herself of colville the night before had told him celebrating mrs bowen at length and boasting of her acceptance among the best english residents who next after the natives seem to constitute the social ambition of americans living in italian cities  it interested him to find that some geographical distinctions which are fading at home had quite disappeared in florence when he was there before people from quite small towns in the east had made pretty lina ridgely and her friend feel the disadvantage of having come from the western side of an imaginary line he had himself been at the pains always to let people know at the american wateringplaces where he spent his vacations that though presently from des vaches indiana he was really born in rhode island but in florence it was not at all necessary he found in mrs bowens house people from denver chicago st louis boston new york and baltimore all meeting as of apparently the same civilisation and whether mrs bowens own origin was like that of the etruscan cities lost in the mists of antiquity or whether she had sufficiently atoned for the error of her birth by subsequent residence in the national capital and prolonged sojourn in new york it seemed certainly not to be remembered against her among her eastern acquaintance the time had been when the fact that miss graham came from buffalo would have gone far to class her with the animal from which her native city had taken its name but now it made no difference unless it was a difference in her favour the english spoke with the same vague respect of buffalo and of philadelphia and to a family of real bostonians colville had the courage to say simply that he lived in des vaches and not to seek to palliate the truth in any sort if he wished to prevaricate at all it was rather to attribute himself to mrs bowens city in ohio  she and miss graham called for him with her carriage the next night when it was time to go to madame uccellis  this gives me a very patronised and effeminate feeling said colville getting into the odorous dark of the carriage and settling himself upon the front seat with a skill inspired by his anxiety not to tear any of the silken spreading white wraps that inundated the whole interior being come for by ladies they both gave some nervous joyful laughs as they found his hand in the obscurity and left the sense of a gloved pressure upon it is this the way you used to do in vesprucius mrs bowen  oh no indeed she answered the young gentlemen used to find out whether i was going and came for me with a hack and generally if the weather was good we walked home  thats the way we still do in des vaches sometimes as a tremendous joke the ladies come for us in leapyear how do you go to balls in buffalo miss graham or no i withdraw the embarrassing question some gleams from the street lamps as they drove along struck in through the carriage windows and flitted over the ladies faces and were gone again ah this is very trying couldnt you stop him at the next corner and let me see how radiant you ladies really are i may be in very great danger id like to know just how much  it wouldnt be of any use cried the young girl gaily were all wrapped up and you couldnt form any idea of us you must wait and let us burst upon you when we come out of the dressingroom at madame uccellis  but then it may be too late he urged is it very far  yes said mrs bowen its ridiculously far its outside the roman gate i dont see why people live at that distance  in order to give the friends you bring the more pleasure of your company mrs bowen  ah thats very well but youre not logical  no said colville you cant be logical and complimentary at the same time its too much to ask how delicious your flowers are the ladies each had a bouquet in her hand which she was holding in addition to her fan the edges of her cloak and the skirt of her train  yes said mrs bowen we are so much obliged to you for them  why i sent you no flowers said colville startled into untimely earnest  didnt you triumphed mrs bowen i thought gentlemen always sent flowers to ladies when they were going to a ball with them they used to in columbus  and in buffalo they always do miss graham added  ah they dont in des vaches said colville they tried to mystify him further about the bouquets they succeeded in being very gay and in making themselves laugh a great deal mrs bowen was even livelier than the young girl  her carriage was one of the few private equipages that drove up to madame uccellis door most people had not even come in a remise but after the simple florentine fashion had taken the little cabs which stretched in a long line up and down the way the horses had let their weary heads drop and were easing their broken knees by extending their forelegs while they drowsed the drivers huddled in their greatcoats had assembled around the doorway to see the guests alight with that amiable unenvious interest of the italians in the pleasure of others the deep sky glittered with stars in the corner of the next villa garden the black plumes of some cypresses blotted out their space among them  isnt it florentine demanded mrs bowen giving the hand which colville offered in helping her out of the carriage a little vivid pressure full of reminiscence and confident sympathy a flush of youth warmed his heart he did not quail even when the porter of the villa intervened between her and her coachman whom she was telling when to come back and said that the carriages were ordered for three oclock  did you ever sit up so late as that in des vaches asked miss graham mischievously  oh yes i was editor of a morning paper he explained but he did not like the imputation of her question  madame uccelli accepted him most hospitably among her guests when he was presented she was an american who had returned with her italian husband to italy and had long survived him in the villa which he had built with her money such people grow very queer with the lapse of time madame uccellis character remained inalienably american but her manners and customs had become largely italian without having learned the language thoroughly she spoke it very fluently and its idioms marked her philadelphia english her house was a menagerie of all the nationalities she was liked in italian society and there were many italians englishspeaking russians abounded there were many genuine english germans scandinavians protestant irish american catholics and then americans of all kinds there was a superstition of her exclusiveness among her compatriots but one really met every one there sooner or later she was supposed to be a convert to the religion of her late husband but no one really knew what religion she was of probably not even madame uccelli herself one thing you were sure of at her house and that was a substantial supper it is the example of such resident foreigners which has corrupted the florentines though many native families still hold out against it  the dancing was just beginning and the daughter of madame uccelli who spoke both english and italian much better than her mother came forward and possessed herself of miss graham after a polite feint of pressing mrs bowen to let her find a partner for her  mrs bowen cooed a gracious refusal telling fanny uccelli that she knew very well that she never danced now the girl had not much time for colville she welcomed him but she was full of her business of starting the dance and she hurried away without asking him whether she should introduce him to some lady for the quadrille that was forming her mother however asked him if he would not go out and get himself some tea and she found a lady to go with him to the supperroom this lady had daughters whom apparently she wished to supervise while they were dancing and she brought colville back very soon he had to stand by the sofa where she sat till madame uccelli found him and introduced him to another mother of daughters later he joined a group formed by the father of one of the dancers and the nondancing husband of a dancing wife their conversation was perfunctory they showed one another that they had no pleasure in it  presently the father went to see how his daughter looked while dancing the husband had evidently no such curiosity concerning his wife and colville went with the father and looked at miss graham she was very beautiful and she obeyed the music as if it were her breath her face was rapt intense full of an unsmiling delight which shone in her dark eyes glowing like low stars her abandon interested colville and then awed him the spectacle of that young unjaded capacity for pleasure touched him with a profound sense of loss suddenly imogene caught sight of him and with the coming of a second look in her eyes the light of an exquisite smile flashed over her face his heart was in his throat  your daughter asked the fond parent at his elbow that is mine yonder in red  colville did not answer nor look at the young lady in red the dance was ceasing the fragments of those kaleidoscopic radiations were dispersing themselves the tormented piano was silent  the officer whom imogene had danced with brought her to mrs bowen and resigned her with the regulation bow hanging his head down before him as if submitting his neck to the axe she put her hand in colvilles arm where he stood beside mrs bowen oh do take me to get something to eat  in the supperroom she devoured salad and ices with a childish joy in them the place was jammed and she laughed from her corner at colvilles struggles in getting the things for her and bringing them to her while she was still in the midst of an ice the faint note of the piano sounded oh theyre beginning again its the lancers she said giving him the plate back she took his arm again she almost pulled him along on their return  why dont you dance she demanded mockingly  i would if youd let me dance with you  oh thats impossible im engaged ever so many deep she dropped his arm instantly at sight of a young englishman who seemed to be looking for her this young englishman had a zeal for dancing that was unsparing partners were nothing to him except as a means of dancing his manner expressed a supreme contempt for people who made the slightest mistake who danced with less science or less conscience than himself ive been looking for you he said in a tone of cold rebuke without looking at her weve been waiting  colville wished to beat him but imogene took his rebuke meekly and murmured some apologies about not hearing the piano before he hurried her off without recognising colvilles existence in any way  the undancing husband of the dancing wife was boring himself in a corner colville decided that the chances with him were better than with the fond father and joined him just as a polite officer came up and entreated him to complete a set oh i never danced in my life he replied and then he referred the officer to colville dont you dance  i used to dance colville began while the officer stood looking patiently at him this was true he used to dance the lancers too and very badly seventeen years before he had danced it with lina ridgely and the other one mrs milbury his glance wandered to the vacant place on the floor it was the same set which miss graham was in she smiled and beckoned derisively a vain and foolish ambition fired him oh yes i can dance a little he said  a little was quite enough for the eager officer he had colville a partner in an instant and the next he was on the floor  oh what fun cried miss graham but the fun had not really begun yet  colville had forgotten everything about the lancers he walked round like a bear in a pen he capered to and fro with a futile absurdity people poked him hither and thither his progress was attended by rending noises from the trains over which he found his path he smiled and cringed and apologised to the hardening faces of the dancers even miss grahams face had become very grave  this wont do said the englishman at last with cold insolence he did not address himself to any one he merely stopped they all stopped and colville was effectively expelled the set another partner was found for his lady and he wandered giddily away he did not know where to turn the whole room must have seen what an incredible ass he had made of himself but mrs bowen looked as if she had not seen  he went up to her resolved to make fun of himself at the first sign she gave of being privy to his disgrace but she only said have you found your way to the supperroom yet  oh yes twice he answered and kept on talking with her and madame uccelli after five minutes or so something occurred to colville have you found the way to the supperroom yet mrs bowen  no she owned with a small pathetic laugh which expressed a certain physical faintness and reproached him with insupportable gentleness for his selfish obtuseness  let me show you the way he cried  why i am rather hungry said mrs bowen taking his arm with a patient arrangement first of her fan her bouquet and her train and then moving along by his side with a delicate footed pace which insinuated and deprecated her dependence upon him  there were only a few people in the supperroom and they had it practically to themselves she took a cup of tea and a slice of buttered bread with a little salad which she excused herself from eating because it was the day after her headache i shouldnt have thought you were hungry mrs bowen he said if you hadnt told me so and he recalled that as a young girl her friend used to laugh at her for having such a butterfly appetite she was in fact one of those women who go through life the marvels of such of our brutal sex as observe the ethereal nature of their diet but in an illogical revulsion of feeling colville who was again cramming himself with all the solids and fluids in reach and storing up a vain regret against the morrow preferred her delicacy to the magnificent rapacity of miss graham imogene had passed from salad to ice and at his suggestion had frankly reverted to salad again and then taken a second ice with the robust appetite of perfect health and perfect youth he felt a desire to speak against her to mrs bowen he did not know why and he did not know how he veiled his feeling in an open attack miss graham has just been the cause of my playing the fool with her dancing she dances so superbly that she makes you want to dance tooshe made me feel as if i could dance  yes said mrs bowen it was very kind of you to complete the set i saw you dancing she added without a glimmer of guilty consciousness in her eyes  it was very sweet but colville had to protest oh no you didnt see me dancing you saw me not dancing i am a ruined man and i leave florence tomorrow but i have the sad satisfaction of reflecting that i dont leave an unbroken train among the ladies of that set and i have made one young englishman so mad that there is a reasonable hope of his not recovering  oh no you dont think of going away for that said mrs bowen not heeding the rest of his joking  well the time has been when i have left florence for loss said colville with the air of preparing himself to listen to reason  you mustnt said mrs bowen briefly  oh very well then i wont said colville whimsically as if that settled it  mrs bowen would not talk of the matter any more he could see that with her kindness which was always more than her tact she was striving to get away from the subject as he really cared for it no longer this made him persist in clinging to it he liked this pretty womans being kind to him well he said finally i consent to stay in florence on condition that you suggest some means of atonement for me which i can also make a punishment to miss graham  mrs bowen did not respond to the question of placating and punishing her protégée with sustained interest they went back to madame uccelli and to the other elderly ladies in the room that opened by archways upon the dancingroom  imogene was on the floor dancing not merely with unabated joy but with a zest that seemed only to freshen from dance to dance if she left the dance it was to go out on her partners arm to the supperroom colville could not decently keep on talking to mrs bowen the whole evening it would be too conspicuous he devolved from frump to frump he bored himself he yawned in his passage from one of these mothers or fathers to another the hours passed it was two oclock imogene was going out to the supperroom again he was taking out his watch she saw him and oh dont she cried laughing as she passed  the dancing went on she was waltzing now in the interminable german some one had let down a window in the dancingroom and he was feeling it in his shoulder mrs bowen across the room looked heroically patient but weary he glanced down at the frump on the sofa near and realised that she had been making a long speech to him which he could see from her look had ended in some sort of question  three oclock came and they had to wait till the german was over he felt that miss graham was behaving badly ungratefully selfishly on the way home in the carriage he was silent from utter boredom and fatigue but mrs bowen was sweetly sympathetic with the girls rapture imogene did not seem to feel his moodiness she laughed she joked she told a number of things that happened she hummed the air of the last waltz isnt it divine she asked oh i feel as if i could dance for a week she was still dancing she gave colvilles foot an accidental tap in keeping time on the floor of the carriage to the tune she was humming no one said anything about a next meeting when they parted at the gate of palazzo pinti and mrs bowen bade her coachman drive colville to his hotel but both the ladies voices called goodnight to him as he drove away he fancied a shade of mocking in miss grahams voice  the great outer door of the hotel was locked of course and the poor little porter kept colville thumping at it some time before he unlocked it full of sleepy smiles and apologies im sorry to wake you up said colville kindly  it is my duty said the porter with amiable heroism he discharged another duty by lighting a whole new candle which would be set down to colvilles account and went before him to his room up the wide stairs cold in their white linen path and on through the crooked corridors haunted by the ghosts of extinct tables dhôte and full of goblin shadows he had recovered a noonday suavity by the time he reached colvilles door and bowed himself out after lighting the candles within with a sweet plenitude of politeness which colville even in his gloomy mood could not help admiring in a man in his shirt sleeves with only one suspender up  if there had been a fire colville would have liked to sit down before it and take an account of his feelings but the atmosphere of a bedchamber in a florentine hotel at halfpast three oclock on a winter morning is not one that invites to meditation and he made haste to get into bed with nothing clearer in his mind than a shapeless sense of having been trifled with he ought not to have gone to a dancing party to begin with and then he certainly ought not to have attempted to dance so far he might have been master of the situation and was responsible for it but he was over and above this aware of not having wished to do either of having been wrought upon against his convictions to do both he regarded now with supreme loathing a fantastic purpose which he had formed while tramping round on those womens dresses of privately taking lessons in dancing and astonishing miss graham at the next ball where they met miss graham what did he care for that child or mrs bowen either for the matter of that had he come four thousand miles to be used to be played with by them at this point colville was aware of the brutal injustice of his mood they were ladies both of them charming and good and he had been a fool that was all it was not the first time he had been a fool for women an inexpressible bitterness for that old wrong which however he had been used to laugh at it and despise it had made his life solitary and barren poured upon his soul it was as if it had happened to him yesterday  a band of young men burst from one of the narrow streets leading into the piazza and straggled across it letting their voices flare out upon the silence and then drop extinct one by one a whole world of faded associations flushed again in colvilles heart this was italy this was florence and he execrated the hour in which he had dreamed of returning       vii   the next mornings sunshine dispersed the black mood of the night before but enough of colvilles selfdisgust remained to determine him not to let his return to florence be altogether vain or his sojourn so idle as it had begun being the vague purpose which he had cherished of studying the past life and character of the florentines in their architecture shaped itself anew in the halfhour which he gave himself over his coffee and he turned it over in his mind with that mounting joy in its capabilities which attends the contemplation of any sort of artistic endeavour no people had ever more distinctly left the impress of their whole temper in their architecture or more sharply distinguished their varying moods from period to period in their palaces and temples he believed that he could not only supply that brief historical sketch of florence which mrs bowen had lamented the want of but he could make her history speak an unintelligible an unmistakeable tongue in every monument of the past from the etruscan wall at fiesole to the cheap plain and tasteless shaft raised to commemorate italian unity in the next piazza with sketches from his own pencil illustrative of points which he could not otherwise enforce he could make such a book on florence as did not exist such a book as no one had yet thought of making with this object in his mind making and keeping him young he could laugh with any one who liked at the vanity of the middleaged hoosier who had spoiled a set in the lancers at madame uccellis party he laughed at him now alone with a wholly impersonal sense of his absurdity  after breakfast he went without delay to viesseuxs readingroom to examine his catalogue and see what there was in it to his purpose while he was waiting his turn to pay his subscription with the people who surrounded the proprietor half a dozen of the acquaintances he had made at mrs bowens passed in and out viesseuxs is a place where sooner or later you meet every one you know among the foreign residents at florence the natives in smaller proportion resort there too and colville heard a lady asking for a book in that perfect italian which strikes envy to the heart of the stranger sufficiently versed in the language to know that he never shall master it he rather rejoiced in his despair however as an earnest of his renewed intellectual life henceforth his life would be wholly intellectual he did not regret his little excursion into society it had shown him with dramatic sharpness how unfit for it he was  good morning said some one in a bland undertone full of a pleasant recognition of the claims to quiet of a place where some others were speaking in their ordinary tones  colville looked round on the rev mr waters and took his friendly hand good morningglad to see you he answered  are you looking for that short florentine history for mrs bowens little girl asked mr waters inclining his head slightly for the reply she mentioned it to me  by day colville remarked more distinctly that the old gentleman was short and slight with a youthful eagerness in his face surviving on good terms with the grey locks that fell down his temples from under the brim of his soft felt hat with the boyish sweetness of his looks blended a sort of appreciative shrewdness which pointed his smiling lips slightly aslant in what seemed the expectation rather than the intention of humour  not exactly said colville experiencing a difficulty in withholding the fact that in some sort he was just going to write a short florentine history and finding a certain pleasure in mrs bowens having remembered that he had taken an interest in effies reading he had a sudden wish to tell mr waters of his plan but this was hardly the time or place  they now found themselves face to face with the librarian and mr waters made a gesture of waiving himself in colvilles favour  no no said the latter you had better ask i am going to put this gentleman through rather an extended course of sprouts  the librarian smiled with the helplessness of a foreigner who knows his interlocutors english but not the meaning of it  oh i merely wanted to ask said mr waters addressing the librarian and explaining to colville whether you had received that book on savonarola yet the german one  i shall see said the librarian and he went upon a quest that kept him some minutes  youre not thinking of taking savonarolas life i suppose suggested colville  oh no villaris book has covered the whole ground for ever it seems to me its a wonderful book youve read it  yes its a thing that makes you feel that after all the italians have only to make a real effort in any direction and they go ahead of everybody else what biography of the last twenty years can compare with it  youre right siryoure right cried the old man enthusiastically theyre a gifted race a people of genius  i wish for their own sakes theyd give their minds a little to generalship said colville pressed by the facts to hedge somewhat they did get so badly smashed in their last war poor fellows  oh i dont think i should like them any better if they were better soldiers perhaps the lesson of noble endurance that theyve given our times is all that we have the right to demand of them in the way of heroism no one can say they lack courage and sometimes it seems to me that in simply outgrowing the different sorts of despotism that had fastened upon them till their broken bonds fell away without positive effort on their part they showed a greater sublimity than if they had violently conquered their freedom most nations sink lower and lower under tyranny the italians grew steadily more and more civilised more noble more gentle more grand it was a wonderful spectaclelike a human soul perfected through suffering and privation every period of their history is full of instruction i find my ancestral puritanism particularly appealed to by the puritanism of savonarola  then villari hasnt satisfied you that savonarola wasnt a protestant  oh yes he has i said his puritanism just now im interested in justifying his failure to myself for its one of the things in history that ive found it hardest to accept but no doubt his puritanic state fell because it was dreary and ugly as the puritanic state always has been it makes its own virtues intolerable puritanism wont let you see how good and beautiful the puritans often are it was inevitable that savonarolas enemies should misunderstand and hate him  you are one of the last men i should have expected to find among the arrabiati said colville  oh theres a great deal to be said for the florentine arrabiati as well as for the english malignants though the puritans in neither case would have known how to say it savonarola perished because he was excessive i am studying him in this aspect it is fresh ground it is very interesting to inquire just at what point a mans virtues become mischievous and intolerable  these ideas interested colville he turned to them with relief from the sense of his recent trivialities in this old mans earnestness he found support and encouragement in the new course he had marked out for himself sometimes it had occurred to him not only that he was too old for the interests of his youth at forty but that there was no longer time for him to take up new ones he considered mr waterss grey hairs and determined to be wiser i should like to talk these things over with youand some other things he said  the librarian came toward them with the book for mr waters who was fumbling nearsightedly in his pocketbook for his card i shall be very happy to see you at my room he said ah thank you he added taking his book with a simple relish as if it were something whose pleasantness was sensible to the touch he gave colville the scholars faroff look as he turned to go he was already as remote as the fifteenth century through the magic of the book which he opened and began to read at once colville stared after him he did not wish to come to just that yet either life active life life of his own day called to him he had been one of its busiest children could he turn his back upon it for any charm or use that was in the past again that unnerving doubt that paralysing distrust beset him and tempted him to curse the day in which he had returned to this outworn old world idler on its modern surface or delver in its deephearted past could he reconcile himself to it what did he care for the italians of today or the history of the florentines as expressed in their architectural monuments it was the problems of the vast tumultuous american life which he had turned his back on that really concerned him later he might take up the study that fascinated yonder old man but for the present it was intolerable  he was no longer young that was true but with an ache of old regret he felt that he had not yet lived his life that his was a baffled destiny an arrested fate a lady came up and took his turn with the librarian and colville did not stay for another he went out and walked down the lung arno toward the cascine the sun danced on the river and bathed the long line of pale buff and grey houses that followed its curve and ceased in the mist of leafless treetops where the cascine began it was not the hour of the promenade and there was little driving but the sidewalks were peopled thickly enough with persons in groups or singly who had the air of straying aimlessly up or down with no purpose but to be in the sun after the rainy weather of the past week there were faces of invalids wistful and thin and here and there a man muffled to the chin lounged feebly on the parapet and stared at the river colville hastened by them they seemed to claim him as one of their ailing and aging company and just then he was in the humour of being very young and strong  a carriage passed before him through the cascine gates and drove down the road next the river he followed and when it had got a little way it stopped at the roadside and a lady and little girl alighted who looked about and caught sight of him and then obviously waited for him to come up with them it was imogene and effie bowen and the young girl called to him we thought it was you arent you astonished to find us here at this hour she demanded as soon as he came up and gave him her hand mrs bowen sent us for our healthor effies healthand i was just making the man stop and let us out for a little walk  my health is very much broken too miss effie said colville will you let me walk with you the child smiled as she did at colvilles speeches which she apparently considered all jokes but diplomatically referred the decision to imogene with an upward glance  we shall be very glad indeed said the girl  thats very polite of you but miss effie makes no effort to conceal her dismay said colville  the little girl smiled again and her smile was so like the smile of lina ridgely twenty years ago that his next words were inevitably tinged with reminiscence  does one still come for ones health to the cascine when i was in florence before there was no other place if one went to look for it with young ladiesthe cascine or the boboli gardens do they keep the fountain of youth turned on here during the winter still  ive never seen it said imogene gaily  of course not you never looked for it neither did i when i was here before but it wouldnt escape me now  since he had met them he had aged again in spite of his resolutions to the contrary somehow beside their buoyancy and bloom the youth in his heart faded  imogene had started forward as soon as he joined them and colville with effies gloved hand stolen shyly in his was finding it quite enough to keep up with her in her elastic advance  she wore a long habit of silk whose furtrimmed edge wandered diagonally across her breast and down to the edge of her walking dress to colville whom her girlish slimness in her ball costume had puzzled after his original impressions of junonian abundance she did not so much dwindle as seem to vanish from the proportions his visions had assigned her that first night when he saw her standing before the mirror in this outdoor avatar this companionship with the sun and breeze she was new to him again and he found himself searching his consciousness for his lost acquaintance with her and feeling as if he knew her less and less perhaps indeed she had no very distinctive individuality perhaps at her age no woman has but waits for it to come to her through life through experience she was an expression of youth of health of beauty and of the moral loveliness that comes from a fortunate combination of these but beyond this she was elusive in a way that seemed to characterise her even materially he could not make anything more of the mystery as he walked at her side and he went thinkingformlessly as people always thinkthat with the child or with her mother he would have had a community of interest and feeling which he lacked with this splendid girlhood he was both too young and too old for it and then while he answered this or that to imogenes talk aptly enough his mind went back to the time when this mystery was no mystery or when he was contemporary with it and if he did not understand it at least accepted it as if it wore the most natural thing in the world it seemed a longer time now since it had been in his world than it was since he was a child  should you have thought she asked turning her face back toward him that it would be so hot in the sun today oh that beautiful river how it twists and writhes along do you remember that sonnet of longfellowsthe one he wrote in italian about the ponte vecchio and the arno twisting like a dragon underneath it they say that hawthorne used to live in a villa just behind the hill over there were going to look it up as soon as the weather is settled dont you think his books are perfectly fascinating  yes said colville only i should want a good while to say it  i shouldnt retorted the girl when youve said fascinating youve said everything theres no other word for them dont you like to talk about the books youve read  i would if i could remember the names of the characters but i get them mixed up  oh i never do i remember the least one of them and all they do and say  i used to  it seems to me you used to do everything  it seems to me as if i did    i remember when i think    that my youth was half divine   oh tennysonyes hes fascinating dont you think hes fascinating  very said colville he was wondering whether this were the kind of talk that he thought was literary when he was a young fellow  how perfectly weird the vision of sin is imogene continued dont you like weird things  weird things colville reflected yes but i dont see very much in them any more the fact is they dont seem to come to anything in particular  oh i think they do ive had dreams that ive lived on for days do you ever have prophetic dreams  yes but they never come true when they do i know that i didnt have them  what do you mean  i mean that we are all so fond of the marvellous that we cant trust ourselves about any experience that seems supernatural if a ghost appeared to me i should want him to prove it by at least two other reliable disinterested witnesses before i believed my own account of the matter  oh cried the girl half puzzled half amused then of course you dont believe in ghosts  yes i expect to be one myself some day but im in no hurry to mingle with them  imogene smiled vaguely as if the talk pleased her even when it mocked the fancies and whims which after so many generations that have indulged them she was finding so fresh and new in her turn  dont you like to walk by the side of a river she asked increasing her eager pace a little i feel as if it were bearing me along  i feel as if i were carrying it said colville its as fatiguing as walking on railroad ties  oh thats too bad cried the girl how can you be so prosaic should you ever have believed that the sun could be so hot in january and look at those ridiculous green hillsides over the river there dont you like it to be winter when it is winter  she did not seem to have expected anything from colville but an impulsive acquiescence but she listened while he defended the mild weather i think its very well for italy he said it has always seemed to methat is it seems to me now for the first time but one has to begin the other wayas if the seasons here had worn themselves out like the turbulent passions of the people i dare say the winter was much fiercer in the times of the bianchi and neri  oh how delightful do you really believe that  no i dont know that i do but i shouldnt have much difficulty in proving it i think to the sympathetic understanding  i wish you would prove it to mine it sounds so pretty im sure it must be true  oh then it isnt necessary ill reserve my arguments for mrs bowen  you had better she isnt at all romantic she says its very well for me she isntthat her being matteroffact lets me be as romantic as i like  then mrs bowen isnt as romantic as she would like to be if she hadnt charge of a romantic young lady  oh i dont say that dear me id no idea it could be so hot in january as they strolled along beside the long hedge of laurel the carriage slowly following them at a little distance the sun beat strong upon the white road blotched here and there with the black irregular shadows of the ilexes the girl undid the pelisse across her breast with a fine impetuosity and let it swing open as she walked she stopped suddenly hark what bird was that  it was the nightingale and not the lark suggested colville lazily  oh dont you think romeo and juliet is divine demanded imogene promptly dropping the question of the bird  i dont know about romeo returned colville but its sometimes occurred to me that juliet was rather forthputting  you know she wasnt its my favourite play i could go every night its perfectly amazing to me that they can play anything else  you would like it five hundred nights in the year like hazel kirke that would be a good deal of romeo not to say juliet  they ought to do it out of respect to shakespeare dont you like shakespeare  well ive seen the time when i preferred alexander smith said colville evasively  alexander smith who in the world is alexander smith  how recent you are alexander smith was an immortal who flourished about the year 1850  that was before i was born how could i remember him but i dont feel so very recent for all that  neither do i this morning said colville i was up at one of pharaohs balls last night and i danced too much  he gave imogene a droll glance and then bent it upon effies discreet face the child dropped her eyes with a blush like her mothers having first sought provisional counsel of imogene who turned away he rightly inferred that they all had been talking him over at breakfast and he broke into a laugh which they joined in but imogene said nothing in recognition of the fact  with what he felt to be haste for his relief she said dont you hate to be told to read a book  i used toquarter of a century ago said colville recognising that this was the way young people talked even then  used to she repeated dont you now  no im a great deal more tractable now i always say that i shall get the book out of the library i draw the line at buying i still hate to buy a book that people recommend  what kind of books do you like to buy  oh no kind i think we ought to get all our books out of the library  do you never like to talk in earnest  well not often said colville because if you do you cant say with a good conscience afterward that you were only in fun  oh and do you always like to talk so that you can get out of things afterward  no i didnt say that did i  very nearly i should think  then im glad i didnt quite  i like people to be outspokento say everything they think said the girl regarding him with a puzzled look  then i foresee that i shall become a favourite answered colville i say a great deal more than i think  she looked at him again with envy with admiration qualifying her perplexity they had come to a point where some mossgrown weatherbeaten statues stood at the corners of the road that traversed the bosky stretch between the avenues of the cascine ah how beautiful they are he said halting and giving himself to the rapture that a blackened garden statue imparts to one who beholds it from the vantageground of sufficient years and experience  do you remember that story of heines he resumed after a moment of the boy who steals out of the old castle by moonlight and kisses the lips of the garden statue fallen among the rank grass of the ruinous parterres and long afterward when he looks down on the sleep of the dying girl where she lies on the green sofa it seems to him that she and that statue are the same  oh deeply sighed the young girl no i never read it tell me what it is i must read it  the rest is all talkvery good talk but i doubt whether it would interest you he goes on to talk of a great many thingsof the way bellini spoke french for example he says it was bloodcurdling horrible cataclysmal he brought out the poor french words and broke them upon the wheel till you thought the whole world must give way with a thundercrash a dead hush reigned in the room the women did not know whether to faint or fly the men looked down at their pantaloons and tried to realise what they had on  oh how perfectly delightful how shameful cried the girl i must read it what is it in what is the name of the story  it isnt a story said colville did you ever see anything lovelier than these statues  no said imogene are they good  they are much better than goodthey are the very worst rococo  what makes you say they are beautiful then  why dont you see they commemorate youth gaiety brilliant joyous life thats what that kind of statues was made forto look on at rich young beautiful people and their gallantries to be danced before by fine ladies and gentlemen playing at shepherd and shepherdesses to be driven past by marcheses and contessinas flirting in carriages to be hung with scarfs and wreaths to be parts of eternal fétes champêtres dont you see how bored they look when i first came to italy i should have detested and ridiculed their bad art but now theyre exquisitethe worse the better  i dont know what in the world you do mean said imogene laughing uneasily  mrs bowen would its a pity mrs bowen isnt here with us miss effie if i lift you up to one of those statues will you kindly ask it if it doesnt remember a young american signor who was here just before the french revolution i dont believe its forgotten me  no no said imogene its time we were walking back dont you like scott she added i should think you would if you like those romantic things i used to like scott so much when i was fifteen i wouldnt read anything but scott dont you like thackeray oh hes so cynical its perfectly delightful  cynical repeated colville thoughtfully i was looking into the newcomes the other day and i thought he was rather sentimental  sentimental why what an idea that is the strangest thing i ever heard of oh she broke in upon her own amazement dont you think brownings statue and the bust is splendid mr morton read it to usto mrs bowen i mean  colville resented this freedom of mr morions he did not know just why then his pique was lost in sarcastic recollection of the time when he too used to read poems to ladies he had read that poem to lina ridgely and the other one  mrs bowen asked him to read it imogene continued  did she asked colville pensively  and then we discussed it afterward we had a long discussion and then he read us the legend of pornic and we had a discussion about that mrs bowen says it was real gold they found in the coffin but i think it was the girls gold hair i dont know which mr morion thought which do you dont you think the legend of pornic is splendid  yes its a great poem and deep said colville they had come to a place where the bank sloped invitingly to the river miss effie he asked wouldnt you like to go down and throw stones into the arno thats what a river is for he added as the child glanced toward imogene for authorisation to have stones thrown into it  oh let us cried imogene rushing down to the brink i dont want to throw stones into it but to get near itto get near to any bit of nature they do pen you up so from it in europe she stood and watched colville skim stones over the current when you stand by the shore of a swift river like this or near a railroad train when it comes whirling by dont you ever have a morbid impulse to fling yourself forward  not at my time of life said colville stooping to select a flat stone morbid impulses are one of the luxuries of youth he threw the stone which skipped triumphantly far out into the stream that was beautiful wasnt it miss effie  lovely murmured the child  he offered her a flat pebble would you like to try one  it would spoil my gloves she said in deprecating refusal  let me try it cried imogene im not afraid of my gloves  colville yielded the pebble looking at her with the thought of how intoxicating he should once have found this bit of wilful abandon but feeling rather sorry for it now oh perhaps not he said laying his hand upon hers and looking into her eyes  she returned his look and then she dropped the pebble and put her hand back in her muff and turned and ran up the bank theres the carriage its time we should be going at the top of the bank she became a mirror of dignity a transparent mirror to his eye are you going back to town mr colville she asked with formal state we could set you down anywhere  thank you miss graham i shall be glad to avail myself of your very kind offer allow me he handed her ceremoniously to the carriage he handed effie bowen even more ceremoniously to the carriage holding his hat in one hand while he offered the other then he mounted to the seat in front of them the weather has changed he said  imogene hid her face in her muff and effie bowen bowed hers against imogenes shoulder  a sense of the girls beauty lingered in colvilles thought all day and recurred to him again and again and the ambitious intensity and enthusiasm of her talk came back in touches of amusement and compassion how divinely young it all was and how lovely he patronised it from a height far aloof  he was not in the frame of mind for the hotel table and he went to lunch at a restaurant he chose a simple trattoria the first he came to and he took his seat at one of the bare rude tables where the joint saucers for pepper and salt and a small glass for toothpicks with a muchscraped porcelain box for matches expressed an uncorrupted florentinity of custom but when he gave his order in offhand italian the waiter answered in the french which waiters get together for the travellers confusion in italy and he resigned himself to whatever chance of acquaintance might befall him the place had a companionable smell of stale tobacco and the dim light showed him on the walls of a space dropped a step or two lower at the end of the room a variety of sketches and caricatures a waiter was laying a large table in this space and when colville came up to examine the drawings he jostled him with due apologies in the haste of a man working against time for masters who will brook no delay he was hurrying still when a party of young men came in and took their places at the table and began to rough him for his delay colville could recognise several of them in the vigorous burlesques on the walls and as others dropped in the grotesque portraitures made him feel as if he had seen them before they all talked at once each man of his own interests except when they joined in a shout of mockery and welcome for some newcomer colville at his risotto almost the rooms length away could hear what they thought one and another of botticelli and michelangelo of old pilotys things at munich of the dishes they had served to them and of the quality of the chianti of the respective merits of german and italian tobacco of whether inglehart had probably got to venice yet of the personal habits of billings and of the question whether the want of modelling in simmonss nose had anything to do with his style of snoring of the overrated colouring of some of those venetian fellows of the delicacy of mino da fiesole and of the genius of babsons tailor babson was there to defend the cut of his trousers and billings and simmons were present to answer for themselves at the expense of the pictures of those who had called their habits and features into question when it came to this all the voices joined in jolly uproar derision and denial broke out of the tumult and presently they were all talking quietly of a reception which some of them were at the day before then colville heard one of them saying that he would like a chance to paint some lady whose name he did not catch and she looks awfully sarcastic one of the young fellows said  they say she is said another they say shes awfully intellectual  boston queried a third  no kalamazoo the centre of culture is out there now  she knows how to dress anyhow said the first commentator i wonder what parker would talk to her about when he was painting her hes never read anything but poes ullalume  well thats a good subjectullalume  i suppose shes read it  shes read most everything they say  whats an ullalume anyway parker  one of the group sprang up from the table and drew on the wall what he labelled an ullalume another rapidly depicted parker in the moment of sketching a young lady her portrait had got as far as the eyes and nose when some one protested oh hello no personalities  the draughtsman said well all right and sat down again  hall talked with her the most what did she say hall  hall cant remember words in three syllables but he says it was mighty brilliant and mighty deep  they say shes a niece of mrs bowens shes staying with mrs bowen  then it was the wisdom and brilliancy and severity of imogene graham that these young men stood in awe of colville remembered how the minds of girls of twenty had once dazzled him and yes he mused she must have believed that we were talking literature in the cascine certainly i should have thought it an intellectual time when i was at that age he owned to himself with forlorn irony  the young fellows went on to speak of mrs bowen whom it seemed they had known the winter before she had been very polite to them they praised her as if she were quite an old woman  but she must have been a very pretty girl one of them put in  well she has a good deal of style yet  oh yes but she never could have been a beauty like the other one  on her part imogene was very sober when she met mrs bowen though she had come in flushed and excited from the air and the mornings adventure mrs bowen was sitting by the fire placidly reading a vase of roses on the little table near her diffused the delicate odour of winter roses through the room all seemed very still and dim and of another time somehow  imogene kept away from the fire sitting down in the provisional fashion of women with her things on but she unbuttoned her pelisse and flung it open effie had gone to her room  did you have a pleasant drive asked mrs bowen  very said the girl  mr morton brought you these roses continued mrs bowen  oh said imogene with a cold glance at them  the flemmings have asked us to a party thursday there is to be dancing  the flemmings  yes as if she now saw reason to do so mrs bowen laid the book face downward in her lap she yawned a little with her hand on her mouth did you meet any one you knew  yes mr colville mrs bowen cut her yawn in half we got out to walk in the cascine and we saw him coming in at the gate he came up and asked if he might walk with us  did you have a pleasant walk asked mrs bowen a breath more chillily than she had asked if they had a pleasant drive  yes pleasant enough and then we came back and went down the river bank and he skipped stones and we took him to his hotel  was there anybody you knew in the cascine  oh no the place was a howling wilderness i never saw it so deserted said the girl impatiently it was terribly hot walking i thought i should burn up  mrs bowen did not answer anything she let the book lie in her lap  what an odd person mr colville is said imogene after a moment dont you think hes very different from other gentlemen  why  oh he has such a peculiar way of talking  what peculiar way  oh i dont know plenty of the young men i see talk cynically and i do sometimes myselfdesperately dont you know but then i know very well we dont mean anything by it  and do you think mr colville does do you think he talks cynically  imogene leaned back in her chair and reflected no she returned slowly i cant say that he does but he talks lightly with a kind of touch and go that makes you feel that he has exhausted all feeling he doesnt parade it at all but you hear between the words dont you know just as you read between the lines in some kinds of poetry of course its everything in knowing what hes been through hes perfectly unaffected and dont you think hes good  oh yes sighed mrs bowen in his way  but he sees through you oh quite nothing escapes him and pretty soon he lets out that he has seen through you and then you feel so flat oh its perfectly intoxicating to be with him i would give the world to talk as he does  what was your talk all about  oh i dont know i suppose it would have been called rather intellectual  mrs bowen smiled infinitesimally but after a moment she said gravely mr colville is very much older than you hes old enough to be your father  yes i know that you feel that he feels old and its perfectly tragical sometimes when he turns that slow dull melancholy look on you he seems a thousand years old  i dont mean that hes positively old said mrs bowen hes only old comparatively  oh yes i understand that and i dont mean that he really seems a thousand years old what i meant was he seems a thousand years off as if he were still young and had got left behind somehow he seems to be on the other side of some impassable barrier and you want to get over there and help him to our side but you cant do it i suppose his talking in that light way is merely a subterfuge to hide his feeling to make him forget  mrs bowen fingered the edges of her book you mustnt let your fancy run away with you imogene she said with a little painful smile  oh i like to let it run away with me and when i get such a subject as mr colville theres no stopping i cant stop and i dont wish to stop shouldnt you have thought that he would have been perfectly crushed at the exhibition he made of himself in the lancers last night he wasnt the least embarrassed when he met me and the only allusion he made to it was to say that he had been up late and had danced too much wasnt it wonderful he could do it oh if i could do that  i wish he could have avoided the occasion for his bravado said mrs bowen  i think i was a little to blame perhaps said the girl i beckoned him to come and take the vacant place  i dont see that that was an excuse returned mrs bowen primly  imogene seemed insensible to the tone as it concerned herself it only apparently reminded her of something guess what mr colville said when i had been silly and then tried to make up for it by being very dignified all of a sudden  i dont know how had you been silly  the servant brought in some cards imogene caught up the pelisse which she had been gradually shedding as she sat talking to mrs bowen and ran out of the room by another door  they did not recur to the subject but that night when mrs bowen went to say good night to effie after the child had gone to bed she lingered  effie she said at last in a husky whisper what did imogene say to mr colville today that made him laugh  i dont know said the child they kept laughing at so many things  laughing  yes he laughed do you mean toward the last when he had been throwing stones into the river  it must have been then  the child stretched herself drowsily oh i couldnt understand it all she wanted to throw a stone in the river but he told her she had better not but that didnt make him laugh she was so very stiff just afterward that he said the weather had changed and that made us laugh  was that all  we kept laughing ever so long i never saw any one like mr colville how queerly the fire shines on your face it gives you such a beautiful complexion  does it  yes lovely the childs mother stooped over and kissed her youre the prettiest mamma in the world she said throwing her arms round her neck sometimes i cant tell whether imogene is prettier or not but tonight im certain you are do you like to have me think that  yesyes but dont pull me down so you hurt my neck good night  the child let her go i havent said my prayer yet mamma i was thinking  well say it now then said the mother gently  when the child had finished she turned upon her cheek good night mamma  mrs bowen went about the room a little while picking up its pretty disorder then she sat down in a chair by the hearth where a log was still burning the light of the flame flickered upon her face and threw upon the ceiling a writhing fantastic shadow the odious caricature of her gentle beauty       viii   in that still air of the florentine winter time seems to share the arrest of the natural forces the repose of the elements the pale blue sky is frequently overcast and it rains two days out of five sometimes under extraordinary provocation from the north a snowstorm whirls along under the low grey dome and whitens the brown roofs where a growth of spindling weeds and grass clothes the tiles the whole year round and shows its delicate green above the gathered flakes but for the most part the winds are laid and the sole change is from quiet sun to quiet shower this at least is the impression which remains in the senses of the sojourning stranger whose days slip away with so little difference one from another that they seem really not to have passed but like the grass that keeps the hillsides fresh round florence all the winter long to be waiting some decisive change of season before they begin  the first of the carnival sights that marked the lapse of a month since his arrival took colville by surprise he could not have believed that it was february yet if it had not been for the straggling maskers in armour whom he met one day in via borgognissanti with their visors up for their better convenience in smoking they were part of the chorus at one of the theatres and they were going about to eke out their salaries with the gifts of people whose windows the festival season privileged them to play under the silly spectacle stirred colvilles blood a little as any sort of holiday preparation was apt to do he thought that it afforded him a fair occasion to call at palazzo pinti where he had not been so much of late as in the first days of his renewed acquaintance with mrs bowen he had at one time had the fancy that mrs bowen was cool toward him he might very well have been mistaken in this in fact she had several times addressed him the politest reproaches for not coming but he made some evasion and went only on the days when she was receiving other people and when necessarily he saw very little of the family  miss graham was always very friendly but always very busy drawing tea from the samovar and looking after others effie bowen dropped her eyes in reestablished strangeness when she brought the basket of cake to him there was one moment when he suspected that he had been talked over in family council and put under a certain regimen but he had no proof of this and it had really nothing to do with his keeping away which was largely accidental he had taken up with as much earnestness as he could reasonably expect of himself that notion of studying the architectural expression of florentine character at the different periods he had spent a good deal of money in books he had revived his youthful familiarity with the city and he had made what acquaintance he could with people interested in such matters he met some of these in the limited but very active society in which he mingled daily and nightly after the first strangeness to any sort of social life had worn off he found himself very fond of the prompt hospitalities which his introduction at mrs bowens had opened to him his hostor more frequently it was his hostesshad sometimes merely an apartment at a hotel perhaps the family was established in one of the furnished lodgings which stretch the whole length of the lung arno on either hand and abound in all the new streets approaching the cascine and had set up the simple and facile housekeeping of the sojourner in florence for a few months others had been living in the villa or the palace they had taken for years  the more recent and transitory people expressed something of the prevailing english and american aestheticism in the decoration of their apartments but the greater part accepted the florentine drawingroom as their landlord had imagined it for them with furniture and curtains in yellow satin a cheap ingrain carpet thinly covering the stone floor and a fire of little logs ineffectually blazing on the hearth and flickering on the carved frames of the pictures on the wall and the nakedness of the frescoed allegories in the ceiling whether of longer or shorter stay the sojourners were bound together by a common language and a common social tradition they all had a day and on that day there was tea and bread and butter for every comer they had one another to dine there were evening parties with dancing and without dancing colville even went to a fancy ball where he was kept in countenance by several other florentines of the period of romola at all these places he met nearly the same people whose alien life in the midst of the native community struck him as one of the phases of modern civilisation worthy of note if not particular study for he fancied it destined to a wider future throughout europe as the conditions in england and america grow more tiresome and more onerous they seemed to see very little of italian society and to be shut out from practical knowledge of the local life by the terms upon which they had themselves insisted our race finds its simplified and cheapened london or new york in all its continental resorts now but nowhere has its taste been so much studied as in italy and especially in florence it was not perhaps the real englishman or american who had been considered but a forestière conventionalised from the florentines observation of many anglosaxons but he had been so well conjectured that he was hemmed round with a very fair illusion of his national circumstances  it was not that he had his english or american doctor to prescribe for him when sick and his english or american apothecary to compound his potion it was not that there was an english tailor and an american dentist an english bookseller and an english baker and chapels of every shade of protestantism with catholic preaching in english every sunday these things were more or less matters of necessity but colville objected that the barbers should offer him an american shampoo that the groceries should abound in english biscuit and our own canned fruit and vegetables and that the grocers clerks should be ambitious to read the labels of the boston baked beans he heardthough he did not prove this by experimentthat the master of a certain trattoria had studied the doughnut of new england till he had actually surpassed the original in the qualities that have undermined our digestion as a people but above all it interested him to see that intense expression of american civilisation the horsecar triumphing along the magnificent avenues that mark the line of the old city walls and he recognised an instinctive obedience to an abtruse natural law in the fact that whereas the omnibus which the italians have derived from the english was not filled beyond its seating capacity the horsecar was overcrowded without and within at florence just as it is with us who invented it  i wouldnt mind even that he said one day to the lady who was drawing him his fifth or sixth cup of tea for that afternoon and with whom he was naturally making this absurd condition of things a matter of personal question but you people here pass your days in a round of unbroken english except when you talk with your servants im not sure you dont speak english with the shop people i can hardly get them to speak italian to me  perhaps they think you can speak english better said the lady  this went over florence in a week it was told to colville as something said to some one else he fearlessly reclaimed it as said to himself and this again was told in the houses where he visited he had the friendly acceptance of any intelligent and reasonably agreeable person who comes promptly and willingly when he is asked and seems always to have enjoyed himself when he goes away but besides this sort of general favour he enjoyed a very pleasing little personal popularity which came from his interest in other people from his goodnature and from his inertness he slighted no acquaintance and talked to every one with the same apparent wish to be entertaining this was because he was incapable of the cruelty of open indifference when his lot was cast with a dull person and also because he was mentally too lazy to contrive pretences for getting away besides he did not really find anybody altogether a bore and he had no wish to shine he listened without shrinking to stories that he had heard before and to things that had already been said to him as has been noted he had himself the habit of repeating his ideas with the recklessness of maturity for he had lived long enough to know that this can be done with almost entire safety  he haunted the studios a good deal and through a retrospective affinity with art and a human sympathy with the sacrifice which it always involves he was on friendly terms with sculptors and painters who were not in every case so friendly with one another more than once he saw the scars of old rivalries and he might easily have been an adherent of two or three parties but he tried to keep the freedom of the different camps without taking sides and he felt the pathos of the case when they all told the same story of the disaster which the taste for bricàbrac had wrought to the cause of art how people who came abroad no longer gave orders for statues and pictures but spent their money on curtains and carpets old chests and chairs and pots and pans there were some among these artists whom he had known twenty years before in florence ardent and hopeful beginners and now the backs of their grey or bald heads as they talked to him with their faces towards their work and a pencil or a pinch of clay held thoughtfully between their fingers appealed to him as if he had remained young and prosperous and they had gone forward to age and hard work they were very quaint at times they talked the american slang of the war days and of the days before the war without a mastery of italian they often used the idioms of that tongue in their english speech they were dim and vague about the country with whose affairs they had kept up through the newspapers here and there one thought he was going home very soon others had finally relinquished all thoughts of return these had perhaps without knowing it lost the desire to come back they cowered before the expensiveness of life in america and doubted of a future with which indeed only the young can hopefully grapple but in spite of their accumulated years and the evil times on which they had fallen colville thought them mostly very happy men leading simple and innocent lives in a world of the ideal and rich in the inexhaustible beauty of the city the sky the air they all whether they were ever going back or not were fervent americans and their ineffaceable nationality marked them perhaps all the more strongly for the patches of something alien that overlaid it in places they knew that he was or had been a newspaper man but if they secretly cherished the hope that he would bring them to the dolce lume of print they never betrayed it and the authorship of his letter about the american artists in florence which he printed in the american register at paris was not traced to him for a whole week  colville was a frequent visitor of mr waters who had a lodging in piazza san marco of the poverty which can always be decent in italy it was bare but for the books that furnished it with a table for his writing on a corner of which he breakfasted a wide sofa with cushions in coarse white linen that frankly confessed itself a bed by night and two chairs of plain italian walnut but the windows which had no sun looked out upon the church and the convent sacred to the old socinian for the sake of the meek heroic mystic whom they keep alive in all the glory of his martyrdom no two minds could well have been further apart than the new england minister and the florentine monk and no two souls nearer together as colville recognised with a not irreverent smile  when the old man was not looking up some point of his saints history in his books he was taking with the hopefulness of youth and the patience of age a lesson in colloquial italian from his landladys daughter which he pronounced with a scholarly scrupulosity and a sincere atonic massachusetts accent he practised the language wherever he could especially at the trattoria where he dined and where he made occasions to detain the waiter in conversation they humoured him out of their national goodheartedness and sympathy and they did what they could to realise a strange american dish for him on sundaysa combination of stockfish and potatoes boiled and then fried together in small cakes they revered him as a foreign gentleman of saintly amiability and incomprehensible preferences and he was held in equal regard at the next greengrocers where he spent every morning five centessimi for a bunch of radishes and ten for a little pat of butter to eat with his bread and coffee he could not yet accustom himself to mere bread and coffee for breakfast though he conformed as completely as he could to the italian way of living he respected the abstemiousness of the race he held that it came from a spirituality of nature to which the north was still strange with all its conscience and sense of individual accountability he contended that he never suffered in his small dealings with these people from the dishonesty which most of his countrymen complained of and he praised their unfailing gentleness of manner this could arise only from goodness of heart which was perhaps the best kind of goodness after all  none of these humble acquaintance of his could well have accounted for the impression they all had that he was some sort of ecclesiastic they could never have understoodnor for that matter could any one have understood through european traditionthe sort of sacerdotal office that mr waters had filled so long in the little deeply bookclubbed new england village where he had outlived most of his flock till one day he rose in the midst of the surviving dyspeptics and consumptives and following the example of mr emerson renounced his calling for ever by that time even the pale unitarianism thinning out into paler doubt was no longer tenable with him he confessed that while he felt the divine goodness more and more he believed that it was a mistake to preach any specific creed or doctrine and he begged them to release him from their service a young man came to fill his place in their pulpit but he kept his place in their hearts they raised a subscription of seventeen hundred dollars and thirtyfive cents another being submitted to the new button manufacturer who had founded his industry in the village he promptly rounded it out to three thousand and mr waters came to florence his people parted with him in terms of regret as delicate as they were awkward and their love followed him he corresponded regularly with two or three ladies and his letters were sometimes read from his pulpit  colville took the piazza san marco in on his way to palazzo pinti on the morning when he had made up his mind to go there and he stood at the window looking out with the old man when some more maskers passed through the placetwo young fellows in old florentine dress with a third habited as a nun  ah said the old man gently i wish they hadnt introduced the nun but i suppose they cant help signalising their escape from the domination of the church on all occasions its a natural reaction it will all come right in time  you preach the true american gospel said colville  of course there is no other gospel that is the gospel  do you suppose that savonarola would think it had all come out right asked colville a little maliciously if he could look from the window with us here and see the wicked old carnival that he tried so hard to kill four hundred years ago still alive and kicking he added in cognisance of the caper of one of the maskers  oh yes why not by this time he knows that his puritanism was all a mistake unless as a thing for the moment only i should rather like to have savonarola here with us he would find these costumes familiar they are of his time i shall make a point of seeing all i can of the carnival as part of my study of savonarola if nothing else  im afraid youll have to give yourself limitations said colville as one of the maskers threw his arm round the mocknuns neck but the old man did not see this and colville did not feel it necessary to explain himself  the maskers had passed out of the piazza now and have you seen our friends at palazzo pinti lately said mr waters  not very said colville i was just on my way there  i wish you would make them my compliments such a beautiful young creature  yes said colville she is certainly a beautiful girl  i meant mrs bowen returned the old man quietly  oh i thought you meant miss graham mrs bowen is my contemporary and so i didnt think of her when you said young i should have called her pretty rather than beautiful  no shes beautiful the young girl is goodlookingi dont deny that but she is very crude yet  colville laughed crude in looks i should have said miss graham was rather crude in mind though im not sure i wouldnt have stopped at saying young  no mildly persisted the old man she couldnt be crude in mind without being crude in looks  you mean pursued colville smiling but not wholly satisfied that she hasnt a lovely nature  you never can know what sort of nature a young girl has her nature depends so much upon that of the man whose fate she shares  the woman is what the man makes her that is convenient for the woman and relieves her of all responsibility  the man is what the woman makes him too but not so much so the man was cast into a deep sleep you know  and the woman was what he dreamed her i wish she were  in most cases she is said mr waters  they did not pursue the matter the truth that floated in the old ministers words pleased colville by its vagueness and flattered the man in him by its implication of the mans superiority he wanted to say that if mrs bowen were what the late mr bowen had dreamed her then the late mr bowen when cast into his deep sleep must have had lina ridgely in his eye but this seemed to be personalising the fantasy unwarrantably and pushing it too far for like reason he forbore to say that if mr waterss theory were correct it would be better to begin with some one whom nobody else had dreamed before then you could be sure at least of not having a wife to somebody elses mind rather than your own once on his way to palazzo pinti he stopped arrested by a thought that had not occurred to him before in relation to what mr waters had been saying and then pushed on with the sense of security which is the compensation the possession of the initiative brings to our sex along with many responsibilities in the enjoyment of this no man stops to consider the other side which must wait his initiative however they mean to meet it  in the por san maria colville found masks and dominoes filling the shop windows and dangling from the doors a devil in red and a clown in white crossed the way in front of him from an intersecting street several children in pretty masquerading dresses flashed in and out among the crowd he hurried to the lung arno and reached the palace where mrs bowen lived with these holiday sights fresh in his mind imogene turned to meet him at the door of the apartment running from the window where she had left effie bowen still gazing  we saw you coming she said gaily without waiting to exchange formal greetings we didnt know at first but it might be somebody else disguised as you weve been watching the maskers go by isnt it exciting  awfully said colville going to the window with her and putting his arm on effies shoulder where she knelt in a chair looking out what have you seen  oh only two spanish students with mandolins said imogene but you can see theyre beginning to come  theyll stop now murmured effie with gentle disappointment its commencing to rain  oh too bad wailed the young girl but just then two mediaeval menatarms came in sight carrying umbrellas isnt that too delicious umbrellas and chainarmour  you cant expect them to let their chainarmour get rusty said colville you ought to have been with meminstrels in scalearmour florentines of savonarolas times nuns clowns demons fairiesno end to them  its very well saying we ought to have been with you but we cant go anywhere alone  i didnt say alone said colville dont you think mrs bowen would trust you with me to see these carnival beginnings he had not meant at all to do anything of this kind but that had not prevented his doing it  how do we know when she hasnt been asked said imogene with a touch of burlesque dolor such as makes a dignified girl enchanting when she permits it to herself she took effies hand in hers the child having faced round from the window and stood smoothing it with her lovely head pathetically tilted on one side  what havent i been asked yet demanded mrs bowen coming lightly toward them from a door at the side of the salon she gave her hand to colville with the prettiest grace and a cordiality that brought a flush to her cheek there had really been nothing between them but a little unreasoned coolness if it were even so much as that say rather a dryness aggravated by time and absence and now as friends do after a thing of that kind they were suddenly glad to be good to each other  why you havent been asked how you have been this long time said colville  i have been wanting to tell you for a whole week returned mrs bowen seating the rest and taking a chair for herself where have you been  oh shut up in my cell at hotel datene writing a short history of the florentine people for miss effie  effie take mr colvilles hat said her mother were going to make you stay to lunch she explained to him  is that so he asked with an effect of polite curiosity  yes imogene softly clapped her hands unseen by mrs bowen for colvilles instruction that all was going well if it delights women to pet an undangerous friend of our sex to use him like one of themselves there are no words to paint the soft and flattered content with which his spirit purrs under their caresses you must have nearly finished the history added mrs bowen  well i could have finished it said colville if i had only begun it you see writing a short history of the florentine people is such quick work that you have to be careful how you actually put pen to paper or youre through with it before youve had any fun out of it  i think effie will like to read that kind of history said her mother  the child hung her head and would not look at colville she was still shy with him his absence must have seemed longer to a child of course  at lunch they talked of the carnival sights that had begun to appear he told of his call upon mr waters and of the old ministers purpose to see all he could of the carnival in order to judge intelligently of savonarolas opposition to it  mr waters is a very good man said mrs bowen with the air of not meaning to approve him quite nor yet to let any notion of his be made fun of in her presence but for my part i wish there were not going to be any carnival the city will be in such an uproar for the next two weeks  o mrs bowen cried imogene reproachfully effie looked at her mother in apparent anxiety lest she should be meaning to put forth an unquestionable power and stop the carnival  the last carnival i thought there was never going to be any end to it i was so glad when lent came  glad when lent came breathed imogene in astonishment but she ventured upon nothing more insubordinate and colville admired to see this spirited girl as subject to mrs bowen as her own child there is no reason why one woman should establish another woman over her but nearly all women do it in one sort or another from love of a voluntary submission or from a fear of their own ignorance if they are younger and more inexperienced than their lieges neither the one passion nor the other seems to reduce them to a like passivity as regards their husbands they must apparently have a fetish of their own sex colville could see that imogene obeyed mrs bowen not only as a protégée but as a devotee  oh i suppose you will have to go through it all said mrs bowen in reward of the girls acquiescence  youre rather out of the way of it up here said colville you had better let me go about with the young ladiesif you can trust them to the care of an old fellow like me  oh i dont think youre so very old at all times replied mrs bowen with a peculiar look whether indulgent or reproachful he could not quite make out  but he replied boldly in his turn i have certainly my moments of being young still i dont deny it theres always a danger of their occurrence  i was thinking said mrs bowen with a graceful effect of not listening that you would let me go too it would be quite like old times  only too much honour and pleasure returned colville if you will leave out the old times im not particular about having them along mrs bowen joined in laughing at the joke which they had to themselves i was only consulting an explicit abhorrence of yours in not asking you to go at first he explained  oh yes i understand that  the excellence of the whole arrangement seemed to grow upon mrs bowen of course she said imogene ought to see all she can of the carnival she may not have another chance and perhaps if she had he wouldnt consent  ill engage to get his consent said the girl what i was afraid of was that i couldnt get yours mrs bowen  am i so severe as that asked mrs bowen softly  quite replied imogene  perhaps thought colville it isnt always silent submission  for no very good reason that any one could give the carnival that year was not a brilliant one colvilles party seemed to be always meeting the same maskers on the street and the maskers did not greatly increase in numbers there were a few more of them after nightfall but they were then a little more bacchanal and he felt it was better that the ladies had gone home by that time in the pursuit of the tempered pleasure of looking up the maskers he was able to make the reflection that their fantastic and vivid dresses sympathised in a striking way with the architecture of the city and gave him an effect of florence which he could not otherwise have had there came by and by a little attempt at a corso in via cerratani and via tornabuoni there were some masks in carriages and from one they actually threw plaster confetti half a dozen barelegged boys ran before and beat one another with bladders some people but not many watched the show from the windows and the footways were crowded  having proposed that they should see the carnival together colville had made himself responsible for it to the bowen household imogene said well is this the famous carnival of florence  it certainly doesnt compare with the carnival last year said mrs bowen  your reproach is just mrs bowen he acknowledged ive managed it badly but you know ive been out of practice a great while there in des vaches  oh poor mr colville cried imogene he isnt altogether to blame  i dont know said mrs bowen humouring the joke in her turn it seems to me that if he had consulted us a little earlier he might have done better  he drove home with the ladies and mrs bowen made him stay to tea as if she felt that he needed to be consoled for the failure of his carnival she was especially indulgent with him she played to him on the piano some of the songs that were in fashion when they were in florence together before  imogene had never heard them she had heard her mother speak of them one or two of them were negro songs such as very pretty young ladies used to sing without harm to themselves or offence to others but imogene decided that they were rather rowdy dear me mrs bowen did you sing such songs you wouldnt let effie  no i wouldnt let effie the times are changed i wouldnt let effie go to the theatre alone with a young gentleman  the times are changed for the worse colville began what harm ever came to a young man from a young ladys going alone to the theatre with him  he stayed till the candles were brought in and then went away only because as he said they had not asked him to stay to dinner  he came nearly every day upon one pretext or another and he met them oftener than that at the teas and on the days of other ladies in florence for he was finding the busy idleness of the life very pleasant and he went everywhere he formed the habit of carrying flowers to the palazzo pinti excusing himself on the ground that they were so cheap and so abundant as to be impersonal he brought violets to effie and roses to imogene to mrs bowen he always brought a bunch of the huge purple anemones which grow so abundantly all winter long about florence i wonder why purple anemones he asked her one day in presenting them to her  oh it is quite time i should be wearing purple she said gently  ah mrs bowen he reproached her why do i bring purple violets to miss effie  you must ask effie said mrs bowen with a laugh  after that he stayed away fortyeight hours and then appeared with a bunch of the red anemones as large as tulips which light up the meadow grass when it begins to stir from its torpor in the spring they grew on purpose to set me right with you he said and i saw them when i was in the country  it was a little triumph for him which she celebrated by putting them in a vase on her table and telling people who exclaimed over them that they were some mr colville gathered in the country he enjoyed his privileges at her house with the futureless satisfaction of a man he liked to go about with the bowens he was seen with the ladies driving and walking in most of their promenades he directed their visits to the churches and the galleries he was fond of strolling about with effies daintilygloved little hand in his he took her to giocosas and treated her to ices he let her choose from the confectioners prettiest caprices in candy he was allowed to bring the child presents in his pockets perhaps he was not as conscientious as he might have been in his behaviour with the little girl he did what he could to spoil her or at least to relax the severity of the training she had received he liked to see the struggle that went on in the mothers mind against this and then the other struggle with which she overcame her opposition to it the worst he did was to teach effie some picturesque western phrases which she used with innocent effectiveness she committed the crimes against convention which he taught her with all the conventional elegance of her training the most that he ever gained for her were some concessions in going out in weather that her mother thought unfit or sitting up for halfhours after her bedtime he ordered books for her from goodbans and it was colville now and not the rev mr morton who read poetry aloud to the ladies on afternoons when mrs bowen gave orders that she and miss graham should be denied to all other comers  it was an intimacy and society in florence is not blind and especially it is not dumb the old lady who had celebrated mrs bowen to him the first night at palazzo pinti led a life of active questions as to what was the supreme attraction to colville there and she referred her doubt to every friend with whom she drank tea she philosophised the situation very scientifically and if not very conclusively how few are the absolute conclusions of science upon any point  he is a bachelor and there is a natural affinity between bachelors and widowsmuch more than if he were a widower too if he were a widower i should say it was undoubtedly mademoiselle if he were a little bit younger i should have no doubt it was madame but men of that age have such an ambition to marry young girls i suppose that they think it proves they are not so very old after all and certainly he isnt too old to marry if he were wisewhich he probably isnt if hes like other men in such mattersthere wouldnt be any question about mrs bowen pretty creature and so much sense too much for him ah my dear how we are wasted upon that sex  mrs bowen herself treated the affair with masterly frankness more than once in varying phrase she said you are very good to give us so much of your time mr colville and i wont pretend i dont know it youre helping me out with a very hazardous experiment when i undertook to see imogene through a winter in florence i didnt reflect what a very gay time girls have at home in western towns especially but i havent heard her breathe buffalo once and im sure its doing her a great deal of good here shes naturally got a very good mind shes very ambitious to be cultivated shes read a good deal and shes anxious to know history and art and your advice and criticism are the greatest possible advantage to her  thank you said colville with a fine remote dissatisfaction i supposed i was merely enjoying myself  he had lately begun to haunt his bankers for information in regard to the carnival balls with the hope that something might be made out of them  but either there were to be no great carnival balls or it was a mistake to suppose that his banker ought to know about them colville went experimentally to one of the peoples balls at a minor theatre which he found advertised on the house walls at halfpast ten the dancing had not begun but the masks were arriving young women in gay silks and dirty white gloves men in womens dresses with enormous hands girls as pages clowns pantaloons old women and the like they were all very goodhumoured the men who far outnumbered the women danced contentedly together colville liked two cavalry soldiers who waltzed with each other for an hour and then went off to a battery on exhibition in the pit and had as much electricity as they could hold he liked also two young citizens who danced together as long as he stayed and did not leave off even for electrical refreshment he came away at midnight pushing out of the theatre through a crowd of people at the door some of whom were tipsy this certainly would not have done for the ladies though the people were civilly tipsy       ix   the next morning paolo when he brought up colvilles breakfast brought the news that there was to be a veglione at the pergola theatre this news revived colvilles courage paolo he said you ought to open a bankinghouse paolo was used to being joked by foreigners who could not speak italian very well he smiled as if he understood  the banker had his astute doubts of paolos intelligence the banker in europe doubts all news not originating in his house but after a day or two the advertisements in the newspapers carried conviction even to the banker  when colville went to the ladies with news of the veglione he found that they had already heard of it should you like to go he asked mrs bowen  i dont know what do you think she asked in turn  oh its for you to do the thinking i only know what i want  imogene said nothing while she watched the internal debate as it expressed itself in mrs bowens face  people go in boxes she said thoughtfully but you would feel that a box wasnt the same thing exactly  we went on the floor suggested colville  it was very different then and besides mrs finlay had absolutely no sense of propriety when a woman has explicitly condemned a given action she apparently gathers courage for its commission under a little different conditions of course if we went upon the floor i shouldnt wish it to be known at all though foreigners can do almost anything they like  really said colville when it comes to that i dont see any harm in it  and you say go  i say whatever you say  mrs bowen looked from him to imogene i dont either she said finally and they understood that she meant the harm which he had not seen  which of us has been so good as to deserve this asked colville  oh you have all been good she said we shall go in masks and dominoes she continued nothing will happen and who should know us if anything did they had received tickets to the great borghese ball which is still a fashionable and desired event of the carnival to foreigners in florence but their preconceptions of the veglione threw into the shade the entertainment which the gentlemen of florence offered to favoured sojourners  come said mrs bowen you must go with us and help us choose our dominoes  a prudent woman does not do an imprudent thing by halves effie was to be allowed to go to the veglione too and she went with them to the shop where they were to hire their dominoes it would be so much more fun mrs bowen said to choose the dresses in the shop than to have them sent home for you to look at effie was to be in black imogene was to have a light blue domino and mrs bowen chose a purple one even where their faces were not to be seen they considered their complexions in choosing the colours if you happened to find a friend and wanted to unmask you would not want to look horrid the shop people took the vividest interest in it all as if it were a new thing to them and these were the first foreigners they had ever served with masks and dominoes they made mrs bowen and imogene go into an inner room and come out for the mystification of colville hulking about in the front shop with his mask and domino on  which is which the ladies both challenged him in the masks conventional falsetto when they came out  with a mans severe logic he distinguished them according to their silks but there had been time for them to think of changing and they took off their masks to laugh in his face  they fluttered so airily about among the pendent masks and dominoes from which they shook a ghostly perfume of old carnivals that his heart leaped  ah youll never be so fascinating again he cried he wanted to take them in his arms they were both so delicious a man has still only that primitive way of expressing his supreme satisfaction in women now which am i he demanded of them and that made them laugh again he had really put his arm about effie  do you think you will know your papa at the veglione asked one of the shopwomen with a mounting interest in the amiable family party  they all laughed the natural mistake seemed particularly droll to imogene  come cried mrs bowen its time we should be going  that was true they had passed so long a time in the shop that they did not feel justified in seriously attempting to beat down the price of their dresses they took them at the first price the woman said with reason that it was carnival and she could get her price for the things  they went to the veglione at eleven the ladies calling for colville as before in mrs bowens carriage he felt rather sheepish coming out of his room in his mask and domino but the corridors of the hotel were empty and for the most part dark there was no one up but the porter who wished him a pleasant time in as matteroffact fashion as if he were going out to an evening party in his dress coat his spirits mounted in the atmosphere of adventure which the ladies diffused about them in the carriage effie bowen laughed aloud when he entered in childish gaiety of heart  the narrow streets roared with the wheels of cabs and carriages coming and going the street before the theatre was so packed that it was some time before they could reach the door masks were passing in and out the nervous joy of the ladies expressed itself in a deepdrawn quivering sigh their carriage door was opened by a servant of the theatre who wished them a pleasant veglione and the next moment they were in the crowded vestibule where they paused a moment to let imogene and effie really feel that they were part of a masquerade  now keep all together said mrs bowen as they passed through the inner door of the vestibule and the brilliantly lighted theatre flashed its colours and splendours upon them the floor of the pit had been levelled to that of the stage which stripped of the scenic apparatus opened vaster spaces for the motley crew already eddying over it in the waltz the boxes tier over tier blazed with the light of candelabra which added their sparkle to that of the gas jets  you and effie go before said mrs bowen to imogene she made them take hands like children and mechanically passed her own hand through colvilles arm  a mask in red from head to foot attached himself to the party and began to make love to her in excellent pantomime  colville was annoyed he asked her if he should tell the fellow to take himself off  not on any account she answered its perfectly delightful it wouldnt be the veglione without it did you ever see such good acting  i dont think its remarkable for anything but its fervour said colville  i should like to see you making love to some lady she rejoined mischievously  i will make love to you if you like he said but he felt in an instant that his joke was in bad taste  they went the round of the theatre that is prince strozzi imogene said mrs bowen leaning forward to whisper to the girl she pointed out other people of historic and aristocratic names in the boxes where there was a democracy of beauty among the ladies all painted and powdered to the same marquise effect  on the floor were gentlemen in evening dress without masks and here and there ladies waltzing who had masks but no dominoes but for the most part people were in costume the theatre flushed and flowered in gay variety of tint that teased the eye with its flow through the dance  mrs bowen had circumscribed the adventure so as to exclude dancing from it imogene was not to dance one might go to the veglione and look on from a box if one ventured further and went on the floor decidedly one was not to dance  this was thoroughly understood beforehand and there were to be no petitions or murmurs at the theatre they found a quiet corner and sat down to look on  the mask in red followed and took his place at a little distance where whenever mrs bowen looked that way he continued to protest his passion  youre sure he doesnt bore you suggested colville  no indeed hes very amusing  oh all right  the waltz ceased the whirling and winding confusion broke into an irregular streaming hither and thither up and down they began to pick out costumes and characters that interested them clowns in white with big noses and harlequins in their motley with flat black masks abounded there were some admirable grasshoppers in green with long antennae quivering from their foreheads two or three mephistos reddened through the crowd several knights in armour got about with difficulty apparently burdened by their greaves and breastplates  a group of leaping and dancing masks gathered around a young man in evening dress with long hair who stood leaning against a pillar near them and who underwent their mockeries with a smile of patience half amused half tormented  when they grew tired of baiting him and were looking about for other prey the red mask redoubled his show of devotion to mrs bowen and the other masks began to flock round and approve  oh now she said with a little embarrassed laugh in which there was no displeasure i think you may ask him to go away but dont be harsh with him she added at a brusque movement which colville made toward the mask  oh why should i be harsh with him were not rivals this was not in good taste either colville felt besides im an italian too he said to retrieve himself he made a few paces toward the mask and said in a low tone with gentle suggestion madame finds herself a little incommoded  the mask threw himself into an attitude of burlesque despair bowed low with his hand on his heart in token of submission and vanished into the crowd the rest dispersed with cries of applause  how very prettily you did it both of you said mrs bowen i begin to believe you are an italian mr colville i shall be afraid of you  you werent afraid of him  oh he was a real italian  it seems to me that mamma is getting all the good of the veglione said effie in a plaintive murmur the welldisciplined child must have suffered deeply before she lifted this seditious voice  why so i am effie answered her mother and i dont think its fair myself what shall we do about it  i should like something to eat said the child  so should i said colville thats reparation your mother owes us all lets make her take us and get us something wouldnt you like an ice miss graham  yes an ice said imogene with an effect of adding nothing more for worlds that made colville laugh she rose slowly like one in a dream and cast a look as impassioned as a look could be made through a mask on the scene she was leaving behind her the band was playing a waltz again and the wide floor swam with circling couples  the corridor where the tables were set was thronged with people who were drinking beer and eating cold beef and boned turkey and slices of huge round sausages oh how can they cried the girl shuddering  i didnt know you were so etherealminded about these things said colville i thought you didnt object to the salad at madame uccellis  oh but at the veglione breathed the girl for all answer he laughed again but mrs bowen did not laugh with him he wondered why  when they returned to their corner in the theatre they found a mask in a black domino there who made place for them and remained standing near they began talking freely and audibly as englishspeaking people incorrigibly do in italy where their tongue is all but the language of the country  really said colville i think i shall stifle in this mask if you ladies will do what you can to surround me and keep me secret ill take it off a moment  i believe i will join you mr colville said the mask near them he pushed up his little visor of silk and discovered the mild benignant features of mr waters  bless my soul cried colville  mrs bowen was apparently too much shocked to say anything  you didnt expect to meet me here asked the old man as if otherwise it should be the most natural thing in the world after that they could only unite in suppressing their astonishment its extremely interesting he went on extremely ive been here ever since the exercises began and i have not only been very greatly amused but greatly instructed it seems to me the key to a great many anomalies in the history of this wonderful people  if mr waters took this philosophical tone about the carnival it was not possible for colville to take any other  and have you been able to divine from what you have seen here he asked gravely the grounds of savonarolas objection to the carnival  not at all said the old man promptly i have seen nothing but the most harmless gaiety throughout the evening  colville hung his head he remembered reading once in a passage from swedenborg that the most celestial angels had scarcely any power of perceiving evil  why arent you young people dancing asked mr waters in a cheerful general way of mrs bowens party  colville was glad to break the silence mrs bowen doesnt approve of dancing at vegliones  nowhy not inquired the old man with invincible simplicity  mrs bowen smiled her pretty small smile below her mask  the company is apt to be rather mixed she said quietly  yes pursued mr waters but you could dance with one another the company seems very well behaved  oh quite so mrs bowen assented  shortly after i came said mr waters one of the masks asked me to dance i was really sorry that my age and traditions forbade my doing so i tried to explain but im afraid i didnt make myself quite clear  probably it passed for a joke with her said colville in order to say something  ah very likely but i shall always feel that my impressions of the carnival would have been more definite if i could have danced now if i were a young man like you  imogens turned and looked at colville through the eyeholes of her mask even in that sort of isolation he thought her eyes expressed surprise  it never occurred to you before that i was a young man he suggested gravely  she did not reply  after a little interval imogene asked mrs bowen would you like to dance  colville was astonished the veglione has gone to your head mrs bowen he tacitly made his comment she had spoken to imogene but she glanced at him as if she expected him to be grateful to her for this stroke of liberality  what would be the use returned the girl  colville rose after my performance in the lancers i cant expect you to believe me but i really do know how to waltz he had but to extend his arms and she was hanging upon his shoulder and they were whirling away through a long orbit of delight to the girl  oh why have you let me do you such injustice she murmured intensely i never shall forgive myself  it grieved me that you shouldnt have divined that i was really a magnificent dancer in disguise but i bore it as best i could said colville really amused at her seriousness perhaps youll find out after a while that im not an old fellow either but only a lost youth  hush she said i dont like to hear you talk so  how  aboutage she answered it makes me feel dont tonight  colville laughed it isnt a fact that my blinking is going to change materially you had better make the most of me as a lost youth im old enough to be two of them  she did not answer and as they wound up and down through the other orbing couples he remembered the veglione of seventeen years before when he had dreamed through the waltz with the girl who jilted him she was very docile and submissive that night he believed afterward that if he had spoken frankly then she would not have refused him but he had veiled his passion in words and phrases that taken in themselves had no meaningthat neither committed him nor claimed her he could not help it he had not the courage at any moment to risk the loss of her for ever till it was too late till he must lose her  do you believe in preexistence he demanded of imogene  oh yes she flashed back this very instant it was just as if i had been here before long ago  dancing with me  with you yesyesi think so  he had lived long enough to know that she was making herself believe what she said and that she had not lived long enough to know this  then you remember what i said to youtried to say to youthat night through one of those psychological juggles which we all practise with ourselves at times it amused him it charmed him to find her striving to realise this past  no it was so long ago what was it she whispered dreamily  a turn of the waltz brought them near mrs bowen her mask seemed to wear a dumb reproach  he began to be weary one of the differences between youth and later life is that the latter wearies so soon of any given emotion  ah i cant remember either arent you getting rather tired of the waltz and me  oh no go on she deeply murmured try to remember  the long pulsating stream of the music broke and fell the dancers crookedly dispersed in wandering lines she took his arm he felt her heart leap against it those innocent trustful throbs upbraided him at the same time his own heart beat with a sort of fond protecting tenderness he felt the witchery of his power to make this young radiant and beautiful creature hang flattered and bewildered on his talk he liked the compassionate worship with which his tacit confidence had inspired her even while he was not without some satirical sense of the crude sort of heartbroken hero he must be in the fancy of a girl of her age  let us go and walk in the corridor a moment he said but they walked there till the alluring melancholy music of the waltz began again in a mutual caprice they rejoined the dance  it came into his head to ask who is he and as he had got past denying himself anything he asked it  he what he  he that mrs bowen thought might object to your seeing the carnival  ohoh yes that was the not impossible he  is that all  yes  then hes not even the not improbable he  no indeed  they waltzed in silence then why did you ask me that she murmured  i dont know was it such a strange question  i dont know you ought to  yes if it was wrong im old enough to know better  you promised not to say old any more  then i suppose i mustnt but you mustnt get me to ignore it and then laugh at me for it  oh she reproached him you think i could do that  you could if it was you who were here with me once before  then i know i wasnt  again they were silent and it was he who spoke first i wish you would tell me why you object to the interdicted topic  becausebecause i like every time to be perfect in itself  oh and this wouldnt be perfect in itself if i werenot so young as some people  i didnt mean that no but if you didnt mention it no one else would think of it or care for it  did any one ever accuse you of flattering miss graham  not till now and you are unjust  well i withdraw the accusation  and will you ever pretend such a thing again  oh never  then i have your promise  the talk was light wordplay such as depends upon the talkers own mood for its point or its pointlessness between two young people of equal years it might have had meanings to penetrate to sigh over to question colville found it delicious to be pursued by the ingenuous fervour of this young girl eager to vindicate her sincerity in prohibiting him from his own ironical depreciation apparently she had a sentimental mission of which he was the object he was to be convinced that he was unnecessarily morbid he was to be cheered up to be kept in heart  i must believe in you after this he said with a smile which his mask hid  thanks she breathed it seemed to him that her hand closed convulsively upon his in their light clasp  the pressure sent a real pang to his heart it forced her name from his lips imogene ah ive no right to call you that  yes  from this out i promise to be twenty years younger but no one is to know it but you do you think you will know it i shouldnt like to keep the secret to myself altogether  no i will help you it shall be our secret  she gave a low laugh of delight he convinced himself that she had entered into the light spirit of banter in which he believed that he was talking  the music ceased again he whirled her to the seat where he had left mrs bowen she was not there nor the others  colville felt the meanness of a man who has betrayed his trust and his selfcontempt was the sharper because the trust had been as tacit and indefinite as it was generous the effect of mrs bowens absence was as if she had indignantly flown and left him to the consequences of his treachery  he sat down rather blankly with imogene to wait for her return it was the only thing they could do  it had grown very hot the air was thick with dust the lights burned through it as through a fog  i believe i will take off my mask she said i can scarcely breathe  no no protested colville that wont do  i feel faint she gasped  his heart sank dont he said incoherently come with me into the vestibule and get a breath of air  he had almost to drag her through the crowd but in the vestibule she revived and they returned to their place again he did not share the easy content with which she recognised the continued absence of mrs bowen  why they must be lost but isnt it perfect sitting here and watching the maskers  perfect said colville distractedly  dont you like to make romances about the different ones  it was on colvilles tongue to say that he had made all the romances he wished for that evening but he only answered oh very  poor mrs bowen laughed the girl it will be such a joke on her with her punctilious notions getting lost from her protégée at a carnival ball i shall tell every one  oh no dont said colville in horror that big mask scarcely concealed  why not  it wouldnt be at all the thing  why are you becoming europeanised too she demanded i thought you went in for all sorts of unconventionalities recollect your promise you must be as impulsive as i am  colville staring anxiously about in every direction made for the first time the reflection that most young girls probably conform to the proprieties without in the least knowing why  do you think he asked in desperation that you would be afraid to be left here a moment while i went about in the crowd and tried to find them  not at all she said but she added dont be gone long  oh no he answered pulling off his mask be sure not to move from here on any account  he plunged into the midst of the crowd that buffeted him from side to side as he struck against its masses the squeaking and gibbering masks mocked in their falsetto at his wildeyed naked face thrusting hither and thither among them  i saw your lady wife with another gentleman cried one of them in a subtle misinterpretation of the cause of his distraction  the throng had immensely increased the clowns and harlequins ran shrieking up and down and leaped over one anothers heads  it was useless he went back to imogene with a heartsickening fear that she too might have vanished  but she was still there  you ought to have come sooner she said gaily that red mask has been here again he looked as if he wanted to make love to me this time but he didnt if youd been here you might have asked him where mrs bowen was  colville sat down he had done what he could to mend the matter and the time had come for philosophical submission it was now his duty to keep up miss grahams spirits they were both americans and from the national standpoint he was simply the young girls middleaged bachelor friend there was nothing in the situation for him to beat his breast about  well all that we can do is to wait for them he said  oh yes she answered easily theyll be sure to come back in the course of time  they waited a halfhour talking somewhat at random and still the others did not come but the red mask came again he approached colville and said politely  la signora è partita  the lady gone repeated colville taking this to be part of the red masks joke  la bambina pareva poco lene  the little one not well echoed colville again rising are you joking  the mask made a deep murmur of polite deprecation i am not capable of such a thing in a serious affair perhaps you know me he said taking off his mask and in further sign of good faith he gave the name of a painter sufficiently famous in florence  i beg your pardon and thank you said colville he had no need to speak to imogene her hand was already trembling on his arm  they drove home in silence through the white moonlight of the streets filled everywhere with the gay voices and figures of the carnival  mrs bowen met them at the door of her apartment and received them with a manner that justly distributed the responsibility and penalty for their escapade colville felt that a meaner spirit would have wreaked its displeasure upon the girl alone she made short quiet answers to all his eager inquiries most probably it was some childish indisposition effie had been faint no he need not go for the doctor mr waters had called the doctor who had just gone away there was nothing else that he could do for her she dropped her eyes and in everything but words dismissed him she would not even remain with him till he could decently get himself out of the house she left imogene to receive his adieux feigning that she heard effie calling  imim very sorry faltered the girl that we didnt go back to her at once  yes i was to blame answered the humiliated hero of her carnival dream the clinging regret with which she kept his hand at parting scarcely consoled him for what had happened  i will come round in the morning he said i must know how effie is  yes come       x   colville went to palazzo pinti next day with the feeling that he was defying mrs bowen upon a review of the facts he could not find himself so very much to blame for the occurrences of the night before and he had not been able to prove to his reason that mrs bowen had resented his behaviour she had not made a scene of any sort when he came in with imogene it was natural that she should excuse herself and should wish to be with her sick child she had done really nothing but when a woman has done nothing she fills the soul of the man whose conscience troubles him with an instinctive apprehension there is then no safety his nerves tell him except in bringing the affair whatever it is to an early issuein having it out with her colville subdued the cowardly impulse of his own heart which would have deceived him with the suggestion that mrs bowen might be occupied with effie and it would be better to ask for miss graham he asked for mrs bowen and she came in directly  she smiled in the usual way and gave her hand as she always did but her hand was cold and she looked tired though she said effie was quite herself again and had been asking for him imogene has been telling her about your adventure last night and making her laugh  if it had been mrs bowens purpose to mystify him she could not have done it more thoroughly than by this bold treatment of the affair he bent a puzzled gaze upon her im glad any of you have found it amusing he saidi confess that i couldnt let myself off so lightly in regard to it she did not reply and he continued the fact is i dont think i behaved very well i abused your kindness to miss graham  abused my kindness to miss graham  yes when you allowed her to dance at the veglione i ought to have considered that you were stretching a point i ought to have taken her back to you very soon instead of tempting her to go and walk with me in the corridor  yes said mrs bowen so it was you who proposed it imogene was afraid that she had what exemplary young people you are the way each of you confesses and assumes all the blame would leave the severest chaperone without a word  her gaiety made colville uncomfortable he said gravely what i blame myself most for is that i was not there to be of use to you when effie  oh you mustnt think of that at all mr waters was most efficient my admirer in the red mask was close at hand and between them they got effie out without the slightest disturbance i fancy most people thought it was a carnival joke please dont think of that again  nothing could be politer than all this  and you wont allow me to punish myself for not being there to give you even a moral support  certainly not as i told imogene young people will be young people and i knew how fond you were of dancing  though it pierced him colville could not help admiring the neatness of this thrust i didnt know you were so ironical mrs bowen  ironical not at all  ah i see im not forgiven  im sure i dont know what you mean  imogene and effie came in the child was a little pale and willingly let him take her on his knee and lay her languid head on his shoulder the girl had not aged overnight like himself and mrs bowen she looked as fresh and strong as yesterday  miss graham said colville if a person to whom you had done a deadly wrong insisted that you hadnt done any wrong at all should you consider yourself forgiven  it would depend upon the person said the girl with innocent liveliness recognising the extravagance in his tone  yes he said with an affected pensiveness so very much depends upon the person in such a case  mrs bowen rose excuse me a moment i will be back directly dont get up please she said and prevented him with a quick withdrawal to another room which left upon his sense the impression of elegant grace and a smile and sunny glance but neither had any warmth in it  colville heaved an involuntary sigh do you feel very much used up he asked imogene  not at all she laughed do you  not in the least my veglione hasnt ended yet im still practically at the pergola its easy to keep a thing of that sort up if you dont sleep after you get home  didnt you sleep i expected to lie awake a long time thinking it over but i dropped asleep at once i suppose i was very tired i didnt even dream  you must have slept hard youre pretty apt to dream when youre waking  how do you know  ah ive noticed when youve been talking to me better not its a bad habit it gives you false views of things i used  but you mustnt say you used thats forbidden now remember your promise  my promise what promise  oh if youve forgotten already  i remember but that was last night  no no it was for all time why should dreams be so very misleading i think theres ever so much in dreams the most wonderful thing is the way you make people talk in dreams it isnt strange that you should talk yourself but that other people should say this and that when you arent at all expecting what they say  thats when youre sleeping but when youre waking you make people say just what you want and thats why day dreams are so bad if you make people say what you want they probably dont mean it  dont you think so  half the time do you ever have day dreams he asked effie pressing her cheek against his own  i dont know what they are she murmured with a soft little note of polite regret for her ignorance if possibly it incommoded him  you will by and by he said and then you must look out for them theyre particularly bad in this air i had one of them in florence once that lasted three months  what was it about asked the child  imogene involuntarily bent forward  ah i cant tell you now shes trying to hear us  no no protested the girl with a laugh i was thinking of something else  oh we know her dont we he said to the child with a playful appeal to that passion for the joint possession of a mystery which all children have  we might whisper it she suggested  no better wait for some other time they were sitting near a table where a pencil and some loose leaves of paper lay he pulled his chair a little closer and with the child still upon his knee began to scribble and sketch at random ah theres san miniato he said with a glance from the window must get its outline in youve heard how there came to be a church up there no well it shows the sort of man san miniato really was he was one of the early christians and he gave the poor pagans a great deal of trouble they first threw him to the wild beasts in the amphitheatre but the moment those animals set eyes on him they saw it would be of no use they just lay down and died very well then the pagans determined to see what effect the axe would have upon san miniato but as soon as they struck off his head he picked it up set it back on his shoulders again waded across the arno walked up the hill and when he came to a convenient little oratory up there he knelt down and expired isnt that a pretty good story its like fairies isnt it  yes whispered the child  what nonsense said imogene you made it up  oh did i perhaps i built the church that stands there to commemorate the fact its all in the history of florence not in all histories some of them are too proud to put such stories in but im going to put every one i can find into the history im writing for effie san miniato was beheaded where the church of santa candida stands now and he walked all that distance  did he have to die when he got to the oratory asked the child with gentle regret  it appears so said colville sketching he would have been dead by this time anyway you know  yes she reluctantly admitted  i never quite like those things either effie he said pressing her to him there were people cruelly put to death two or three thousand years ago that i cant help feeling would be alive yet if they had been justly treated there are a good many fairy stories about florence perhaps they used to be true stories the truth seems to die out of stories after a while simply because people stop believing them saint ambrose of milan restored the son of his host to life when he came down here to dedicate the church of san giovanni then there was another saint san zenobi who worked a very pretty miracle after he was dead they were carrying his body from the church of san giovanni to the church of santa reparata and in piazza san giovanni his bier touched a dead elmtree that stood there and the tree instantly sprang into leaf and flower though it was in the middle of the winter a great many people took the leaves home with them and a marble pillar was put up there with a cross and an elmtree carved on it oh the case is very well authenticated  i shall really begin to think you believe such things said imogene perhaps you are a catholic  mrs bowen returned to the room and sat down  theres another fairy story prettier yet said colville while the little girl drew a long deep breath of satisfaction and expectation youve heard of the buondelmonti he asked imogene  oh it seems to me as if id had nothing but the buondelmonti dinned into me since i came to florence she answered in lively despair  ah this happened some centuries before the buondelmonte youve been bored with was born this was giovanni gualberto of the buondelmonti and he was riding along one day in 1003 near the church of san miniato when he met a certain man named ugo who had killed one of his brothers gualberto stopped and drew his sword ugo saw no other chance of escape and he threw himself face downward on the ground with his arms stretched out in the form of the cross gualberto remember jesus christ who died upon the cross praying for his enemies the story says that these words went to gualbertos heart he got down from his horse and in sign of pardon lifted his enemy and kissed and embraced him then they went together into the church and fell on their knees before the figure of christ upon the cross and the figure bowed its head in sign of approval and pleasure in gualbertos noble act of christian piety  beautiful murmured the girl the child only sighed  ah yes its an easy matter to pick up ones head from the ground and set it back on ones shoulders or to bring the dead to life or to make a tree put forth leaves and flowers in midwinter but to melt the heart of a man with forgiveness in the presence of his enemythats a different thing thats no fairy story thats a real miracle and i believe this one happenedits so impossible  oh yes it must have happened said the girl  do you think its so very hard to forgive then asked mrs bowen gravely  oh not for ladies replied colville  she flushed and her eyes shone when she glanced at him  im sorry to put you down he said to the child but i cant take you with me and i must be going  mrs bowen did not ask him to stay to lunch he thought afterward that she might have relented as far as that but for the last little thrust which he would better have spared  effie dear said her mother when the door closed upon colville dont you think youd better lie down a while you look so tired  shall i lie down on the sofa here  no on your bed  well  ill go with you effie said imogene and see that youre nicely tucked in  when she returned alone mrs bowen was sitting where she had left her and seemed not to have moved i think effie will drop off to sleep she said she seems drowsy she sat down and after a pensive moment continued i wonder what makes mr colville seem so gloomy  does he seem gloomy asked mrs bowen unsympathetically  no not gloomy exactly but different from last night i wish people could always be the same he was so gay and full of spirits and now hes so selfabsorbed he thinks youre offended with him mrs bowen  i dont think he was very much troubled about it i only thought he was flighty from want of sleep at your age you dont mind the loss of a night  do you think mr colville seems so very old asked imogene anxiously  mrs bowen appeared not to have heard her she went to the window and looked out when she came back isnt it almost time for you to have a letter from home she asked  why no i had one from mother day before yesterday what made you think so  imogene interrupted mrs bowen with a sudden excitement which she tried to control but which made her lips tremble and break a little from her restraint you know that i am here in the place of your mother to advise you and look after you in every way  why yes mrs bowen cried the girl in surprise  its a position of great responsibility in regard to a young lady i cant have anything to reproach myself with afterward  no  have i always been kind to you and considerate of your rights and your freedom have i ever interfered with you in any way that you think i oughtnt  what an idea youve been loveliness itself mrs bowen  then i want you to listen to me and answer me frankly and not suspect my motives  why how could i do that  never mind cried mrs bowen impatiently almost angrily people cant help their suspicions do you think mr morton cares for you  the girl hung her head  imogene answer me  i dont know answered imogene coldly but if youre troubled about that mrs bowen you neednt be i dont care anything for mr morton  if i thought you were becoming interested in any one it would be my duty to write to your mother and tell her  of course i should expect you to do it  and if i saw you becoming interested in any one in a way that i thought would make you unhappy it would be my duty to warn you  yes  of course i dont mean that any one would knowingly try to make you unhappy  no  men dont go about nowadays trying to break girls hearts but very good men can be thoughtless and selfish  yes i understand that said imogene in a falling accent  i dont wish to prejudice you against any one i should consider it very wrong and wicked besides i dont care to interfere with you to that degree you are old enough to see and judge for yourself  imogene sat silent passing her hand across the front of her dress the clock ticked audibly from the mantel  i will not have it left to me cried mrs bowen it is hard enough at any rate do you think i like to speak to you  no  of course it makes me seem inhospitable and distrustful and detestable  i never thought of accusing you said the girl slowly lifting her eyes  i will never never speak to you of it again said mrs bowen and from this time forth i insist upon your feeling just as free as if i hadnt spoken she trembled upon the verge of a sob from which she repelled herself  imogene sat still with a sort of serious bewildered look  you shall have every proper opportunity of meeting any one you like  oh yes  and i shall be only too glglad to take back everything  imogene sat motionless and silent mrs bowen broke out again with a sort of violence the years teach us something of selfcontrol perhaps but they weaken and unstring the nerves in this opposition of silence to silence the woman of the world was no match for the inexperienced girl  have you nothing to say imogene  i never thought of him in that way at all i dont know what to say yet itconfuses me ii cant imagine it but if you think that he is trying to amuse himself  i never said that  no i know it  he likes to make you talk and to talk with you but he is perfectly idle here andthere is too much difference every way the very good in him makes it the worse i suppose that after talking with him every one else seems insipid  yes  mrs bowen rose and ran suddenly from the room  imogene remained sitting cold and still  no one had been named since they spoke of mr morton       xi   colville had not done what he meant in going to mrs bowens in fact he had done just what he had not meant to do as he distinctly perceived in coming away it was then that in a luminous retrospect he discovered his motive to have been a wish to atone to her for behaviour that must have distressed her or at least to explain it to her she had not let him do this at once an instant willingness to hear and to condone was not in a womans nature she had to make him feel by the infliction of a degree of punishment that she had suffered but before she ended she had made it clear that she was ready to grant him a tacit pardon and he had answered with a silly sarcasm the question that was to have led to peace he could not help seeing that throughout the whole carnival adventure she had yielded her cherished reluctances to please him to show him that she was not stiff or prudish to convince him that she would not be a killjoy through her devotion to conventionalities which she thought he despised he could not help seeing that he had abused her delicate generosity insulted her subtle concessions he strolled along down the arno feeling flat and mean as a man always does after a contest with a woman in which he has got the victory our sex can preserve its selfrespect only through defeat in such a case it gave him no pleasure to remember that the glamour of the night before seemed still to rest on imogene unbroken that indeed was rather an added pain he surprised himself in the midst of his poignant reflections by a yawn clearly the time was past when these ideal troubles could keep him awake and there was after all a sort of brutal consolation in the fact he was fortyone years old and he was sleepy whatever capacity for suffering remained to him he went to his hotel to catch a little nap before lunch when he woke it was dinnertime the mists of slumber still hung about him and the events of the last fortyeight hours showed vast and shapelessly threatening through them  when the drama of the table dhôte reached its climax of roast chestnuts and butter he determined to walk over to san marco and pay a visit to mr waters he found the old minister from haddam east village massachusetts italianate outwardly in almost ludicrous degree he wore a furlined overcoat indoors his feet cased in thick woollen shoes rested on a strip of carpet laid before his table a man who had lived for forty years in the pungent atmosphere of an airtight stove succeeding a quarter of a century of roaring hearth fires contented himself with the spare heat of a scaldino which he held his clasped hands over in the very italian manner the lamp that cast its light on the book open before him was the classic lucerna with three beaks fed with olive oil he looked up at his visitor over his spectacles without recognising him till colville spoke then after their greeting is it snowing heavily he asked  it isnt snowing at all what made you think that  perhaps i was drowsing over my book and dreamed it we become very strange and interesting studies to ourselves as we live along  he took up the metaphysical consideration with the promptness of a man who has no smalltalk and who speaks of the mind and soul as if they were the gossip of the neighbourhood  at times the forty winters that i passed in haddam east village seem like an alien experience and i find myself pitying the life i lived there quite as if it were the life of some one else it seems incredible that men should still inhabit such climates  then youre not homesick for haddam east village  ah for the good and striving souls there yes especially the souls of some women there they used to think that it was i who gave them consolation and spiritual purpose but it was they who really imparted it women soulshow beautiful they sometimes are they seem truly like angelic essences i trust that i shall meet them somewhere some time but it will never be in haddam east village yes i must have been dreaming when you came in i thought that i was by my fire there and all round over the hills and in the streets the snow was deep and falling still how distinctly he said closing his eyes as artists do in looking at a picture i can see the black wavering lines of the walls in the fields sinking into the drifts the snow billowed over the graves by the church where i preached the banks of snow around the houses the white desolation everywhere i ask myself at times if the people are still there yes i feel as blessedly remote from that terrible winter as if i had died away from it and were in the weather of heaven  then you have no reproach for feeblespirited fellowcitizens who abandon their native climate and come to live in italy  the old man drew his fur coat closer about him and shrugged his shoulders in true florentine fashion there may be something to say against those who do so in the heyday of life but i shall not be the one to say it the race must yet revert in its decrepitude as i have in mine to the climates of the south since i have been in italy i have realised what used to occur to me dimly at homethe cruel disproportion between the end gained and the means expended in reclaiming the savage north half the human endeavour half the human suffering would have made the whole south protestant and the whole east christian and our civilisation would now be there no i shall never go back to new england new england new irelandnew canada half the farms in haddam are in the hands of our irish friends and the labour on the rest is half done by french canadians that is all right and well new england must come to me here by way of the great middle west and the pacific coast  colville smiled at the emersonian touch but he said gravely i can never quite reconcile myself to the thought of dying out of my own country  why not it is very unimportant where one dies a moment after your breath is gone you are in exile for everor at home for ever  colville sat musing upon this phase of americanism as he had upon many others at last he broke the silence they had both let fall far away from the topic they had touched  well he asked how did you enjoy the veglione  oh im too old to go to such places for pleasure said the minister simply but it was very interesting and certainly very striking especially when i went back toward daylight after seeing mrs bowen home  did you go back demanded colville in some amaze  oh yes i felt that my experience was incomplete without some knowledge of how the carnival ended at such a place  oh and do you still feel that savonarola was mistaken  there seemed to be rather more boisterousness toward the close and if i might judge the excitement grew a little unwholesome but i really dont feel myself very well qualified to decide my own life has been passed in circumstances so widely different that i am at a certain disadvantage  yes said colville with a smile i daresay the carnival at haddam east village was quite another tiling  the old man smiled responsively i suppose that some of my former parishioners might have been scandalised at my presence at a carnival ball had they known the fact merely in the abstract but in my letters home i shall try to set it before them in an instructive light i should say that the worst thing about such a scene of revelry would be that it took us too much out of our inner quiet but i suppose the same remark might apply to almost any form of social entertainment  yes  but human nature is so constituted that some means of expansion must be provided or a violent explosion takes place the only question is what means are most innocent i have been looking about added the old man quietly at the theatres lately  have you asked colville opening his eyes in suppressed surprise  yes with a view to determining the degree of harmless amusement that may be derived from them its rather a difficult question i should be inclined to say however that i dont think the ballet can ever be instrumental for good  colville could not deny himself the pleasure of saying well not the highest i suppose  no said mr waters in apparent unconsciousness of the irony but i think the church has made a mistake in condemning the theatre in toto it appears to me that it might always have countenanced a certain order of comedy in which the motive and plot are unobjectionable though i dont deny that there are moods when all laughter seems low and unworthy and incompatible with the most advanced state of being and i confess he went on with a dreamy thoughtfulness that i have very great misgivings in regard to tragedy the glare that it throws upon the play of the passionsjealousy in its anguish revenge glutting itself envy eating its heart hopeless lovetheir nakedness is terrible the terror may be salutary it may be very mischievous i am afraid that i have left some of my inquiries till it is too late i seem to have no longer the materials of judgment left in me if i were still a young man like you  am i still a young man interrupted colville sadly  you are young enough to respond to the appeals that sometimes find me silent if i were of your age i should certainly investigate some of these interesting problems  ah but if you become personally interested in the problems its as bad as if you hadnt the materials of judgment left youre prejudiced besides i doubt my youthfulness very much  you are fifty i presume suggested mr waters in a leading way  not very nearonly too near laughed colville im fortyone  you are younger than i supposed but i remember now that at your age i had the same feeling which you intimate it seemed to me then that i had really passed the bound which separates us from the further possibility of youth but ive lived long enough since to know that i was mistaken at forty one has still a great part of youth before himperhaps the richest and sweetest part by that time the turmoil of ideas and sensations is over we see clearly and feel consciously we are in a sort of quiet in which we peacefully enjoy we have enlarged our perspective sufficiently to perceive things in their true proportion and relation we are no longer tormented with the lurking fear of death which darkens and embitters our earlier years we have got into the habit of life we have often been ailing and we have not died then we have time enough behind us to supply us with the materials of reverie and reminiscence the terrible solitude of inexperience is broken we have learned to smile at many things besides the fear of death we ought also to have learned pity and patience yes the old man concluded in cheerful selfcorroboration it is a beautiful age  but it doesnt look so beautiful as it is colville protested people in that rosy prime dont produce the effect of garlanded striplings upon the world at large the women laugh at us they think we are fat old fellows they dont recognise the slender and elegant youth that resides in our unwieldy bulk  you take my meaning a little awry besides i doubt if even the ground you assume is tenable if a woman has lived long enough to be truly young herself she wont find a man at forty either decrepit or grotesque he can even make himself youthful to a girl of thought and imagination  yes colville assented with a certain discomfort  but to be truly young at forty resumed mr waters a man should be already married  yes  i sometimes feel continued the old man that i made a mistake in yielding to a disappointment that i met with early in life and in not permitting myself the chance of retrieval i have missed a beautiful and consoling experience in my devotion to a barren regret  colville said nothing but he experienced a mixed feeling of amusement of repulsion and of curiosity at this  we are put into the world to be of it i am more and more convinced of that we have scarcely a right to separate ourselves from the common lot in any way i justify myself for having lived alone only as a widower might ilost her it was a great while ago  yes said colville after the pause which ensued i agree with you that one has no right to isolate himself to refuse his portion of the common lot but the effects of even a rebuff may last so long that one has no heart to put out his hand a second timefor a second rap over the knuckles oh i know how trivial it is in the retrospect and how what is called a disappointment is something to be humbly grateful for in most cases but for a while it certainly makes you doubtful whether you were ever really intended to share the common lot he was aware of an insincerity in his words he hoped that it might not be perceptible but he did not greatly care  mr waters took no notice of what he had been saying he resumed from another point but i should say that it would be unwise for a man of mature life to seek his happiness with one much younger than himself i dont deny that there are cases in which the disparity of years counts for little or nothing but generally speaking people ought to be as equally mated in age as possible they ought to start with the same advantages of ignorance a young girl can only live her life through a community of feeling an equality of inexperience in the man she gives her heart to if he is tired of things that still delight her the chances of unhappiness are increased  yes thats true answered colville gravely its apt to be a mistake and a wrong  oh not alwaysnot always said the old minister we mustnt look at it in that way quite wrongs are of the will he seemed to lapse into a greater intimacy of feeling with colville have you seen mrs bowen today orah true i think you told me  no said colville have we spoken of her but i have seen her  and was the little one well  very much better  pretty creatures both of them said the minister with as fresh a pleasure in his recognition of the fact as if he had not said nearly the same thing once before youve noticed the very remarkable resemblance between mother and daughter  oh yes  there is a gentleness in mrs bowen which seems to me the last refinement of a gracious spirit suggested mr waters i have never met any lady who reconciled more exquisitely what is charming in society with what is lovely in nature  yes said colville mrs bowen always had that gentle manner i used to know her here as a girl a great while ago  did you i wonder you allowed her to become mrs bowen  this sprightliness of mr waters amused colville greatly at that time i was preoccupied with my great mistake and i had no eyes for mrs bowen  it isnt too late yet said mr waters with open insinuation  a bachelor of forty is always flattered by any suggestion of marriage the suggestion that a beautiful and charming woman would marry him is too much for whatever reserves of modesty and wisdom he may have stored up colville took leave of the old minister in better humour with himself than he had been for fortyeight hours or than he had any very good reason for being now  mr waters came with him to the head of the stairs and held up the lamp for him to see the light fell upon the white locks thinly straggling from beneath his velvet skullcap and he looked like some mediaeval scholar of those who lived and died for learning in florence when letters were a passion there almost as strong as love  the next day colville would have liked to go at once and ask about effie but upon the whole he thought he would not go till after he had been at the reception where he was going in the afternoon it was an artist who was giving the reception he had a number of pictures to show and there was to be tea there are artists and artists this painter was one who had a distinct social importance it was felt to be rather a nice thing to be asked to his reception one was sure at least to meet the nicest people  this reason prevailed with colville so far as it related to mrs bowen whom he felt that he would like to tell he had been there he would speak to her of this person and thatvery respected and recognised social figuresso that she might see he was not the outlaw the bohemian he must sometimes have appeared to her it would not be going too far to say that something like an obscure intention to show himself the next sunday at the english chapel where mrs bowen went was not forming itself in his mind as he went along it began to seem not impossible that she would be at the reception if effies indisposition was no more serious than it appeared yesterday very probably mrs bowen would be there he even believed that he recognised her carriage among those which were drawn up in front of the old palace under the painters studio windows  there were a great number of people of the four nationalities that mostly consort in italy there were english and americans and russians and the sort of italians resulting from the native intermarriages with them here and there were italians of pure blood borderers upon the foreign life through a literary interest or an artistic relation or a matrimonial intention here and there also the large stomach of a german advanced the bounds of the new empire and the new ideal of duty there were no frenchmen one may meet them in more strictly italian assemblages but it is as if the sorrows and uncertainties of france in these times discouraged them from the international society in which they were always an infrequent element it is not of course imaginable that as frenchmen they have doubts of their merits but that they have their misgivings as to the intelligence of others the language that prevailed was englishin fact one heard no otherand the tea which our civilisation carries everywhere with it steamed from the cups in all hands this beverage in fact becomes a formidable factor in the life of a florentine winter one finds it at all houses and more or less mechanically drinks it  i am turning out a terrible tea toper said colville stirring his cup in front of the old lady whom his relations to the ladies at palazzo pinti had interested so much i dont think i drink less than ten cups a day seventy cups a week is a low average for me im really beginning to look down at my boots a little anxiously  mrs amsden laughed she had not been in america for forty years but she liked the american way of talking better than any other oh didnt you hear about inglehart when he was here he was so goodnatured that he used to drink all the tea people offered him and then the young ladies made tea for him in his studio when they went to look at his pictures it almost killed him by the time spring came he trembled so that the brush flew out of his hands when he took it up he had to hurry off to venice to save his life its just as bad at the italian houses theyve learned to like tea  when i was here before they never offered you anything but coffee said colville they took tea for medicine and there was an old joke that i thought i should die of i heard it so often about the italian that said to the english woman when she offered him tea grazie sto bene  oh thats all changed now  yes ive seen the tea and i havent heard the joke  the flavour of colvilles talk apparently encouraged his companion to believe that he would like to make fun of their hosts paintings with her but whether he liked them or whether he was principled against that sort of return for hospitality he chose to reply seriously to some ironical lures she threw out  oh if youre going to be good she exclaimed i shall have nothing more to say to you here comes mr thurston i can make him abuse the pictures there you had better go away to a young lady i see alone over yonder though i dont know what you will do with one alone she laughed and shook her head in a way that had once been arch and lively but that was now puckery and infirmit is affecting to see these things in womenand welcomed the old gentleman who came up and superseded colville  the latter turned with his cup still in his hand and wandered about through the company hoping he might see mrs bowen among the groups peering at the pictures or solidly blocking the view in front of them he did not find her but he found imogene graham standing somewhat apart near a window he saw her face light up at sight of him and then darken again as he approached  isnt this rather an unnatural state of things he asked when he had come up i ought to be obliged to fight my way to you through successive phalanxes of young men crowding round with cups of tea outstretched in their imploring hands have you had some tea  thank you no i dont wish any said the young girl so coldly that he could not help noticing though commonly he was man enough to notice very few things  how is effie today he asked quickly  oh quite well said imogene  i dont see mrs bowen he ventured further  no answered the girl still very lifelessly i came with mrs fleming she looked about the room as if not to look at him  he now perceived a distinct intention to snub him he smiled have you seen the pictures there are two or three really lovely ones  mrs fleming will be here in a moment i suppose said imogene evasively but not with all her first coldness  let us steal a march on her said colville briskly when she comes you can tell her that i showed you the pictures  i dont know faltered the girl  perhaps it isnt necessary you should he suggested  she glanced at him with questioning trepidation  the respective duties of chaperone and protégée are rather undefined where the chaperone isnt there to command the protégée isnt there to obey i suppose youd know if you were at home  oh yes  let me imagine myself at a loan exhibition in buffalo ah that appeal is irresistible youll come i see  she hesitated she looked at the nearest picture then followed him to another he now did what he had refused to do for the old lady who tempted him to it he made fun of the pictures a little but so amiably and with so much justice to their good points that the painter himself would not have minded his jesting from time to time he made imogene smile but in her eyes lurked a look of uneasiness and her manner expressed a struggle against his will which might have had its pathos for him in different circumstances but now it only incited him to make her forget herself more and more he treated her as one does a child that is out of sortscoaxingly ironically  when they had made the round of the rooms mrs fleming was not at the window where she had left imogene the girl detected the top of her bonnet still in the next room  the chaperone is never there when you come back with the protégée said colville it seems to be the nature of the chaperone  imogene turned very grave i think i ought to go to her she murmured  oh no she ought to come to you i stand out for protégées rights  i suppose she will come directly  she sees me with you she knows you are safe  oh of course said the girl after a constraint which she marked by rather a long silence she added how strange a roomful of talking sounds doesnt it just like a great caldron boiling up and bubbling over wouldnt you like to know what theyre all saying  oh its quite bad enough to see them replied colville frivolously  i think a company of gentlemen with their hats off look very queer dont you she asked after another interval  well really said colville laughing i dont know that the spectacle ever suggested any metaphysical speculations to me i rather think they look queerer with their hats on  oh yes  though there is not very much to choose were a queerlooking set anyway  he got himself another cup of tea and coming back to her allowed her to make the efforts to keep up the conversation and was not without a malicious pleasure in her struggles they interested him as social exercises which however abrupt and undexterous now were destined with time and practice to become the finesse of a woman of society and to be accepted even while they were still abrupt and undexterous as touches of character he had broken up that coldness with which she had met him at first and now he let her adjust the fragments as she could to the new situation he wore that air of a gentleman who has been talking a long time to a lady and who will not dispute her possession with a newcomer  but no one came though as he cast his eyes carelessly over the company he found that it had been increased by the accession of eight or ten young fellows with a refreshing light of originality in their faces and little touches of difference from the other men in their dress  oh there are the inglehart boys cried the girl with a flash of excitement  there was a sensation of interest and friendliness in the company as these young fellows after their moment of social intimidation began to gather round the pictures and to fling their praise and blame about and talk the delightful shop of the studio  the sight of their fresh young faces the sound of their voices struck a pang of regret that was almost envy to colvilles heart  imogene followed them with eager eyes oh she sighed shouldnt you like to be an artist  i should very much  oh i beg your pardon i forgot i knew you were an architect  i should say i used to be if you hadnt objected to my perfects and preterits  what came next seemed almost an accident  i didnt suppose you cared for my objections so long as i amused you she suddenly glanced at him as if terrified at her own words  have you been trying to amuse me he asked  oh no i thought  oh then said colville sharply you meant that i was amusing myself with you she glanced at him in terror of his divination but could not protest has any one told you that he pursued with sudden angry suspicion  no no one began imogene she glanced about her frightened they stood quite alone where they were the people had mostly wandered off into the other rooms oh donti didnt meani didnt intend to say anything  but you have said somethingsomething that surprises me from you and hurts me i wish to know whether you say it from yourself  i dont knowyes that is notoh i wish mrs fleming  she looked as if another word of pursuit would put it beyond her power to control herself  let me take you to mrs fleming said colville with freezing hauteur and led the way where the top of mrs flemings bonnet still showed itself he took leave at once and hastily parting with his host found himself in the street whirled in many emotions the girl had not said that from herself but it was from some woman he knew that by the directness of the phrase and its excess for he had noticed that women who liked to beat about the bush in small matters have a prodigious straightforwardness in more vital affairs and will even call grey black in order clearly to establish the presence of the black in that colour he could hardly keep himself from going to palazzo pinti  but he contrived to go to his hotel instead where he ate a moody dinner and then after an hours solitary bitterness in his room went out and passed the evening at the theatre the play was one of those fleering comedies which render contemptible for the time all honest and earnest intention and which surely are a whiff from the bottomless pit itself it made him laugh at the serious strain of selfquestion that had mingled with his resentment it made him laugh even at his resentment and with its humour in his thoughts sent him off to sleep in a sottish acceptance of whatever was trivial in himself as the only thing that was real and lasting  he slept late and when paolo brought up his breakfast he brought with it a letter which he said had been left with the porter an hour before a faint appealing perfume of violet exhaled from the note and mingled with the steaming odours of the coffee and boiled milk when colville after a glance at the unfamiliar handwriting of the superscription broke the seal  dear mr colvillei dont know what you will think of my writing to you but perhaps you cant think worse of me than you do already and anything will be better than the misery that i am in i have not been asleep all night i hate myself for telling you but i do want you to understand how i have felt i would give worlds if i could take back the words that you say wounded you i didnt mean to wound you nobody is to blame for them but me nobody ever breathed a word about you that was meant in unkindness  i am not ashamed of writing this whatever you think and i will sign my name in full imogene graham   colville had commonly a good appetite for his breakfast but now he let his coffee stand long untasted there were several things about this note that touched himthe childlike simplicity and directness the generous courage even the imperfection and crudity of the literature however he saw it afterward he saw it then in its true intention he respected that intention through all the sophistications in which life had wrapped him it awed him a little he realised that if he had been younger he would have gone to imogene herself with her letter he felt for the moment a rush of the emotion which he would once not have stopped to examine which he would not have been capable of examining but now his duty was clear he must go to mrs bowen in the noblest human purpose there is always some admixture however slight of less noble motive and colville was not without the willingness to see whatever embarrassment she might feel when he showed her the letter and to invoke her finest tact to aid him in reassuring the child  she was alone in her drawingroom and she told him in response to his inquiry for their health that imogene and effie had gone out to drive she looked so pretty in the quiet house dress in which she rose from the sofa and stood letting him come the whole way to greet her that he did not think of any other look in her but afterward he remembered an evidence of inner tumult in her brightened eyes  he said smiling im so glad to see you alone and this brought still another look into her face which also he afterward remembered she did not reply but made a sound in her throat like a bird when it stirs itself for flight or song it was a strange indefinite little note in which colville thought he detected trepidation at the time and recalled for the sort of expectation suggested in it she stood waiting for him to go on  i have come to get you to help me out of trouble  yes said mrs bowen with a vague smile i always supposed you would be able to help yourself out of trouble or perhaps wouldnt mind it if you were in it  oh yes i mind it very much returned colville refusing her banter if it were banter especially this sort of trouble which involves some one else in the discomfort he went on abruptly i have been held up to a young lady as a person who was amusing himself with her and i was so absurd as to be angry when she told me and demanded the name of my friend whoever it was my behaviour seems to have given the young lady a bad night and this morning she writes to tell me so and to take all the blame on herself and to assure me that no harm was meant me by any one of course i dont want her to be distressed about it perhaps you can guess who has been writing to me  colville said all this looking down in a fashion he had when he looked up he saw a severity in mrs bowens pretty face such as he had not seen there before  i didnt know she had been writing to you but i know that you are talking of imogene she told me what she had said to you yesterday and i blamed her for it but im not sure that it wasnt best  oh indeed said colville perhaps you can tell me who put the idea into her head  yes i did  a dead silence ensued in which the fragments of the situation broken by these words revolved before colvilles thought with kaleidoscopic variety and he passed through all the phases of anger resentment wounded selflove and accusing shame  at last i suppose you had your reasons he said simply  i am in her mothers place here she replied tightening the grip of one little hand upon another where she held them laid against the side of her waist  yes i know that said colville but what reason had you to warn her against me as a person who was amusing himself with her i dont like the phrase but she seems to have got it from you i use it at third hand  i dont like the phrase either i didnt invent it  you used it  no it wasnt i who used it i should have been glad to use another if i could said mrs bowen with perfect steadiness  then you mean to say that you believe ive been trifling with the feelings of this child  i mean to say nothing you are very much older and she is a romantic girl very extravagant you have tried to make her like you  i certainly have i have tried to make effie bowen like me too  mrs bowen passed this over in serenity that he felt was not far from contempt  he gave a laugh that did not express enjoyment  you have no right to laugh she cried losing herself a little and so making her first gain upon him  it appears not perhaps you will tell me what i am to do about this letter  that is for you to decide she recovered herself and lost ground with him in proportion  i thought perhaps that since you were able to judge my motives so clearly you might be able to advise me  i dont judge your motives mrs bowen began she added suddenly as if by an afterthought i dont think you had any  im obliged to you  but you are as much to blame as if you had  and perhaps im as much to blame as if i had really wronged somebody  yes  its rather paradoxical you dont wish me to see her any more  i havent any wish about it you must not say that i have said mrs bowen with dignity  colville smiled may i ask if you have  not for myself  you put me on very short allowance of conjecture  i will not let you trifle with the matter she cried you have made me speak when a word a look ought to have been enough oh i didnt think you had the miserable vanity to wish it  colville stood thinking a long time and she waiting i see that everything is at an end i am going away from florence goodbye mrs bowen he approached her holding out his hand but if he expected to be rewarded for this nothing of the kind happened she shrank swiftly back  no no you shall not touch me  he paused a moment gazing keenly at her face in which whatever other feeling showed there was certainly no fear of him then with a slight bow he left the room  mrs bowen ran from it by another door and shut herself into her own room when she returned to the salotto imogene and effie were just coming in the child went to lay aside her hat and sacque the girl after a glance at mrs bowens face lingered inquiringly  mr colville came here with your letter imogene  yes said imogene faintly do you think i oughtnt to have written it  oh it makes no difference now he is going away from florence  yes breathed the girl  i spoke openly with him  yes  i didnt spare him i made him think i hated and despised him  imogene was silent then she said i know that whatever you have done you have acted for the best  yes i have a right that you should say thati have a right that you should always say it i think he has behaved very foolishly but i dont blame him  no i was to blame  i dont know that he was to blame and i wont let you think he was  oh he is the best man in the world  he gave up at once he didnt try to defend himself its nothing for you to lose a friend at your age but at mine  i know it mrs bowen  and i wouldnt even shake hands with him when he was going i  oh i dont see how you could be so hard cried imogene she put up her hands to her face and broke into tears mrs bowen watched her dry eyed with her lips parted and an intensity of question in her face  imogene she said at last i wish you to promise me one thing  yes  not to write to mr colville again  no no indeed i wont mrs bowen the girl came up to kiss her mrs bowen turned her cheek  imogene was going from the room when mrs bowen spoke again but i wish you to promise me this only because you dont feel sure of yourself about him if you care for himif you think you care for himthen i leave you perfectly free  the girl looked up scared no no id rather you wouldnt leave me freeyou mustnt i shouldnt know what to do  very well then said mrs bowen  they both waited a moment as if each were staying for the other to speak then imogene asked is hegoing soon  i dont know said mrs bowen why should he want to delay he had better go at once and i hope he will go homeas far from florence as he can i should think he would hate the place  yes said the girl with a quivering sigh it must be hateful to him she paused and then she rushed on with bitter selfreproach and ii have helped to make it so o mrs bowen perhaps its i who have been trifling with him trying to make him believeno not trying to do that but letting him see that i sympathisedoh do you think i have  you know what you have been doing imogene said mrs bowen with the hardness it surprises men to know women use with each other they seem such tender creatures in the abstract you have no need to ask me  no no  as you say i warned you from the first  oh yes you did  i couldnt do more than hint it was too much to expect  oh yes yes  and if you couldnt take my hints i was helpless  yes i see it  i was only afraid of saying too much and all through that miserable veglione business i was trying to please you and him because i was afraid i had said too muchgone too far i wanted to show you that i disdained to be suspicious that i was ashamed to suppose that a girl of your age could care for the admiration of a man of his  oh i didnt care for his admiration i admired himand pitied him  mrs bowen apparently would not be kept now from saying all that had been rankling in her breast i didnt approve of going to the veglione a great many people would be shocked if they knew i went i wouldnt at all like to have it known but i was not going to have him thinking that i was severe with you and wanted to deny you any really harmless pleasure  oh who could think that youre only too good to me you see said the girl what a return i have made for your trust i knew you didnt want to go to the veglione if i hadnt been the most selfish girl in the world i wouldnt have let you but i did i forced you to go and then after we got there i seized every advantage and abused your kindness till i wonder i didnt sink through the floor yes i ought to have refused to danceif id had a spark of generosity or gratitude i would have done it and i ought to have come straight back to you the instant the waltz was done and now see what has come of it ive made you think he was trifling with me and ive made him think that im a false and hollowhearted thing  you know best what you have done imogene said mrs bowen with a smiling tearfulness that was somehow very bitter she rose from the sofa as if to indicate that there was no more to be said and imogene with a fresh burst of grief rushed away to her own room  she dropped on her knees beside her bed and stretched out her arms upon it an image of that desolation of soul which when we are young seems limitless but which in later life we know has comparatively narrow bounds beyond the clouds that rest so blackly around us       xii   in his room colville was devouring as best he might the chagrin with which he had come away from palazzo pinti while he packed his trunk for departure now that the thing was over the worst was past again he observed that his emotions had no longer the continuity that the emotions of his youth possessed as he remembered a painful or pleasant impression used to last indefinitely but here he was with this humiliating affair hot in his mind shrugging his shoulders with a sense of relief almost a sense of escape does the soul really wear out with the body the question flitted across his mind as he took down a pair of trousers and noticed that they were considerably frayed about the feet he determined to give them to paolo and this reminded him to ring for paolo and send word to the office that he was going to take the evening train for rome  he went on packing and putting away with the different garments the unpleasant thoughts that he knew he should be sure to unpack with them in rome but they would then have less poignancy  for the present he was doing the best he could and he was not making any sort of pretences when his trunk was locked he kindled himself a fire and sat down before it to think of imogene he began with her but presently it seemed to be mrs bowen that he was thinking of then he knew he was dropping off to sleep by the manner in which their two ideas mixed the fatigues and excitements of the week had been great but he would not give way it was too disgraceful  some one rapped at his door he called out avanti and he would have been less surprised to see either of those ladies than paolo with the account he had ordered to be made out it was a long pendulous minutely itemed affair such as the travellers recklessness in candles and firewood comes to in the books of the continental landlord and it almost swept the floor when its volume was unrolled but it was not the sumtotal that dismayed colville when he glanced at the final figure that indeed was not so very great with all the items it was the conviction suddenly flashing upon him that he had not money enough by him to pay it his watch held close to the fire told him that it was five oclock the banks had been closed an hour and this was saturday afternoon  the squalid accident had all the effect of intention as he viewed it from without himself and considered that the money ought to have been the first thing in his thoughts after he determined to go away he must get the money somehow and be off to rome by the seven oclock train a whimsical suggestion which was so good a bit of irony that it made him smile flashed across him he might borrow it of mrs bowen she was in fact the only person in florence with whom he was at all on borrowing terms and a sad sense of the sweetness of her lost friendship followed upon the antic notion no for once he could not go to mrs bowen he recollected now the many pleasant talks they had had together confidential in virtue of their old acquaintance and harmlessly intimate in many things he recalled how when he was feeling dull from the florentine air she had told him to take a little quinine and he had found immediate advantage in it these memories did strike him as grotesque or ludicrous he only felt their pathos he was ashamed even to seem in anywise recreant further if she should ever hear that he had lingered for thirtysix hours in florence after he had told her he was going away what could she think but that he had repented his decision he determined to go down to the office of the hotel and see if he could not make some arrangement with the landlord it would be extremely distasteful but his ample letter of credit would be at least a voucher of his final ability to pay as a desperate resort he could go and try to get the money of mr waters  he put on his coat and hat and opened the door to some one who was just in act to knock at it and whom he struck against in the obscurity  i beg your pardon said the visitor  mr waters is it possible cried colville feeling something fateful in the chance i was just going to see you  im fortunate in meeting you then shall we go to my room he asked at a hesitation in colvilles manner  no no said the latter come in here he led the way back into his room and struck a match to light the candles on his chimney their dim rays fell upon the disorder his packing had left you must excuse the look of things he said the fact is im just going away im going to rome at seven oclock  isnt this rather sudden asked the minister with less excitement than the fact might perhaps have been expected to create in a friend i thought you intended to pass the winter in florence  yes i didsit down pleasebut i find myself obliged to cut my stay short wont you take off your coat he asked taking off his own  thank you ive formed the habit of keeping it on indoors said mr waters and i oughtnt to stay long if youre to be off so soon  colville gave a very uncomfortable laugh why the fact is im not off so very soon unless you help me  ah returned the old gentleman with polite interest  yes i find myself in the absurd position of a man who has reckoned without his host i have made all my plans for going and have had my hotel bill sent to me in pursuance of that idea and now i discover that i not only havent money enough to pay it and get to rome but i havent much more than half enough to pay it i have credit galore he said trying to give the situation a touch of liveliness but the bank is shut  mr waters listened to the statement with a silence concerning which colville was obliged to form his conjectures that is unfortunate he said sympathetically but not encouragingly  colville pushed on desperately it is unless you can help me mr waters i want you to lend me fifty dollars for as many hours  mr waters shook his head with a compassionate smile i havent fifty francs in cash you are welcome to what there is im very forgetful about money matters and havent been to the bankers  oh dont excuse yourself to me unless you wish to embitter my shame im obliged to you for offering to share your destitution with me i must try to run my face with the landlord said colville  oh no said mr waters gently is there such haste as all that  yes i must go at once  i dont like to have you apply to a stranger said the old man with fatherly kindness cant you remain over till monday i had a little excursion to propose  no i cant possibly stay i must go tonight cried colville  the minister rose then i really mustnt detain you i suppose goodbye he offered his hand colville took it but could not let it go at once i would like extremely to tell you why im leaving florence in such haste but i dont see what good it would do for i dont want you to persuade me to stay  the old gentleman looked at him with friendly interest  the fact is colville proceeded as if he had been encouraged to do so i have had the misfortuneyes im afraid ive had the faultto make myself very displeasing to mrs bowen and in such a way that the very least i can do is to take myself off as far and as soon as i conveniently can  yes said mr waters with the cheerful note of incredulity in his voice with which one is apt to respond to others confession of extremity is it so bad as that ive just seen mrs bowen and she told me you were going  oh said colville with disagreeable sensation perhaps she told you why i was going  no answered mr waters she didnt do that colville imagined a consciousness in him which perhaps did not exist she didnt allude to the subject further than to state the fact when i mentioned that i was coming to see you  colville had dropped his hand she was very forbearing he said with bitterness that might well have been incomprehensible to mr waters upon any theory but one  perhaps he suggested you are precipitate perhaps you have mistaken perhaps you have been hasty these things are often the result of impulse in women i have often wondered how they could make up their minds i believe they certainly ought to be allowed to change them at least once  colville turned very red what in the world do you mean do you imagine that i have been offering myself to mrs bowen  wasnt it that which you wished towhich you said you would like to tell me  colville was suddenly silent on the verge of a selfderisive laugh when he spoke he said gently no it wasnt that i never thought of offering myself to her we have always been very good friends but now im afraid we cant be friends any moreat least we cant be acquaintances  oh exclaimed mr waters he waited a while as if for colville to say more but the latter remained silent and the old man gave his hand again in farewell i must really be going i hope you wont think me intrusive in my mistaken conjecture  oh no  it was what i supposed you had been telling me  i understand you mustnt be troubled said colville though he had to own to himself that it seemed superfluous to make this request of mr waters who was taking the affair with all the serenity of age concerning matters of sentiment i wish you were going to rome with me he added to disembarrass the moment of parting  thank you but i shall not go to rome for some years shall you come back on your way in the spring  no i shall not come to florence again said colville sadly  ah im sorry goodbye my dear young friend its been a great pleasure to know you colville walked down to the door of the hotel with his visitor and parted with him there as he turned back he met the landlord who asked him if he would have the omnibus for the station the landlord bowed smilingly after his kind and rubbed his hands he said he hoped colville was pleased with his hotel and ran to his desk in the little office to get some cards for him so that he might recommend it accurately to american families  colville looked absently at the cards the fact is he said to the little bowing smiling man i dont know but i shall be obliged to postpone my going till monday he smiled too trying to give the fact a jocose effect and added i find myself out of money and ive no means of paying your bill till i can see my bankers  after all his heroic intention this was as near as he could come to asking the landlord to let him send the money from rome  the little man set his head on one side  oh well occupy the room until monday then he cried hospitably it is quite at your disposition you will not want the omnibus  no i shall not want the omnibus said colville with a laugh doubtless not perfectly intelligible to the landlord who respectfully joined him in it  he did not mean to stop that night without writing to mrs bowen and assuring her that though an accident had kept him in florence till monday she need not be afraid of seeing him again but he could not go back to his room yet he wandered about the town trying to pick himself up from the ruin into which he had fallen again and wondering with a sort of alien compassion what was to become of his aimless empty existence as he passed through the piazza san marco he had half a mind to pick a pebble from the gardened margin of the fountain there and toss it against the rev mr waterss window and when he put his skullcap out to ask that optimistic agnostic what a man had best do with a life that had ceased to interest him but for the time being he got rid of himself as he best could by going to the opera they professed to give rigoletto but it was all mrs bowen and imogene graham to colville  it was so late when he got back to his hotel that the outer gate was shut and he had to wake up the poor little porter as on that night when he returned from madame uccellis the porter was again equal to his duty and contrived to light a new candle to show him the way to his room the repetition almost mechanical of this small chicane made colville smile and this apparently encouraged the porter to ask as if he supposed him to have been in society somewhere  you have amused yourself this evening  oh very much  i am glad there is a letter for you  a letter where  i sent it to your room it came just before midnight       xiii   mrs bowen sat before the hearth in her salon with her hands fallen in her lap at thirtyeight the emotions engrave themselves more deeply in the face than they do in our first youth or than they will when we have really aged and the pretty woman looked haggard  imogene came in wearing a long blue robe flung on as if with desperate haste her thick hair fell crazily out of a careless knot down her back i couldnt sleep she said with quivering lips at the sight of which mrs bowens involuntary smile hardened isnt it eleven yet she added with a glance at the clock it seems years since i went to bed  its been a long day mrs bowen admitted she did not ask imogene why she could not sleep perhaps because she knew already and was too honest to affect ignorance  the girl dropped into a chair opposite her and began to pull her fingers through the long tangle of her hair while she drew her breath in sighs that broke at times on her lips some tears fell down her cheeks unheeded mrs bowen she said at length i should like to know what right we have to drive any one from florence i should think people would call it rather a highhanded proceeding if it were known  mrs bowen met this feebleness promptly it isnt likely to be known but we are not driving mr colville away  he is going  yes he said he would go  dont you believe he will go  i believe he will do what he says  he has been very kind to us all he has been as good  no one feels that more than i said mrs bowen with a slight tremor in her voice she faltered a moment i cant let you say those things to me imogene  no i know its wrong i didnt know what i was saying oh i wish i could tell what i ought to do i wish i could make up my mind oh i cant let him goso ii dont know what to think any more once it was clear but now im not sure no im not sure  not sure about what  i think i am the one to go away if any one  you know you cant go away said mrs bowen with weary patience  no of course not well i shall never see any one like him  mrs bowen made a start in her chair as if she had no longer the power to remain quiet but only placed herself a little more rigidly in it  no the girl went on as if uttering a hopeless reverie he made every moment interesting he was always thinking of ushe never thought of himself he did as much for effie as for any one he tried just as hard to make himself interesting to her he was unselfish i have seen him at places being kind to the stupidest people you never caught him choosing out the stylish or attractive ones or trying to shine at anybodys expense oh hes a true gentlemani shall always say it how delicate he was never catching you up or if you said a foolish thing trying to turn it against you no never never never oh dear and now what can he think of me oh how frivolous and fickle and selfish he must think me  imogene mrs bowen cried out but quelled herself again  yes pursued the girl in the same dreary monotone he thinks i couldnt appreciate him because he was old he thinks that i cared for his not being handsome perhapsperhaps she began to catch her breath in the effort to keep back the sobs that were coming oh i cant bear it i would rather die than let him think itsuch a thing as that she bent her head aside and cried upon the two hands with which she clutched the top of her chair  mrs bowen sat looking at her distractedly from time to time she seemed to silence a word upon her lips and in fact she did not speak  imogene lifted her head at last and softly dried her eyes then as she pushed her handkerchief back into the pocket of her robe what sort of looking girl was that other one  that other one  yes you know what i mean the one who behaved so badly to him before  imogene said mrs bowen severely this is nonsense and i cant let you go on so i might pretend not to know what you mean but i wont do that and i tell you that there is no sort of likenessof comparison  no no wailed the girl there is none i feel that she had nothing to warn herhe hadnt suffered then he was young he was able to bear ityou said it yourself mrs bowen but nownow what will he do he could make fun of that and not hate her so much because she didnt know how much harm she was doing but i did and what can he think of me  mrs bowen looked across the barrier between them that kept her from taking imogene into her arms and laughing and kissing away her craze with cold dislike and only said you know whether youve really anything to accuse yourself of imogene i cant and wont consider mr colville in the matter i didnt consider him in what i said today and i tell you again that i will not interfere with you in the slightest degree beyond appearances and the responsibility i feel to your mother and its for you to know your own mind you are old enough i will do what you say its for you to be sure that you wish what you say  yes said imogene huskily and she let an interval that was long to them both elapse before she said anything more have i always done what you thought best mrs bowen  yes i have never complained of you  then why cant you tell me now what you think best  because there is nothing to be done it is all over  but if it were not would you tell me  no  why  because icouldnt  then i take back my promise not to write to mr colville i am going to ask him to stay  have you made up your mind to that imogene asked mrs bowen showing no sign of excitement except to take a faster hold of her own wrists with the slim hands in which she had caught them  yes  you know the position it places you in  what position  has he offered himself to you  no the girls face blazed  then after whats passed this is the same as offering yourself to him  imogene turned white i must write to him unless you forbid me  certainly i shall not forbid you mrs bowen rose and went to her writingdesk but if you have fully made up your mind to this step and are ready for the consequences whatever they are she stopped before sitting down and looked back over her shoulder at imogene  yes said the girl who had also risen  then i will write to mr colville for you and render the proceeding as little objectionable as possible  imogene made no reply she stood motionless while mrs bowen wrote  is this what you wished asked the latter offering the sheet  dear mr colvillei have reasons for wishing to recall my consent to your going away will you not come and lunch with us tomorrow and try to forget everything that has passed during a few days  yours very sincerely  evalina bowen  yes that will do gasped imogene  mrs bowen rang the bell for the porter and stood with her back to the girl waiting for him at the salon door he came after a delay that sufficiently intimated the lateness of the hour this letter must go at once to the hotel datene said mrs bowen peremptorily  you shall be served said the porter with fortitude  as mrs bowen turned imogene ran toward her with clasped hands oh how mercifulhow good  mrs bowen shrank back dont touch me imogene please  it was her letter which colville found on his table and read by the struggling light of his newly acquired candle then he sat down and replied to it  dear mrs boweni know that you mean some sort of kindness by me and i hope you will not think me prompted by any poor resentment in declining tomorrows lunch i am satisfied that it is best for me to go and i am ashamed not to be gone already but a ridiculous accident has kept me and when i came in and found your note i was just going to write and ask your patience with my presence in florence till monday morning  yours sincerely theodore colville  he took his note down to the porter who had lain down again in his little booth but sprang up with a cheerful request to be commanded colville consulted him upon the propriety of sending the note to palazzo pinti at once and the porter with his head laid in deprecation upon one of his lifted shoulders owned that it was perhaps the very least little bit in the world late  send it the first thing in the morning then said colville  mrs bowen received it by the servant who brought her coffee to the room and she sent it without any word to imogene the girl came instantly back with it she was fully dressed as if she had been up a long time and she wore a very plain dull dress in which one of her own sex might have read the expression of a potential selfdevotion  its just as i wish it mrs bowen she said in a low key of impassioned resolution now my conscience is at rest and you have done this for me mrs bowen she stood timidly with the door in her hand watching mrs bowens slight smile then as if at some sign in it she flew to the bed and kissed her and so fled out of the room again  colville slept late and awoke with a vague sense of selfreproach which faded afterward to such poor satisfaction as comes to us from the consciousness of having made the best of a bad business some pangs of softer regret mixed with this at first he felt a stupid obligation to keep indoors and he really did not go out till after lunch the sunshine had looked cold from his window and with the bright fire which he found necessary in his room he fancied a bitterness in the gusts that caught up the dust in the piazza and blew it against the line of cabs on the other side but when he got out into the weather he found the breeze mild and the sun warm the streets were thronged with people and at all the corners there were groups of cloaked and overcoated talkers soaking themselves full of the sunshine the air throbbed as always with the sound of bells but it was a mellower and opener sound than before and looking at the purple bulk of one of those hills which seem to rest like clouds at the end of each avenue in florence colville saw that it was clear of snow he was going up through via cavour to find mr waters and propose a walk but he met him before he had got halfway to san marco  the old man was at a momentary standstill looking up at the riccardi palace and he received colville with apparent forgetfulness of anything odd in his being still in florence upon the whole he said without preliminary of any sort as colville turned and joined him in walking on i dont know any homicide that more distinctly proves the futility of assassination as a political measure than that over yonder he nodded his head sidewise toward the palace as he shuffled actively along at colvilles elbow  you might say that the moment when lorenzino killed alessandro was the most auspicious for a deed of that kind the medici had only recently been restored alessandro was the first ruler in florence who had worn a title no more reckless brutal and insolent tyrant ever lived and his right even such as the medici might have to play the despot was involved in the doubt of his origin the heroism of the great siege ought still to have survived in the people who withstood the forces of the whole german empire for fifteen months it seems as if the taking off of that single wretch should have ended the whole medicean domination but there was not a voice raised to second the homicides appeal to the old love of liberty in florence the medici party were able to impose a boy of eighteen upon the most fiery democracy that ever existed and to hunt down and destroy alessandros murderer at their leisure no added the old man thoughtfully i think that the friends of progress must abandon assassination as invariably useless the trouble was not that alessandro was alive but that florence was dead assassination always comes too early or too late in any popular movement it may be said mr waters with a carefulness to do justice to assassination which made colville smile that the modern scientific spirits may be able to evolve something useful from the principle but considering the enormous abuses and perversions to which it is liable i am very doubtful of itvery doubtful  colville laughed i like your way of bringing a fresh mind to all these questions in history and morals whether they are conventionally settled or not dont you think the modern scientific spirit could evolve something useful out of the old classic idea of suicide  perhaps said mr waters i havent yet thought it over the worst thing about suicideand this must always rank it below political assassinationis that its interest is purely personal no man ever kills himself for the good of others  thats certainly against it we oughtnt to countenance such an abominably selfish practice but you cant bring that charge against euthanasy what have you to say of that  i have heard one of the most benevolent and tenderhearted men i ever knew defend it in cases of hopeless suffering but i dont know that i should be prepared to take his ground there appears to be something so sacred about human life that we must respect it even in spite of the prayers of the sufferer who asks us to end his irremediable misery  well said colville i suspect we must at least class murder with the ballet as a means of good one might say there was still some virtue in the primal eldest curse against bloodshed  oh i dont by any means deny those things said the old man with the air of wishing to be scrupulously just which way are you walking  your way if you will let me replied colville i was going to your house to ask you to take a walk with me  ah thats good i was reading of the great siege last night and i thought of taking a look at michelangelos bastions let us go together if you dont think youll find it too fatiguing  i shall be ashamed to complain if i do  and you didnt go to rome after all said mr waters  no i couldnt face the landlord with a petition so preposterous as mine i told him that i found i had no money to pay his bill till i had seen my banker and as he didnt propose that i should send him the amount back from rome i stayed landlords have their limitations they are not imaginative as a class  well a day more will make no great difference to you i suppose said the old man and a day less would have been a loss to me i shall miss you  shall you indeed asked colville with a grateful stir of the heart its very nice of you to say that  oh no i meet few people who are willing to look at life objectively with me and i have fancied some such willingness in you what i chiefly miss over here is a philosophic lift in the human mind but probably that is because my opportunities of meeting the best minds are few and my means of conversing with them are small if i had not the whole past with me i should feel lonely at times  and is the past such good company always  yes in a sense it is the past is humanity set free from circumstance and history studied where it was once life is the past rehumanised  as if he found this rarefied air too thin for his lungs colville made some ineffectual gasps at response and the old man continued what i mean is that i meet here the characters i read of and commune with them before their errors were committed before they had condemned themselves to failure while they were still wise and sane and still active and vital forces  did they all fail i thought some of the bad fellows had a pretty fair worldly success  the blossom of decay  oh what black pessimism  not at all men fail but man succeeds i dont know what it all means or any part of it but i have had moods in which it seemed as if the whole secret of the mystery were about to flash upon me walking along in the full sun in the midst of men or sometimes in the solitude of midnight poring over a book and thinking of quite other things i have felt that i had almost surprised it  but never quite  oh it isnt too late yet  i hope you wont have your revelation before i get away from florence or i shall see them burning you here like the great frate  they had been walking down the via calzioli from the duomo and now they came out into the piazza della signoria suddenly as one always seems to do upon the rise of the old palace and the leap of its tower into the blue air the history of all florence is there with memories of every great time in bronze or marble but the supreme presence is the martyr who hangs for ever from the gibbet over the quenchless fire in the midst  ah they had to kill him sighed the old man it has always been so with the benefactors they have always meant mankind more good than any one generation can bear and it must turn upon them and destroy them  how will it be with you then when you have read us the riddle of the painful earth  that will be so simple that every one will accept it willingly and gladly and wonder that no one happened to think of it before and perhaps the world is now grown old enough and docile enough to receive the truth without resentment  i take back my charge of pessimism said colville you are an optimist of the deepest dye  they walked out of the piazza and down to the lung arno through the corridor of the uffizzi where the illustrious florentines stand in marble under the arches all reconciled and peaceful and equal at last colville shivered a little as he passed between the silent ranks of the statues  i cant stand those fellows today they seem to feel such a smirk satisfaction at having got out of it all  they issued upon the river and he went to the parapet and looked down on the water i wonder he mused aloud if it has the same sunday look to these sabbathless italians as it has to us  no nature isnt puritan replied the old minister  not at haddam east village  no there less than here for shes had to make a harder fight for her life there  ah then you believe in natureyoure a friend of nature asked colville following the lines of an oily swirl in the current with indolent eye  only up to a certain point mr waters seemed to be patient of any direction which the other might be giving the talk nature is a savage she has good impulses but you cant trust her altogether  do you know said colville i dont think theres very much of her left in us after we reach a certain point in life she drives us on at a great pace for a while and then some fine morning we wake up and find that nature has got tired of us and has left us to taste and conscience and taste and conscience are by no means so certain of what they want you to do as nature was  yes said the minister i see what you mean he joined colville in leaning on the parapet and he looked out on the river as if he saw his meaning there but by the time we reach that point in life most of us have got the direction which nature meant us to take and theres no longer any need of her driving us on  and what about the unlucky fellows who havent got the direction or havent kept it  they had better go back to it  but if nature herself seemed to change her mind about you  ah you mean persons of weak will they are a great curse to themselves and to everybody else  im not so sure of that said colville ive seen cases in which a strong will looked very much more like the devil  yes a perverted will but there can be no good without a strong will a weak will means inconstancy it means even in good good attempted and relinquished which is always a terrible thing because it is sure to betray some one who relied upon its accomplishment  and in evil perhaps the evil attempted and relinquished turns into good  oh never replied the minister fervently there is something very mysterious in what we call evil apparently it has infinitely greater force and persistence than good i dont know why it should be so but so it appears  youll have the reason of that along with the rest of the secret when your revelation comes said colville with a smile he lifted his eyes from the river and looked up over the clustering roofs beyond it to the hills beyond them flecked to the crest of their purple slopes with the white of villas and villages as if something in the beauty of the wonderful prospect had suggested the vision of its opposite he said dreamily i dont think i shall go to rome tomorrow after all i will go to des vaches where did you say you were walking mr waters oh yes you told me i will cross the bridge with you but i couldnt stand anything quite so vigorous as the associations of the siege this afternoon im going to the boboli gardens to debauch myself with a final sense of nerveless despotism as it expressed itself in marble allegory and formal alleys the fact is that if i stay with you any longer i shall tell you something that im too old to tell and youre too old to hear the old man smiled but offered no urgence or comment and at the thither end of the bridge colville said hastily goodbye if you ever come to des vaches look me up  goodbye said the minister perhaps we shall meet in florence again  no no whatever happens that wont  they shook hands and parted colville stood a moment watching the slight bent figure of the old man as he moved briskly up the via de bardi turning his head from side to side to look at the palaces as he passed and so losing himself in the dim cavernous curve of the street as soon as he was out of sight colville had an impulse to hurry after him and rejoin him then he felt like turning about and going back to his hotel  but he shook himself together into the shape of resolution however slight and transient i must do something i intended to do he said between his set teeth and pushed on up through the via guicciardini i will go to the boboli because i said i would  as he walked along he seemed to himself to be merely crumbling away in this impulse and that in one abortive intent and another what did it all mean had he been his whole life one of these weak wills which are a curse to themselves and others and most a curse when they mean the best was that the secret of his failure in life but for many years he had seemed to succeed to be as other men were hard practical men he had once made a good newspaper which was certainly not a dream of romance had he given that up at last because he was a weak will and now was he running away from florence because his will was weak he could look back to that squalid tragedy of his youth and see that a more violent a more determined man could have possessed himself of the girl whom he had lost and now would it not be more manly if more brutal to stay here where a hope however fleeting however fitful of what might have been had revisited him in the love of this young girl he felt sure if anything were sure that something in him in spite of their wide disparity of years had captured her fancy and now in his abasement he felt again the charm of his own power over her they were no farther apart in years than many a husband and wife they would grow more and more together there was youth enough in his heart yet and who was pushing him away from her forbidding him this treasure that he had but to put out his hand and make his own some one whom through all his thoughts of another he was trying to please but whom he had made finally and inexorably his enemy better stay then something said to him and when he answered i will something else reminded him that this also was not willing but unwilling       xiv   when he entered the beautiful old garden its benison of peace fell upon his tumult and he began to breathe a freer air reverting to his purpose to be gone in the morning and resting in it as he strolled up the broad curve of its alley from the gate he had not been there since he walked there with one now more like a ghost to him than any of the dead who had since died it was there that she had refused him he recalled with a grim smile the awkwardness of getting back with her to the gate from the point far within the garden where he had spoken except that this had happened in the fall and now it was early spring there seemed no change since then the long years that had elapsed were like a winter between  he met people in groups and singly loitering through the paths and chiefly speaking english but no one spoke to him and no one invaded the solitude in which he walked but the garden itself seemed to know him and to give him a tacit recognition the great foolish grotto before the gate with its statues by bandinelli and the fantastic effects of drapery and flesh in partycoloured statues lifted high on either side of the avenue the vast shoulder of wall covered thick with ivy and myrtle which he passed on his way to the amphitheatre behind the palace the alternate figures and urns on their pedestals in the hemicycle as if the urns were placed there to receive the ashes of the figures when they became extinct the white statues or the colossal busts set at the ends of the long alleys against black curtains of foliage the big fountain with its group in the centre of the little lake and the meadow quiet and sad that stretched away on one side from this the keen light under the levels of the dense pines and ilexes the paths striking straight on either hand from the avenue through which he sauntered and the walk that coiled itself through the depths of the plantations all knew him and from them and from the winter neglect which was upon the place distilled a subtle influence a charm an appeal belonging to that combination of artifice and nature which is perfect only in an italian garden under an italian sky he was right in the name which he mockingly gave the effect before he felt it it was a debauch delicate refined of unserious pensiveness a smiling melancholy in which he walked emancipated from his harassing hopes and keeping only his shadowy regrets  colville did not care to scale the easy height from which you have the magnificent view conscious of many photographs of florence he wandered about the skirts of that silent meadow and seeing himself unseen he invaded its borders far enough to pluck one of those large scarlet anemones such as he had given his gentle enemy it was tilting there in the breeze above the unkempt grass and the grass was beginning to feel the spring and to stir and stretch itself after its winter sleep it was sprinkled with violets but these he did not molest he came back to a stained and mossy stone bench on the avenue fronting a pair of rustic youths carved in stone who had not yet finished some game in which he remembered seeing them engaged when he was there before he had not walked fast but he had walked far and was warm enough to like the whiffs of soft wind on his uncovered head the spring was coming that was its breath which you know unmistakably in italy after all the kisses that winter gives some birds were singing in the trees down an alley into which he could look between the high walls of green he could see two people in flirtation he waited patiently till the young man should put his arm round the girls waist for the fleeting embrace from which she pushed it and fled further down the path  yes its spring thought colville and then with the selfishness of the troubled soul he wished that it might be winter still and indefinitely it occurred to him now that he should not go back to des vaches for he did not know what he should do there he would go to new york though he did not know what he should do in new york either  he became tired of looking at the people who passed and of speculating about them through the second consciousness which enveloped the sad substance of his misgivings like an atmosphere and he let his eyelids fall as he leaned his head back against the tree behind his bench then their voices pursued him through the twilight that he had made himself and forced him to the same weary conjecture as if he had seen their faces he heard gay laughter and laughter that affected gaiety the tones of young men in earnest disquisition reached him through the veil and the talk falling to whisper of girls with the names of men in it sums of money a hundred francs forty thousand francs came in high tones a husband and wife went by quarrelling in the false security of english and snapping at each other as confidingly as if in the sanctuary of home the man bade the woman not be a fool and she asked him how she was toendure his company if she was not a fool  colville opened his eyes to look after them when a voice that he knew called out why it is mr colville  it was mrs amsden and pausing with her as if they had passed him in doubt and arrested themselves when they had got a little way by were effie bowen and imogens graham the old lady had the child by the hand and the girl stood a few paces apart from them she was one of those beauties who have the property of looking very plain at times and colville who had seen her in more than one transformation now beheld her somehow clumsy of feature and with the youth gone from her aspect she seemed a woman of thirty and she wore an unbecoming walking dress of a fashion that contributed to this effect of age colville was aware afterward of having wished that she was really as old and plain as she looked  he had to come forward and put on the conventional delight of a gentleman meeting lady friends  its remarkable how your having your eyes shut estranged you said mrs amsden now if you had let me see you oftener in church where people close their eyes a good deal for one purpose or another i should have known you at once  i hope you havent lost a great deal of time as it is mrs amsden said colville of course i should have had my eyes open if i had known you were going by  oh dont apologise cried the old thing with ready enjoyment of his tone  i dont apologise for not being recognisable i apologise for being visible said colville with some shapeless impression that he ought to excuse his continued presence in florence to imogene but keeping his eyes upon mrs amsden to whom what he said could not be intelligible i ought to be in turin today  in turin are you going away from florence  im going home  why did you know that asked the old lady of imogene who slightly nodded and then of effie who also assented really the silence of the bowen family in regard to the affairs of others is extraordinary there never was a family more eminently qualified to live in florence i dare say that if i saw a little more of them i might hope to reach the years of discretion myself some day why are you going away you see i havent reached them yet are you tired of florence already  no said colville passively florence is tired of me  youre quite sure  yes theres no mistaking one of her sex on such a point  mrs amsden laughed ah a great many people mistake us both ways and youre really going back to america what in the world for  i havent the least idea  is america fonder of you than florence  shes never told her love i suspect its merely that shes more used to me  they were walking without any volition of his down the slope of the broad avenue to the fountain where he had already been  is your mother well he asked of the little girl it seemed to him that he had better not speak to imogene who still kept that little distance from the rest and get away as soon as he decently could  she has a headache said effie  oh im sorry returned colville  yes she deputed me to take her young people out for an airing said mrs amsden and miss graham decided us for the boboli where she hadnt been yet ive done what i could to make the place attractive but what is an old woman to do for a girl in a garden we ought to have brought some other young peoplesome of the inglehart boys but were respectable we americans abroad were decorous above all things and i dont know about meeting you here mr colville it has a very bad appearance are you sure that you didnt know i was to go by here at exactly halfpast four  i was living from breath to breath in the expectation of seeing you you must have noticed how eagerly i was looking out for you  yes and with a single red anemone in your hand so that i should know you without being obliged to put on my spectacles  you divine everything mrs amsden he said giving her the flower  i shall make my brags to mrs bowen when i see her said the old lady how far into the country did you walk for this  as far as the meadow yonder  they had got down to the sheet of water from which the seahorses of the fountain sprang and the old lady sank upon a bench near it colville held out his hand toward effie i saw a lot of violets over there in the grass  did you she put her hand eagerly into his and they strolled off together after a first motion to accompany them imogene sat down beside mrs amsden answering quietly the talk of the old lady and seeming in nowise concerned about the expedition for violets except for a dull first glance she did not look that way colville stood in the border of the grass and the child ran quickly hither and thither in it stooping from time to time upon the flowers then she came out to where he stood and showed her bunch of violets looking up into the face which he bent upon her while he trifled with his cane he had a very fatherly air with her  i think ill go and see what theyve found said imogene irrelevantly to a remark of mrs amsdens about the expensiveness of madame bossis bonnets  well said the old lady imogene started and the little girl ran to meet her she detained effie with her admiration of the violets till colville lounged reluctantly up go and show them to mrs amsden she said giving back the violets which she had been smelling the child ran on mr colville i want to speak with you  yes said colville helplessly  why are you going away  why oh ive accomplished the objectsor noobjectsi came for he said with dreary triviality and i must hurry away to other fields of activity he kept his eyes on her face which he saw full of a passionate intensity working to some sort of overflow  that is not true and you neednt say it to spare me you are going away because mrs bowen said something to you about me  not quite that returned colville gently  no it was something that she said to me about you but its the same thing it makes no difference i ask you not to go for that  do you know what you are saying imogene  yes  colville waited a long moment then i thank you you dear girl and i am going tomorrow all the same but i shant forget this whatever my life is to be this will make it less unworthy and less unhappy if it could buy anything to give you joy to add some little grace to the good that must come to you i would give it some day youll meet the young fellow whom youre to make immortal and you must tell him of an old fellow who knew you afar off and understood how to worship you for an angel of pity and unselfishness ah i hope hell understand too goodbye if he was to fly that was the sole instant he took her hand and said again goodbye and then he suddenly cried imogene do you wish me to stay  yes said the girl pouring all the intensity of her face into that whisper  even if there had been nothing said to make me go awayshould you still wish me to stay  yes  he looked her in the starry lucid eyes where a divine fervour deepened he sighed in nerveless perplexity it was she who had the courage  its a mistake you mustnt i am too old for you it would be a wrong and a cruelty yes you must let me go and forget me i have been to blame if mrs bowen has blamed me she was righti deserved it i deserved all she could say against me  she never said anything against you do you think i would have let her no it was i that said it and i blamed you it was because i thought that you wereyou were  trifling with you how could you think that  yes i know now how it was and it makes you seem all the grander to me did you think i cared for your being older than i was i never cared for iti never hardly thought of it after the very first i tried to make you understand that and how it hurt me to have you speak of it dont you think that i could see how good you were do you suppose that all i want is to be happy i dont care for thati despise it and i always hate myself for seeking my own pleasure if i find myself doing it i have seen enough of life to know what that comes to and what hurt me worst of all was that you seemed to believe that i cared for nothing but amusing myself when i wished to be something better higher its nothing whether you are of my age or not ififyou care for me  imogene  all that i ask is to be with you and try to make you forget whats been sad in your life and try to be of use to you in whatever you are doing and i shall be prouder and gladder of that than anything that people call happiness  colville stood holding her hand while she uttered these ideas and incoherent repetitions of them with a deep sense of powerlessness if i believed that i could keep you from regretting this  what should i regret i wont let you depreciate yourselfmake yourself out not good enough for the best oh i know how it happened but now you shall never think of it again no i will not let you that is the only way you could make me regret anything  i am going to stay said colville but on my own terms i will be bound to you but you shall not be bound to me  you doubt me i would rather have you go no stay and let me prove to you how wrong you are i mustnt ask more than that only give me the chance to show you how different i am from what you thinkhow different you are too  yes but you must be free  well  what are they doing so long there asked mrs amsden of effie putting her glasses to her eyes i cant see  they are just holding hands said the child with an easy satisfaction in the explanation which perhaps the old lady did not share he always holds my hand when he is with me  does he indeed exclaimed mrs amsden with a cackle she added thats very polite of him isnt it you must be a great favourite with mr colville you will miss him when hes gone  yes hes very nice  colville and imogene returned coming slowly across the loose neglected grass toward the old womans seat she rose as they came up  you dont seem to have succeeded so well in getting flowers for miss graham as for the other ladies but perhaps you didnt find her favourite over there what is your favourite flower miss graham dont say you have none i didnt know that i preferred scarlet anemones were there no forgetmenots over there in the grass  there was no occasion for them answered colville  you always did make such pretty speeches said the old lady and they have such an orphic character too you can interpret them in so many different ways should you mind saying just what you meant by that one  yes very much replied colville  the old lady laughed with cheerful resignation she would as lief report that reply of his as another even more than a man whom she could entangle in his speech she liked a man who could slip through the toils with unfailing ease her talk with such a man was the last consolation which remained to her from a life of harmless coquetries  i will refer it to mrs bowen she said she is a very wise woman and she used to know you a great while ago  if you like i will do it for you mrs amsden im going to see her  to renew your adieux well why not parting is such sweet sorrow and if i were a young man i would go to say goodbye to mrs bowen as often as she would let me now tell me honestly mr colville did you ever see such an exquisite perfect creature  oh thats asking a good deal  what  to tell you a thing honestly how did you come here mrs amsden  in mrs bowens carriage i sent it round from the pitti entrance to the porta romana its waiting there now i suppose  i thought you had been corrupted somehow your zeal is carriagebought it is a delightful vehicle do you think you could give me a lift home in it  yes indeed ive always a seat for you in my carriage to hotel datene  no to palazzo pinti  this is deliciously mysterious said mrs amsden drawing her shawl up about her shoulders which if no longer rounded had still a charming droop one realises in looking at such old ladies that there are women who could manage their own skeletons winningly she put up her glasses which were an oldfashioned sort held to the nose by a handle and perused the different persons of the group mr colville concealing an inward trepidation under a bold front miss graham agitated but firm the child as much puzzled as the old woman i feel that we are a very interesting groupalmost dramatic  oh call us a passage from a modern novel suggested colville if youre in the romantic mood one of mr jamess  dont you think we ought to be rather more of the great world for that i hardly feel up to mr james i should have said howells only nothing happens in that case  oh very well thats the most comfortable way if its only howells theres no reason why i shouldnt go with miss graham to show her the view of florence from the cypress grove up yonder  no hes very particular when hes on italian ground said mrs amsden rising you must come another time with miss graham and bring mrs bowen its quite time we were going home  the light under the limbs of the trees had begun to grow more liquid the currents of warm breeze streaming through the cooler body of the air had ceased to ruffle the lakelet round the fountain and the naiads rode their seahorses through a perfect calm a damp pierced with the fresh odour of the water and of the springing grass descended upon them the saunterers through the different paths and alleys were issuing upon the main avenues and tending in gathering force toward the gate  they found mrs bowens carriage there and drove first to her house beyond which mrs amsden lived in a direct line on the way colville kept up with her the bantering talk that they always carried on together and found in it a respite from the formless future pressing close upon him he sat with effie on the front seat and he would not look at imogenes face which nevertheless was present to some inner vision when the porter opened the iron gate below and rang mrs bowens bell and effie sprang up the stairs before them to give her mother the news of mr colvilles coming the girl stole her hand into his  shall youtell her  of course she must know without an instants delay  yes yes that is right ohshall i go with you  yes come       xv   mrs bowen came in to them looking pale and painworn as she did that evening when she would not let colville go away with the other teataking callers to whom she had made her headache an excuse the eyelids which she had always a little difficulty in lifting were heavy with suffering and her pretty smile had an effect of very great remoteness but there was no consciousness of anything unusual or unexpected in his presence expressed in her looks or manner colville had meant to take imogene by the hand and confront mrs bowen with an immediate declaration of what had happened but he found this impossible at least in the form of his intention he took instead the hand of conventional welcome which she gave him and he obeyed her in taking provisionally the seat to which she invited him at the same time the order of his words was dispersed in that wonder whether she suspected anything with which he listened to her placid talk about the weather she said she had thought it was a chilly day outdoors but her headaches always made her very sensitive  yes said colville i supposed it was cold myself till i went out for i woke with a tinge of rheumatism he felt a strong desire to excuse to justify what had happened and he went on with a painful sense of imogenes eyes bent in bewildered deference upon him i started out for a walk with mr waters but i left him after we got across the ponte vecchio he went up to look at the michelangelo bastions and i strolled over to the boboli gardenswhere i found your young people  he had certainly brought himself to the point but he seemed actually further from it than at first and he made a desperate plunge trying at the same time to keep something of his habitual nonchalance but that doesnt account for my being here imogene accounts for that she has allowed me to stay in florence  mrs bowen could not turn paler than her headache had left her and she now underwent no change of complexion but her throat was not clear enough to say to the end allowed you to stay in the trouble in her throat arrested her again  colville became very red he put out his hand and took imogenes and now his eyes and mrs bowens met in the kind of glance in which people intercept and turn each other aside before they have reached a restingplace in each others souls but at the girls touch his courage revivedin some physical sort yes and if she will let me stay with her we are not going to part again  mrs bowen did not answer at once and in the hush colville heard the breathing of all three  of course he said we wished you to know at once and i came in with imogene to tell you  what do you wish me asked mrs bowen to do  colville forced a nervous laugh really im so little used to this sort of affair that i dont know whether i have any wish imogene is here with you and i suppose i supposed you would wish to do something  i will do whatever you think best  thank you thats very kind of you he fell into a silence in which he was able only to wish that he knew what was best and from which he came to the surface with imogenes family ought to know of course  yes they put her in my charge they will have to know shall i write to them  why if you will  oh certainly  thank you  he had taken to stroking with his right hand the hand of imogene which he held in his left and now he looked round at her with a glance which it was a relief not to have her meet and till we can hear from them i suppose you will let me come to see her  you know you have always been welcome here  thank you very much it seemed as if there ought to be something else to say but colville could not think of anything except we wish to act in every way with your approval mrs bowen and i know that you are very particular in some thingsthe words now that they were said struck him as unfortunate and even vulgarand i shouldnt wish to annoy you  oh i understand i think it will bei have no doubt you will know how to manage all that it isnt as if you were both  young asked colville no one of us is quite old enough to be thoroughly up in the convenances we are qualified im afraid as far as that goes he added bitterly to set all florence an example of correct behaviour  he knew there must be pain in the face which he would not look at he kept looking at mrs bowens face in which certainly there was not much pleasure either  there was another silence which became very oppressive before it ended in a question from mrs bowen who stirred slightly in her chair and bent forward as if about to rise in asking it shall you wish to consider it an engagement  colville felt imogenes hand tremble in his but he received no definite prompting from the tremor i dont believe i know what you mean  i mean till you have heard from imogenes mother  i hadnt thought of that perhaps under the circumstances the tremor died out of the hand he held it lay lax between his what do you say imogene  i cant say anything whatever you think will be rightfor me  i wish to do what will seem right and fair to your mother  yes  colville heaved a hopeless sigh then with a deep inward humiliation he said perhaps if you know imogenes mother mrs bowen you can suggestadviseyou  you must excuse me i cant suggest or advise anything i must leave you perfectly free she rose from her chair and they both rose too from the sofa on which he had seated himself at imogenes side i shall have to leave you im afraid my head aches still a little imogene she advanced toward the girl who stood passively letting her come the whole distance as if sensible of the rebuff expressed in this attitude she halted a very little then she added i hope you will be very happy and suddenly cast her arms round the girl and stood long pressing her face into her neck when she released her colville trembled lest she should be going to give him her hand in congratulation but she only bowed slightly to him with a sidelong aversive glance and walked out of the room with a slow rigid pace like one that controls a tendency to giddiness  imogene threw herself on colvilles breast it gave him a shock as if he were letting her do herself some wrong but she gripped him fast and began to sob and to cry oh oh oh  what is itwhat is it my poor girl he murmured are you unhappy are you sorry let it all end then  no no it isnt that but i am very unhappyyes very very unhappy oh i didnt suppose i should ever feel so toward any one i hate her  you hate her gasped colville  yes i hate her and sheshe is so good to me it must be that ive done her some deadly wrong without knowing it or i couldnt hate her as i know i do  oh no said colville soothingly thats just your fancy you havent harmed her and you dont hate her  yes yes i do you cant understand how i feel toward her  but you cant feel so toward her long he urged dealing as he might with what was wholly a mystery to him she is so good  it only makes my badness worse and makes me hate her more  i dont understand but youre excited now when youre calmer youll feel differently of course ive kept you restless and nervous a long time poor child but now our peace begins and everything will be bright and he stopped the words had such a very hollow sound  she pushed herself from him and dried her eyes oh yes  and imogeneperhapsperhapsor no never mind now i must go away she looked at him frightened but submissive but i will be back tonight or perhaps tomorrow morning i want to thinkto give you time to think i dont want to be selfish about youi want to consider you all the more because you wont consider yourself goodbye he stooped over and kissed her hair even in this he felt like a thief he could not look at the face she lifted to his  mrs bowen sent word from her room that she was not coming to dinner and imogene did not come till the dessert was put on then she found effie bowen sitting alone at the table and served in serious formality by the man whom she had apparently felt it right to repress for they were both silent the little girl had not known how to deny herself an excess of the less wholesome dishes and she was perhaps anticipating the regret which this indulgence was to bring for she was very pensive  isnt mamma coming at all she asked plaintively when imogene sat down and refused everything but a cup of coffee well she went on i cant make out what is coming to this family you were all crying last night because mr colville was going away and now when hes going to stay its just as bad i dont think you make it very pleasant for him i should think he would be perfectly puzzled by it after hes done so much to please you all i dont believe he thinks its very polite i suppose it is polite but it doesnt seem so and hes always so cheerful and nice i should think he would want to visit in some family where there was more amusement there used to be plenty in this family but now its as dismal the first of the winter you and mamma used to be so pleasant when he came and would try everything to amuse him and would let me come in to get some of the good of it but now you seem to fly every way as soon as he comes in sight of the house and im poked off in holes and corners before he can open his lips and ive borne it about as long as i can i would rather be back in vevay or anywhere at this point her own pathos overwhelmed her and the tears rolling down her cheeks moistened the crumbs of pastry at the corners of her pretty mouth what was so strange i should like to know about his staying that mamma should pop up like a ghost when i told her he had come home with us and grab me by the wrist and twitch me about and ask me all sorts of questions i couldnt answer and frighten me almost to death i havent got over it yet and i dont think its very nice it used to be a very polite family and pleasant with each other and always having something agreeable going on in it but if it keeps on very much longer in this way i shall think the bowens are beginning to lose their goodbreeding i suppose that if mr colville were to go down on his knees to mamma and ask her to let him take me somewhere now she wouldnt do it she pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket and dried her eyes on a ball of it i dont see what youve been crying about imogene youve got nothing to worry you  im not very well effie returned the girl gently i havent been well all day  it seems to me that nobody is well any more i dont believe florence is a very healthy place or at least this house isnt i think it must be the drainage if we keep on i suppose we shall all have diphtheria dont you imogene  yes asserted the girl distractedly  the girls had it at vevay frightfully and none of them were as strong afterward some of the parents came and took them away but madame schebres never let mamma know do you think that was right  no it was very wrong  i suppose mr colville will have it if we do that is if he keeps coming here is he coming any more  yes hes coming tomorrow morning  is he a smile flickered over the rueful face what time is he coming  i dont know exactly said imogene listlessly stirring her coffee some time in the forenoon  do you suppose hes going to take us anywhere  yesi think so i cant tell exactly  if he asks me to go somewhere will you tease mamma she always lets you imogene and it seems sometimes as if she just took a pleasure in denying me  you mustnt talk so of your mother effie  no i wouldnt to everybody i know that she means for the best but i dont believe she understands how much i suffer when she wont let me go with mr colville dont you think hes about the nicest gentleman we know imogene  yes hes very kind  and i think hes handsome a good many people would consider him oldlooking and of course he isnt so young as mr morton was or the inglehart boys but that makes him all the easier to get along with and his being just a little fat that way seems to suit so well with his character the smiles were now playing across the childs face and her eyes sparkling i think mr colville would make a good saint nicholasthe kind they have going down chimneys in america im going to tell him for the next veglione it would be such a nice surprise  no better not tell him that suggested imogene  do you think he wouldnt like it  yes  well it would become him how old do you suppose he is imogene seventyfive  what an idea cried the girl fiercely hes fortyone  i didnt know they had those little jiggering lines at the corners of their eyes so quick but fortyone is pretty old isnt it is mr waters  effie said her mothers voice at the door behind her will you ring for giovanni and tell him to bring me a cup of coffee in here she spoke from the portière of the salotto  yes mamma ill bring it to you myself  thank you dear mrs bowen called from within  the little girl softly pressed her hands together i hope shell let me stay up i feel so excited and i hate to lie and think so long before i get to sleep couldnt you just hint a little to her that i might stay up its sunday night  i cant effie said imogene i oughtnt to interfere with any of your mothers rules  the child sighed submissively and took the coffee that giovanni brought to her she and imogene went into the salotto together mrs bowen was at her writingdesk you can bring the coffee here effie she said  must i go to bed at once mamma asked the child setting the cup carefully down  the mother looked distractedly up from her writing no you may sit up a while she said looking back to her writing  how long mamma pleaded the little girl  oh till youre sleepy it doesnt matter now  she went on writing from time to time she tore up what she had written  effie softly took a book from the table and perching herself on a stiff high chair bent over it and began to read  imogene sat by the hearth where a small fire was pleasant in the indoor chill of an italian house even after so warm a day as that had been she took some large beads of the strand she wore about her neck into her mouth and pulled at the strand listlessly with her hand while she watched the fire her eyes wandered once to the child  what made you take such an uncomfortable chair effie  effie shut her book over her hand it keeps me wakeful longer she whispered with a glance at her mother from the corner of her eye  i dont see why any one should wish to be wakeful sighed the girl  when mrs bowen tore up one of her halfwritten pages imogene started nervously forward and then relapsed again into her chair at last mrs bowen seemed to find the right phrases throughout and she finished rather a long letter and read it over to herself then she said without leaving her desk imogene ive been trying to write to your mother will you look at this  she held the sheet over her shoulder and imogene came languidly and took it mrs bowen dropped her face forward on the desk into her hands while imogene was reading  florence march 10 18  dear mrs grahami have some very important news to give you in regard to imogene and as there is no way of preparing you for it i will tell you at once that it relates to her marriage  she has met at my house a gentleman whom i knew in florence when i was here before and of whom i never knew anything but good we have seen him very often and i have seen nothing in him that i could not approve he is mr theodore colville of prairie des vaches indiana where he was for many years a newspaper editor but he was born somewhere in new england he is a very cultivated interesting man and though not exactly a society man he is very agreeable and refined in his manners i am sure his character is irreproachable though he is not a member of any church in regard to his means i know nothing whatever and can only infer from his way of life that he is in easy circumstances  the whole matter has been a surprise to me for mr colville is some twentyone or two years older than imogene who is very young in her feelings for a girl of her age if i could have realised anything like a serious attachment between them sooner i would have written before even now i do not know whether i am to consider them engaged or not no doubt imogene will write you more fully  of course i would rather not have had anything of the kind happen while imogene was under my charge though i am sure that you will not think i have been careless or imprudent about her i interfered as far as i could at the first moment i could but it appears that it was then too late to prevent what has followedyours sincerely evalina bowen   imogene read the letter twice over and then she said why isnt he a society man  probably mrs bowen expected this sort of approach i dont think a society man would have undertaken to dance the lancers as he did at madam uccellis she answered patiently without lifting her head  imogene winced but i should despise him if he were merely a society man she said i have seen enough of them i think its better to be intellectual and good  mrs bowen made no reply and the girl went on and as to his being older i dont see what difference it makes if people are in sympathy then they are of the same age no difference how much older than one the other is i have always heard that she urged this as if it were a question  yes said mrs bowen  and how should his having been a newspaper editor be anything against him  mrs bowen lifted her face and stared at the girl in astonishment who said it was against him  you hint as much the whole letter is against him  imogene  yes every word you make him out perfectly detestable i dont know why you should hate him hes done everything he could to satisfy you  mrs bowen rose from her desk putting her hand to her forehead as if to soften a shock of headache that her change of posture had sent there i will leave the letter with you and you can send it or not as you think best its merely a formality my writing to your mother perhaps youll see it differently in the morning effie she called to the child who with her book shut upon her hand had been staring at them and listening intently its time to go to bed now  when effie stood before the glass in her mothers room and mrs bowen was braiding her hair and tying it up for the night she asked ruefully whats the matter with imogene mamma  she isnt very happy tonight  you dont seem very happy either said the child watching her own face as it quivered in the mirror i should think that now mr colvilles concluded to stay we would all be happy again but we dont seem to werewere perfectly demoralised it was one of the words she had picked up from colville  the quivering face in the glass broke in a passion of tears and effie sobbed herself to sleep  imogene sat down at mrs bowens desk and pushing her letter away began to write  florence march 10 18  dear motheri inclose a letter from mrs bowen which will tell you better than i can what i wish to tell i do not see how i can add anything that would give you more of an idea of him or less either no person can be put down in cold black and white and not seem like a mere inventory i do not suppose you expected me to become engaged when you sent me out to florence and as mrs bowen says i dont know whether i am engaged or not i will leave it entirely to mr colville if he says we are engaged we are i am sure he will do what is best i only know that he was going away from florence because he thought i supposed he was not in earnest and i asked him to stay  i am a good deal excited tonight and cannot write very clearly but i will write soon again and more at length  perhaps something will be decided by that time with much love to father  your affectionate daughter  imogene  she put this letter into an envelope with mrs bowens and leaving it unsealed to show her in the morning she began to write again this time she wrote to a girl with whom she had been on terms so intimate that when they left school they had agreed to know each other by names expressive of their extremely confidential friendship and to address each other respectively as diary and journal they were going to write every day if only a line or two and at the end of a year they were to meet and read over together the records of their lives as set down in these letters they had never met since though it was now three years since they parted and they had not written since imogene came abroad that is imogene had not answered the only letter she had received from her friend in florence this friend was a very serious girl and had wished to be a minister but her family would not consent or even accept the compromise of studying medicine which she proposed and she was still living at home in a small city of central new york imogene now addressed her  dear diaryyou cannot think how far away the events of this day have pushed the feelings and ideas of the time when i agreed to write to you under this name till now it seems to me as if i had not changed in the least thing since we parted and now i can hardly know myself for the same person o dear di something very wonderful has come into my life and i feel that it rests with me to make it the greatest blessing to myself and others or the greatest misery if i prove unworthy of it or unequal to it then i am sure that nothing but wretchedness will come of it  i am engagedyesand to a man more than twice my own age it is so easy to tell you this for i know that your largemindedness will receive it very differently from most people and that you will see it as i do he is the noblest of men though he tries to conceal it under the light ironical manner with which he has been faithful to a cruel disappointment it was here in florence twenty years ago that a girli am ashamed to call her a girltrifled with the priceless treasure that has fallen to me and flung it away you di will understand how i was first fascinated with the idea of trying to atone to him here for all the wrong he had suffered at first it was only the vaguest suggestionsomething like what i had read in a poem or a novelthat had nothing to do with me personally but it grew upon me more and more the more i saw of him and felt the witchery of his light indifferent manner which i learned to see was tense with the anguish he had suffered she had killed his youth she had spoiled his life if i could revive them restore them it came upon me like a great flash of light at last and as soon as this thought took possession of me i felt my whole being elevated and purified by it and i was enabled to put aside with contempt the selfish considerations that had occurred to me at first at first the difference between our ages was very shocking to me for i had always imagined it would be some one young but when this light broke upon me i saw that he was young younger even than i as a man is at the same age with a girl sometimes with my experiences the fancies and flirtations that every one has and must have however one despises them i felt so old beside him for he had been true to one love all his life and he had not wavered for a moment if i could make him forget it if i could lift every feathers weight of sorrow from his breast if i could help him to complete the destiny grand and beautiful as it would have been which another had arrested broken offdont you see di dear how rich my reward would be  and he how forbearing how considerate how anxious for me how full of generous warning he has been always putting me in mind at every step of the difference in years between us never thinking of himself and shrinking so much from even seeming to control me or sway me that i dont know really whether i have not made all the advances  i cannot write his name yet and you must not ask it till i can and i cannot tell you anything about his looks or his life without seeming to degrade him somehow and make him a common man like others  how can i make myself his companion in everything how can i convince him that there is no sacrifice for me and that he alone is giving up these are the thoughts that keep whirling through my mind i hope i shall be helped and i hope that i shall be tried for that is the only way for me to be helped i feel strong enough for anything that people can say i should welcome criticism and opposition from any quarter but i can see that he is very sensitiveit comes from his keen sense of the ridiculousand if i suffer it will be on account of this grand unselfish nature and i shall be glad of that  i know you will understand me di and i am not afraid of your laughing at these ravings but if you did i should not care it is such a comfort to say these things about him to exalt him and get him in the true light at last  your faithful journal  i shall tell him about you one of the first things and perhaps he can suggest some way out of your trouble he has had so much experience of every kind you will worship him as i do when you see him for you will feel at once that he understands you and that is such a rest  j   before imogene fell asleep mrs bowen came to her in the dark and softly closed the door that opened from the girls room into effies she sat down on the bed and began to speak at once as if she knew imogene must be awake i thought you would come to me imogene but as you didnt i have come to you for if you can go to sleep with hard thoughts of me tonight i cant let you you need me for your friend and i wish to be your friend it would be wicked in me to be anything else i would give the world if your mother were here but i tried to make my letter to her everything that it should be if you dont think it is i will write it over in the morning  no said the girl coldly it will do very well i dont wish to trouble you so much  oh how can you speak so to me do you think that i blame mr colville is that it i dont ask youi shall never ask youhow he came to remain but i know that he has acted truthfully and delicately i knew him long before you did and no one need take his part with me this was not perhaps what mrs bowen meant to say when she began i have told you all along what i thought but if you imagine that i am not satisfied with mr colville you are very much mistaken i cant burst out into praises of him to your mother that would be very patronising and very bad taste cant you see that it would  oh yes  mrs bowen lingered as if she expected imogene to say something more but she did not and mrs bowen rose then i hope we understand each other she said and went out of the room       xvi   when colville came in the morning mrs bowen received him they shook hands and their eyes met in the intercepting glance of the night before  imogene will be here in a moment she said with a naturalness that made him awkward and conscious  oh there is no haste he answered uncouthly that is i am very glad of the chance to speak a moment with you and to ask yourto profit by what you think best i know you are not very well pleased with me and i dont know that i can ever put myself in a better light with youthe true light it seems that there are some things we must not do even for the truths sake but thats neither here nor there what i am most anxious for is not to take a shadow of advantage of this childsof imogenes inexperience and her remoteness from her family i feel that i must in some sort protect her from herself yesthat is my idea but i have to do this in so many ways that i hardly know how to begin i should be very willing if you thought best to go away and stay away till she has heard from her people and let her have that time to think it all over again she is very youngso much younger than i or if you thought it better i would stay and let her remain free while i held myself bound to any decision of hers i am anxious to do what is right at the same timehe smiled ruefullythere is such a thing as being so disinterested that one may seem uninterested i may leave her so very free that she may begin to suspect that i want a little freedom myself what shall i do i wish to act with your approval  mrs bowen had listened with acquiescence and intelligence that might well have looked like sympathy as she sat fingering the top of her handscreen with her eyelids fallen she lifted them to say i have told you that i will not advise yon in any way i cannot i have no longer any wish in this matter i must still remain in the place of imogenes mother but i will do only what you wish please understand that and dont ask me for advice any more it is painful she drew her lower lip in a little and let the screen fall into her lap  im sorry mrs bowen to do anythingsay anythingthat is painful to you colville began you know that i would give the world to please you the words escaped him and left him staring at her  what are you saying to me theodore colville she exclaimed flashing a fulleyed glance upon him and then breaking into a laugh as unnatural for her really i dont believe you know  heaven knows i meant nothing but what i said he answered struggling stupidly with a confusion of desires which every man but no woman will understand after eighteen hundred years the man is still imperfectly monogamous is there anything wrong in it  oh no not for you she said scornfully  i am very much in earnest he went on hopelessly in asking your opinion your help in regard to how i shall treat this affair  and i am still more in earnest in telling you that i will give you no opinion no help i forbid you to recur to the subject he was silent unable to drop his eyes from hers but for her continued mrs bowen i will do anything in my power if she asks my advice i will give it and i will give her all the help i can  thank you said colville vaguely  i will not have your thanks promptly retorted mrs bowen for i mean you no kindness i am trying to do my duty to imogene and when that is ended all is ended there is no way now for you to please meas you call itexcept to keep her from regretting what she has done  do you think i shall fail in that he demanded indignantly  i can offer you no opinion i cant tell what you will do  there are two ways of keeping her from regretting what she has done and perhaps the simplest and best way would be to free her from the consequences as far as theyre involved in me said colville  mrs bowen dropped herself back in her armchair if you choose to force these things upon me i am a woman and cant help myself especially i cant help myself against a guest  oh i will relieve you of my presence said colville ive no wish to force anything upon youleast of all myself he rose and moved toward the door  she hastily intercepted him do you think i will let you go without seeing imogene do you understand me so little as that its too late for you to go you know what i think of all this and i know better than you what you think i shall play my part and you shall play yours i have refused to give you advice or help and i never shall do it but i know what my duty to her is and i will fulfil it no matter how distasteful it is to either of us you must come here as before the house is as free to you as everfreer and we are to be as good friends as everbetter you can see imogene alone or in my presence and as far as i am concerned you shall consider yourself engaged or not as you choose do you understand  not in the least said colville in the ghost of his old bantering manner but dont explain or i shall make still less of it  i mean simply that i do it for imogene and not for you  oh i understand that you dont do it for me  at this moment imogene appeared between the folds of the portière and her timid embarrassed glance from mrs bowen to colville was the first gleam of consolation that had visited him since he parted with her the night before a thrill of inexplicable pride and fondness passed through his heart and even the compunction that followed could not spoil its sweetness but if mrs bowen discreetly turned her head aside that she need not witness a tender greeting between them the precaution was unnecessary he merely went forward and took the girls hand with a sigh of relief good morning imogene he said with a kind of compassionate admiration  good morning she returned halfinquiringly  she did not take a seat near him and turned as if for instruction to mrs bowen it was probably the force of habit in any case mrs bowens eyes gave no response she bowed slightly to colville and began i must leave imogene to entertain you for the present mr  no cried the girl impetuously dont go mrs bowen stopped i wish to speak with youwith you and mr colville together i wish to sayi dont know how to say it exactly but i wish to knowyou asked him last night mrs bowen whether he wished to consider it an engagement  i thought perhaps you would rather hear from your mother  yes i would be glad to know that my mother approved but if she didnt i couldnt help it mr colville said he was bound but i was not that cant be i wish to be bound if he is  i dont quite know what you expect me to say  nothing said imogene i merely wished you to know and i dont wish you to sacrifice anything to us if you think best mr colville will not see me till i hear from home though it wont make any difference with me what i hear  theres no reason why you shouldnt meet said mrs bowen absently  if you wish it to have the same appearance as an italian engagement  no said mrs bowen putting her hand to her head with a gesture she had that would be quite unnecessary it would be ridiculous under the circumstances i have thought of it and i have decided that the american way is the best  very well then said imogene with the air of summing up then the only question is whether we shall make it known or not to other people  this point seemed to give mrs bowen greater pause than any she was a long time silent and colville saw that imogene was beginning to chafe at her indecision yet he did not see the moment to intervene in a debate in which he found himself somewhat ludicrously ignored as if the affair were solely the concern of these two women and none of his  of course mrs bowen said the girl haughtily if it will be disagreeable to you to have it known  mrs bowen blushed delicatelya blush of protest and of generous surprise or so it seemed to colville i was not thinking of myself imogene i only wish to consider you and i was thinking whether at this distance from home you wouldnt prefer to have your familys approval before you made it known  i am sure of their approval father will do what mother says and she has always said that she would never interfere with me ininsuch a thing  perhaps you would like all the more then to show her the deference of waiting for her consent  imogene started as if stopped short in swift career it was not hard for colville to perceive that she saw for the first time the reverse side of a magnanimous impulse she suddenly turned to him  i think mrs bowen is right he said gravely in answer to the eyes of imogene he continued with a flicker of his wonted mood you must consider me a little in the matter i have some small shreds of selfrespect about me somewhere and i would rather not be put in the attitude of defying your family or ignoring them  no said imogene in the same effect of arrest  when it isnt absolutely necessary continued colville especially as you say there will be no opposition  of course imogene assented and in fact what he said was very just and he knew it but he could perceive that he had suffered loss with her a furtive glance at mrs bowen did not assure him that he had made a compensating gain in that direction where indeed he had no right to wish for any  well then the girl went on it shall be so we will wait it will only be waiting i ought to have thought of you before i make a bad beginning she said tremulously i supposed i was thinking of you but i see that i was only thinking of myself the tears stood in her eyes mrs bowen quite overlooked in this apology slipped from the room  imogene said colville coming toward her  she dropped herself upon his shoulder oh why why why am i so miserable  miserable imogene he murmured stroking her beautiful hair  yes yes utterly miserable it must be because im unworthy of youunequal every way if you think so cast me off at once dont be weakly merciful  the words pierced his heart i would give the world to make you happy my child he said with perfidious truth and a sigh that came from the bottom of his soul sit down here by me he said moving to the sofa and with whatever obscure sense of duty to her innocent selfabandon he made a space between them and reduced her embrace to a clasp of the hand she left with him now tell me he said what is it makes you unhappy  oh i dont know she answered drying her averted eyes i suppose i am overwrought from not sleeping and from thinking how we should arrange it all  and now that its all arranged cant you be cheerful again  yes  youre satisfied with the way weve arranged it because if  oh perfectlyperfectly she hastily interrupted i wouldnt have it otherwise of course she added it wasnt very pleasant having some one else suggest what i ought to have thought of myself and seem more delicate about you than i was  some one else  you know mrs bowen  oh but i couldnt see that she was anxious to spare me it occurred to me that she was concerned about your family  it led up to the other its all the same thing  well even in that case i dont see why you should mind it it was certainly very friendly of her and i know that she has your interest at heart entirely  yes she knows how to make it seem so  colville hesitated in bewilderment imogene he cried at last i dont understand this dont you think mrs bowen likes you  she detests me  oh no no no thats too cruel an error you mustnt think that i cant let you its morbid im sure that shes devotedly kind and good to you  being kind and good isnt liking i know what she thinks but of course i cant expect to convince you of it no one else could see it  no said colville with generous fervour  because it doesnt exist and you mustnt imagine it you are as sincerely and unselfishly regarded in this house as you could be in your own home im sure of that i know mrs bowen she has her little worldlinesses and unrealities of manner but she is truth and loyalty itself she would rather die than be false or even unfair i knew her long ago  yes cried the girl long before you knew me  and i know her to be the soul of honour said colville ignoring the childish outburst honourlike a mans he added and imogene i want you to promise me that youll not think of her any more in that way i want you to think of her as faithful and loving to you for she is so will you do it  imogene did not answer him at once then she turned upon him a face of radiant selfabnegation i will do anything you tell me only tell me things to do  the next time he came he again saw mrs bowen alone before imogene appeared the conversation was confined to two sentences  mr colville she said with perfectly tranquil point while she tilted a shut book to and fro on her knee i will thank you not to defend me  had she overheard had imogene told her he answered in a fury of resentment for her ingratitude that stupefied him i will never speak of you again  now they were enemies he did not know how or why but he said to himself in the bitterness of his heart that it was better so and when imogene appeared and mrs bowen vanished as she did without another word to him he folded the girl in a vindictive embrace  what is the matter she asked pushing away from him  with me  yes you seem so excited  oh nothing he said shrinking from the sharpness of that scrutiny in a womans eyes which when it begins the perusal of a mans soul astonishes and intimidates him he never perhaps becomes able to endure it with perfect selfcontrol i suppose a slight degree of excitement in meeting you may be forgiven me he smiled under the unrelaxed severity of her gaze  was mrs bowen saying anything about me  not a word said colville glad of getting back to the firm truth again even if it were mere literality  we have made it up she said her scrutiny changing to a lovely appeal for his approval what there was to make up  yes  i told her what you had said and now its all right between us and you mustnt be troubled at that any more i did it to please you  she seemed to ask him with the last words whether she really had pleased him as if something in his aspect suggested a doubt and he hastened to reassure her that was very good of you i appreciate it highly its extremely gratifying  she broke into a laugh of fond derision i dont believe you really cared about it or else youre not thinking about it now sit down here i want to tell you of something ive thought out she pulled him to the sofa and put his arm about her waist with a simple fearlessness and matterofcourse promptness that made him shudder he felt that he ought to tell her not to do it but he did not quite know how without wounding her she took hold of his hand and drew his lax arm taut then she looked up into his eyes as if some sense of his misgiving had conveyed itself to her but she did not release her hold of his hand  perhaps we oughtnt if were not engaged she suggested with such utter trust in him as made his heart quake  oh he sighed from a complexity of feeling that no explanation could wholly declare were engaged enough for that i suppose  im glad you think so she answered innocently i knew you wouldnt let me if it were not right having settled the question of course she continued we shall all do our best to keep our secret but in spite of everything it may get out do you see  well  well of course it will make a great deal of remark  oh yes you must be prepared for that imogene said colville with as much gravity as he could make comport with his actual position  i am prepared for it and prepared to despise it answered the girl i shall have no trouble except the fear that you will mind it she pressed his hand as if she expected him to say something to this  i shall never care for it he said and this was true enough my only care will be to keep you from regretting i have tried from the first to make you see that i was very much older than you it would be miserable enough if you came to see it too late  i have never seen it and i never shall see it because theres no such difference between us it isnt the years that make us young or oldwho is it says that no matter its true and i want you to believe it i want you to feel that i am your youththe youth you were robbed ofgiven back to you will you do it oh if you could i should be the happiest girl in the world tears of fervour dimmed the beautiful eyes which looked into his dont speak she hurried on i wont let you till i have said it all its been this idea this hope with me alwaysever since i knew what happened to you here long agothat you might go back in my life and take up yours where it was broken off that i might make your life what it would have beencomplete your destiny  colville wrenched himself loose from the hold that had been growing more tenderly close and clinging and do you think i could be such a vampire as to let you yes yes i have had my dreams of such a thing but i see now how hideous they were you shall make no such sacrifice to me you must put away the fancies that could never be fulfilled or if by some infernal magic they could would only bring sorrow to you and shame to me god forbid and god forgive me if i have done or said anything to put this in your head and thank god it isnt too late yet for you to take yourself back  oh she murmured do you think it is selfsacrifice for me to give myself to you its selfglorification you dont understandi havent told you what i mean or else ive told it in such a way that ive made it hateful to you do you think i dont care for you except to be something to you im not so generous as that you are all the world to me if i take myself back from you as you say what shall i do with myself  has it come to that asked colville he sat down again with her and this time he put his arm around her and drew her to him but it seemed to him he did it as if she were his child i was going to tell you just now that each of us lived to himself in this world and that no one could hope to enter into the life of another and complete it but now i see that i was partly wrong we two are bound together imogene and whether we become all in all or nothing to each other we can have no separate fate  the girls eyes kindled with rapture then let us never speak of it again i was going to say something but now i wont say it  yes say it  no it will make you think that i am anxious on my own account about appearances before people  you poor child i shall never think you are anxious on your own account about anything what were you going to say  oh nothing it was onlyare you invited to the phillipses fancy ball  yes said colville silently making what he could of the diversion i believe so  and are you goingdid you mean to go she asked timidly  good heavens no what in the world should i do at another fancy ball i walked about with the airy grace of a bull in a china shop at the last one  imogene did not smile she faintly sighed well then i wont go either  did you intend to go  oh no  why of course you did and its very right you should did you want me to go  it would bore you  not if youre there she gave his hand a grateful pressure come ill go of course imogene a fancy ball to please you is a very different thing from a fancy ball in the abstract  oh what nice things you say do you know i always admired your compliments i think theyre the most charming compliments in the world  i dont think theyre half so pretty as yours but theyre more sincere  no honestly they flatter and at the same time they make fun of the flattery a little they make a person feel that you like them even while you laugh at them  they appear to be rather an intricate kind of complimentsort of salsa agradolce affairtutti frutti stylespecies of moral mayonnaise  nobe quiet you know what i mean what were we talking about oh i was going to say that the most fascinating thing about you always was that ironical way of yours  have i an ironical way you were going to tell me something more about the fancy ball  i dont care for it i would rather talk about you  and i prefer the ball its a fresher topicto me  very well then but this i will say no matter how happy you should be i should always want you to keep that tone of persiflage youve no idea how perfectly intoxicating it is  oh yes i have it seems to have turned the loveliest and wisest head in the world  oh do you really think so i would give anything if you did  what  think i was pretty she pleaded with full eyes do you  no but i think you are wise fifty per cent of truthits a large average in compliments what are you going to wear  wear oh at the ball something egyptian i suppose its to be an egyptian ball didnt you understand that  oh yes but i supposed you could go in any sort of dress  you cant you must go in some egyptian character  how would moses do in the bulrushes you know you could be pharaohs daughter and recognise me by my three hats and toward the end of the evening when i became very much bored i could go round killing egyptians  no no be serious though i like you to joke too i shall always want you to joke shall you always  there may be emergencies when i shall faillike family prayers and grace before meat and dangerous sickness  why of course but i mean when were together and theres no reason why you shouldnt  oh at such times i shall certainly joke  and before people too i wont have them saying that its sobered youthat you used to be very gay and now youre cross and never say anything  i will try to keep it up sufficiently to meet the public demand  and i shall want you to joke me too you must satirise me it does more to show me my faults than anything else and it will show other people how perfectly submissive i am and how i think everything you do is just right  if i were to beat you a little in company dont you think it would serve the same purpose  no no be serious  about joking  no about me i know that im very intense and you must try to correct that tendency in me  i will with pleasure which of my tendencies are you going to correct  you have none  well then neither have you im not going to be outdone in civilities  oh if people could only hear you talk in this light way and then know what i know  colville broke out into a laugh at the deep sigh which accompanied these words as a whole the thing was grotesque and terrible to him but after a habit of his he was finding a strange pleasure in its details  no no she pleaded dont laugh there are girls that would give their eyes for it  as pretty eyes as yours  do you think theyre nice  yes if they were not so mysterious  mysterious  yes i feel that your eyes cant really be as honest as they look that was what puzzled me about them the first night i saw you  nodid it really  i went home saying to myself that no girl could be so sincere as that miss graham seemed  did you say that  words to that effect  and what do you think now  ah i dont know you had better go as the sphinx  imogene laughed in simple gaiety of heart  how far weve got from the ball she said as if the remote excursion were a triumph what shall we really go as  isis and osiris  werent they gods of some kind  little onehorse deitiesnot very much  it wont do to go as gods of any kind theyre always failures people expect too much of them  yes said colville thats human nature under all circumstances but why go to an egyptian ball at all  oh we must go if we both stayed away it would make talk at once and my object is to keep people in the dark till the very last moment of course its unfortunate your having told mrs amsden that you were going away and then telling her just after you came back with me that you were going to stay but it cant be helped now and i dont really care for it but dont you see why i want you to go to all these things  all these things  yes everything youre invited to after this its not merely for a blind as regards ourselves now but if they see that youre very fond of all sorts of gaieties they will see that you arethey will understand  there was no need for her to complete the sentence colville rose come come my dear child he said why dont you end all this at once i dont blame you heaven knows i blame no one but myself i ought to have the strength to break away from this mistake but i havent i couldnt bear to see you suffer from pain that i should give you even for your good but do it yourself imogene and for pitys sake dont forbear from any notion of sparing me i have no wish except for your happiness and now i tell you clearly that no appearance we can put on before the world will deceive the world at the end of all our trouble i shall still be forty  she sprang to him and put her hand over his mouth i know what youre going to say and i wont let you say it for youve promised over and over again not to speak of that any more oh do you think i care for the world or what it will think or say  yes very much  that shows how little you understand me its because i wish to defy the world  imogene be as honest with yourself as you are with me  i am honest  look me in the eyes then  she did so for an instant and then hid her face on his shoulder  you silly girl he said what is it you really do wish  i wish there was no one in the world but you and me  ah youd find it very crowded at times said colville sadly well well he added ill go to your fandangoes because you want me to go  thats all i wished you to say she replied lifting her head and looking him radiantly in the face i dont want you to go at all i only want you to promise that youll come here every night that youre invited out and read to mrs bowen and me  oh i cant do that said colville im too fond of society for example ive been invited to an egyptian fancy ball and i couldnt think of giving that up  oh how delightful you are they couldnt any of them talk like you  he had learned to follow the processes of her thought now perhaps they can when they come to my age  there she exclaimed putting her hand on his mouth again to remind him of another broken promise why cant you give up the egyptian ball  because i expect to meet a young lady therea very beautiful young lady  but how shall you know her if shes disguised  why i shall be disguised too you know  oh what delicious nonsense you do talk sit down here and tell me what you are going to wear  she tried to pull him back to the sofa what character shall you go in  no no he said resisting the gentle traction i cant i have urgent business downtown  oh business in florence  well if i stayed i should tell you what disguise im going to the ball in  i knew it was that what do you think would be a good character for me  i dont know the serpent of old nile would be pretty good for you  oh i know you dont think it she cried fondly she had now let him take her hand and he stood holding it at armslength effie bowen came into the room goodbye said imogene with an instant assumption of society manner  goodbye said colville and went out  oh mr colville she called before he got to the outer door  yes he said starting back  she met him midway of the dim corridor only to she put her arms about his neck and sweetly kissed him  colville went out into the sunlight feeling like some strange newly invented kind of scoundrela rascal of such recent origin and introduction that he had not yet had time to classify himself and ascertain the exact degree of his turpitude the task employed his thoughts all that day and kept him vibrating between an instinctive conviction of monstrous wickedness and a logical and wellreasoned perception that he had all the facts and materials for a perfectly good conscience he was the betrothed lover of this poor child whose affection he could not check without a degree of brutality for which only a better man would have the courage when he thought of perhaps refusing her caresses he imagined the shock it would give her and the look of grief and mystification that would come into her eyes and he found himself incapable of that cruel rectitude he knew that these were the impulses of a white and loving soul but at the end of all his argument they remained a terror to him so that he lacked nothing but the will to fly from florence and shun her altogether till she had heard from her family this he recalled with bitter selfreproach was what had been his first inspiration he had spoken of it to mrs bowen and it had still everything in its favour except that it was impossible  imogene returned to the salotto where the little girl was standing with her face to the window drearily looking out her back expressed an inner desolation which revealed itself in her eyes when imogene caught her head between her hands and tilted up her face to kiss it  what is the matter effie she demanded gaily  nothing  oh yes there is  nothing that you will care for as long as hes pleasant to you you dont care what he does to me  what has he done to you  he didnt take the slightest notice of me when i came into the room he didnt speak to me or even look at me  imogene caught the little grieving quivering face to her breast he is a wicked wicked wretch and i will give him the awfulest scolding he ever had when he comes here again i will teach him to neglect my pet i will let him understand that if he doesnt notice you he neednt notice me i will tell you effieive just thought of a way the next time he comes we will both receive him we will sit up very stiffly on the sofa together and just answer yes no yes no to everything he says till he begins to take the hint and learns how to behave himself will you  a smile glittered through the little girls tears but she asked do you think it would be very polite  no matter polite or not its what he deserves of course as soon as he begins to take the hint we will be just as we always are  imogene despatched a note which colville got the next morning to tell him of his crime and apprise him of his punishment and of the sweet compunction that had pleaded for him in the breast of the child if he did not think he could help play the comedy through he must come prepared to offer effie some sort of atonement  it was easy to do this to come with his pockets full of presents and take the little girl on his lap and pour out all his troubled heart in the caresses and tendernesses which would bring him no remorse he humbled himself to her thoroughly and with a strange sincerity in the harmless duplicity and promised if she would take him back into favour that he would never offend again mrs bowen had sent word that she was not well enough to see him she had another of her headaches and he sent back a sympathetic and respectful message by effie who stood thoughtfully at her mothers pillow after she had delivered it fingering the bouquet colville had brought her and putting her head first on this side and then on that to admire it  i think mr colville and imogene are much more affectionate than they used to be she said  mrs bowen started up on her elbow what do you mean effie  oh theyre both so good to me  yes said her mother dropping back to her pillow both  yes hes the most affectionate  the mother turned her face the other way then he must be she murmured  what asked the child  nothing i didnt know i spoke  the little girl stood a while still playing with her flowers i think mr colville is about the pleasantest gentleman that comes here dont you mamma  yes  hes so interesting and says such nice things i dont know whether children ought to think of such things but i wish i was going to marry some one like mr colville of course i should want to be tolerably old if i did how old do you think a person ought to be to marry him  you mustnt talk of such things effie said her mother  no i suppose it isnt very nice she picked out a bud in her bouquet and kissed it then she held the nosegay at armslength before her and danced away with it       xvii   in the ensuing fortnight a great many gaieties besides the egyptian ball took place and colville went wherever he and imogene were both invited he declined the quiet dinners which he liked and which his hearty appetite and his habit of talk fitted him to enjoy and accepted invitations to all sorts of evenings and at homes where dancing occupied a modest corner of the card and usurped the chief place in the pleasures at these places it was mainly his business to see imogene danced with by others but sometimes he waltzed with her himself and then he was complimented by people of his own age who had left off dancing upon his vigour they said they could not stand that sort of thing though they supposed if you kept yourself in practice it did not come so hard one of his hostesses who had made a party for her daughters told him that he was an example to everybody and that if middleaged people at home mingled more in the amusements of the young american society would not be the silly insipid boyandgirl affair that it was now he went to these places in the character of a young man but he was not readily accepted or recognised in that character they gave him frumps to take out to supper mothers and maiden aunts and if the mothers were youngish they threw off on him and did not care for his talk  at one of the parties imogene seemed to become aware for the first time that the lapels of his dresscoat were not faced with silk  why dont you have them so she asked all the other young men have and you ought to wear a boutonnière  oh i think a man looks rather silly in silk lapels at my he arrested himself and then continued ill see what the tailor can do for me in the meantime give me a bud out of your bouquet  how sweet you are she sighed you do the least thing so that it is ten times as good as if any one else did it  the same evening as he stood leaning against a doorway behind imogene and a young fellow with whom she was beginning a quadrille he heard her taking him to task  why do you say sir to mr colville  well i know the english laugh at us for doing it and say its like servants but i never feel quite right answering just yes and no to a man of his age  this was one of the inglehart boys whom he met at nearly all of these parties and not all of whom were so respectful some of them treated him upon an oldboy theory joking him as freely as if he were one of themselves laughing his antiquated notions of art to scorn but condoning them because he was goodnatured and because a man could not help being of his own epoch anyway they put a caricature of him among the rest on the walls of their trattoria where he once dined with them  mrs bowen did not often see him when he went to call upon imogene and she was not at more than two or three of the parties mrs amsden came to chaperon the girl and apparently suffered an increase of unrequited curiosity in regard to his relations to the bowen household and the extraordinary development of his social activity colville not only went to all those evening parties but he was in continual movement during the afternoon at receptions and at days of which he began to think each lady had two or three here he drank tea cup after cup in reckless excitement and at night when he came home from the dancing parties dropping with fatigue he could not sleep till toward morning he woke at the usual breakfasthour and then went about drowsing throughout the day till the tea began again in the afternoon he fell asleep whenever he sat down not only in the readingroom at viesseuxs where he disturbed the people over their newspapers by his demonstrations of somnolence but even at church whither he went one sunday to please imogene and started awake during the service with the impression that the clergyman had been making a joke everybody but imogene was smiling at the café he slept without scruple selecting a corner seat for the purpose and proportioning his buonamano to the indulgence of the giovane he could not tell how long he slept at these places but sometimes it seemed to him hours  one day he went to see imogene and while effie bowen stood prattling to him as he sat waiting for imogene to come in he faded lightheadedly away from himself on the sofa as if he had been in his corner at the café then he was aware of some one saying sh and he saw effie bowen with her finger on her lip turned toward imogene a figure of beautiful despair in the doorway he was all tucked up with sofa pillows and made very comfortable by the child no doubt she slipped out seeing him awake so as to leave him and imogene alone as she had apparently been generally instructed to do and imogene came forward  what is the matter theodore she asked patiently she had taken to calling him theodore when they were alone she owned that she did not like the name but she said it was right she should call him by it since it was his she came and sat down beside him where he had raised himself to a sitting posture but she did not offer him any caress  nothing he answered but this climate is making me insupportably drowsy or else the spring weather  oh no it isnt that she said with a slight sigh he had left her in the middle of a german at three oclock in the morning but she now looked as fresh and lambent as a star its the late hours theyre killing you  colville tried to deny it his incoherencies dissolved themselves in a yawn which he did not succeed in passing for a careless laugh  it wont do she said as if speaking to herself no it wont do  oh yes it will colville protested i dont mind being up ive been used to it all my life on the paper its just some temporary thing itll come all right  well no matter said imogene it makes you ridiculous going to all those silly places and id rather give it up  the tears began to steal down her cheeks and colville sighed it seemed to him that somebody or other was always crying a man never quite gets used to the tearfulness of women  oh dont mind it he said if you wish me to go i will go or die in the attempt he added with a smile  imogene did not smile with him i dont wish you to go any more it was a mistake in the first place and from this out i will adapt myself to you  and give up all your pleasures do you think i would let you do that no indeed neither in this nor in anything else i will not cut off your young life in any way imogenenot shorten it or diminish it if i thought i should do that or you would try to do it for me i should wish i had never seen you  it isnt that i know how good you are and that you would do anything for me  well then why dont you go to these fandangoes alone i can see that you have me on your mind all the time when im with you  oughtnt i  yes up to a certain point but not up to the point of spoiling your fun i will drop in now and then but i wont try to come to all of them after this youll get along perfectly well with mrs amsden and i shall be safe from her for a while that old lady has marked me for her prey i can see it in her glittering eyeglass i shall fall asleep some evening between dances and then she will get it all out of me  imogene still refused to smile no i shall give it up i dont think its well going so much without mrs bowen people will begin to talk  talk  yes they will begin to say that i had better stay with her a little more if she isnt well  why isnt mrs bowen well asked colville with trepidation  no shes miserable havent you noticed  she sees me so seldom now i thought it was only her headaches  its much more than that she seems to be failing every way the doctor has told her she ought to get away from florence colville could not speak imogene went on shes always delicate you know and i feel that all thats keeping her here now is the news from home that iwere waiting for  colville got up this is ghastly she mustnt do it  how can you help her doing it if she thinks anything is right she cant help doing it who could  colville thought to himself that he could have said but he was silent at the moment he was not equal to so much joke or so much truth and imogene went on  shed be all the more strenuous about it if it were disagreeable and rather than accept any relief from me she would die  is sheunkind to you faltered colville  she is only too kind you can feel that shes determined to be sothat shes said she will have nothing to reproach herself with and she wont you dont suppose mrs bowen would be unkind to any one she disliked  ah i didnt know sighed colville  the more she disliked them the better she would use them its because our engagement is so distasteful to her that shes determined to feel that she did nothing to oppose it  but how can you tell that its distasteful then  she lets you feel it bynot saying anything about it  i cant see how  she never speaks of you i dont believe she ever mentions your name she asks me about the places where ive been and about the peopleevery one but you its very uncomfortable  yes said colville its uncomfortable  and if i allude to letters from home she merely presses her lips together its perfectly wretched  i see its i whom she dislikes and i would do anything to please her she must know that mused colville aloud imogene he exclaimed with a sudden inspiration why shouldnt i go away  go away she palpitated what should i do  the colours faded from his brilliant proposal oh i only meant till something was settleddeterminedconcluded till this terrible suspense was over he added hopelessly but nothing can be done  i proposed said imogene that we should all go away i suggested via reggiothe doctor said she ought to have sea airor venice but she wouldnt hear of it no we must wait  yes we must wait repeated colville hollowly then nothing can be done  why havent you said it  oh yesyes i cant go away and you cant but couldnt we do somethingget up something  i dont know what you mean  i mean couldnt weamuse her somehow help her to take her mind off herself  imogene stared at him rather a long time then as if she had satisfied herself in her own mind she shook her head she wouldnt submit to it  no she seems to take everything amiss that i do said colville  she has no right to do that cried imogene im sure that youre always considering her and proposing to do things for her i wont let you humble yourself as if you had wronged her  oh i dont call it humbling ii should only be too happy if i could do anything that was agreeable to her  very well i will tell her said the girl haughtily shall you object to my joining you in your amusements whatever they are i assure you i will be very unobtrusive  i dont understand all this replied colville who has proposed to exclude you why did you tell me anything about mrs bowen if you didnt want me to say or do something i supposed you did but ill withdraw the offensive proposition whatever it was  there was nothing offensive but if you pity her so much why cant you pity me a little  i didnt know anything was the matter with you i thought you were enjoying yourself  enjoying keeping you up at dances till you drop asleep whenever you sit down and then coming home and talking to a person who wont mention your name do you call that enjoying i cant speak of you to any one and no one speaks to me  if you like i will talk to you on the subject colville essayed in dreary jest  oh dont joke about it this perpetual joking i believe its that thats wearing me out when i come to you for a little comfort in circumstances that drive me almost distracted you want to amuse mrs bowen and when i ask to be allowed to share in the amusement you laugh at me if you dont understand it all im sure i dont  imogene  no its very strange theres only one explanation you dont care for me  not care for you cried colville thinking of his sufferings in the past fortnight  and i would have made anyany sacrifice for you at least i wouldnt have made you show yourself a mean and grudging person if you had come to me for a little sympathy  o poor child he cried and his heart ached with the sense that she really was nothing but an unhappy child i do sympathise with you and i see how hard it is for you to manage with mrs bowens dislike for me but you mustnt think of if i dare say it will be different ive no doubt we can get her to look at me in some brighter light i he did not know what he should urge next but he goaded his invention and was able to declare that if they loved each other they needed not regard any one else this flight when accomplished did not strike him as very original effect and it was with a dull surprise that he saw it sufficed for her  no no one she exclaimed accepting the platitude as if it were now uttered for the first time she dried her eyes and smiled i will tell mrs bowen how you feel and what youve said and i know she will appreciate your generosity  yes said colville pensively theres nothing i wont propose doing for people  she suddenly clung to him and would not let him go oh what is the matter she moaned afresh i show out the worst that is in me and only the worst do you think i shall always be so narrowminded with you i thought i loved you enough to be magnanimous you are it seemed to me that our lives together would be grand and large and here i am grovelling in the lowest selfishness i am worrying and scolding you because you wish to please some one that has been as good as my own mother to me do you call that noble  colville did not venture any reply to a demand evidently addressed to her own conscience  but when she asked if he really thought he had better go away he said oh no that was a mistake  because if you do you shallto punish me  my dearest girl why should i wish to punish you  because ive been low and mean now i want you to do something for mrs bowensomething to amuse her to show that we appreciate her and i dont want you to sympathise with me at all when i ask for your sympathy its a sign that i dont deserve it  is that so  oh be serious with me i mean it and i want to beg your pardon for something  yes whats that  cant you guess  no  you neednt have your lapels silklined you neednt wear boutonnières  oh but ive had the coat changed  no matter change it back it isnt for me to make you over i must make myself over its my right its my sacred privilege to conform to you in every way and i humble myself in the dust for having forgotten it at the very start oh do you think i can ever be worthy of you i will try indeed i will i shall not wear my light dresses another time from this out i shall dress more in keeping with you i boasted that i should live to comfort and console you to recompense you for the past and what have i been doing wearying and degrading you  oh no pleaded colville i am very comfortable i dont need any compensation for the past i needsleep im going to bed tonight at eight oclock and i am going to sleep twentyfour hours then i shall be fresh for mrs flemings ball  im not going said imogene briefly  oh yes you are ill come round tomorrow evening and see  no there are to be no more parties  why  i cant endure them  she was looking at him and talking at him but she seemed far aloof in the abstraction of a sublime regret she seemed puzzled bewildered at herself  colville got away he felt the pathos of the confusion and question to which he left her but he felt himself powerless against it there was but one solution to it all and that was impossible he could only grieve over her trouble and wait grieve for the irrevocable loss which made her trouble remote and impersonal to him and submit       xviii   the young clergyman whom colville saw talking to imogene on his first evening at mrs bowens had come back from rome where he had been spending a month or two and they began to meet at palazzo pinti again if they got on well enough together they did not get on very far the suave housepriest manners of the young clergyman offended colville he could hardly keep from sneering at his taste in art and books which in fact was rather conventional and no doubt mr morton had his own reserves under which he was perfectly civil and only too deferential to colville as to an older man since his return mrs bowen had come back to her salon she looked haggard but she did what she could to look otherwise she was always polite to colville and she was politely cordial with the clergyman sometimes colville saw her driving out with him and effie they appeared to make excursions and he had an impression very obscure that mrs bowen lent the young clergyman money that he was a superstition of hers and she a patron of his he must have been ten years younger than she not more than twentyfive  the first sunday after his return colville walked home with mr waters from hearing a sermon of mr mortons which they agreed was rather well judged and simply and fitly expressed  and he spoke with the authority of the priest said the old minister his church alone of all the protestant churches has preserved that to its ministers sometimes i have thought it was a great thing  not always asked colville with a smile  these things are matters of mood rather than conviction with me returned mr waters once they affected me very deeply but now i shall so soon know all about it that they dont move me but at times i think that if i were to live my life over again i would prefer to be of some formal some inflexibly ritualised religion at solemnitiesweddings and funeralsi have been impressed with the advantage of the anglican rite it is the church speaking to and for humanityor seems so he added with cheerful indifference something in its favour he continued after a while is the influence that every ritualised faith has with women if they apprehend those mysteries more subtly than we such a preference of theirs must mean a good deal yes the other protestant systems are mens systems women must have form they dont care for freedom  they appear to like the formalist too as well as the form said colville with scorn not obviously necessary  oh yes they must have everything in the concrete said the old gentleman cheerfully  i wonder where mr morton met mrs bowen first said colville  here i think i believe he had letters to her before you came i used often to meet him at her house i think she has helped him with money at times  isnt that rather an unpleasant idea  yes its disagreeable and it places the ministry in a dependent attitude but under our system its unavoidable young men devoting themselves to the ministry frequently receive gifts of money  i dont like it cried colville  they dont feel it as others would i didnt myself even at present i may be said to be living on charity but sometimes i have fancied that in mr mortons case there might be peculiarly mitigating circumstances  what do you mean  when i met him first at mrs bowens i used to think that it was miss graham in whom he was interested  i can assure you interrupted colville that she was never interested in him  oh no i didnt suppose that returned the old man tranquilly and ive since had reason to revise my opinion i think he is interested in mrs bowen  mrs bowen and you think that would be a mitigating circumstance in his acceptance of money from her if he had the spirit of a man at all it would make it all the more revolting  oh no oh no softly pleaded mr waters we must not look at these things too romantically he probably reasons that she would give him all her money if they were married  but he has no right to reason in that way retorted colville with heat they are not married its ignoble and unmanly for him to count upon it its preposterous she must be ten years older than he  oh i dont say that theyre to be married mr waters replied but these disparities of age frequently occur in marriage i dont like them though sometimes i think the evil is less when it is the wife who is the elder we look at youth and age in a gross material way too often women remain young longer than men they keep their youthful sympathies an old woman understands a young girl do youor do iunderstand a young man  colville laughed harshly it isnt quite the same thing mr waters but yes ill admit for the sake of argument that i dont understand young men ill go further and say that i dont like them im afraid of them and you wouldnt think he added abruptly that it would be well for me to marry a girl twenty years younger than myself  the old man glanced up at him with innocent slyness i prefer always to discuss these things in an impersonal way  but you cant discuss them impersonally with me im engaged to miss graham ever since you first found me here after i told you i was going away i have wished to tell you this and this seems as good a time as anyor as bad the defiance faded from his voice which dropped to a note of weary sadness yes were engagedor shall be as soon as she can hear from her family i wanted to tell you because it seemed somehow your due and because i fancied you had a friendly interest in us both  yes that is true returned mr waters i wish you joy he went through the form of offering his hand to colville who pressed it with anxious fervour  i confess he said that i feel the risks of the affair its not that i have any dread for my own part i have lived my life such as it is but the child is full of fancies about me that cant be fulfilled she dreams of restoring my youth somehow of retrieving the past for me of avenging me at her own cost for an unlucky love affair that i had here twenty years ago its pretty of her but its terribly patheticits tragic i know very well that im a middleaged man and that theres no more youth for me im getting grey and im getting fat i wouldnt be young if i could its a bore i suppose i could keep up an illusion of youthfulness for five or six years more and then if i could be quietly chloroformed out of the way perhaps it wouldnt have been so very bad  i have always thought said mr waters dreamily that a good deal might be said for abbreviating hopeless suffering i have known some very good people advocate its practice by science  yes answered colville perhaps ive presented that point too prominently what i wished you to understand was that i dont care for myself that i consider only the happiness of this young girl thats somehowi hardly know howbeen put in my keeping i havent forgotten the talks that weve had heretofore on this subject and it would be affectation and bad taste in me to ignore them dont be troubled at anything youve said it was probably true and im sure it was sincere sometimes i think that the kindestthe least cruelthing i could do would be to break with her to leave her but i know that i shall do nothing of the kind i shall drift the child is very dear to me she has great and noble qualities shes supremely unselfish she loves me through her mistaken pity and because she thinks she can sacrifice herself to me but she cant everything is against that she doesnt know how and there is no reason why i dont express it very well i think nobody clearly understands it but mrs bowen and ive somehow alienated her  he became aware that his selfabnegation was taking the character of selfpity and he stopped  mr waters seemed to be giving the subject serious attention in the silence that ensued there is this to be remembered he began which we dont consider in our mere speculations upon any phase of human affairs and that is the wonderful degree of amelioration that any given difficulty finds in the realisation it is the anticipation not the experience that is the trial in a case of this kind facts of temperament of mere association of union work unexpected mitigations they not only alleviate they allay you say that she cherishes an illusion concerning you well with women nothing is so indestructible as an illusion give them any chance at all and all the forces of their nature combine to preserve it and if as you say she is so dear to you that in itself is almost sufficient i can well understand your misgivings springing as they do from a sensitive conscience but we may reasonably hope that they are exaggerated very probably there will not be the rapture for her that there would be ifif you were younger but the chances of final happiness are greatyes very considerable she will learn to appreciate what is really best in you and you already understand her your love for her is the key to the future without that of course  oh of course interrupted colville hastily every touch of this comforters hand had been a sting and he parted with him in that feeling of utter friendlessness involving a man who has taken counsel upon the confession of half his trouble  something in mrs bowens manner when he met her next made him think that perhaps imogene had been telling her of the sympathy he had expressed for her illhealth it was in the evening and imogene and mr morton were looking over a copy of the marble faun which he had illustrated with photographs at rome imogene asked colville to look at it too but he said he would examine it later he had his opinion of people who illustrated the marble faun with photographs it surprised him that she seemed to find something novel and brilliant in the idea  effie bowen looked round where she was kneeling on a chair beside the couple with the book and seeing colville wandering neglectedly about before he placed himself she jumped down and ran and caught his hand  well what now he asked with a dim smile as she began to pull him toward the sofa when he should be expelled from palazzo pinti he would really miss the worship of that little thing he knew that her impulse had been to console him for his exclusion from the pleasures that imogene and mr morton were enjoying  nothing just talk she said making him fast in a corner of the sofa by crouching tight against him  what about about which is the pleasantest season  oh no weve talked about that so often besides of course youd say spring now that its coming on so nicely  do you think im so changeable as that havent i always said winter when this question of the seasons was up and i say it now shant you be awfully sorry when you cant have a pleasant little fire on the hearth like this any more  yes i know but its very nice having the flowers too the grass was all full of daisies todayperfectly powdered with them  today where  at the cascine and in under the trees there were millions of violets and crowsfeet mr morton helped me to get them for mamma and imogene and we stayed so long that when we drove home the daisies had all shut up and the little pink leaves outside made it look like a field of red clover are you never going there any more  mrs bowen came in from the fact that there was no greeting between her and mr morton colville inferred that she was returning to the room after having already been there she stood a moment with a little uncertainty when she had shaken hands with him and then dropped upon the sofa beyond effie the little girl ran one hand through colvilles arm and the other through her mothers and gripped them fast now i have got you both she triumphed and smiled first into her face and then into his  be quiet effie said her mother but she submitted  i hope youre better for your drive today mrs bowen effie has been telling me about it  we stayed out a long time yes i think the air did me good but im not an invalid you know  oh no  im feeling a little fagged and the weather was tempting i suppose youve been taking one of your long walks  no ive scarcely stirred out i usually feel like going to meet the spring a little more than halfway but this year i dont somehow  a good many people are feeling rather languid i believe said mrs bowen  i hope youll get away from florence said colville  oh she returned with a faint flush im afraid imogene exaggerated that a little she added you are very good  she was treating him more kindly than she had ever done since that sunday afternoon when he came in with imogene to say that he was going to stay it might be merely because she had worn out her mood of severity as people do returning in goodhumour to those with whom they were offended merely through the reconciling force of time she did not look at him but this was better than meeting his eye with that interceptive glance a strange peace touched his heart imogene and the young clergyman at the table across the room were intent on the book still he was explaining and expatiating and she listening colville saw that he had a fine head and an intelligent handsome gentle face when he turned again to mrs bowen it was with the illusion that she had been saying something but she was in fact sitting mute and her face with its bright colour showed pathetically thin  i should imagine that venice would be good for you he said  its still very harsh there i hear no when we leave florence i think we will go to switzerland  oh not to madame schebress pleaded the child turning upon her  no not to madame schebres consented the mother she continued addressing colville i was thinking of lausanne do you know lausanne at all  only from gibbons report its hardly up to date  i thought of taking a house there for the summer said mrs bowen playing with effies fingers its pleasant by the lake i suppose  its lovely by the lake cried the child oh do go mamma i could get a boat and learn to row here you cant row the arnos so swift  the air would bring you up said colville to mrs bowen switzerlands the only country where youre perfectly sure of waking new every morning  this idea interested the child waking new she repeated  yes perfectly made over you wake up another person shouldnt you think that would be nice  no  well i shouldnt in your place but in mine i much prefer to wake up another person only its pretty hard on the other person  how queer you are the child set her teeth for fondness of him and seizing his cheeks between her hands squeezed them hard admiring the effect upon his features which in some respects was not advantageous  effie cried her mother sternly and she dropped to her place again and laid hold of colvilles arm for protection you are really very rude i shall send you to bed  oh no dont mrs bowen he begged im responsible for these violences effie used to be a very well behaved child before she began playing with me its all my fault  they remained talking on the sofa together while imogene and mr morton continued to interest themselves in the book from time to time she looked over at them and then turned again to the young clergyman who when he had closed the book rested his hands on its top and began to give an animated account of something conjecturably his sojourn in rome  in a low voice and with pauses adjusted to the occasional silences of the young people across the room mrs bowen told colville how mr morton was introduced to her by an old friend who was greatly interested in him she said frankly that she had been able to be of use to him and that he was now going back to america very soon it was as if she were privy to the conjecture that had come to the surface in his talk with mr waters and wished him to understand exactly how matters stood with the young clergyman and herself colville indeed began to be more tolerant of him he succeeded in praising the sermon he had heard him preach  oh he has talent said mrs bowen  they fell into the old almost domestic strain from which she broke at times with an effort but returning as if helplessly to it he had the gift of knowing how not to take an advantage with women that sense of unconstraint in them fought in his favour when effie dropped her head wearily against his arm her mother even laughed in sending her off to bed she had hitherto been serious imogene said she would go to see her tucked in and that sent the clergyman to say goodnight to mrs bowen and to put an end to colvilles audience  in these days when colville came every night to palazzo pinti he got back the tone he had lost in the past fortnight he thought that it was the complete immunity from his late pleasures and the regular and sufficient sleep which had set him firmly on his feet again but he did not inquire very closely imogene went two or three times after she had declared she would go no more from the necessity women feel of blunting the edge of comment but colville profited instantly and fully by the release from the parties which she offered him he did not go even to afternoon teadrinkings the days of the different ladies which he had been so diligent to observe knew him no more at the hours when society assembled in this house or that and inquired for him or wondered about him he was commonly taking a nap and he was punctually in bed every night at eleven after his return from mrs bowens  he believed of course that he went there because he now no longer met imogene elsewhere and he found the house pleasanter than it had ever been since the veglione mrs bowens relenting was not continuous however there were times that seemed to be times of question and of struggle with her when she vacillated between the old cordiality and the later alienation when she went beyond the former or lapsed into moods colder and more repellent than the latter it would have been difficult to mark the moment when these struggles ceased altogether and an evening passed in unbroken kindness between them but afterwards colville could remember an emotion of grateful surprise at a subtle word or action of hers in which she appeared to throw all restraintscruple or rancour whichever it might beto the winds and become perfectly his friend again it must have been by compliance with some wish or assent to some opinion of his what he knew was that he was not only permitted he was invited to feel himself the most favoured guest the charming smile so small and sweet so very near to bitterness came back to her lips the deeply fringed eyelids were lifted to let the sunny eyes stream upon him she did now whatever he asked her she consulted his taste and judgment on many points she consented to resume when she should be a little stronger their visits to the churches and galleries it would be a shame to go away from florence without knowing them thoroughly it came to her asking him to drive with her and imogene in the cascine and when imogene made some excuse not to go mrs bowen did not postpone the drive but took colville and effie  they drove quite down to the end of the cascine and got out there to admire the gay monument with the painted bust of the poor young indian prince who died in florence they strolled all about talking of the old times in the cascine twenty years before and walking up the road beside the canal while the carriage slowly followed they stopped to enjoy the peasants lying asleep in the grass on the other bank colville and effie gathered wildflowers and piled them in her mothers lap when she remounted to the carriage and drove along while they made excursions into the little dingles beside the road some people who overtook them in these sylvan pleasures reported the fact at a reception to which they were going and mrs amsden whose mind had been gradually clearing under the simultaneous withdrawal of imogene and colville from society professed herself again as thickly clouded as a weatherglass before a storm she appealed to the sympathy of others against this hardship  mrs bowen took colville home to dinner mr morton was coming she said and he must come too at table the young clergyman made her his compliment on her look of health and she said yes she had been driving and she believed that she needed nothing but to be in the air a little more as she very well could now the spring weather was really coming she said that they had been talking all winter of going to fiesole where imogene had never been yet and upon comparison it appeared that none of them had yet been to fiesole except herself then they must all go together she said the carriage would hold four very comfortably  ah that leaves me out said colville who had caught sight of effies fallen countenance  oh no how is that it leaves effie out  its the same thing but i might ride and effie might give me her hand to hold over the side of the carriage that would sustain me  we could take her between us mrs bowen suggested imogene the back seat is wide  then the party is made up said colville and effie hasnt demeaned herself by asking to go where she wasnt invited  the child turned inquiringly toward her mother who met her with an indulgent smile which became a little flush of grateful appreciation when it reached colville but mrs bowen ignored imogene in the matter altogether  the evening passed delightfully mr morton had another book which he had brought to show imogene and mrs bowen sat a long time at the piano striking this air and that of the songs which she used to sing when she was a girl colville was trying to recall them when he and imogene were left alone for their adieux they approached each other in an estrangement through which each tried to break  why dont you scold me she asked i have neglected you the whole evening  how have you neglected me  how ah if you dont know  no i dare say i must be very stupid i saw you talking with mr morton and you seemed interested i thought id better not intrude  she seemed uncertain of his intention and then satisfied of its simplicity  isnt it pleasant to have mrs bowen in the old mood again he asked  is she in the old mood  why yes havent you noticed how cordial she is  i thought she was rather colder than usual  colder the chill of the idea penetrated even through the density of colvilles selfish content a very complex emotion which took itself for indignation throbbed from his heart is she cold with you imogene  oh if you saw nothing  no and i think you must be mistaken she never speaks of you without praising you  does she speak of me asked the girl with her honest eyes wide open upon him  why no colville acknowledged come to reflect its i who speak of you but howhow is she cold with you  oh i dare say its a delusion of mine perhaps im cold with her  then dont be so my dear be sure that shes your friendtrue and good good night  he caught the girl in his arms and kissed her tenderly she drew away and stood a moment with her repellent fingers on his breast  is it all for me she asked  for the whole obliging and amiable world he answered gaily       xix   the next time colville came he found himself alone with imogene who asked him what he had been doing all day  oh living along till evening what have you  she did not answer at once nor praise his speech for the devotion implied in it after a while she said do you believe in courses of reading mr morton has taken up a course of reading in italian poetry he intends to master it  does he  yes do you think something of the kind would be good for me  oh if you thirst for conquest but i should prefer to rest on my laurels if i were you  imogene did not smile mr morton thinks i should enjoy a course of kingsley he says hes very earnest  oh immensely but arent you earnest enough already my dear  do you think im too earnest  no i should say you were just right  you know better than that i wish you would criticise me sometimes  oh id rather not  why dont you see anything to criticise in me are you satisfied with me in every way you ought to think you ought to think now do you think that i am doing right in all respects am i all that i could be to you and to you alone if i am wrong in the least thing criticise me and i will try to be better  oh you might criticise back and i shouldnt like that  then you dont approve of a course of kingsley asked the girl  does that follow but if youre going in for earnestness why dont you take up a course of carlyle  do you think that would be better than kingsley  not a bit but carlyles so earnest that he cant talk straight  i cant make out what you mean wouldnt you like me to improve  not much laughed colville if you did i dont know what i should do i should have to begin to improve too and im very comfortable as i am  i should wish to do it toto be more worthy of you grieved the girl as if deeply disappointed at his frivolous behaviour  he could not help laughing but he was sorry and would have taken her hand she kept it from him and removed to the farthest corner of the sofa apparently however her ideal did not admit of open pique and she went on trying to talk seriously with him  you think dont you that we oughtnt to let a day pass without storing away some thoughtsuggestion  oh theres no hurry he said lazily life is rather a long affairif you live there appears to be plenty of time though people say not and i think it would be rather odious to make every day of use let a few of them go by without doing anything for you and as for reading why not read when youre hungry just as you eat shouldnt you hate to take up a course of roast beef or a course of turkey  very well then said imogene i shall not begin kingsley  yes do it i dare say mr mortons quite right he will look at these things more from your own point of view all the kingsley novels are in the tauchnitz by all means do what he says  i will do what you say  oh but i say nothing  then i will do nothing  colville laughed at this too and soon after the clergyman appeared imogene met him so coldly that colville felt obliged to make him some amends by a greater show of cordiality than he felt but he was glad of the effort for he began to like him as he talked to him it was easy for him to like people the young man showed sense and judgment and if he was a little academic in his mind and manners colville tolerantly reflected that some people seemed to be born so and that he was probably not artificial as he had once imagined from the ecclesiastical scrupulosity of his dress  imogene ebbed away to the piano in the corner of the room and struck some chords on it at each stroke the young clergyman whose eyes had wandered a little toward her from the first seemed to vibrate in response the conversation became incoherent before mrs bowen joined them then by a series of illogical processes the clergyman was standing beside imogene at the piano and mrs bowen was sitting beside colville on the sofa  isnt there to be any effie tonight he asked  no she has been up too much of late and i wished to speak with youabout imogene  yes said colville not very eagerly at that moment he could have chosen another topic  it is time that her mother should have got my letter in less than a fortnight we ought to have an answer  well said colville with a strange constriction of the heart  her mother is a person of very strong character her husband is absorbed in business and defers to her in everything  it isnt an uncommon american situation said colville relieving his tension by this excursion  mrs bowen ignored it i dont know how she may look at the affair she may give her assent at once or she may decide that nothing has taken place tillshe sees you  i could hardly blame her for that he answered submissively  it isnt a question of that said mrs bowen its a question ofothers mr morton was here before you came and i know he was interested in imogenei am certain of it he has come back and he sees no reason why he should not renew his attentions  nooo faltered colville  i wish you to realise the fact  but what would you  i told you said mrs bowen with a full return of that severity whose recent absence colville had found so comfortable that i cant advise or suggest anything at all  he was long and miserably silent at last did you ever think he asked did you ever supposethat is to say did you ever suspect thatshethat imogene wasat all interested in him  i think she wasat one time said mrs bowen promptly  colville sighed with a wandering disposition to whistle  but that is nothing she went on people have many passing fancies the question is what are you going to do now i want to know as mr mortons friend  ah i wish you wanted to know as my friend mrs bowen a sudden thought flashed upon him why shouldnt i go away from florence till imogene hears from her mother that seemed to me right in the first place there is no tie that binds her to me i hold her to nothing if she finds in my absence that she likes this young man better an expression of mrs bowens face stopped him he perceived that he had said something very shocking to her he perceived that the thing was shocking in itself but it was not that which he cared for i dont mean that i wont hold myself true to her as long as she will i recognise my responsibility fully i know that i am answerable for all this and that no one else is and i am ready to bear any penalty but what i cant bear is that you should misunderstand me that you shouldi have been so wretched ever since you first began to blame me for my part in this and so happy this past fortnight that i canti wontgo back to that state of things no you have no right to relent toward me and then fling me off as you have tried to do tonight i have some feeling toosome rights you shall receive me as a friend or not at all how can i live if you  she had been making little efforts as if to rise now she forced herself to her feet and ran from the room  the young people looked up from their music some wave of the sensation had spread to them but seeing colville remain seated they went on with their playing till he rose then imogene called out isnt mrs bowen coming back  i dont know i think not answered colville stupidly standing where he had risen  she hastened questioning toward him what is the matter isnt she well  mr mortons face expressed a polite share in her anxiety  oh yes quite i believe colville replied  she heard effie call i suppose suggested the girl  yes yes i think so that isyes i must be going good night  he took her hand and went away leaving the clergyman still there but he lingered only for a report from mrs bowen which imogene hurried to get she sent word that she would join them presently but mr morion said that it was late already and he would beg miss graham to say goodnight for him when mrs bowen returned imogene was alone  she did not seem surprised or concerned at that imogene i have been talking to mr colville about you and mr morton  the girl started and turned pale  it is almost time to hear from your mother and she may consent to your engagement then you must be prepared to act  act  to make it known matters cant go on as they have been going i told mr colville that mr morton ought to know at once  why ought he to know asked imogene doubtless with that impulse to temporise which is natural to the human soul in questions of right and interest she sank into the chair beside which she had been standing  if your mother consents you will feel bound to mr colville  yes said the girl  and if she refuses  he has my word i will keep my word to him replied imogene huskily nothing shall make me break it  very well then exclaimed mrs bowen we need not wait for your mothers answer mr morton ought to know and he ought to know at once dont try to blind yourself imogene to what you see as plainly as i do he is in love with you  oh moaned the girl  yes you cant deny it and its cruel its treacherous to let him go on thinking that you are free  i will never see him again  ah that isnt enough he has a claim to know why i will not let him be treated so  they were both silent then what did mr colville say asked imogene  he i dont know that he said anything he mrs bowen stopped  imogene rose from her chair  i will not let him tell mr morton it would be too indelicate  and shall you let it go on so  no i will tell him myself  how will you tell him  i will tell him if he speaks to me  you will let it come to that  there is no other way i shall suffer more than he  but you will deserve to suffer and your suffering will not help him  imogene trembled into her chair again  i see said mrs bowen bitterly how it will be at last it will be as it has been from the first she began to walk up and down the room mechanically putting the chairs in place and removing the disorder in which the occupancy of several people leaves a room at the end of an evening she closed the piano which imogene had forgot to shut with a clash that jarred the strings from their silence but i will do it and i wonder  you will speak to him faltered the girl  yes returned mrs bowen vehemently and arresting herself in her rapid movements it wont do for you to tell him and you wont let mr colville  no i cant said imogene slowly shaking her head but i will discourage him i will not see him anymore mrs bowen silently confronted her i will not see any one now till i have heard from home  and how will that help he must have some explanation and i will have to make it what shall it be  imogene did not answer she said i will not have any one know what is between me and mr colville till i have heard from home if they try to refuse then it will be for him to take me against their will but if he doesnt choose to do that then he shall be free and i wont have him humiliated a second time before the world this time he shall be the one to reject and i dont care who suffers the more i prize the person the gladder i shall be and if i could suffer before everybody i would if people ever find it out i will tell them that it was he who broke it off she rose again from her chair and stood flushed and thrilling with the notion of her selfsacrifice out of the tortuous complexity of the situation she had evolved this brief triumph in which she rejoiced as if it were enduring success but she suddenly fell from it in the dust oh what can i do for him how can i make him feel more and more that i would give up anything everything for him its because he asks nothing and wants nothing that its so hard if i could see that he was unhappy as i did once if i could see that he was at all different sincesinceoh what i dread is this smooth tranquillity if our lives could only be stormy and full of cares and anxieties and troubles that i could take on myself then then i shouldnt be afraid of the future but im afraid they wont be sono im afraid that they will be easy and quiet and then what shall i do o mrs bowen do you think he cares for me  mrs bowen turned white she did not speak  the girl wrung her hands sometimes it seems as if he didntas if i had forced myself on him through a mistake and he had taken me to save me from the shame of knowing that i had made a mistake do you think that is true if you can only tell me that it isntor no if it is true tell me that that would be real mercy  the other trembled as if physically beaten upon by this appeal but she gathered herself together rigidly how can i answer you such a thing as that i mustnt listen to you you mustnt ask me she turned and left the girl standing still in her attitude of imploring but in her own room where she locked herself in sobs mingled with the laughter which broke crazily from her lips as she removed this ribbon and that jewel and pulled the bracelets from her wrists a man would have plunged from the house and walked the night away a woman must wear it out in her bed       xx   in the morning mrs bowen received a note from her banker covering a despatch by cable from america it was from imogenes mother it acknowledged the letters they had written and announced that she sailed that day for liverpool it was dated at new york and it was to be inferred that after perhaps writing in answer to their letters she had suddenly made up her mind to come out  yes that is it said imogene to whom mrs bowen hastened with the despatch why should she have telegraphed to you she asked coldly but with a latent fire of resentment in her tone  you must ask her when she comes returned mrs bowen with all her gentleness it wont be long now  they looked as if they had neither of them slept but the girls vigil seemed to have made her wild and fierce like some bird that has beat itself all night against its cage and still from time to time feebly strikes the bars with its wings mrs bowen was simply worn to apathy  what shall you do about this she asked  do about it oh i will think i will try not to trouble you  imogene  i shall have to tell mr colville but i dont know that i shall tell him at once give me the despatch please she possessed herself of it greedily offensively i shall ask you not to speak of it  i will do whatever you wish  thank you  mrs bowen left the room but she turned immediately to reopen the door she had closed behind her  we were to have gone to fiesole tomorrow she said inquiringly  we can still go if the day is fine returned the girl nothing is changed i wish very much to go couldnt we go today she added with eager defiance  its too late today said mrs bowen quietly i will write to remind the gentlemen  thank you i wish we could have gone today  you can have the carriage if you wish to drive anywhere said mrs bowen  i will take effie to see mrs amsden but imogene changed her mind and went to call upon two misses guicciardi the result of an international marriage whom mrs bowen did not like very well imogene drove with them to the cascine where they bowed to a numerous military acquaintance and they asked her if mrs bowen would let her join them in a theatre party that evening they were newyorkers by birth and it was to be a theatre party in the new york style they were to be chaperoned by a young married lady two young men cousins of theirs just out from america had taken the box  when imogene returned home she told mrs bowen that she had accepted this invitation mrs bowen said nothing but when one of the young men came up to hand imogene down to the carriage which was waiting with the others at the gate she could not have shown a greater tolerance of his secondrate new yorkiness if she had been a boston dowager offering him the scrupulous hospitalities of her city  imogene came in at midnight she hummed an air of the opera as she took off her wraps and ornaments in her room and this in the quiet of the hour had a terrible almost profane effect it was as if some other kind of girl had whistled she showed the same nonchalance at breakfast where she was prompt and answered mrs bowens inquiries about her pleasure the night before with a liveliness that ignored the polite resolution that prompted them  mr morton was the first to arrive and if his discouragement began at once the first steps masked themselves in a reckless welcome which seemed to fill him with joy and mrs bowen with silent perplexity the girl ran on about her evening at the opera and about the weather and the excursion they were going to make and after an apparently needless ado over the bouquet which he brought her together with one for mrs bowen she put it into her belt and made colville notice it when he came he had not thought to bring flowers  he turned from her hilarity with anxious question to mrs bowen who did not meet his eye and who snubbed effie when the child found occasion to whisper i think imogene is acting very strangely for her dont you mamma it seems as if going with those guicciardi girls just once had spoiled her  dont make remarks about people effie said her mother sharply it isnt nice in little girls and i dont want you to do it you talk too much lately  effie turned grieving away from this rejection and her face did not light up even at the whimsical sympathy in colvilles face who saw that she had met a check of some sort he had to take her on his knee and coax and kiss her before her wounded feelings were visibly healed he put her down with a sighing wish that some one could take him up and soothe his troubled sensibilities too and kept her hand in his while he sat waiting for the last of those last moments in which the hurrying delays of ladies preparing for an excursion seem never to end  when they were ready to get into the carriage the usual contest of selfsacrifice arose which imogene terminated by mounting to the front seat mr morton hastened to take the seat beside her and colville was left to sit with effie and her mother you old people will be safer back there said imogene it was a little joke which she addressed to the child but a gleam from her eye as she turned to speak to the young man at her side visited colville in desperate defiance he wondered what she was about in that allusion to an idea which she had shrunk from so sensitively hitherto but he found himself in a situation which he could not penetrate at any point when he spoke with mrs bowen it was with a dark undercurrent of conjecture as to how and when she expected him to tell mr morton of his relation to imogene or whether she still expected him to do it when his eyes fell upon the face of the young man he despaired as to the terms in which he should put the fact any form in which he tacitly dramatised it remained very embarrassing for he felt bound to say that while he held himself promised in the matter he did not allow her to feel herself so  a sky of american blueness and vastness a mellow sun and a delicate breeze did all that these things could for them as they began the long devious climb of the hills crowned by the ancient etruscan city at first they were all in the constraint of their own and one anothers moods known or imagined and no talk began till the young clergyman turned to imogene and asked after a long look at the smiling landscape what sort of weather do you suppose they are having at buffalo today  at buffalo she repeated as if the place had only a dim existence in her remotest consciousness oh the ice isnt near out of the lake yet you cant count on it before the first of may  and the first of may comes sooner or later according to the season said colville i remember coming on once in the middle of the month and the river was so full of ice between niagara falls and buffalo that i had to shut the car window that id kept open all the way through southern canada but we have very little of that local weather at home our weather is as democratic and continental as our political constitution here its march or may any time from september till june according as theres snow on the mountains or not  the young man smiled but dont you like he asked with deference this slow orderly advance of the italian spring where the flowers seem to come out one by one and every blossom has its appointed time  oh yes its very well in its way but i prefer the rush of the american spring no thought of mild weather this morning a warm gusty rain tomorrow night day after tomorrow a burst of blossoms and flowers and young leaves and birds i dont know whether we were made for our climate or our climate was made for us but its impatience and lavishness seem to answer some inner demand of our goahead souls this happens to be the week of the peach blossoms here and you see their pink everywhere today and you dont see anything else in the blossom line but imagine the american spring abandoning a whole week of her precious time to the exclusive use of peach blossoms she wouldnt do it shes got too many other things on hand  effie had stretched out over colvilles lap and with her elbow sunk deep in his knee was renting her chin in her hand and taking the facts of the landscape thoroughly in do they have just a week she asked  not an hour more or less said colville if they found an almond blossom hanging round anywhere after their time came they would make an awful row and if any lazy little peachblow hadnt got out by the time their week was up it would have to stay in till next year the pear blossoms wouldnt let it come out  wouldnt they murmured the child in dreamy sympathy with this belated peachblow  well thats what people say in america it would be allowed to come out any time its a free country  mrs bowen offered to draw effie back to a posture of more decorum but colville put his arm round the little girl oh let her stay it doesnt incommode me and she must be getting such a novel effect of the landscape  the mother fell back into her former attitude of jaded passivity he wondered whether she had changed her mind about having him speak to mr morton her quiescence might well have been indifference one could have said knowing the whole situation that she had made up her mind to let things take their course and struggle with them no longer  he could not believe that she felt content with him she must feel far otherwise and he took refuge as he had the power of doing from the discomfort of his own thoughts in jesting with the child and mocking her with this extravagance and that the discomfort then became merely a dull ache that insisted upon itself at intervals like a grumbling tooth  the prospect was full of that mingled wildness and subordination that gives its supreme charm to the italian landscape and without elements of great variety it combined them in infinite picturesqueness there were olive orchards and vineyards and again vineyards and olive orchards closer to the farmhouses and cottages there were peaches and other fruit trees and kitchengardens broad ribbons of grain waved between the ranks of trees around the white villas the spires of the cypresses pierced the blue air now and then they came to a villa with weatherbeaten statues strutting about its parterres a mild pleasant heat brooded upon the fields and roofs and the city dropping lower and lower as they mounted softened and blended its towers and monuments in a sombre mass shot with gleams of white  colville spoke to imogene who withdrew her eyes from it with a sigh after long brooding upon the scene you can do nothing with it i see  with what  the landscape its too full of every possible interest what a history is written all over it public and private if you dont take it simply like any other landscape it becomes an oppression its well that tourists come to italy so ignorant and keep so otherwise they couldnt live to get home again the past would crush them  imogene scrutinised him as if to extract some personal meaning from his words and then turned her head away the clergyman addressed him with what was like a respectful toleration of the drolleries of a gifted but eccentric man the flavour of whose talk he was beginning to taste  you dont really mean that one shouldnt come to italy as well informed as possible  well i did said colville but i dont  the young man pondered this and imogene started up with an air of rescuing them from each otheras if she would not let mr morton think colville trivial or colville consider the clergyman stupid but would do what she could to take their minds off the whole question perhaps she was not very clear as to how this was to be done at any rate she did not speak and mrs bowen came to her support from whatever motive of her own it might have been from a sense of the injustice of letting mr morton suffer from the complications that involved herself and the others the affair had been going very hitchily ever since they started with the burden of the conversation left to the two men and that helpless girl if it were not to be altogether a failure she must interfere  did you ever hear of gratiano when you were in venice she asked mr morton  is he one of their new watercolourists returned the young man i heard they had quite a school there now  no said mrs bowen ignoring her failure as well as she could he was a famous talker he loved to speak an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in venice  an ancestor of mine mr morton said colville a poor honest man who did his best to make people forget that the ladies were silent thank you mrs bowen for mentioning him i wish he were with us today  the young man laughed oh in the merchant of venice  no other said colville  i confess said mrs bowen that i am rather stupid this morning i suppose its the softness of the air its been harsh and irritating so long it makes me drowsy  dont mind us returned colville we will call you at important points they were driving into a village at which people stop sometimes to admire the works of art in its church here for example iswhat place is this he asked of the coachman  san domenico  i should know it again by its beggars of all ages and sexes they swarmed round the carriage which the driver had instinctively slowed to oblige them and thrust forward their hands and hats colville gave effie his small change to distribute among them at sight of which they streamed down the street from every direction those who had received brought forward the halt and blind and did not scruple to propose being rewarded for this service at the same time they did not mind his laughing in their faces they laughed too and went off content or as nearly so as beggars ever are he buttoned up his pocket as they drove on more rapidly i am the only person of no principleexcept effiein the carriage and yet i am at this moment carrying more blessings out of this village than i shall ever know what to do with mrs bowen i know is regarding me with severe disapproval she thinks that i ought to have sent the beggars of san domenico to florence where they would all be shut up in the pia casa di ricovero and taught some useful occupation its terrible in florence you can walk through florence now and have no appeal made to your better nature that is not made at the appellants risk of imprisonment when i was there before you had opportunities of giving at every turn  you can send a cheque to the pia casa said mrs bowen  ah but what good would that do me when i give i want the pleasure of it i want to see my beneficiary cringe under my bounty but ive tried in vain to convince you that the world has gone wrong in other ways do you remember the onearmed man whom we used to give to on the lung arno that persevering sufferer has been repeatedly arrested for mendicancy and obliged to pay a fine out of his hard earnings to escape being sent to your pia casa  mrs bowen smiled and said was he living yet in a pensive tone of reminiscence she was even more than patient of colvilles nonsense it seemed to him that the light under her eyelids was sometimes a grateful light confronting imogene and the young man whose hopes of her he was to destroy at the first opportunity the lurid moral atmosphere which he breathed seemed threatening to become a thing apparent to sense and to be about to blot the landscape he fought it back as best he could and kept the hovering cloud from touching the earth by incessant effort at times he looked over the side of the carriage and drew secretly a long breath of fatigue it began to be borne in upon him that these ladies were using him ill in leaving him the burden of their entertainment he became angry but his heart softened and he forgave them again for he conjectured that he was the cause of the cares that kept them silent he felt certain that the affair had taken some new turn he wondered if mrs bowen had told imogene what she had demanded of him but he could only conjecture and wonder in the dreary undercurrent of thought that flowed evenly and darkly on with the talk he kept going he made the most he could of the varying views of florence which the turns and mounting levels of the road gave him he became affectionately grateful to the young clergyman when he replied promptly and fully and took an interest in the objects or subjects he brought up  neither mrs bowen nor imogene was altogether silent the one helped on at times wearily and the other broke at times from her abstraction doubtless the girl had undertaken too much in insisting upon a party of pleasure with her mind full of so many things and doubtless mrs bowen was sore with a rankling resentment at her insistence and vexed at herself for having yielded to it if at her time of life and with all her experience of it she could not rise under this inner load imogene must have been crushed by it  her starts from the dreamy oppression if that were what kept her silent took the form of aggression when she disagreed with colville about things he was saying or attacked him for this or that thing which he had said in times past it was an unhappy and unamiable selfassertion which he was not able to compassionate so much when she resisted or defied mrs bowen as she seemed seeking to do at every point perhaps another would not have felt it so it must have been largely in his consciousness the young clergyman seemed not to see anything in these bursts but the indulgence of a gay caprice though his laughing at them did not alleviate the effect to colville who when he turned to mrs bowen for her alliance was astonished with a prompt snub unmistakable to himself however imperceptible to others  he found what diversion and comfort he could in the party of children who beset them at a point near the town and followed the carriage trying to sell them various light and useless trifles made of strawfans baskets parasols and the like he bought recklessly of them and gave them to effie whom he assured without the applause of the ladies and with the grave question of the young clergyman that the vendors were little etruscan girls all at least twentyfive hundred years old its very hard to find any etruscans under that age most of the grownup people are three thousand  the child humoured his extravagance with the faith in fable which children are able to command and said oh tell me about them while she pushed up closer to him and began to admire her presents holding them up before her and dwelling fondly upon them one by one  oh theres very little to tell answered colville theyre mighty close people and always keep themselves very much to themselves but wouldnt you like to see a party of etruscans of all ages even down to little babies only eleven or twelve hundred years old come driving into an american town it would make a great excitement wouldnt it  it would be splendid  yes we would give them a collation in the basement of the city hall and drive them out to the cemetery the americans and etruscans are very much alike in thatthey always show you their tombs  will they in fiesole  how you always like to burrow into the past interrupted imogene  well its rather difficult burrowing into the future returned colville defensively accepting the challenge he added yes i should really like to meet a few etruscans in fiesole this morning i should feel as if id got amongst my contemporaries at last they would understand me  the girls face flushed then no one else can understand you  apparently not i am the great american incompris  im sorry for you she returned feebly and in fact sarcasm was not her strong point  when they entered the town they found the etruscans preoccupied with other visitors whom at various points in the quaint little piazza they surrounded in dense groups to their own disadvantage as guides and beggars and dealers in straw goods one of the groups reluctantly dispersed to devote itself to the new arrivals and these then perceived that it was a party of artists scattered about and sketching which had absorbed the attention of the population colville went to the restaurant to order lunch leaving the ladies to the care of mr morton when he came back he found the carriage surrounded by the artists who had turned out to be the inglehart boys they had walked up to fiesole the afternoon before and they had been sketching there all the morning with the artists indifference to the conventional objects of interest they were still ignorant of what ought to be seen in fiesole by tourists and they accepted colvilles proposition to be of his party in going the rounds of the cathedral the museum and the view from that point of the wall called the belvedere they found that they had been at the belvedere before without knowing that it merited particular recognition and some of them had made sketches from itof bits of architecture and landscape and of figure amongst the women with straw fans and baskets to sell who thronged round the whole party again and interrupted the prospect in the church they differed amongst themselves as to the best bits for study and colville listened in whimsical despair to the enthusiasm of their likings and dislikings all that was so far from him now but in the museum which had only a thin interest based upon a small collection of art and archeology he suffered a real affliction in the presence of a young italian couple who were probably plighted lovers they went before a greyhaired pair who might have been the girls father and mother and they looked at none of the objects though they regularly stopped before them and waited till their guide had said his say about them the girl clinging tight to the young mans arm knew nothing but him her mouth and eyes were set in a passionate concentration of her being upon him and he seemed to walk in a dream of her from time to time they peered upon each others faces and then they paused rapt and indifferent to all besides  the young painters had their jokes about it even mr morton smiled and mrs bowen recognised it but imogene did not smile she regarded the lovers with an interest in them scarcely less intense than their interest in each other and a cold perspiration of question broke out on colvilles forehead was that her ideal of what her own engagement should be had she expected him to behave in that way to her and to accept from her a devotion like that girls how bitterly he must have disappointed her it was so impossible to him that the thought of it made him feel that he must break all ties which bound him to anything like it and yet he reflected that the time was when he could have been equal to that and even more  after lunch the painters joined them again and they all went together to visit the ruins of the roman theatre and the stretch of etruscan wall beyond it the former seems older than the latter whose huge blocks of stone lie as firmly and evenly in their courses as if placed there a year ago the turf creeps to the edge at top and some small trees nod along the crest of the wall whose ancient face clean and bare looks sternly out over a vast prospect now young and smiling in the first delight of spring the piety or interest of the community which guards the entrance to the theatre by a fee of certain centesimi may be concerned in keeping the wall free from the grass and vines which are stealing the halfexcavated arena back to forgetfulness and decay but whatever agency it was it weakened the appeal that the wall made to the sympathy of the spectators  they could do nothing with it the artists did not take their sketchblocks from their pockets but in the theatre where a few broken columns marked the place of the stage and the stone benches of the auditorium were here and there reached by a flight of uncovered steps the human interest returned  i suspect that there is such a thing as a ruins being too old said colville our etruscan friends made the mistake of building their wall several thousand years too soon for our purpose  yes consented the young clergyman it seems as if our own race became alienated from us through the mere effect of time dont you think sir i mean of course terrestrially  the artists looked uneasy as if they had not counted upon anything of this kind and they began to scatter about for points of view effie got her mothers leave to run up and down one of the stairways if she would not fall mrs bowen sat down on one of the lower steps and mr morton took his place respectfully near her  i wonder how it looks from the top imogene asked this of colville with more meaning than seemed to belong to the question properly  there is nothing like going to see he suggested he helped her up giving her his hand from one course of seats to another when they reached the point which commanded the best view of the whole she sat down and he sank at her feet but they did not speak of the view  theodore i want to tell you something she said abruptly i have heard from home  yes he replied in a tone in which he did his best to express a readiness for any fate  mother has telegraphed she is coming out she is on her way now she will be here very soon  colville did not know exactly what to say to these passionately consecutive statements well he said at last  wellshe repeated his wordwhat do you intend to do  intend to do in what event he asked lifting his eyes for the first time to the eyes which he felt burning down upon him  if she should refuse  again he could not command an instant answer but when it came it was a fair one it isnt for me to say what i shall do he replied gravely or if it is i can only say that i will do whatever you wish  do you wish nothing  nothing but your happiness  nothing but my happiness she retorted what is my happiness to me have i ever sought it  i cant say he answered but if i did not think you would find it  i shall find it if ever i find it in yours she interrupted and what shall you do if my mother will not consent to our engagement  the experienced and sophisticated manfor that in no ill way was what colville wasfelt himself on trial for his honour and his manhood by this simple girl this child he could not endure to fall short of her ideal of him at that moment no matter what error or calamity the fulfilment involved if you feel sure that you love me imogene it will make no difference to me what your mother says i would be glad of her consent i should hate to go counter to her will but i know that i am good enough man to be true and keep you all my life the first in all my thoughts and thats enough for me but if you have any fear any doubt of yourself now is the time  imogene rose to her feet as in some turmoil of thought or emotion that would not suffer her to remain quiet  oh keep still dont get up yet hold on a minute please came from the artists in different parts of the theatre and half a dozen imploring pencils were waved in the air  they are sketching you said colville and she sank compliantly into her seat again  i have no doubt for myselfno she said as if there had been no interruption  then we need have no anxiety in meeting your mother said colville with a light sigh after a moments pause what makes you think she will be unfavourable  i dont think that but i thoughti didnt know but  what  nothing now her lips were quivering he could see her struggle for selfcontrol but he could not see it unmoved  poor child he said putting out his hand toward her  dont take my hand theyre all looking she begged  he forbore and they remained silent and motionless a little while before she had recovered herself sufficiently to speak again  then we are promised to each other whatever happens she said  yes  and we will never speak of this again but there is one thing did mrs bowen ask you to tell mr morton of our engagement  she said that i ought to do so  and did you say you would  i dont know but i suppose i ought to tell him  i dont wish you to cried the girl  you dont wish me to tell him  no i will not have it  oh very well its much easier not but it seems to me that its only fair to him  did you think of that yourself she demanded fiercely  no returned colville with sad selfrecognition im afraid im not apt to think of the comforts and rights of other people it was mrs bowen who thought of it  i knew it  but i must confess that i agreed with her though i would have preferred to postpone it till we heard from your family he was thoughtfully silent a moment then he said but if their decision is to have no weight with us i think he ought to be told at once  do you think that i am flirting with him  imogene exclaimed colville reproachfully  thats what you imply thats what she implies  youre very unjust to mrs bowen imogene  oh you always defend her it isnt the first time youve told me i was unjust to her  i dont mean that you are willingly unjust or could be so to any living creature least of all to her but iweowe her so much she has been so patient  what do we owe her how has she been patient  she has overcome her dislike to me  oh indeed  andand i feel under obligation to her forin a thousand little ways and i should be glad to feel that we were acting with her approval i should like to please her  you wish to tell mr morton  i think i ought  to please mrs bowen tell him then you always cared more to please her than me perhaps you stayed in florence to please her  she rose and ran down the broken seats and ruined steps so recklessly and yet so surefootedly that it seemed more like a flight than a pace to the place where mrs bowen and mr morton were talking together  colville followed as he could slowly and with a heavy heart a good thing develops itself in infinite and unexpected shapes of good a bad thing into manifold and astounding evils this mistake was whirling away beyond his recall in hopeless mazes of error he saw this generous young spirit betrayed by it to ignoble and unworthy excess and he knew that he and not she was to blame  he was helpless to approach her to speak with her to set her right great as the need of that was and he could see that she avoided him but their relations remained outwardly undisturbed the artists brought their sketches for inspection and comment and without speaking to each other he and imogene discussed them with the rest  when they started homeward the painters said they were coming a little way with them for a sendoff and then going back to spend the night in fiesole they walked beside the carriage talking with mrs bowen and imogene who had taken their places with effie between them on the back seat and when they took their leave colville and the young clergyman who had politely walked with them continued on foot a little further till they came to the place where the highway to florence divided into the new road and the old at this point it steeply overtops the fields on one side which is shored up by a wall some ten or twelve feet deep and here round a sharp turn of the hill on the other side came a peasant driving a herd of the black pigs of the country  mrs bowens horses were perhaps pampered beyond the habitual resignation of florentine horses to all manner of natural phenomena they reared at sight of the sable crew and backing violently uphill set the carriage across the road with its hind wheels a few feet from the brink of the wall the coachman sprang from his seat the ladies and the child remained in theirs as if paralysed  colville ran forward to the side of the carriage jump mrs bowen jump effie imogene  the mother and the little one obeyed he caught them in his arms and set them down the girl sat still staring at him with reproachful with disdainful eyes  he leaped forward to drag her out she shrank away and then he flew to help the coachman who had the maddened horses by the bit  let go he heard the young clergyman calling to him shes safe he caught a glimpse of imogene whom mr morton had pulled from the other side of the carriage he struggled to free his wrist from the curbbit chain of the horse through which he had plunged it in his attempt to seize the bridle the wheels of the carriage went over the wall he felt himself whirled into the air and then swung ruining down into the writhing and crashing heap at the bottom of the wall       xxi   when colville came to himself his first sensation was delight in the softness and smoothness of the turf on which he lay then the strange colour of the grass commended itself to his notice and presently he perceived that the thing under his head was a pillow and that he was in bed he was supported in this conclusion by the opinion of the young man who sat watching him a little way off and who now smiled cheerfully at the expression in the eyes which colville turned inquiringly upon him  where am i he asked with what appeared to him very unnecessary feebleness of voice  the young man begged his pardon in italian and when colville repeated his question in that tongue he told him that he was in palazzo pinti whither he had been brought from the scene of his accident he added that colville must not talk till the doctor had seen him and given him leave and he explained that he was himself a nurse from the hospital who had been taking care of him  colville moved his head and felt the bandage upon it he desisted in his attempt to lift his right arm to it before the attendant could interfere in behalf of the broken limb he recalled dimly and fragmentarily long histories that he had dreamed but he forbore to ask how long he had been in his present case and he accepted patiently the apparition of the doctor and other persons who came and went and were at his bedside or not there as it seemed to him between the opening and closing of an eye as the days passed they acquired greater permanence and maintained a more uninterrupted identity he was able to make quite sure of mr morton and of mr waters mrs bowen came in leading effie and this gave him a great pleasure mrs bowen seemed to have grown younger and better imogene was not among the phantoms who visited him and he accepted her absence as quiescently as he accepted the presence of the others there was a cheerfulness in those who came that permitted him no anxiety and he was too weak to invite it by any conjecture he consented to be spared and to spare himself and there were some things about the affair which gave him a singular and perhaps not wholly sane content one of these was the man nurse who had evidently taken care of him throughout he celebrated whenever he looked at this capable person his escape from being in the odious helplessness of sickness a burden upon the strength and sympathy of the two women for whom he had otherwise made so much trouble his satisfaction in this had much to do with his recovery which when it once began progressed rapidly to a point where he was told that imogene and her mother were at a hotel in florence waiting till he should be strong enough to see them it was mrs bowen who told him this with an air which she visibly strove to render noncommittal and impersonal but which betrayed nevertheless a faint apprehension for the effect upon him the attitude of imogene and her mother was certainly not one to have been expected of people holding their nominal relation to him but colville had been revising his impressions of events on the day of his accident imogenes last look came back to him and he could not think the situation altogether unaccountable  have i been here a long time he asked as if he had not heeded what she told him  about a fortnight answered mrs bowen  and imogenehow long has she been away  since they knew you would get well  i will see them any time he said quietly  do you think you are strong enough  i shall never be stronger till i have seen them he returned with a glance at her yes i want them to come today i shall not be excited dont be troubledif you were going to be he added please send to them at once  mrs bowen hesitated but after a moment left the room she returned in half an hour with a lady who revealed even to colvilles languid regard evidences of the character which mrs bowen had attributed to imogenes mother she was a large robust person laced to sufficient shapeliness and she was well and simply dressed she entered the room with a waft of some clean wholesome perfume and a quiet temperament and perfect health looked out of her clear honest eyesthe eyes of imogene graham though the girls were dark and the womans were blue when mrs bowen had named them to each other in withdrawing mrs graham took colvilles weak left hand in her fresh strong right and then lifted herself a chair to his bedside and sat down  how do you do today sir she said with a touch of oldfashioned respectfulness in the last word do you think you are quite strong enough to talk with me  i think so said colville with a faint smile at least i can listen with fortitude  mrs graham was not apparently a person adapted to joking i dont know whether it will require much fortitude to hear what i have to say or not she said with her keen gaze fixed upon him its simply this i am going to take imogene home  she seemed to expect that colville would make some reply to this and he said blankly yes  i came out prepared to consent to what she wished after i had seen you and satisfied myself that she was not mistaken for i had always promised myself that her choice should be perfectly untrammelled and i have tried to bring her up with principles and ideas that would enable her to make a good choice  yes said colville again im afraid you didnt take her temperament and her youth into account and that she disappointed you  no i cant say that she did it isnt that at all i see no reason to blame her for her choice her mistake was of another kind  it appeared to colville that this very sensible and judicial lady found an intellectual pleasure in the analysis of the case which modified the intensity of her maternal feeling in regard to it and that like many people who talk well she liked to hear herself talk in the presence of another appreciative listener he did not offer to interrupt her and she went on no sir i am not disappointed in her choice i think her chances of happiness would have been greater in the abstract with one nearer her own age but that is a difference which other things affect so much that it did not alarm me greatly some people are younger at your age than at hers no sir that is not the point mrs graham fetched a sigh as if she found it easier to say what was not the point than to say what was and her clear gaze grew troubled but she apparently girded herself for the struggle as far as you are concerned mr colville i have not a word to say your conduct throughout has been most highminded and considerate and delicate  it is hard for any man to deny merits attributed to him especially if he has been ascribing to himself the opposite demerits but colville summoned his dispersed forces to protest against this  oh no no he cried anything but that my conduct has been selfish and shameful if you could understand all  i think i do understand allat least far more i regret to say than my daughter has been willing to tell me and i am more than satisfied with you i thank you and honour you  oh no dont say that pleaded colville i really cant stand it  and when i came here it was with the full intention of approving and confirming imogenes decision but i was met at once by a painful and surprising state of things you are aware that you have been very sick  dimly said colville  i found you very sick and i found my daughter frantic at the error which she had discovered in herselfdiscovered too late as she felt mrs graham hesitated and then added abruptly she had found out that she did not love you  didnt love me repeated colville feebly  she had been conscious of the truth before but she had stifled her misgivings insanely and as i feel almost wickedly pushing on and saying to herself that when you were married then there would be no escape and she must love you  poor girl poor child i see i see  but the accident that was almost your death saved her from that miserable folly and iniquity yes she continued in answer to the protest in his face folly and iniquity i found her half crazed at your bedside she was fully aware of your danger but while she was feeling all the remorse that she ought to feelthat any one could feelshe was more and more convinced that she never had loved you and never should i can give you no idea of her state of mind  oh you neednt you neednt poor poor child  yes a child indeed if it had not been for the pity i felt for herbut no matter about that she saw at last that if your heroic devotion to hercolville did his best to hang his pillowed head for shameif your present danger did not awaken her to some such feeling for you as she had once imagined she had if they both only increased her despair and selfabhorrence then the case was indeed hopeless she was simply distracted i had to tear her away almost by force she has had a narrow escape from brainfever and now i have come to implore to demandmrs graham with all her poise and calm was rising to the hysterical keyher release from a fate that would be worse than death for such a girl i mean marrying without the love of her whole soul she esteems you she respects you she admires you she likes you but mrs graham pressed her lips together and her eyes shone  she is free said colville and with the words a mighty load rolled from his heart there is no need to demand anything  i know  there hasnt been an hour an instant duringsince iwespoke together that i wouldnt have released her if i could have known what you tell me now  of courseof course  i have had my fearsmy doubts but whenever i approached the point i found no avenue by which we could reach a clearer understanding i could not say much without seeming to seek for myself the release i was offering her  naturally and what added to her wretchedness was the suspicion at the bottom of all that she had somehow forced herself upon you misunderstood you and made you say and do things to spare her that you would not have done voluntarily this was advanced tentatively in the midst of his sophistications colville had as most of his sex have a native fatal helpless truthfulness which betrayed him at the most unexpected moments and this must now have appeared in his countenance the lady rose haughtily she had apparently been considering him but after all she must have been really considering her daughter if anything of the kind was the case she said i will ask you to spare her the killing knowledge its quite enough for me to know it and allow me to say mr colville that it would have been far kinder in you  ah think my dear madam he exclaimed how could i  she did think evidently and when she spoke it was with a generous emotion in which there was no trace of pique  you couldnt you have done right i feel that and i will trust you to say anything you will to my daughter  to your daughter shall i see her  she came with me she wished to beg your forgiveness  colville lay silent there is no forgiveness to be asked or granted he said at length why should she suffer the pain of seeing mefor it would be nothing else what do you think will it do her any good hereafter i dont care for myself  i dont know what to think said mrs graham she is a strange child she may have some idea of reparation  oh beseech her from me not to imagine that any reparation is due where there has been an error there must be blame but wherever it lies in ours i am sure it isnt at her door tell her i say this tell her that i acquit her with all my heart of every shadow of wrong that i am not unhappy but glad for her sake and my own that this has ended as it has he stretched his left hand across the coverlet to her and said with the feebleness of exhaustion goodbye bid her goodbye for me  mrs graham pressed his hand and went out a moment after the door was flung open and imogene burst into the room she threw herself on her knees beside his bed i will pray to you she said her face intense with the passions working in her soul she seemed choking with words which would not come then with an inarticulate cry that must stand for all she caught up the hand that lay limp on the coverlet she crushed it against her lips and ran out of the room  he sank into a deathly torpor the physical refusal of his brain to take account of what had passed when he woke from it little effie bowen was airily tiptoeing about the room fondly retouching its perfect order he closed his eyes and felt her come to him and smooth the sheet softly under his chin then he knew she must be standing with clasped hands admiring the effect some one called her in whisper from the door it closed and all was still again       xxii   colville got himself out of the comfort and quiet of mrs bowens house as soon as he could he made the more haste because he felt that if he could have remained with the smallest trace of selfrespect he would have been glad to stay there for ever  even as it was the spring had advanced to early summer and the sun was lying hot and bright in the piazzas and the shade dense and cool in the narrow streets before he left palazzo pinti the lung arno was a glare of light that struck back from the curving line of the buff houses the river had shrivelled to a rill in its bed the black cypresses were dim in the tremor of the distant air on the hillslopes beyond the olives seemed to swelter in the sun and the villa walls to burn whiter and whiter at evening the mosquito began to wind his tiny horn it was the end of may and nearly everybody but the florentines had gone out of florence dispersing to villa reggio by the sea to the hills of pistoja and to the high cool air of siena more than once colville had said that he was keeping mrs bowen after she ought to have got away and she had answered that she liked hot weather and that this was not comparable to the heat of washington in june she was looking very well and younger and prettier than she had since the first days of their renewed acquaintance in the winter her southern complexion enriched itself in the sun sometimes when she came into his room from outdoors the straying brown hair curled into loose rings on her temples and her cheeks glowed a deep red  she said those polite things to appease him as long as he was not well enough to go away but she did not try to detain him after his strength sufficiently returned it was the blow on the head that kept him longest after his broken arm and his other bruises were quite healed he was aware of physical limits to thinking of the future or regretting the past and this sense of his powerlessness went far to reconcile him to a life of present inaction and oblivion theoretically he ought to have been devoured by remorse and chagrin but as a matter of fact he suffered very little from either even in people who are in full possession of their capacity for mental anguish one observes that after they have undergone a certain amount of pain they cease to feel  colville amused himself a good deal with effies endeavours to entertain him and take care of him the child was with him every moment that she could steal from her tasks and her mother no longer attempted to stem the tide of her devotion it was understood that effie should joke and laugh with mr colville as much as she chose that she should fan him as long as he could stand it that she should read to him when he woke and watch him when he slept she brought him his breakfast she petted him and caressed him and wished to make him a monster of dependence and selfindulgence it seemed to grieve her that he got well so fast  the last night before he left the house she sat on his knee by the window looking out beyond the firefly twinkle of oltrarno to the silence and solid dark of the solemn company of hills beyond they had not lighted the lamps because of the mosquitoes and they had talked till her head dropped against his shoulder  mrs bowen came in to get her why is she asleep  yes dont take her yet said colville  mrs bowen rustled softly into the chair which effie had left to get into colvilles lap neither of them spoke and he was so richly content with the peace the tacit sweetness of the little moment that he would have been glad to have it silently endure forever if any troublesome question of his right to such a moment of bliss obtruded itself upon him he did not concern himself with it  we shall have another hot day tomorrow said mrs bowen at length i hope you will find your room comfortable  yes its at the back of the hotel mighty high and wide and no sun ever comes into it except when they show it to foreigners in winter then they get a few rays to enter as a matter of business on condition that they wont detain them i dare say i shall stay there some time i suppose you will be getting away from florence very soon  yes but i havent decided where to go yet  should you like some general expression of my gratitude for all youve done for me mrs bowen  no i would rather not it has been a great pleasureto effie  oh a luxury beyond the dreams of avarice they spoke in low tones and there was something in the hush that suggested to colville the feasibility of taking into his unoccupied hand one of the pretty hands which the pale nightlight showed him lying in mrs bowens lap but he forbore and only sighed well then i will say nothing but i shall keep on thinking all my life  she made no answer  when you are gone i shall have to make the most of mr waters he said  he is going to stop all summer i believe  oh yes when i suggested to him the other day that he might find it too hot he said that he had seventy new england winters to thaw out of his blood and that all the summers he had left would not be more than he needed one of his friends told him that he could cook eggs in his piazza in august and he said that he should like nothing better than to cook eggs there hes the most delightfully expatriated compatriot ive ever seen  do you like it  its well enough for him life has no claims on him any more i think its very pleasant over here now that everybodys gone added colville from a confused resentfulness of collectively remembered days and afternoons and evenings how still the night is  a few feet clapping by on the pavement below alone broke the hush  sometimes i feel very tired of it all and want to get home sighed mrs bowen  well so do i  i cant believe its right staying away from the country so long people often say such things in europe  no i dont either if youve got anything to do there  you can always make something to do there  oh yes some young young men breaking from a street near by began to sing we shouldnt have that sort of thing at home  no said mrs bowen pensively  i heard just such singing before i fell asleep the night after that party at madame uccellis and it filled me with fury  why should it do that  i dont know it seemed like voices from our youthlina  she had no resentment of his use of her name in the tone with which she asked did you hate that so much  no the loss of it  they both fetched a deep breath  the uccellis have a villa near the baths of lucca said mrs bowen they have asked me to go  do you think of going inquired colville ive always fancied it must be pleasant there  no i declined sometimes i think i will just stay on in florence  i dare say youd find it perfectly comfortable theres nothing like having the range of ones own house in summer he looked out of the window on the blueblack sky    and deepening through their silent spheres    heaven over heaven rose the night   he quoted its wonderful do you remember how i used to read mariana in the south to you and poor jenny how it must have bored her what an ass i was  yes said mrs bowen breathlessly in sympathy with his reminiscence rather than in agreement with his selfdenunciation  colville broke into a laugh and then she began to laugh to but not quite willingly as it seemed  effie started from her sleep whatwhat is it she asked stretching and shivering as halfwakened children do  bedtime said her mother promptly taking her hand to lead her away say goodnight to mr colville  the child turned and kissed him good night she murmured  good night you sleepy little soul it seemed to colville that he must be a pretty good man after all if this little thing loved him so  do you always kiss mr colville goodnight asked her mother when she began to undo her hair for her in her room  sometimes dont you think its nice  oh yes nice enough  colville sat by the window a long time thinking mrs bowen might come back but she did not return  mr waters came to see him the next afternoon at his hotel  are you pretty comfortable here he asked  well its a change said colville i miss the little one awfully  shes a winning child admitted the old man that combination of conventionality and naïveté is very captivating i notice it in the mother  yes the mother has it too have you seen them today  yes mrs bowen was sorry to be out when you came  i had the misfortune to miss them i had a great mind to go again tonight  the old man said nothing to this the fact is colville went on im so habituated to being there that im rather spoiled  ah its a nice place mr waters admitted  of course i made all the haste i could to get away and i have the reward of a good conscience but i dont find that the reward is very great  the old gentleman smiled the difficulty is to know conscience from selfinterest  oh theres no doubt of it in my case said colville if id consulted my own comfort and advantage i should still be at palazzo pinti  i dare say they would have been glad to keep you  do you really think so asked colville with sudden seriousness i wish you would tell me why have you any reasongrounds pshaw im absurd he sank back into the easychair from whose depths he had pulled himself in the eagerness of his demand and wiped his forehead with his handkerchief mr waters you remember my telling you of my engagement to miss graham  yes  that is broken offif it were ever really on it was a great mistake for both of usa tragical one for her poor child a ridiculous one for me my only consolation is that it was a mistake and no more but i dont conceal from myself that i might have prevented it altogether if i had behaved with greater wisdom and dignity at the outset but im afraid i was flattered by an illusion of hers that ought to have pained and alarmed me and the rest followed inevitably though i was always just on the point of escaping the consequences of my weaknessmy wickedness  ah there is something extremely interesting in all that said the old minister thoughtfully the situation used to be figured under the old idea of a compact with the devil his debtor was always on the point of escaping as you say but i recollect no instance in which he did not pay at last the myth must have arisen from mans recognition of the inexorable sequence of cause from effect in the moral world which even repentance cannot avert goethe tries to imagine an atonement for fausts trespass against one human soul in his benefactions to the race at large but it is a very cloudy business  it isnt quite a parallel case said colville rather sulkily he had in fact suffered more under mr waterss generalisation than he could from a more personal philosophy of the affair  oh no i didnt think that consented the old man  and i dont think i shall undertake any extended scheme of drainage or subsoiling in atonement for my little dream colville continued resenting the parity of outline that grew upon him in spite of his protest they were both silent for a while and then colville cried out yes yes they are alike i dreamed too of recovering and restoring my own lost and broken past in the love of a young soul and it was in essence the same cruelly egotistic dream and its nothing in my defence that it was all formless and undirected at first and that as soon as i recognised it i abhorred it  oh yes it is replied the old man with perfect equanimity your assertion is the hysterical excess of puritanism in all times and places in the moral world we are responsible only for the wrong that we intend it cant he otherwise  and the evil thats suffered from the wrong we didnt intend  ah perhaps that isnt evil  its pain  its pain yes  and to have wrung a young and innocent heart with the anguish of selfdoubt with the fear of wrong to another with the shame of an error such as i allowed perhaps encouraged her to make  yes said the old man the young suffer terribly but they recover afterward we dont suffer so much but we dont recover i wouldnt defend you against yourself if i thought you seriously in the wrong if you know yourself to be you shouldnt let me  thus put upon his honour colville was a long time thoughtful how can i tell he asked you know the facts you can judge  if i were to judge at all i should say you were likely to do a greater wrong than any you have committed  i dont understand you  miss graham is a young girl and i have no doubt that the young clergymanwhat was his name  morton do you thinkdo you suppose there was anything in that demanded colville with eagerness that a more humorous observer than mr waters might have found ludicrous he was an admirable young fellow with an excellent head and a noble heart i underrated him at one time though i recognised his good qualities afterward but i was afraid she did not appreciate him  im not so sure of that said the old man with an astuteness of manner which colville thought authorised by some sort of definite knowledge  i would give the world if it were so he cried fervently  but you are really very much more concerned in something else  in what else  cant you imagine  no said colville but he felt himself growing very red in the face  then i have no more to say  yes speak and after an interval colville added is it anything aboutyou hinted at something long agomrs bowen  yes the old man nodded his head do you owe her nothing  owe her nothing everything my life what selfrespect is left me immeasurable gratitude the homage of a man saved from himself as far as his stupidity and selfishness would permit why ii love her the words gave him courage in every breath and pulse she is the most beautiful and gracious and wisest and best woman in the world i have loved her ever since i met her here in florence last winter good heavens i must have always loved her but he added falling from the rapture of this confession she simply loathes me  it was certainly not to your credit that you were willing at the same time to marry some one else  willing i wasnt willing i was bound hand and foot yesi dont care what you think of my weaknessi was not a free agent its very well to condemn onesself but it may be carried too far injustice to others is not the only injustice or the worst what i was willing to do was to keep my wordto prevent that poor child if possible from ever finding out her mistake  if colville expected this heroic confession to impress his listener he was disappointed mr waters made him no reply and he was obliged to ask with a degree of sarcastic impatience i suppose you scarcely blame me for that  oh i dont know that i blame people for things there are times when it seems as if we were all puppets pulled this way or that without control of our own movements hamlet was able to browbeat rosencrantz and guildenstern with his business of the pipe but if they had been in a position to answer they might have told him that it required far less skill to play upon a man than any other instrument most of us in fact go sounding on without any special application of breath or fingers repeating the tunes that were played originally upon other men it appears to me that you suffered yourself to do something of the kind in this affair we are a long time learning to act with commonsense or even common sanity in what are called matters of the affections a broken engagement may be a bad thing in some cases but i am inclined to think that it is the very best thing that could happen in most cases where it happens the evil is done long before the broken engagement is merely sanative and so far beneficent  the old gentleman rose and colville dazed by the recognition of his own cowardice and absurdity did not try to detain him but he followed him down to the outer gate of the hotel the afternoon sun was pouring into the piazza a sea of glimmering heat into which mr waters plunged with the security of a salamander he wore a broadbrimmed panama hat a sack coat of black alpaca and loose trousers of the same material and colville fancied him doubly defended against the torrid waves not only by the stored cold of half a century of winters at haddam east village but by an inner coolness of spirit which appeared to diffuse itself in an appreciable atmosphere about him it was not till he was gone that colville found himself steeped in perspiration and glowing with a strange excitement       xxiii   colville went back to his own room and spent a good deal of time in the contemplation of a suit of clothes adapted to the season which had been sent home from the tailors just before mr waters came in the coat was of the lightest serge the trousers of a pearly grey tending to lavender the waistcoat of cool white duck on his way home from palazzo pinti he had stopped in via tornabuoni and bought some silk gauze neckties of a tasteful gaiety of tint which he had at the time thought very well of but now as he spread out the whole array on his bed it seemed too emblematic of a light and blameless spirit for his wear he ought to put on something as nearly analogous to sackcloth as a modern stock of drygoods afforded he ought at least to wear the grave materials of his winter costume but they were really insupportable in this sudden access of summer besides he had grown thin during his sickness and the things bagged about him if he were going to see mrs bowen that evening he ought to go in some decent shape it was perhaps providential that he had failed to find her at home in the morning when he had ventured thither in the clumsy attire in which he had been loafing about her drawingroom for the past week he now owed it to her to appear before her as well as he could how charmingly punctilious she always was herself  as he put on his new clothes he felt the moral support which the becomingness of dress alone can give with the blue silk gauze lightly tied under his collar and the lapels of his thin coat thrown back to admit his thumbs to his waistcoat pockets he felt almost cheerful before his glass should he shave as once before this important question occurred to him his thinness gave him some advantages of figure but he thought that it made his face older what effect would cutting off his beard have upon it he had not seen the lower part of his face for fifteen years no one could say what recent ruin of a double chin might not be lurking there he decided not to shave at least till after dinner and after dinner he was too impatient for his visit to brook the necessary delay  he was shown into the salotto alone but effie bowen came running in to meet him she stopped suddenly bridling  you never expected to see me looking quite so pretty said colville tracing the cause of her embarrassment to his summer splendour where is your mamma  she is in the diningroom replied the child getting hold of his hand she wants you to come and have coffee with us  by all meansnot that i havent had coffee already though  she led the way looking up at him shyly over her shoulder as they went  mrs bowen rose napkin in lap and gave him a hand of welcome how are you feeling today she asked politely ignoring his finery  like a new man he said and then he added to relieve the strain of the situation of the best tailors make in florence  you look very well she smiled  oh i always do when i take pains said colville the trouble is that i dont always take pains but i thought i would tonight in upon a lady  effie will feel very much flattered said mrs bowen  dont refuse a portion of the satisfaction he cried  oh is it for me too  this gave colville consolation which no religion or philosophy could have brought him and his pleasure was not marred but rather heightened by the little pangs of expectation bred by long custom that from moment to moment imogene would appear she did not appear and a thrill of security succeeded upon each alarm he wished her well with all his heart such is the human heart that he wished her arrived home the bretrothed of that excellent that wholly unobjectionable young man mr morton  will you have a little of the ice before your coffee asked mrs bowen proposing one of the moulded creams with her spoon  yes thank you perhaps i will take it in place of the coffee they forgot to offer us any ice at the table dhôte this evening  this is rather luxurious for us said mrs bowen its a compromise with effie she wanted me to take her to giacosas this afternoon  i thought you would come whispered the child to colville  her mother made a little face of mock surprise at her dont give yourself away effie  why let us go to giacosas too said colville taking the ice we shall be the only foreigners there and we shall not even feel ourselves foreign its astonishing how the hot weather has dispersed the tourists i didnt see a baedeker on the whole way up here and i walked down via tornabuoni across through porta rosso and the piazza della signoria and the uffizzi youve no idea how comfortable and homelike it wasall the statues loafing about in their shirt sleeves and the objects of interest stretching and yawning round and having a good rest after their winters work  effie understood colvilles way of talking well enough to enjoy this her mother did not laugh  walked she asked  certainly why not  you are getting well again youll soon be gone too  ive got well but as to being gone theres no hurry i rather think i shall wait now to see how long you stay  we may keep you all summer said mrs bowen dropping her eyelids indifferently  oh very well all summer it is then mr waters is going to stay and he is such a very cool old gentleman that i dont think one need fear the wildest antics of the mercury where he is  when colville had finished his ice mrs bowen led the way to the salotto and they all sat down by the window there and watched the sunset die on san miniato the bronze copy of michelangelos david in the piazzale below the church blackened in perfect relief against the pink sky and then faded against the grey while they talked they were so domestic that colville realised with difficulty that this was an image of what might be rather than what really was the very ease with which he could apparently close his hand upon the happiness within his grasp unnerved him the talk strayed hither and thither and went and came aimlessly a sound of singing floated in from the kitchen and effie eagerly asked her mother if she might go and see maddalena maddalenas mother had come to see her and she was from the mountains  yes go said mrs bowen but dont stay too long  oh i will be back in time said the child and colville remembered that he had proposed going to giacosas  yes dont forget he had forgotten it himself  maddalena is the cook explained mrs bowen she sings ballads to effie that she learned from her mother and i suppose effie wants to hear them at first hand  oh yes said colville dreamily  they were alone now and each little silence seemed freighted with a meaning deeper than speech  have you seen mr waters today asked mrs bowen after one of these lapses  yes he came this afternoon  he is a very strange old man i should think he would be lonely here  he seems not to be he says he finds company in the history of the place and his satisfaction at having got out of haddam east village is perennial  but he will want to go back there before he dies  i dont know he thinks not hes a strange old man as you say he has the art of putting all sorts of ideas into peoples heads do you know what we talked about this afternoon  no i dont murmured mrs bowen  about you and he encouraged me to believeimaginethat i might speak to youasktell you thati loved you lina he leaned forward and took one of the hands that lay in her lap it trembled with a violence inconceivable in relation to the perfect quiet of her attitude but she did not try to take it away could youdo you love me  yes she whispered but here she sprang up and slipped from his hold altogether as with an inarticulate cry of rapture he released her hand to take her in his arms  he followed her a pace or two and you willwill be my wife he pursued eagerly  never she answered and now colville stopped short while a cold bewilderment bathed him from head to foot it must be some sort of jest though he could not tell where the humour was and he could not treat it otherwise than seriously  lina i have loved you from the first moment that i saw you this winter and heaven knows how long before  yes i know that  and every moment  oh i know that too  even if i had no sort of hope that you cared for me i loved you so much that i must tell you before we parted  i expected thati intended it  you intended it and you do love me and yet you wontah i dont understand  how could you understand i love youi blush and burn for shame to think that i love you but i will never marry you i can at least help doing that and i can still keep some little trace of selfrespect how you must really despise me to think of anything else after all that has happened did you suppose that i was merely waiting till that poor girls back was turned as you were oh how can you be yourself and still be yourself yes jenny wheelwright was right you are too much of a mixture theodore colvilleher calling him so showed how often she had thought of him sotoo much for her too much for imogene too much for me too much for any woman except some wretched creature who enjoys being trampled on and dragged through the dust as you have dragged me  i dragged you through the dust there hasnt been a moment in the past six months when i wouldnt have rolled myself in it to please you  oh i knew that well enough and do you think that was flattering to me  that has nothing to do with it i only know that i love you and that i couldnt help wishing to show it even when i wouldnt acknowledge it to myself that is all and now when i am free to speak and you own that you love me you wonti give it up he cried desperately but in the next breath he implored why do you drive me from you lina  because you have humiliated me too much she was perfectly steady but he knew her so well that in the twilight he knew what bitterness there must be in the smile which she must be keeping on her lips i was here in the place of her mother her best friend and you made me treat her like an enemy you made me betray her and cast her off  i  yes you i knew from the very first that you did not really care for her that you were playing with yourself as you were playing with her and i ought to have warned her  it appears to me you did warn her said colville with some resentful return of courage  i tried she said simply and it made it worse it made it worse because i knew that i was acting for my own sake more than hers because i wasntdisinterested there was something in this explanation serious tragic as it was to mrs bowen which made colville laugh she might have had some perception of its effect to him or it may have been merely from a hysterical helplessness but she laughed too a little  but why he gathered courage to ask do you still dwell upon that mr waters told me that mr mortonthat there was  he is mistaken he offered himself and she refused him he told me  oh  do you think she would do otherwise with you lying here between life and death no you can have no hope from that  colville in fact had none this blow crushed and dispersed him he had not strength enough to feel resentment against mr waters for misleading him with this ignis fatuus  no one warned him and it came to that said mrs bowen it was of a piece with the whole affair i was weak in that too  colville did not attempt to reply on this point he feebly reverted to the inquiry regarding himself and was far enough from mirth in resuming it  i couldnt imagine he said that you cared anything for me when you warned another against me if i could  you put me in a false position from the beginning i ought to have sympathised with her and helped her instead of making the poor child feel that somehow i hated her i couldnt even put her on guard against herself though i knew all along that she didnt really care for you but was just in love with her own fancy for you even after you were engaged i ought to have broken it off i ought to have been frank with her it was my duty but i couldnt without feeling that i was acting for myself too and i would not submit to that degradation no i would rather have died i dare say you dont understand how could you you are a man and the kind of man who couldnt at every point you made me violate every principle that was dear to me i loathed myself for caring for a man who was in love with me when he was engaged to another dont think it was gratifying to me it was detestable and yet i did let you see that i cared for you yes i even tried to make you care for mefalsely cruelly treacherously  you didnt have to try very hard said colville with a sort of cold resignation to his fate  oh no you were quite ready for any hint i could have told her for her own sake that she didnt love you but that would have been for my sake too and i would have told you if i hadnt cared for you and known how you cared for me ive saved at least the consciousness of this from the wreck  i dont think its a great treasure said colville i wish that you had saved the consciousness of having been frank even to your own advantage  do you dare to reproach me theodore colville but perhaps ive deserved this too  no lina you certainly dont deserve it if its unkindness from me i wont afflict you with my presence but will you listen to me before i go  she sank into a chair in sign of assent he also sat down he had a dim impression that he could talk better if he took her hand but he did not venture to ask for it he contented himself with fixing his eyes upon as much of her face as he could make out in the dusk a pale blur in a vague outline of dark  i want to assure you linalina my love my dearest as i shall call you for the first and last timethat i do understand everything as delicately and fully as you could wish all that you have expressed and all that you have left unsaid i understand how high and pure your ideals of duty are and how heroically angelically you have struggled to fulfil them broken and borne down by my clumsy and stupid selfishness from the start i want you to believe my dearest loveyou must forgive methat if i didnt see everything at the time i do see it now and that i prize the love you kept from me far more than any love you could have given me to the loss of your selfrespect it isnt logicit sounds more like nonsense i am afraidbut you know what i mean by it you are more perfect more lovely to me than any being in the world and i accept whatever fate you choose for me i would not win you against your will if i could you are sacred to me if you say we must part i know that you speak from a finer discernment than mine and i submit i will try to console myself with the thought of your love if i may not have you yes i submit  his instinct of forbearance had served him better than the subtlest art his submission was the best defence he rose with a real dignity and she rose also remember he said that i confess all you accuse me of and that i acknowledge the justice of what you dobecause you do it he put out his hand and took the hand which hung nerveless at her side you are quite right goodbye he hesitated a moment may i kiss you lina he drew her to him and she let him kiss her on the lips  goodbye she whispered go  i am going  effie bowen ran into the room from the kitchen  arent you going to take she stopped and turned to her mother she must not remind mr colville of his invitation that was what her gesture expressed  colville would not say anything he would not seize his advantage and play upon the mothers heart through the feelings of her child though there is no doubt that he was tempted to prolong the situation by any means perhaps mrs bowen divined both the temptation and the resistance tell her she said and turned away  i cant go with you tonight effie he said stooping toward her for the inquiring kiss that she gave him i amgoing away and i must say goodbye  the solemnity of his voice alarmed her going away she repeated  yesaway from florence im afraid i shall not see you again  the child turned from him to her mother again who stood motionless then as if the whole calamitous fact had suddenly flashed upon her she plunged her face against her mothers breast i cant bear it she sobbed out and the reticence of her lamentation told more than a storm of cries and prayers  colville wavered  oh you must stay said lina in the selfcontemptuous voice of a woman who falls below her ideal of herself       xxiv   in the levities which the most undeserving husbands permit themselves with the severest of wives there were times after their marriage when colville accused lina of never really intending to drive him away but of meaning after a disciplinary ordeal to marry him in reward of his tested selfsacrifice and obedience he said that if the appearance of effie was not a coup de théâtre contrived beforehand it was an accident of no consequence whatever that if she had not come in at that moment her mother would have found some other pretext for detaining him this is a point which i would not presume to decide i only know that they were married early in june before the syndic of florence who tied a tricolour sash round his ample waist for the purpose and never looked more paternal or venerable than when giving the sanction of the italian state to their union it is not of course to be supposed that mrs colville was contented with the civil rite though colville may have thought it quite sufficient the religious ceremony took place in the english chapel the assistant clergyman officiating in the absence of the incumbent who had already gone out of town  the rev mr waters gave away the bride and then went home to palazzo pinti with the party the single and singularly honoured guest at their wedding feast for which effie bowen went with colville to giacosas to order the ices in person she has never regretted her choice of a step father though when colville asked her how she would like him in that relation she had a moment of hesitation in which she reconciled herself to it as to him she had no misgivings he has sometimes found himself the object of little jealousies on her part but by promptly deciding all questions between her and her mother in effies favour he has convinced her of the groundlessness of her suspicions  in the absence of any social pressure to the contrary the colvilles spent the summer in palazzo pinti before their fellowsojourners returned from the villeggiatura in the fall however they had turned their faces southward and they are now in rome where arriving as a married couple there was no inquiry and no interest in their past  it is best to be honest and own that the affair with imogene has been the grain of sand to them no one was to blame or very much to blame even mrs colville says that it was a thing that happened but one would rather it had not happened  last winter however mrs colville received a letter from mrs graham which suggested if it did not impart consolation mr morton was here the other day and spent the morning he has a parish at erie and there is talk of his coming to buffalo  oh heaven grant it said colville with sudden piety  why demanded his wife  well i wish she was married  you have nothing whatever to do with her  it took him some time to realise that this was the fact  no he confessed but what do you think about it  there is no telling we are such simpletons if a man will keep on long enoughbut if it isnt mr morton it will be some one elsesome young person  colville rose and went round the breakfast table to her i hope so he said i have married a young person and it would only be fair  this magnanimity was irresistible   the end
