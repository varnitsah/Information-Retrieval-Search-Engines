  i   the inland port      ii  rochester      iii a night scene    i the inland port  it was a bright forenoon when i set foot on the beach at burlington and took leave of the two boatmen in whose little skiff i had voyaged since daylight from peru  not that we had come that morning from south america but only from the new york shore of lake champlain  the highlands of the coast behind us stretched north and south in a double range of bold blue peaks gazing over each others shoulders at the green mountains of vermont  the latter are far the loftiest and from the opposite side of the lake had displayed a more striking outline  we were now almost at their feet and could see only a sandy beach sweeping beneath a woody bank around the semicircular bay of burlington  the painted lighthouse on a small green island the wharves and warehouses with sloops and schooners moored alongside or at anchor or spreading their canvas to the wind and boats rowing from point to point reminded me of some fishingtown on the seacoast  but i had no need of tasting the water to convince myself that lake champlain was not all arm of the sea its quality was evident both by its silvery surface when unruffled and a faint but unpleasant and sickly smell forever steaming up in the sunshine  one breeze of the atlantic with its briny fragrance would be worth more to these inland people than all the perfumes of arabia  on closer inspection the vessels at the wharves looked hardly seaworthythere being a great lack of tar about the seams and rigging and perhaps other deficiencies quite as much to the purpose  i observed not a single sailor in the port  there were men indeed in blue jackets and trousers but not of the true nautical fashion such as dangle before slopshops others wore tight pantaloons and coats preponderously longtailedcutting very queer figures at the masthead and in short these freshwater fellows had about the same analogy to the real old salt with his tarpaulin peajacket and sailorcloth trousers as a lake fish to a newfoundland cod  nothing struck me more in burlington than the great number of irish emigrants  they have filled the british provinces to the brim and still continue to ascend the st lawrence in infinite tribes overflowing by every outlet into the states  at burlington they swarm in huts and mean dwellings near the lake lounge about the wharves and elbow the native citizens entirely out of competition in their own line  every species of mere bodily labor is the prerogative of these irish  such is their multitude in comparison with any possible demand for their services that it is difficult to conceive how a third part of them should earn even a daily glass of whiskey which is doubtless their first necessary of lifedaily bread being only the second  some were angling in the lake but had caught only a few perch which little fishes without a miracle would be nothing among so many  a miracle there certainly must have been and a daily one for the subsistence of these wandering hordes  the men exhibit a lazy strength and careless merriment as if they had fed well hitherto and meant to feed better hereafter the women strode about uncovered in the open air with far plumper waists and brawnier limbs as well as bolder faces than our shy and slender females and their progeny which was innumerable had the reddest and the roundest cheeks of any children in america  while we stood at the wharf the bell of a steamboat gave two preliminary peals and she dashed away for plattsburgh leaving a trail of smoky breath behind and breaking the glassy surface of the lake before her  our next movement brought us into a handsome and busy square the sides of which were filled up with white houses brick stores a church a courthouse and a bank  some of these edifices had roofs of tin in the fashion of montreal and glittered in the sun with cheerful splendor imparting a lively effect to the whole square  one brick building designated in large letters as the customhouse reminded us that this inland village is a port of entry largely concerned in foreign trade and holding daily intercourse with the british empire  in this border country the canadian banknotes circulate as freely as our own and british and american coin are jumbled into the same pocket the effigies of the king of england being made to kiss those of the goddess of liberty  perhaps there was an emblem in the involuntary contact  there was a pleasant mixture of people in the square of burlington such as cannot be seen elsewhere at one view merchants from montreal british officers from the frontier garrisons french canadians wandering irish scotchmen of a better class gentlemen of the south on a pleasure tour country squires on business and a great throng of green mountain boys with their horsewagons and oxteams true yankees in aspect and looking more superlatively so by contrast with such a variety of foreigners    ii rochester  the gray but transparent evening rather shaded than obscured the scene leaving its stronger features visible and even improved by the medium through which i beheld them  the volume of water is not very great nor the roar deep enough to be termed grand though such praise might have been appropriate before the good people of rochester had abstracted a part of the unprofitable sublimity of the cascade the genesee has contributed so bountifully to their canals and milldams that it approaches the precipice with diminished pomp and rushes over it in foamy streams of various width leaving a broad face of the rock insulated and unwashed between the two main branches of the falling river  still it was an impressive sight to one who had not seen niagara  i confess however that my chief interest arose from a legend connected with these falls which will become poetical in the lapse of years and was already so to me as i pictured the catastrophe out of dusk and solitude  it was from a platform raised over the naked island of the cliff in the middle of the cataract that sam patch took his last leap and alighted in the other world  strange as it may appearthat any uncertainty should rest upon his fate which was consummated in the sight of thousandsmany will tell you that the illustrious patch concealed himself in a cave under the falls and has continued to enjoy posthumous renown without foregoing the comforts of this present life  but the poor fellow prized the shout of the multitude too much not to have claimed it at the instant had he survived  he will not be seen again unless his ghost in such a twilight as when i was there should emerge from the foam and vanish among the shadows that fall from cliff to cliff  how stern a moral may be drawn from the story of poor sam patch  why do we call him a madman or a fool when he has left his memory around the falls of the genesee more permanently than if the letters of his name had been hewn into the forehead of the precipice  was the leaper of cataracts more mad or foolish than other men who throw away life or misspend it in pursuit of empty fame and seldom so triumphantly as he  that which he won is as invaluable as any except the unsought glory spreading like the rich perfume of richer fruit from various and useful deeds  thus musing wise in theory but practically as great a fool as sam i lifted my eyes and beheld the spires warehouses and dwellings of rochester half a mile distant on both sides of the river indistinctly cheerful with the twinkling of many lights amid the fall of the evening  the town had sprung up like a mushroom but no presage of decay could be drawn from its hasty growth  its edifices are of dusky brick and of stone that will not be grayer in a hundred years than now its churches are gothic it is impossible to look at its worn pavements and conceive how lately the forest leaves have been swept away  the most ancient town in massachusetts appears quite like an affair of yesterday compared with rochester  its attributes of youth are the activity and eager life with which it is redundant  the whole street sidewalks and centre was crowded with pedestrians horsemen stagecoaches gigs light wagons and heavy oxteams all hurrying trotting rattling and rumbling in a throng that passed continually but never passed away here a country wife was selecting a churn from several gayly painted ones on the sunny sidewalk there a farmer was bartering his produce and in two or three places a crowd of people were showering bids on a vociferous auctioneer  i saw a great wagon and an oxchain knocked off to a very pretty woman  numerous were the lottery officesthose true temples of mammonwhere red and yellow bills offered splendid fortunes to the world at large and banners of painted cloth gave notice that the lottery draws next wednesday  at the ringing of a bell judges jurymen lawyers and clients elbowed each other to the courthouse to busy themselves with cases that would doubtless illustrate the state of society had i the means of reporting them  the number of public houses benefited the flow of temporary population some were farmers tavernscheap homely and comfortable others were magnificent hotels with negro waiters gentlemanly landlords in black broadcloth and foppish barkeepers in broadway coats with chased gold watches in their waistcoatpockets  i caught one of these fellows quizzing me through an eyeglass  the porters were lumbering up the steps with baggage from the packet boats while waiters plied the brush on dusty travellers who meanwhile glanced over the innumerable advertisements in the daily papers  in short everybody seemed to be there and all had something to do and were doing it with all their might except a party of drunken recruits for the western military posts principally irish and scotch though they wore uncle sams gray jacket and trousers  i noticed one other idle man  he carried a rifle on his shoulder and a powderhorn across his breast and appeared to stare about him with confused wonder as if while he was listening to the wind among the forest boughs the hum and bustle of an instantaneous city had surrounded him    iii  a night scene  the steamboat in which i was passenger for detroit had put into the mouth of a small river where the greater part of the night would be spent in repairing some damages of the machinery  as the evening was warm though cloudy and very dark i stood on deck watching a scene that would not have attracted a second glance in the daytime but became picturesque by the magic of strong light and deep shade  some wild irishmen were replenishing our stock of wood and had kindled a great fire on the bank to illuminate their labors  it was composed of large logs and dry brushwood heaped together with careless profusion blazing fiercely spouting showers of sparks into the darkness and gleaming wide over lake eriea beacon for perplexed voyagers leagues from land  all around and above the furnace there was total obscurity  no trees or other objects caught and reflected any portion of the brightness which thus wasted itself in the immense void of night as if it quivered from the expiring embers of the world after the final conflagration but the irishmen were continually emerging from the dense gloom passing through the lurid glow and vanishing into the gloom on the other side sometimes a whole figure would be made visible by the shirtsleeves and lightcolored dress others were but half seen like imperfect creatures many flitted shadowlike along the skirts of darkness tempting fancy to a vain pursuit and often a face alone was reddened by the fire and stared strangely distinct with no traces of a body in short these wild irish distorted and exaggerated by the blaze now lost in deep shadow now bursting into sudden splendor and now struggling between light and darkness formed a picture which might have been transferred almost unaltered to a tale of the supernatural  as they all carried lanterns of wood and often flung sticks upon the fire the least imaginative spectator would at once compare them to devils condemned to keep alive the flames of their own torments
