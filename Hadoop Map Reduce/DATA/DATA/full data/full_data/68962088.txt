68962088	froudes history of england 1  by charles kingsley     there appeared a few years since a comic history of england duly caricaturing and falsifying all our great national events and representing the english people for many centuries back as a mob of fools and knaves led by the nose in each generation by a few arch fools and archknaves  some thoughtful persons regarded the book with utter contempt and indignation it seemed to them a crime to have written it a proof of banausia as aristotle would have called it only to be outdone by the writing a comic bible  after a while however their indignation began to subside their second thoughts as usual were more charitable than their first they were not surprised to hear that the author was an honest just and able magistrate they saw that the publication of such a book involved no moral turpitude that it was merely meant as a jest on a subject on which jesting was permissible and as a money speculation in a field of which men had a right to make money while all which seemed offensive in it was merely the outcome and as it were apotheosis of that method of writing english history which has been popular for nearly a hundred years  which of our modern historians they asked themselves has had any real feeling of the importance the sacredness of his subjectany real trust in or respect for the characters with whom he dealt  has not the belief of each and all of them been the samethat on the whole the many always have been fools and knaves foolish and knavish enough at least to become the puppets of a few fools and knaves who held the reins of power  have they not held that on the whole the problems of human nature and human history have been sufficiently solved by gibbon and voltaire gil blas and figaro that our forefathers were silly barbarians that this glorious nineteenth century is the one region of light and that all before was outer darkness peopled by foreign devils englishmen no doubt according to the flesh but in spirit in knowledge in creed in customs so utterly different from ourselves that we shall merely show our sentimentalism by doing aught but laughing at them  on what other principle have our english histories as yet been constructed even down to the childrens books which taught us in childhood that the history of this country was nothing but a string of foolish wars carried on by wicked kings for reasons hitherto unexplained save on that great historic law of goldsmiths by which sir archibald alison would still explain the french revolution    the dog to serve his private ends went mad and bit the man   it will be answered by some and perhaps rather angrily that these strictures are too sweeping that there is arising in a certain quarter a school of history books for young people of a far more reverent tone which tries to do full honour to the church and her work in the world  those books of this school which we have seen we must reply seem just as much wanting in real reverence for the past as the school of gibbon and voltaire  it is not the past which they reverence but a few characters or facts eclectically picked out of the past and for the most part made to look beautiful by ignoring all the features which will not suit their preconceived pseudoideal there is in these books a scarcely concealed dissatisfaction with the whole course of the british mind since the reformation and though they are not inclined to confess the fact with its whole course before the reformation because that course was one of steady struggle against the papacy and its antinational pretensions  they are the outcome of an utterly unenglish tone of thought and the so called ages of faith are pleasant and useful to them principally because they are distant and unknown enough to enable them to conceal from their readers that in the ages on which they look back as ideally perfect a bernard and a francis of assisi were crying all day longo that my head were a fountain of tears that i might weep for the sins of my people  dante was cursing popes and prelates in the name of the god of righteousness boccaccio and chaucer were lifting the veil from priestly abominations of which we now are ashamed even to read and wolsey seeing the rottenness of the whole system spent his mighty talents and at last poured out his soul unto death in one long useless effort to make the crooked straight and number that which had been weighed in the balances of god and found for ever wanting  to ignore wilfully facts like these which were patent all along to the british nation facts on which the british laity acted till they finally conquered at the reformation and on which they are acting still and will probably act for ever is not to have any real reverence for the opinions or virtues of our forefathers and we are not astonished to find repeated in such books the old stock calumnies against our lay and protestant worthies taken at second hand from the pages of lingard  in copying from lingard however this party has done no more than those writers have who would repudiate any partyalmost any christianpurpose  lingard is known to have been a learned man and to have examined many manuscripts which few else had taken the trouble to look at so his word is to be taken no one thinking it worth while to ask whether he has either honestly read or honestly quoted the documents  it suited the sentimental and lazy liberality of the last generation to make a show of fairness by letting the popish historian tell his side of the story and to sneer at the illiberal old notion that gentlemen of his class were given to be rather careless about historic truth when they had a purpose to serve thereby and lingard is now actually recommended as a standard authority for the young by educated protestants who seem utterly unable to see that whether the man be honest or not his whole view of the course of british events since becket first quarrelled with his king must be antipodal to their own and that his account of all which has passed for three hundred years since the fall of wolsey is most likely to be and indeed may be proved to be one huge libel on the whole nation and the destiny which god has marked out for it  there is indeed no intrinsic cause why the ecclesiastical or pseudocatholic view of history should in any wise conduce to a just appreciation of our forefathers  for not only did our forefathers rebel against that conception again and again till they finally trampled it under their feet and so appear prima facie as offenders to be judged at its bar but the conception itself is one which takes the very same view of nature as that cynic conception of which we spoke above  man with the romish divines is ipso facto the same being as the man of voltaire le sage or beaumarchais he is an insane and degraded being who is to be kept in order and as far as may be cured and set to work by an ecclesiastical system and the only threads of light in the dark web of his history are clerical and theurgic not lay and human  voltaire is the very experimentum crucis of this ugly fact  european history looks to him what it would have looked to his jesuit preceptors had the sacerdotal element in it been wanting what heathen history actually did look to them  he eliminates the sacerdotal element and nothing remains but the chaos of apes and wolves which the jesuits had taught him to believe was the original substratum of society  the humanity of his historyeven of his pucelle dorleansis simply the humanity of sanchez and the rest of those vingtquatre peres who hang gibbeted for ever in the pages of pascal  he is superior to his teachers certainly in this that he has hope for humanity on earth dreams of a new and nobler life for society by means of a true and scientific knowledge of the laws of the moral and material universe in a word he has in the midst of all his filth and his atheism a faith in a righteous and truthrevealing god which the priests who brought him up had not  let the truth be spoken even though in favour of such a destroying azrael as voltaire  and what if his primary conception of humanity be utterly base  is that of our modern historians so much higher  do christian men seem to them on the whole in all ages to have had the spirit of god with them leading them into truth however imperfectly and confusedly they may have learnt his lessons  have they ever heard with their ears or listened when their fathers have declared unto them the noble works which god did in their days and in the old time before them  do they believe that the path of christendom has been on the whole the path of life and the right way and that the living god is leading her therein  are they proud of the old british worthies  are they jealous and tender of the reputation of their ancestors  do they believe that there were any worthies at all in england before the steamengine and political economy were discovered  do their conceptions of past society and the past generations retain anything of that great thought which is common to all the aryan racesthat is to all races who have left aught behind them better than mere mounds of earthto hindoo and persian greek and roman teuton and scandinavian that men are the sons of the heroes who were the sons of god  or do they believe that for civilised people of the nineteenth century it is as well to say as little as possible about ancestors who possessed our vices without our amenities our ignorance without our science who were bred no matter how like flies by summer heat out of that everlasting midden which men call the world to buzz and sting their foolish day and leave behind them a fresh race which knows them not and could win no honour by owning them and which owes them no more than if it had been produced as middenflies were said to be of old by some spontaneous generation  it is not probable that this writer will be likely to undervalue political economy or the steamengine or any other solid and practical good which god has unveiled to this generation  all that he does demand for he has a right to demand it is that rational men should believe that our forefathers were at least as good as we are that whatsoever their measure of light was they acted up to what they knew as faithfully as we do and that on the whole it was not their fault if they did not know more  even now the real discoveries of the age are made as of old by a very few men and when made have to struggle as of old against all manner of superstitions lazinesses scepticisms  is the history of the minie rifle one so very complimentary to our ages quickness of perception that we can afford to throw many stones at the prejudices of our ancestors  the truth is that as of old many men talk of robin hood who never shot in his bow and many talk of bacon who never discovered a law by induction since they were born  as far as our experience goes those who are loudest in their jubilations over the wonderful progress of the age are those who have never helped that progress forward one inch but find it a great deal easier and more profitable to use the results which humbler men have painfully worked out as secondhand capital for hustingsspeeches and railway books and flatter a mechanics institute of selfsatisfied youths by telling them that the least instructed of them is wiser than erigena or roger bacon let them be  they have their reward  and so also has the patient and humble man of science who the more he knows confesses the more how little he knows and looks back with affectionate reverence on the great men of old timeon archimedes and ptolemy aristotle and pliny and many another honourable man who walking in great darkness sought a ray of light and did not seek in vainas integral parts of that golden chain of which he is but one link more as scientific forefathers without whose aid his science could not have had a being  meanwhile this general tone of irreverence for our forefathers is no hopeful sign  it is unwise to inquire why the former times were better than these to hang lazily and weakly over some eclectic dream of a past golden age for to do so is to deny that god is working in this age as well as in past ages that his light is as near us now as it was to the worthies of old time  but it is more than unwise to boast and rejoice that the former times were worse than these and to teach young people to say in their hearts what clever fellows we are compared with our stupid old fogies of fathers  more than unwise for possibly it may be false in fact  to look at the political and moral state of europe at this moment christendom can hardly afford to look down on any preceding century and seems to be in want of something which neither science nor constitutional government seems able to supply  whether our forefathers also lacked that something we will not inquire just now but if they did their want of scientific and political knowledge was evidently not the cause of the defect or why is not spain now infinitely better instead of being infinitely worse off than she was three hundred years ago  at home toobut on the question whether we are so very much better off than our forefathers mr froude not we must speak  for he has deliberately in his new history set himself to the solution of this question and we will not anticipate what he has to say what we would rather insist on now are the moral effects produced on our young people by books which teach them to look with contempt on all generations but their own and with suspicion on all public characters save a few contemporaries of their own especial party  there is an ancient hebrew book which contains a singular story concerning a grandson who was cursed because his father laughed at the frailty of the grandfather  whether the reader shall regard that story as we do as a literal fact recorded by inspired wisdom as an instance of one of the great rootlaws of family life and therefore of that national life which as the hebrew book so cunningly shows is the organic development of the family life or whether he shall treat it as we do not as a mere apologue or myth he must confess that it is equally grand in its simplicity and singular in its unexpected result  the words of the story taken literally and simply no more justify the notion that canaans slavery was any magical consequence of the old patriarchs anger than they do the wellknown theory that it was the cause of the negros blackness ham shows a low foul irreverent unnatural temper towards his father  the old mans shame is not a cause of shame to his son but only of laughter  noah prophesies in the fullest and deepest meaning of that word that a curse will come upon that sons son that he will be a slave of slaves and reason and experience show that he spoke truth  let the young but see that their fathers have no reverence for the generation before them then will they in turn have no reverence for their fathers  let them be taught that the sins of their ancestors involve their own honour so little that they need not take any trouble to clear the blot off the scutcheon but may safely sit down and laugh over it saying very likely it is true  if so it is very amusing and if notwhat matterthen those young people are being bred up in a habit of mind which contains in itself all the capabilities of degradation and slavery in selfconceit hasty assertion disbelief in nobleness and all the other credulities of scepticism  parted from that past from which they take their common origin they are parted also from each other and become selfish selfseeking divided and therefore weak disbelieving in the nobleness of those who have gone before them they learn more and more to disbelieve in the nobleness of those around them and by denying gods works of old come by a just and dreadful nemesis to be unable to see his works in the men of their own day to suspect and impugn valour righteousness disinterestedness in their contemporaries to attribute low motives to pride themselves on looking at men and things as men who know the world so the young puppies style it to be less and less chivalrous to women less and less respectful to old men less and less ashamed of boasting about their sensual appetites in a word to show all those symptoms which when fully developed leave a generation without fixed principles without strong faith without self restraint without moral cohesion the sensual and divided prey of any race however inferior in scientific knowledge which has a clear and fixed notion of its work and destiny  that many of these signs are themselves more and more ominously showing in our young men from the fine gentleman who rides in rotten row to the boymechanic who listens enraptured to mr holyoakes exposures of the absurdity of all human things save mr holyoakes self is a fact which presses itself most on those who have watched this age most carefully and who rightly or wrongly attribute much of this miserable temper to the way in which history has been written among us for the last hundred years  whether or not mr froude would agree with these notions he is more or less responsible for them for they have been suggested by his history of england from the fall of wolsey to the death of elizabeth  it was impossible to read the book without feeling the contrast between its tone and that of every other account of the times which one had ever seen  mr froude seems to have set to work upon the principle too much ignored in judging of the past that the historians success must depend on his dramatic faculty and not merely on that constructive element of the faculty in which mr macaulay shows such astonishing power but on that higher and deeper critical element which ought to precede the constructive process and without which the constructive element will merely enable a writer as was once bitterly but truly said to produce the greatest possible misrepresentation with the least possible distortion of fact  that deeper dramatic faculty the critical is not logical merely but moral and depends on the moral health the wideness and heartiness of his moral sympathies by which he can put himselfas mr froude has attempted to do and as we think successfullyinto the place of each and every character and not merely feel for them but feel with them  he does not merely describe their actions from the outside attributing them arbitrarily to motives which are pretty sure to be the lowest possible because it is easier to conceive a low motive than a lofty one and to call a man a villain than to unravel patiently the tangled web of good and evil of which his thoughts are composed  he has attempted to conceive of his characters as he would if they had been his own contemporaries and equals acting speaking in his company and he has therefore thought himself bound to act toward them by those rules of charity and courtesy common alike to christian morals english law and decent society namely to hold every man innocent till he is proved guilty where a doubt exists to give the prisoner at the bar the benefit of it not to excite the minds of the public against him by those insinuative or vituperative epithets which are but adders and scorpions and on the whole to believe that a mans death and burial is not the least reason for ceasing to behave to him like a gentleman and a christian  we are not inclined to play with solemn things or to copy lucian and quevedo in writing dialogues of the dead but what dialogues might some bold pen dash off between the old sons of anak at whose coming hades has long ago been moved and to receive whom all the kings of the nation have risen up and the little scribblers who have fancied themselves able to fathom and describe characters to whom they were but pigmies  conceive a half hours interview between queen elizabeth and some popular lady scribbler who has been deluding herself into the fancy that gossiping inventories of millinery are history    you pretend to judge me whose labours whose cares whose fiery trials were beside yours as the heaving volcano beside a boys firework  you condemn my weaknesses  know that they were stronger than your strength  you impute motives for my sins  know that till you are as great as i have been for evil and for good you will be as little able to comprehend my sins as my righteousness  poor marshcroaker who wishest not merely to swell up to the bulk of the ox but to embrace it in thy little paws know thine own size and leave me to be judged by him who made me    how the poor soul would shrink back into nothing before that lion eye which saw and guided the destinies of the world and all the flunkeynature if such a vice exist beyond the grave come out in utter abjectness as if the ass in the fable on making his kick at the dead lion had discovered to his horror that the lion was alive and wellspirit of quevedo finish for us the picture which we cannot finish for ourselves  in a very different spirit from such has mr froude approached these times  great and good deeds were done in them and it has therefore seemed probable to him that there were great and good men there to do them  thoroughly awake to the fact that the reformation was the new birth of the british nation it has seemed to him a puzzling theory which attributes its success to the lust of a tyrant and the cupidity of his courtiers  it has evidently seemed to him paradoxical that a king who was reputed to have been a satyr instead of keeping as many concubines as seemed good to him should have chosen to gratify his passions by entering six times into the strict bonds of matrimony religiously observing those bonds  it has seemed to him even more paradoxical that one reputed to have been the most sanguinary tyrant who ever disgraced the english throne should have been not only endured but loved and regretted by a fierce and freespoken people and he we suppose could comprehend as little as we can the reasoning of such a passage as the following especially when it proceeds from the pen of so wise and venerable a writer as mr hallam  a government administered with so frequent violations not only of the chartered privileges of englishmen but of those still more sacred rights which natural law has established must have been regarded one would imagine with just abhorrence and earnest longings for a change  yet contemporary authorities by no means answer this expectation  some mention henry after his death in language of eulogy not only elizabeth be it remembered but cromwell also always spoke of him with deepest respect and their language always found an echo in the english heart and if we except those whom attachment to the ancient religion had inspired with hatred to his memory few seem to have been aware that his name would descend to posterity among those of the many tyrants and oppressors of innocence whom the wrath of heaven has raised up and the servility of man endured  the names of even those few we should be glad to have for it seems to us that with the exception of a few ultraprotestants who could not forgive that persecution of the reformers which he certainly permitted if not encouraged during one period of his reign no one adopted the modern view of his character till more than a hundred years after his death when belief in all nobleness and faith had died out among an ignoble and faithless generation and the scandalous gossip of such a light rogue as osborne was taken into the place of honest and respectful history  to clear up such seeming paradoxes as these by carefully examining the facts of the sixteenth century has been mr froudes work and we have the results of his labour in two volumes embracing only a period of eleven years but giving promise that the mysteries of the succeeding time will be well cleared up for us in future volumes and that we shall find our forefathers to have been if no better at least no worse men than ourselves  he has brought to the task known talents and learning a mastery over english prose almost unequalled in this generation a spirit of most patient and goodtempered research and that intimate knowledge of human motives and passions which his former books have shown and which we have a right to expect from any scholar who has really profited by aristotles unrivalled ethics  he has fairly examined every contemporary document within his reach and as he informs us in the preface he has been enabled through the kindness of sir francis palgrave to consult a great number of mss relating to the reformation hitherto all but unknown to the public and referred to in his work as mss in the rolls house where the originals are easily accessible  these he states he intends to publish with additions from his own reading as soon as he has brought his history down to the end of henry the eighths reign  but mr froudes chief textbook seems to have been state papers and acts of parliament  he has begun his work in the only temper in which a man can write accurately and well in a temper of trust toward the generation whom he describes  the only temper for if a man has no affection for the characters of whom he reads he will never understand them if he has no respect for his subject he will never take the trouble to exhaust it  to such an author the statutes at large as the deliberate expression of the nations will and conscience will appear the most important of all sources of information the first to be consulted the last to be contradicted the canon which is not to be checked and corrected by private letters and flying pamphlets but which is to check and correct them  this seems mr froudes theory and we are at no pains to confess that if he be wrong we see no hope of arriving at truth  if these public documents are not to be admitted in evidence before all others we see no hope for the faithful and earnest historian he must give himself up to swim as he may on the frothy stream of private letters anecdotes and pamphlets the puppet of the ignorance credulity peevishness spite of any and every gossip and scribbler  beginning his history with the fall of wolsey mr froude enters of course at his first step into the vexed question of henrys divorce an introductory chapter on the general state of england we shall notice hereafter  a very short inspection of the method in which he handles the divorce question gives us at once confidence in his temper and judgment and hope that we may at last come to some clearer understanding of it than the old law gives us which we have already quoted concerning the dog who went mad to serve his private ends  in a few masterly pages he sketches for us the rotting and dying church which had recovered her power after the wars of the roses over an exhausted nation but in form only not in life  wolsey with whom he has fair and understanding sympathy he sketches as the transition minister loving england well but loving rome better who intends a reform of the church but who as the popes commissioner for that very purpose is liable to a praemunire and therefore dare not appeal to parliament to carry out his designs even if he could have counted on the parliaments assistance in any measures designed to invigorate the church  at last arises in the divorce question the accident which brings to an issue on its most vital point the question of papal power in england and which finally draws down ruin upon wolsey himself  this appears to have begun in the winter of 152627  it was proposed to marry the princess mary to a son of the french king  the bishop of tarbes who conducted the negotiations advised himself apparently by special instigation of the evil spirit to raise a question as to her legitimacy  no more ingenious plan for convulsing england could have been devised  the marriage from which mary sprang only stood on a reluctant and doubtful dispensation of the popes  henry had entered into it at the entreaty of his ministers contrary to a solemn promise given to his father and in spite of the remonstrances of the archbishop of canterbury  no blessing seemed to have rested on it all his children had died young save this one sickly girl  a sure note of divine displeasure in the eyes of that coarseminded church which has always declared the chief if not the only purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children  but more  to question marys legitimacy was to throw open the question of succession to half a dozen ambitious competitors  it was too probably to involve england at henrys death in another civil war of the roses and in all the internecine horrors which were still rankling in the memories of men and probably also to bring down a french or scotch invasion  there was then too good reason as mr froude shows at length for wolseys assertion to john cassalis if his holiness which god forbid shall show himself unwilling to listen to the kings demands to me assuredly it will be but grief to live longer for the innumerable evils which i foresee will follow    nothing before us but universal and inevitable ruin  too good reason there was for the confession of the pope himself to gardner what danger it was to the realm to have this thing hang in suspense    that without an heirmale etc the realm was like to come to dissolution  too good reason for the bold assertion of the cardinalgovernor of bologna that he knew the guise of england as few men did and that if the king should die without heirsmale he was sure that it would cost two hundred thousand mens lives and that to avoid this mischief by a second marriage he thought would deserve heaven  too good reason for the assertion of hall that all indifferent and discreet persons judged it necessary for the pope to grant henry a divorce and by enabling him to marry again give him the hope of an undisputed heirmale  the pope had full power to do this in fact such cases had been for centuries integral parts of his jurisdiction as head of christendom  but he was at once too timid and too timeserving to exercise his acknowledged authority and thus just at the very moment when his spiritual power was being tried in the balance he chose himself to expose his political power to the same test  both were equally found wanting he had it appeared as little heart to do justice among kings and princes as he had to seek and to save the souls of men and the reformation followed as a matter of course  through the tangled brakes of this divorce question mr froude leads us with ease and grace throwing light and even beauty into dark nooks where before all was mist not merely by his intimate acquaintance with the facts but still more by his deep knowledge of human character and of womans even more than of mans  for the first time the actors in this long tragedy appear to us as no mere bodiless and soulless names but as beings of like passions with ourselves comprehensible coherent organic even in their inconsistencies  catherine of arragon is still the catherine of shakspeare but mr froude has given us the key to many parts of her story which shakspeare left unexplained and delicately enough has made us understand how henrys affections if he ever had any for herfaithfully as he had kept with one exception to that loveless mariage de convenancemay have been gradually replaced by indifference and even dislike long before the divorce was forced on him as a question not only of duty to the nation but of duty to heaven  and that he did see it in this latter light mr froude brings proof from his own words from which we can escape only by believing that the confessedly honest bluff king hal had suddenly become a consummate liar and a canting hypocrite  delicately too as if speaking of a lady whom he had met in modern society as a gentleman is bound to do does mr froude touch on the sins of that hapless woman who played for henrys crown and paid for it with her life  with all mercy and courtesy he gives us proof for he thinks it his duty to do so of the french miseducation the petty cunning the tendency to sensuality the wilful indelicacy of her position in henrys household as the rival of his queen which made her last catastrophe at least possible  of the justice of her sentence he has no doubt any more than of her preengagement to some one as proved by a letter existing among cromwells papers  poor thing  if she did that which was laid to her charge and more she did nothing after all but what she had been in the habit of seeing the queens and princesses of the french court do notoriously and laugh over shamelessly while as mr froude well says if we are to hold her entirely free from guilt we place not only the king but the privy council the judges the lords and commons and the two houses of convocation in a position fatal to their honour and degrading to ordinary humanity mr froude should have added anne boleyns own uncle the duke of norfolk and her father who were on the commission appointed to try her lovers and her cousin anthony st leger a man of the very highest character and ability who was on the jury which found a true bill against her  we can not continues mr froude acquiesce without inquiry in so painful a conclusion  the english nation also as well as she deserves justice at our hands and it cannot be thought uncharitable if we look with some scrutiny at the career of a person who but for the catastrophe with which it closed would not have so readily obtained forgiveness for having admitted the addresses of the king or for having received the homage of the court as its future sovereign while the kings wife her mistress as yet resided under the same roof  mr froudes conclusion is after examining the facts the same with the whole nation of england in henrys reign  but no one can accuse him of want of sympathy with the unhappy woman who reads the eloquent and affecting account of her trial and death which ends his second volume  our only fear is that by having thus told the truth he has instead of justifying our ancestors only added one more to the list of people who are to be given up with a cynical shrug and smile  we have heard already and among young ladies too who can be as cynical as other people in these times such speeches as well i suppose he has proved anne boleyn to be a bad creature but that does not make that horrid henry any more right in cutting off her head  thus two people will be despised where only one was before and the fact still ignored that it is just as senseless to say that henry cut off anne boleyns head as that queen victoria hanged palmer  death and death of a far more horrible kind than that which anne boleyn suffered was the established penalty of the offences of which she was convicted  and which had in her case this fearful aggravation that they were offences not against henry merely but against the whole english nation  she had been married in order that there might be an undisputed heir to the throne and a fearful war avoided  to throw into dispute by any conduct of hers the legitimacy of her own offspring argued a levity or a hard heartedness which of itself deserved the severest punishment  we will pass from this disagreeable topic to mr froudes lifelike sketch of pope clement and the endless tracasseries into which his mingled weakness and cunning led him and which like most crooked dealings ended by defeating their own object  pages 125 et sqq of vol i contain sketches of him his thoughts and ways as amusing as they are historically important but we have no space to quote from them  it will be well for those to whom the reformation is still a matter of astonishment to read those pages and consider what manner of man he was in spite of all pretended divine authority under whose rule the romish system received its irrecoverable wound  but of all these figures not excepting henrys own wolsey stands out as the most grand and tragical and mr froude has done good service to history if only in making us understand at last the wondrous butchers son  shakspeare seems to have felt though he could explain the reason neither to his auditors nor perhaps to himself that wolsey was on the whole an heroical man  mr froude shows at once his strength and his weakness his deep sense of the rottenness of the church his purpose to purge her from those abominations which were as well known it seems to him as they were afterwards to the whole people of england his vast schemes for education his still vaster schemes for breaking the alliance with spain and uniting france and england as fellowservants of the pope and twinpillars of the sacred fabric of the church which helped so much toward his interest in catherines divorce as a means these are his own words to bind my most excellent sovereign and this glorious realm to the holy roman see in faith and obedience for ever his hopes of deposing the emperor putting down the german heresies and driving back the turks beyond the pale of christendom his pathetic confession to the bishop of bayonne that if he could only see the divorce arranged the king remarried the succession settled and the laws and the church reformed he would retire from the world and would serve god the remainder of his days  peace be with him  he was surely a noble soul misled it may beas who is not when his turn comesby the pride of conscious power and though he loved england well yet loving rome better  but still it is a comfort to see either in past or in present one more brother whom we need not despise even though he may have wasted his energies on a dream  and on a dream he did waste them in spite of all his cunning  as mr froude in a noble passage says    extravagant as his hopes seem the prospect of realising them was humanly speaking neither chimerical nor even improbable  he had but made the common mistake of men of the world who are the representatives of an old order of things when that order is doomed and dying  he could not read the signs of the times and confounding the barrenness of death with the barrenness of winter which might be followed by a new spring and summer he believed that the old life tree of catholicism which in fact was but cumbering the ground might bloom again in its old beauty  the thing which he called heresy was the fire of almighty god which no politic congregation of princes no state machinery though it were never so active could trample out and as in the early years of christianity the meanest slave who was thrown to the wild beasts for his presence at the forbidden mysteries of the gospel saw deeper in the divine power of his faith into the future even of this earthly world than the sagest of his imperial persecutorsso a truer political prophet than wolsey would have been found in the most ignorant of those poor men for whom his police were searching in the purlieus of london who were risking death and torture in disseminating the pernicious volumes of the english testament   it will be seen from this magnificent passage that mr froude is distinctly a protestant  he is one to judge from his book and all the better one because he can sympathise with whatsoever nobleness even with whatsoever mere conservatism existed in the catholic party  and therefore because he has sympathies which are not merely party ones but human ones he has given the world in these two volumes a history of the early reformation altogether unequalled this human sympathy while it has enabled him to embalm in most affecting prose the sad story of the noble though mistaken carthusians and to make even the nun of kent interesting because truly womanly in her very folly and deceit has enabled him likewise to show us the hearts of the early martyrs as they never have been shown before  his sketch of the christian brothers and his little true romance of anthony dalaber the oxford student are gems of writing while his conception of latimer on whom he looks as the hero of the movement and all but an english luther is as worthy of latimer as it is of himself  it is written as history should be discriminatingly patiently and yet lovingly and genially rejoicing not in evil but in the truth and rejoicing still more in goodness where goodness can honestly be found  to the ecclesiastical and political elements in the english reformation mr froude devotes a large portion of his book  we shall not enter into the questions which he discusses therein  that aspect of the movement is a foreign and a delicate subject from discussing which a scotch periodical may be excused 2  north britain had a somewhat different problem to solve from her southern sister and solved it in an altogether different way  but this we must say that the facts and still more the state papers especially the petition of the commons as contrasted with the utterly benighted answer of the bishops which mr froude gives are such as to raise our opinion of the method on which the english part of the reformation was conducted and make us believe that in this as in other matters both henry and his parliament though still doctrinal romanists were soundheaded practical englishmen  this result is of the same kind as most of those at which mr froude arrives  they form altogether a general justification of our ancestors in henry the eighths time if not of henry the eighth himself which frees mr froude from that charge of irreverence to the past generations against which we protested in the beginning of the article  we hope honestly that he may be as successful in his next volumes as he has been in these in vindicating the worthies of the sixteenth century  whether he shall fail or not and whether or not he has altogether succeeded in the volumes before us his book marks a new epoch and we trust a healthier and loftier one in english history  we trust that they inaugurate a time in which the deeds of our forefathers shall be looked on as sacred heirlooms their sins as our shame their victories as bequests to us when men shall have sufficient confidence in those to whom they owe their existence to scrutinise faithfully and patiently every fact concerning them with a proud trust that search as they may they will not find much of which to be ashamed  lastly mr froude takes a view of henrys character not indeed new for it is the original one but obsolete for now two hundred years  let it be well understood that he makes no attempt he has been accused thereof to whitewash henry  all that he does is to remove as far as he can the modern layers of blackwash and to let the man himself fair or foul be seen  for the result he is not responsible  it depends on facts and unless mr froude has knowingly concealed facts to an amount of which even a lingard might be ashamed the result is that henry the eighth was actually very much the man which he appeared to be to the english nation in his own generation and for two or three generations after his deatha result which need not astonish us if we will only give our ancestors credit for having at least as much common sense as ourselves and believe why should we not that on the whole they understood their own business better than we are likely to do  the bloated tyrant it is confessed contrived somehow or other to be popular enough  mr froude tells us the reasons  he was not born a bloated tyrant any more than queen elizabeth though the fact is not generally known was born a wizened old woman  he was from youth till he was long past his grand climacteric a very handsome powerful and active man temperate in his habits goodhumoured frank and honest in his speech as even his enemies are forced to confess  he seems to have been as his portraits prove sufficiently for good and for evil a thorough john bull a thorough englishman  but one of the very highest type   had he died says mr froude previous to the first agitation of the divorce his loss would have been deplored as one of the heaviest misfortunes which had ever befallen this country and he would have left a name which would have taken its place in history by the side of the black prince or the conqueror of agincourt  left at the most trying age with his character unformed with the means of gratifying every inclination and married by his ministers when a boy to an unattractive woman far his senior he had lived for thirtysix years almost without blame and bore through england the reputation of an upright and virtuous king  nature had been prodigal to him of her rarest gifts    of his intellectual ability we are not left to judge from the suspicious panegyrics of his contemporaries  his state papers and letters may be placed by the side of those of wolsey or of cromwell and they lose nothing by the comparison  though they are broadly different the perception is equally clear the expression equally powerful and they breathe throughout an irresistible vigour of purpose  in addition to this he had a fine musical taste carefully cultivated he spoke and wrote in four languages and his knowledge of a multitude of subjects with which his versatile ability made him conversant would have formed the reputation of any ordinary man  he was among the best physicians of his age  he was his own engineer inventing improvements in artillery and new constructions in shipbuilding and this not with the condescending incapacity of a royal amateur but with thorough workmanlike understanding  his reading was vast especially in theology  he was attentive as it is called to his religious duties being present at the services in chapel two or three times a day with unfailing regularity and showing to outward appearance a real sense of religious obligation in the energy and purity of his life  in private he was goodhumoured and goodnatured  his letters to his secretaries though never undignified are simple easy and unrestrained and the letters written by them to him are similarly plain and businesslike as if the writers knew that the person whom they were addressing disliked compliments and chose to be treated as a man  he seems to have been always kind always considerate inquiring into their private concerns with genuine interest and winning as a consequence their sincere and unaffected attachment as a ruler he had been eminently popular  all his wars had been successful  he had the splendid tastes in which the english people most delighted    he had more than once been tried with insurrection which he had soothed down without bloodshed and extinguished in forgiveness    and it is certain that if he had died before the divorce was mooted henry viii like the roman emperor said by tacitus to have been censensu omnium dignus imperii nisi imperasset would have been considered by posterity as formed by providence for the conduct of the reformation and his loss would have been deplored as a perpetual calamity   mr froude has of course not written these words without having facts whereby to prove them  one he gives in an important note containing an extract from a letter of the venetian ambassador in 1515  at least if his conclusions be correct we must think twice ere we deny his assertion that the man best able of all living englishmen to govern england had been set to do it by the conditions of his birth  we are bound as mr froude says to allow him the benefit of his past career and be careful to remember it in interpreting his later actions  the true defect in his moral constitution that intense and imperious will common to all princes of the plantagenet blood had not yet been tested  that he did in his later years act in many ways neither wisely nor well no one denies that his conduct did not alienate the hearts of his subjects is what needs explanation and mr froudes opinions on this matter novel as they are and utterly opposed to that of the standard modern historians require careful examination  now i am not inclined to debate henry the eighths character or any other subject as between mr froude and an author of the obscurantist or pseudoconservative school  mr froude is liberal and so am i  i wish to look at the question as between mr froude and other liberals and therefore of course first as between mr froude and mr hallam  mr hallams name is so venerable and his work so important that to set ourselves up as judges in this or in any matter between him and mr froude would be mere impertinence  but speaking merely as learners we have surely a right to inquire why mr hallam has entered on the whole question of henrys relations to his parliament with a praejudicium against them for which mr froude finds no ground whatsoever in fact  why are all acts both of henry and his parliament to be taken in malam partem  they were not whigs certainly  neither were socrates and plato nor even st paul and st john  they may have been honest men as men go or they may not but why is there to be a feeling against them rather than for them why is henry always called a tyrant and his parliament servile  the epithets have become so common and unquestioned that our interrogation may seem startling  still we make it  why was henry a tyrant  that may be true but must be proved by facts  where are they  is the mere fact of a monarchs asking for money a crime in him and his ministers  the question would rather seem to be were the moneys for which henry asked needed or no and when granted were they rightly or wrongly applied  and on these subjects we want much more information than we obtain from any epithets  the author of a constitutional history should rise above epithets  or if he uses them should corroborate them by facts  why should not historians be as fair and as cautious in accusing henry and wolsey as they would be in accusing queen victoria and lord palmerston  what right allow us to ask has a grave constitutional historian to say that we cannot indeed doubt that the unshackled and despotic condition of his friend francis i afforded a mortifying contrast to henry  what document exists in which henry is represented as regretting that he is the king of a free peoplefor such mr hallam confesses just above england was held to be and was actually in comparison with france  if the document does not exist mr hallam has surely stepped out of the field of the historian into that of the novelist a la scott or dumas  the parliament sometimes grants henrys demands  sometimes it refuses them and he has to help himself by other means  why are both cases to be interpreted in malam partem  why is the parliaments granting to be always a proof of its servilityits refusing always a proof of henrys tyranny and rapacity  both views are mere praejudicia reasonable perhaps and possible  but why is not a praejudicium of the opposite kind as rational and as possible  why has not a historian a right to start as mr froude does by taking for granted that both parties may have been on the whole right that the parliament granted certain sums because henry was right in asking for them refused others because henry was wrong even that in some cases henry may have been right in asking the parliament wrong in refusing and that in such a case under the pressure of critical times henry was forced to get as he could the money which he saw that the national cause required  let it be as folks will  let henry be sometimes right and the parliament sometimes likewise or the parliament always right or henry always right or anything else save this strange diseased theory that both must have been always wrong and that evidence to that effect failing motives must be insinuated or openly asserted from the writers mere imagination  this may be a dream  but it is as easy to imagine as the other and more pleasant also  it will probably be answered though not by mr hallam himself by a sneer you do not seem to know much of the world sir  but so would figaro and gil blas have said and on exactly the same grounds  let us examine a stock instance of henrys rapacity and his parliaments servility namely the exactions in 1524 and 1525 and the subsequent release of the kings debts  what are the facts of the case  france and scotland had attacked england in 1514  the scotch were beaten at flodden  the french lost tournay and therouenne and when peace was made agreed to pay the expenses of the war  times changed and the expenses were not paid  a similar war arose in 1524 and cost england immense sums  a large army was maintained on the scotch border another army invaded france and wolsey not venturing to call a parliamentbecause he was as popes legate liable to a praemunireraised money by contributions and benevolences which were levied it seems on the whole uniformly and equally save that they weighed more heavily on the rich than on the poor if that be a fault and differed from taxes only in not having received the consent of parliament doubtless this was not the best way of raising money  but what if under the circumstances it were the only one  what if too on the whole the money so raised was really given willingly by the nation the sequel alone could decide that  the first contribution for which wolsey asked was paid  the second was resisted and was not paid proving thereby that the nation need not pay unless it chose  the court gave way and the war became defensive only till 1525  then the tide turned  the danger then was not from francis but from the emperor  francis was taken prisoner at pavia and shortly after rome was sacked by bourbon  the effect of all this in england is told at large in mr froudes second chapter  henry became bond for franciss ransom to be paid to the emperor  he spent 500000 crowns more in paying the french army and in the terms of peace made with france a sumtotal was agreed on for the whole debt old and new to be paid as soon as possible and an annual pension of 500000 crowns besides  the french exchequer however still remained bankrupt and again the money was not paid  parliament when it met in 1529 reviewed the circumstances of the expenditure and finding it all such as the nation on the whole approved legalised the taxation by benevolences retrospectively and this is the whole mares nest of the first payment of henrys debts if at least any faith is to be put in the preamble of the act for the release of the kings debts 21 hen viii c 24  the kings loving subjects the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present parliament assembled calling to remembrance the inestimable costs charges and expenses which the kings highness hath necessarily been compelled to support and sustain since his assumption to his crown estate and dignity royal as well for the extinction of a right dangerous and damnable schism sprung in the church as for the modifying the insatiable and inordinate ambition of them who while aspiring to the monarchy of christendom did put universal troubles and divisions in the same intending if they might not only to have subdued this realm but also all the rest unto their power and subjectionfor resistance whereof the kings highness was compelled to marvellous chargesboth for the supportation of sundry armies by sea and land and also for divers and manifold contribution on hand to save and keep his own subjects at home in rest and reposewhich hath been so politically handled that when the most part of all christian lands have been infested with cruel wars the great head and prince of the world the pope brought into captivity cities and towns taken spoiled burnt and sackedthe kings said subjects in all this time by the high providence and politic means of his grace have been nevertheless preserved defended and maintained from all these inconvenients etc  considering furthermore that his highness in and about the premises hath been fain to employ not only all such sums of money as hath risen or grown by contributions made unto his grace by his loving subjectsbut also over and above the same sundry other notable and excellent sums of his own treasure and yearly revenues among which manifold great sums so employed his highness also as is notoriously known and as doth evidently appear by the accounts of the same hath to that use and none other converted all such money as by any of his subjects hath been advanced to his grace by way of prest or loan either particularly or by any taxation made of the samebeing things so well collocate and bestowed seeing the said high and great fruits and effects thereof insured to the surety and commodity and tranquillity of this realmof our mind and consent do freely absolutely give and grant to the kings highness all and every sum or sums of money etc  the second release of the kings debts in 1544 is very similar the kings debts and necessities were really when we come to examine them those of the nation  in 153840 england was put into a thorough state of defence from end to end  fortresses were built along the scottish border and all along the coast opposite france and flanders  the people were drilled and armed the fleet equipped and the nation for the time became one great army  and nothing but this as may be proved by an overwhelming mass of evidence saved the country from invasion  here were enormous necessary expenses which must be met  in 1543 a million crowns were to have been paid by francis the first as part of his old debt  it was not paid  but on the contrary henry had to go to war for it  the nation again relinquished their claim and allowed henry to raise another benevolence in 1545 concerning which mr hallam tells us a great deal but not one word of the political circumstances which led to it or to the release keeping his sympathies and his paper for the sorrows of refractory alderman reed who refusing alone of all the citizens to contribute to the support of troops on the scotch border or elsewhere was sent down by a sort of rough justice to serve on the scotch border himself and judge of the perils of the nation with his own eyes and beingone is pleased to heartaken prisoner by the scots had to pay a great deal more as ransom than he would have paid as benevolence  but to return  what proof is there in all this of that servility which most historians and mr hallam among the rest are wont to attribute to henrys parliaments  what feeling appears on the face of this document which we have given and quoted but one honourable to the nation  through the falsehood of a foreign nation the king is unable to perform his engagements to the people  is not the just and generous course in such a case to release him from those engagements does this preamble does a single fact of the case justify historians in talking of these kings debts in just the same tone as that in which they would have spoken if the king had squandered the money on private pleasures  perhaps most people who write small histories believe that this really was the case  they certainly would gather no other impression from the pages of mr hallam  no doubt the act must have been burdensome on some people  many we are told had bequeathed their promissory notes to their children used their reversionary interest in the loan in many ways and these of course felt the change very heavily  no doubt  but why have we not a right to suppose that the parliament were aware of that fact but chose it as the less of the two evils  the king had spent the money he was unable to recover it from francis could only refund it by raising some fresh tax or benevolence  and why may not the parliament have considered the release of old taxes likely to offend fewer people than the imposition of new ones  it is certainly an ugly thing to break public faith but to prove that public faith was broken we must prove that henry compelled the parliament to release him if the act was of their own free will no public faith was broken for they were the representatives of the nation and through them the nation forgave its own debt  and what evidence have we that they did not represent the nation and that on the whole we must suppose as we should in the case of any other men that they best knew their own business  may we not apply to this case and to others mutatis mutandis the argument which mr froude uses so boldly and well in the case of anne boleyns trialthe english nation also as well as    deserves justice at our hands  certainly it does  but it is a disagreeable token of the method on which we have been accustomed to write the history of our own forefathers that mr froude should find it necessary to state formally so very simple a truth  what proof we ask again is there that this old parliament was servile  had that been so wolsey would not have been afraid to summon it  the specific reason for not summoning a parliament for six years after that of 1524 was that they were not servile that when here we are quoting mr hallam and not mr froude wolsey entered the house of commons with a great train seemingly for the purpose of intimidation they made no other answer to his harangues than that it was their usage to debate only among themselves  the debates on this occasion lasted fifteen or sixteen days during which says an eyewitness there has been the greatest and sorest hold in the lower house the matter debated and beaten such hold that the house was like to have been dissevered in a word hard fightingand why not honest fightingbetween the court party and the opposition which ended says mr hallam in the court party obtaining with the utmost difficulty a grant much inferior to the cardinals original requisition  what token of servility is here  and is it reasonable to suppose that after wolsey was conquered and a comparatively popular ministry had succeeded and that memorable parliament of 1529 which mr froude not unjustly thinks more memorable than the long parliament itself began its great work with a high hand backed not merely by the king but by the public opinion of the majority of england their decisions are likely to have been more servile than before  if they resisted the king when they disagreed with him are they to be accused of servility because they worked with him when they agreed with him  is an opposition always in the right a ministerial party always in the wrong  is it an offence against the people to agree with the monarch even when he agrees with the people himself  simple as these questions are one must really stop to ask them  no doubt pains were often taken to secure elections favourable to the government  are none taken now  are not more taken now  will any historian show us the documents which prove the existence in the sixteenth century of reform club carlton club whippersin and nominees governmental and opposition and all the rest of the beautiful machinery which protects our reformed parliament from the evil influences of bribery and corruption  pahwe have somewhat too much glass in our modern house to afford to throw stones at our forefathers old st stephens  at the worst what was done then but that without which it is said to be impossible to carry on a government now  take an instance from the parliament of 1539 one in which there is no doubt government influence was used in order to prevent as much as possible the return of members favourable to the clergyfor the good reason that the clergy were no doubt on their own side intimidating voters by all those terrors of the unseen world which had so long been to them a source of boundless profit and power  cromwell writes to the king to say that he has secured a seat for a certain sir richard morrison but for what purpose  as one who no doubt should be ready to answer and take up such as should crack or face with literature of learning if any such should be  there was then free discussion they expected clever and learned speakers in the opposition and on subjects of the deepest import not merely political but spiritual and the government needed men to answer such  what more natural than that so close on the pilgrimage of grace and in the midst of so great dangers at home and abroad the government should have done their best to secure a welldisposed house one would like to know when they would not  but surely the very effort confessedly exceptional and the acknowledged difficulty prove that parliament were no mere registrars of edicts  but the strongest argument against the tyranny of the tudors and especially of henry viii in his benevolences is derived from the state of the people themselves  if these benevolences had been really unpopular they would not have been paid  in one case we have seen a benevolence was not paid for that very reason  for the method of the tudor sovereigns like that of their predecessors was the very opposite to that of tyrants in every age and country  the first act of a tyrant has always been to disarm the people and to surround himself with a standing army  the tudor method was as mr froude shows us by many interesting facts to keep the people armed and drilled even to compel them to learn the use of weapons throughout england spread one vast military organisation which made every adult a soldier and enabled him to find at a days notice his commanding officer whether landlord sheriff or lieutenant of the county so that as a foreign ambassador of the time remarks with astonishment we quote from memory england is the strongest nation on earth for though the king has not a single mercenary soldier he can raise in three days an army of two hundred thousand men  and of what temper those men were it is well known enough  mr froude calls themand we beg leave to endorse without exception mr froudes opiniona sturdy highhearted race sound in body and fierce in spirit and furnished with thews and sinews which under the stimulus of those great shins of beef their common diet were the wonder of the age  what comyn folke in all this world says a state paper in 1515 may compare with the comyns of england in riches freedom liberty welfare and all prosperity  what comyn folk is so mighty so strong in the felde as the comyns of england in authentic stories of actions under henry viiiand we will add under elizabeth likewisewhere the accuracy of the account is undeniable no disparity of force made englishmen shrink from enemies whenever they could meet them  again and again a few thousands of them carried dismay into the heart of france  four hundred adventurers vagabond apprentices of london who formed a volunteer corps in the calais garrison were for years hall says the terror of normandy  in the very frolic of conscious power they fought and plundered without pay without reward save what they could win for themselves and when they fell at last they fell only when surrounded by six times their number and were cut to pieces in careless desperation  invariably by friend and foe alike the english are described as the fiercest people in all europeenglish wild beasts benvenuto cellini calls them and this great physical power they owed to the profuse abundance in which they lived to the soldiers training in which every one of them was bred from childhood  mr froudes novel assertion about profuse abundance must be weighed by those who have read his invaluable introductory chapter  but we must ask at once how it was possible to levy on such an armed populace a tax which they were determined not to pay and felt that they were not bound to pay either in law or justice  conceive lord palmerstons sending down to demand a benevolence from the army at aldershot beginning with the general in command and descending to the privates    what would be the consequences  ugly enough  but gentle in comparison with those of any attempt to exact a really unpopular tax from a nation of wellarmed englishmen unless they on the whole thought the tax fit to be paid  they would grumble of course whether they intended to pay or notfor were they not englishmen our own flesh and bloodand grumble all the more in person because they had no press to grumble for them  but what is there then in the mps letter to lord surrey quoted by mr hallam p 25 or in the more pointed letter of warhams two pages on which we do not see lying on our breakfast tables in half the newspapers every week  poor pedantic obstructive old warham himself very angry at so much being asked of his brother clergymen and at their being sworn as to the value of their goods so like are old times to new ones and being on the whole of opinion that the world the church included is going to the devil says that as he has been showed in a secret manner of his friends the people sore grudgeth and murmureth and speaketh cursedly among themselves as far as they dare saying they shall never have rest of payments as long as some liveth and that they had better die than thus be continually handed reckoning themselves their wives and children as despoulit and not greatly caring what they do or what becomes of them  very dreadfulif true  which last point depends very much upon who warham was  now on reading mr froudes or any other good history we shall find that warham was one of the leaders of that despondent party which will always have its antitype in england  have we too not heard within the last seven years similar prophecies of desolation mourning and woeof the church tottering on the verge of ruin the peasantry starving under the horrors of free trade noble families reduced to the verge of beggary by double incometax even such a prophet seems warham to have beenof all people in that day one of the last whom one would have asked for an opinion  poor old warham however was not so far wrong in this particular case for the despoulit slaves of suffolk not content with grumbling rose up with sword and bow and vowed that they would not pay  whereon the bloated tyrant sent his praetorians and enforced payment by scourge and thumbscrew  not in the least  they would not pay and therefore being free men nobody could make them pay and although in the neighbouring county of norfolk from twenty pounds ie 200 pounds of our money upwardfor the tax was not levied on men of less substancethere were not twenty but what had consented and though there was great likelihood that this grant should be much more than the loan was the salt tears shed by the gentlemen of norfolk proceeding says expressly the duke of norfolk only from doubt how to find money to content the kings highness yet the king and wolsey gave way frankly and at once and the contribution was remitted although the dukes of norfolk and suffolk writing to wolsey treat the insurrection lightly and seem to object to the remission as needless  from all which factsthey are mr hallams not mr froudeswe can deduce not tyranny but lenity good sense and the frank withdrawal from a wrong position as soon as the unwillingness of the people proved it to be a wrong one  this instance is well brought forward though only in a line or two by mr froude as one among many proofs that the working classes in henry the eighths time enjoyed an abundance far beyond that which in general falls to the lot of that order in longsettled countries incomparably beyond what the same class were enjoying at that very time in germany or france  the laws secured them and that the laws were put in force we have the direct evidence of successive acts of the legislature justifying the general policy by its success  and we have also the indirect evidence of the contented loyalty of the great body of the people at a time when if they had been discontented they held in their own hands the means of asserting what the law acknowledged to be their right  the government as we have just shown at length had no power to compel injustice    if the peasantry had been suffering under any real grievances we should have heard of them when the religious rebellions furnished so fair an opportunity to press them forward  complaint was loud enough when complaint was just under the somerset protectorate  such broad facts as thesefor facts they areought to make us pause ere we boast of the greater liberty enjoyed by englishmen of the present day as compared with the tyranny of tudor times  thank god there is no lack of that blessing now  but was there any real lack of it then  certainly the outward notes of a tyranny exist now in far greater completeness than then  a standing army a government police ministries who bear no love to a militia and would consider the compulsory arming and drilling of the people as a dangerous insanity do not look at first sight as much like free institutions as a government which though again and again in danger not merely of rebellion but of internecine wars of succession so trusted the people as to force weapons into their hands from boyhood  let us not be mistaken  we are no hankerers after retrogression  the present system works very well let it be all that we say is that the imputation of despotic institutions lies prima facie rather against the reign of queen victoria than against that of king henry the eighth  of course it is not so in fact  many modern methods which are despotic in appearance are not so in practice  let us believe that the same was the case in the sixteenth century  our governors now understand their own business best and make a very fair compromise between discipline and freedom  let us believe that the men of the sixteenth century did so likewise  all we ask is that our forefathers should be judged as we wish to be judged ourselves not according to outward appearance but with righteous judgment  mr froude finds the cause of this general contentment and loyalty of the masses in the extreme care which the government took of their wellbeing  the introductory chapter in which he proves to his own satisfaction the correctness of his opinion is well worth the study of our political economists  the facts which he brings seem certainly overwhelming of course they can only be met by counter facts and our knowledge does not enable us either to corroborate or refute his statements  the chief argument used against them seems to us at least to show that for some cause or other the working classes were prosperous enough  it is said the acts of parliament regulating wages do not fix the minimum of wages but the maximum they are not intended to defend the employed against the employer but the employer against the employed in a defective state of the labour market when the workmen by the fewness of their numbers were enabled to make extravagant demands  let this be the casewe do not say that it is sowhat is it but a token of prosperity among the working classes  a labour market so thin that workmen can demand their own price for their labour till parliament is compelled to bring them to reason is surely a time of prosperity to the employed a time of full work and high wages of full stomachs inclined from very prosperity to wax fat and kick  if however any learned statistician should be able to advance on the opposite side of the question enough to weaken some of mr froudes conclusions he must still if he be a just man do honour to the noble morality of this most striking chapter couched as it is in as perfect english as we have ever had the delight of reading  we shall leave then the battle of facts to be fought out by statisticians always asking mr froudes readers to bear in mind that though other facts may be true yet his facts are no less true likewise and we shall quote at length both as a specimen of his manner and of his matter the last three pages of this introductory chapter in which after speaking of the severity of the laws against vagrancy and showing how they were excused by the organisation which found employment for every able bodied man he goes on to say   it was therefore the expressed conviction of the english nation that it was better for a man not to live at all than to live a profitless and worthless life  the vagabond was a sore spot upon the commonwealth to be healed by wholesale discipline if the gangrene was not incurable to be cut away with the knife if the milder treatment of the cartwhip failed to be of profit  a measure so extreme in its severity was partly dictated by policy the state of the country was critical and the danger from questionable persons traversing it unexamined and uncontrolled was greater than at ordinary times  but in point of justice as well as of prudence it harmonised with the iron temper of the age and it answered well for the government of a fierce and powerful people in whose hearts lay an intense hatred of rascality and among whom no one could have lapsed into evil courses except by deliberate preference for them  the moral sinew of the english must have been strong indeed when it admitted of such stringent bracing but on the whole they were ruled as they preferred to be ruled and if wisdom can be tested by success the manner in which they passed the great crisis of the reformation is the best justification of their princes the era was great throughout europe  the italians of the age of michael angelo the spaniards who were the contemporaries of cortez the germans who shook off the pope at the call of luther and the splendid chivalry of francis i of france were no common men  but they were all brought face to face with the same trials and none met them as the english met them  the english alone never lost their selfpossession and if they owed something to fortune in their escape from anarchy they owed more to the strong hand and steady purpose of their rulers  to conclude this chapter then  in the brief review of the system under which england was governed we have seen a state of things in which the principles of political economy were consciously or unconsciously contradicted where an attempt more or less successful was made to bring the production and distribution of wealth under the moral rule of right or wrong and where those laws of supply and demand which we are now taught to regard as immutable ordinances of nature were absorbed or superseded by a higher code  it is necessary for me to repeat that i am not holding up the sixteenth century as a model which the nineteenth might safely follow  the population has become too large and employment too complicated and fluctuating to admit of such control while in default of control the relapse upon selfinterest as the one motive principle is certain to ensue and when it ensues is absolute in its operations  but as even with us these socalled ordinances of nature in time of war consent to be suspended and duty to his country becomes with every good citizen a higher motive of action than the advantages which he may gain in an enemys market so it is not uncheering to look back upon a time when the nation was in a normal condition of militancy against social injusticewhen the government was enabled by happy circumstances to pursue into detail a single and serious aim at the wellbeingwellbeing in its widest senseof all members of the commonwealth  there were difficulties and drawbacks at that time as well as this  of liberty in the modern sense of the wordof the supposed right of every man to do what he will with his own or with himselfthere was no idea  to the question if ever it was asked may i not do what i will with my own there was the brief answer no man may do what is wrong either with what is his own or with what is anothers  producers too who were not permitted to drive down their workmens wages by competition could not sell their goods as cheaply as they might have done and the consumer paid for the law in an advance of price but the burden though it fell heavily on the rich lightly touched the poor and the rich consented cheerfully to a tax which ensured the loyalty of the people  the working man of modern times has bought the extension of his liberty at the price of his material comfort the higher classes have gained in wealth what they have lost in power  it is not for the historian to balance advantages  his duty is with the facts   our forefathers then were not free if we attach to that word the meaning which our transatlantic brothers seem inclined to give to it they had not learnt to deify selfwill and to claim for each member of the human race a right to the indulgence of every eccentricity they called themselves free and boasted of their freedom but their conception of liberty was that of all old nations a freedom which not only allowed of discipline but which grew out of it  no people had less wish to exalt the kingly power into that specious tyranny a paternal government the king was with them and always had been both formally and really subject to their choice bound by many oaths to many duties the minister not the master of the people but their whole conception of political life was nevertheless shaped by their conception of family life  strict obedience stern discipline compulsory education in practical duties was the law of the latter without such training they thought their sons could never become in any true sense men  and when they grew up their civic life was to be conducted on the same principles for the very purpose of enabling them to live as members of a free nation  if the self will of the individual was curbed now and then needlesslyas it is the nature of all human methods to caricature themselves at times the purpose was not to weaken the man but to strengthen him by strengthening the body to which he belonged  the nation was to be free selfhelping selfcontaining unconquerable to that great purpose the will the fancyeven if need be the mortal life of the individual must give way  men must be trained at all costs in self restraint because only so could they become heroes in the day of danger in selfsacrifice for the common good because only so would they remain united while foreign nations and evil home influences were trying to tear them asunder  in a word their conception of life was as a warfare their organisation that of a regiment  it is a question whether the conception of corporate life embodied in a regiment or army be not after all the best working one for this world  at least the problem of a perfect society howsoever beautiful on paper will always issue in a compromise more or less perfectlet us hope more and more perfect as the centuries roll on between the strictness of military discipline and the irishmans laissezfaire ideal wherein every man should do that which was right in the sight of his own eyes and wrong too if he liked  at least such had england been for centuries under such a system had she thriven a fact which duly considered should silence somewhat those gentlemen who not being of a military turn themselves inform europe so patriotically and so prudently that england is not a military nation  from this dogma we beg leave to differ utterly  britain is at this moment in our eyes the only military nation in europe  all other nations seem to us to have military governments but not to be military themselves  as proof of the assertion we appeal merely to the existence of our militia  while other nations are employing conscription we have raised in twelve months a noble army every soul of which has volunteered as a free man and yet forsooth we are not a military nation  we are not ashamed to tell how but the other day standing in the rear of those militia regiments no matter where a flush of pride came over us at the sight of those lads but a few months since helpless and awkward country boors now full of sturdy intelligence cheerful obedience and the manhood which can afford to be respectful to others because it respects itself and knows that it is respected in turn  true they had not the lightness the order the practical ease the cunning self helpfulness of the splendid german legionaries who stood beside them the breast of every other private decorated with clasps and medals for service in the wars of seven years since  as an invading body perhaps one would have preferred the germans but only because experience had taught them already what it would teach in twelve months to the berkshire or cambridge clod  there to us was the true test of englands military qualities her young men had come by tens of thousands of their own free will to be made soldiers of by her country gentlemen and treated by them the while as men to be educated not as things to be compelled not driven like sheep to the slaughter to be disciplined by men with whom they had no bond but the mere official one of military obedience and what we ask ourselves does england lack to make her a second rome  her people have physical strength animal courage that selfdependence of freemen which enabled at inkerman the privates to fight on literally without officers every man for his own hand  she has inventive genius enormous wealth and if as is said her soldiers lack at present the selfhelpfulness of the zouave it is ridiculous to suppose that that quality could long be wanting in the men of a nation which is at this moment the foremost in the work of emigration and colonisation  if organising power and military system be as is said lacking in high quarters surely there must be organising power enough somewhere in the greatest industrial nation upon earth ready to come forward when there is a real demand for it and whatever be the defects of our system we are surely not as far behind prussia or france as rome was behind the carthaginians and the greeks whom she crushed  a few years sufficed for them to learn all they needed from their enemies fewer still would suffice us to learn from our friends  our working classes are not like those of america in a state of physical comfort too great to make it worth while for them to leave their home occupations and whether that be a good or an evil it at least ensures us as our militia proves an almost inexhaustible supply of volunteers  what a new and awful scene for the worlds drama did such a nation as this once set before itself steadily and ruthlessly as rome did of old the idea of conquest even now waging war as she has done as it were greek text which cannot be reproduced thinking war too unimportant a part of her work to employ on it her highest intellects her flag has advanced in the last fifty years over more vast and richer tracts than that of any european nation upon earth  what keeps her from the dream which lured to their destruction babylon macedonia rome  this  that thank god she has a conscience still that feeling intensely the sacredness of her own national life she has learned to look on that of other peoples as sacred also and since in the fifteenth century she finally repented of that wild and unrighteous dream of conquering france she has discovered more and more that true military greatness lies in the power of defence and not of attack not in waging war but being able to wage it and has gone on her true mission of replenishing the earth more peacefully on the whole and more humanely than did ever nation before her conquering only when it was necessary to put down the lawlessness of the savage few for the wellbeing of the civilised many  this has been her idea she may have confused it and herself in caffre or in chinese wars for who can always be true to the light within him  but this has been her idea and therefore she stands and grows and thrives a virgin land for now eight hundred years  but a fancy has come over us during the last blessed forty years of unexampled peace from which our ancestors of the sixteenth century were kept by stern and yet most wholesome lessons the fancy that peace and not war is the normal condition of the world  the fancy is so fair that we blame none who cherish it after all they do good by cherishing it they point us to an ideal which we should otherwise forget as babylon rome france in the seventeenth century forgot utterly  only they are in haste and pardonable haste too to realise that ideal forgetting that to do so would be really to stop short of it and to rest contented in some form of human society far lower than that which god has actually prepared for those who love him  better to believe that all our conceptions of the height to which the human race might attain are poor and paltry compared with that toward which god is guiding it and for which he is disciplining it by awful lessons  and to fight on if need be ruthless and yet full of pityand many a noble soul has learnt within the last two years how easy it is to reconcile in practice that seeming paradox of wordssmiting down stoutly evil wheresoever we shall find it and saying what ought to be we know not god alone can know  but that this ought not to be we do know and here in gods name it shall not stay  we repeat it  war in some shape or other is the normal condition of the world  it is a fearful fact  but we shall not abolish it by ignoring it and ignoring by the same method the teaching of our bibles  not in mere metaphor does the gospel of love describe the life of the individual good man as a perpetual warfare  not in mere metaphor does the apostle of love see in his visions of the worlds future no arcadian shepherd paradises not even a perfect civilisation but an eternal war in heaven wrath and woe plague and earthquake and amid the everlasting storm the voices of the saints beneath the altar crying lord how long  shall we pretend to have more tender hearts than the old man of ephesus whose dying sermon so old legends say was nought butlittle children love one another and who yet could denounce the liar and the hater and the covetous man and proclaim the vengeance of god against all evildoers with all the fierceness of an isaiah  it was enough for himlet it be enough for usthat he should see above the thunder cloud and the rain of blood and the scorpion swarm and the great angel calling all the fowl of heaven to the supper of the great god that they might eat the flesh of kings and valiant men a city of god eternal in the heavens and yet eternally descending among men a perfect order justice love and peace becoming actual more and more in every age through all the fearful training needful for a fallen race  let that be enough for us  but do not let us fancy that what is true of the two extremes must not needs be true of the mean also that while the life of the individual and of the universe is one of perpetual selfdefence the life of the nation can be aught else  or that any appliances of scientific comforts any intellectual cultivation even any of the most direct and commonsense arguments of selfinterest can avail to quiet in man those outbursts of wrath ambition cupidity wounded pride which have periodically convulsed and will convulse to the end the human race  the philosopher in his study may prove their absurdity their suicidal folly till deluded by the strange lull of a forty years peace he may look on wars as in the same category with flagellantisms witchmanias and other popular delusions as insanities of the past impossible henceforth and may prophesy as really wise political economists were doing in 1847 that mankind had grown too sensible to go to war any more  and behold the peace proves only to be the lull before the thunderstorm and one electric shock sets free forces unsuspected transcendental supernatural in the deepest sense forces which we can no more stop by shrieks at their absurdity from incarnating themselves in actual blood and misery and horror than we can control the madman in his paroxysm by telling him that he is a madman  and so the fair vision of the student is buried once more in rack and hail and driving storm and like daniel of old when rejoicing over the coming restoration of his people he sees beyond the victory some darker struggle still and lets his notes of triumph die away into a wailand the end thereof shall be with a flood and to the end of the war desolations are determined  it is as impossible as it would be unwise to conceal from ourselves the fact that all the continental nations look upon our present peace as but transitory momentary and on the crimean war as but the prologue to a fearful dramaall the more fearful because none knows its purpose its plot which character will be assumed by any given actor and least of all the denouement of the whole  all that they feel and know is that everything which has happened since 1848 has exasperated not calmed the electric tension of the european atmosphere that a rottenness rapidly growing intolerable alike to god and the enemies of god has eaten into the vitals of continental life that their rulers know neither where they are nor whither they are going and only pray that things may last out their time  all notes which one would interpret as proving the continent to be already ripe for subjection to some one devouring race of conquerors were there not a ray of hope in an expectation even more painful to our human pity which is held by some of the wisest among the germans namely that the coming war will fast resolve into no struggle between bankrupt monarchs and their respective armies but a war between nations themselves an internecine war of opinions and of creeds  there are wise germans now who prophesy with sacred tears a second thirty years war with all its frantic horrors for their hapless country which has found two centuries too short a time wherein to recover from the exhaustion of that first fearful scourge let us trust if that war shall beget its new tillys and wallensteins it shall also beget its new gustavus adolphus and many another child of light  but let us not hope that we can stand by in idle comfort and that when the overflowing scourge passes by it shall not reach to us  shame to us were that our destiny  shame to us were we to refuse our share in the struggles of the human race and to stand by in idle comfort while the lords battles are being fought  honour to us if in that day we have chosen for our leaders as our forefathers of the sixteenth century did men who see the work which god would have them do and have hearts and heads to do it honour to us if we spend this transient lull as our forefathers of the sixteenth century did in setting our house in order in redressing every grievance reforming every abuse knitting the hearts of the british nation together by practical care and help between class and class man and man governor and governed that we may bequeath to our children as henry the eighths men did to theirs a british national life so united and wholehearted so clear in purpose and sturdy in execution so trained to know the right side at the first glance and take it that they shall look back with love and honour upon us their fathers determined to carry out even to the death the method which we have bequeathed to them then if god will that the powers of evil physical and spiritual should combine against this land as they did in the days of good queen bess we shall not have lived in vain for those who as in queen besss days thought to yoke for their own use a labouring ox will find as then that they have roused a lion from his den    footnotes   1  north british review no  li november 1856a history of england from the fall of wolsey to the death of elizabeth  by j a
