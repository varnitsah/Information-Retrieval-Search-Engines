 preface   it may surprise many whose knowledge of wild animals is gained from rare fleeting glimpses of frightened hoof or wing in the woods to consider that there can be such a thing as a school for the wood folk or that instruction has any place in the life of the wild things nevertheless it is probably true that education among the higher order of animals has its distinct place and value their knowledge however simple is still the result of three factors instinct training and experience instinct only begins the work the mothers training develops and supplements the instinct and contact with the world with its sudden dangers and unknown forces finishes the process  for many years the writer has been watching animals and recording his observations with the idea of determining if possible which of these three is the governing factor in the animals life some of the results of this study were published last year in a book called school of the woods which consisted of certain studies of animals from life and certain theories in the form of essays to account for what the writers eyes had seen and his own ears heard in the great wilderness among the animals  a school reader is no place for theories therefore that part of the book is not given here the animal studies alone are reproduced in answer to the requests from many teachers that these be added to the wood folk books from these the reader can form his own conclusions as to the relative importance of instinct and training if he will but there is another and a better way open watch the purple martins for a few days when the young birds first leave the house find a crows nest and watch secretly while the old birds are teaching their little ones to fly follow a fox or any other wild motheranimal patiently as she leaves the den and leads the cubs out into the world of unknown sights and sounds and smellsand you will learn more in a week of what education means to the animals than anybodys theories can ever teach you  these are largely studies of individual animals and birds they do not attempt to give the habits of a class or species for the animals of the same class are alike only in a general way they differ in interest and intelligence quite as widely as men and women of the same class if you but watch them closely enough the names here given are those of the milicete indians as nearly as i can remember them and the incidents have all passed under my owneyes and were recorded in the woods from my tent or canoe just as i saw them  william j long  stamford conn march 1903     contents

crouching haunches finished the work   183     what the fawns must know  illustration   to this day it is hard to understand how any eyes could have found them they were so perfectly hidden i was following a little brook which led me by its singing to a deep dingle in the very heart of the big woods a great fallen tree lay across my path and made a bridge over the stream now bridges are for crossing that is plain to even the least of the wood folk so i sat down on the mossy trunk to see who my neighbors might be and what little feet were passing on the kings highway  here beside me are claw marks in the moldy bark only a bear could leave that deep strong imprint and see there is where the moss slipped and broke beneath his weight a restless tramp is mooween who scatters his records over forty miles of hillside on a summer day when his lazy mood happens to leave him for a season here on the other side are the bronzegreen petals of a spruce cone chips from a squirrels workshop scattered as if meeko had brushed them hastily from his yellow apron when he rushed out to see mooween as he passed there beyond is a mink sign plain as daylight where cheokhes sat down a little while after his breakfast of frogs and here clinging to a stub touching my elbow as i sit with heels dangling idly over the lazy brook is a crinkly yellow hair which tells me that eleemos the sly one as simmo calls him hates to wet his feet and so uses a fallen tree or a stone in the brook for a bridge like his brother fox of the settlements  just in front of me was another fallen tree lying alongside the stream in such a way that no animal more dangerous than a roving mink would ever think of using it under its roots away from the brook was a hidden and roomy little house with hemlock tips drooping over its doorway for a curtain a pretty place for a den i thought for no one could ever find you there then as if to contradict me a stray sunbeam found the spot and sent curious bright glintings of sheen and shadow dancing and playing under the fallen roots and trunk beautiful i cried as the light fell on the brown mold and flecked it with white and yellow the sunbeam went away again but seemed to leave its brightness behind it for there were still the goldbrown mold under the roots and the flecks of white and yellow i stooped down to see it better i reached in my handthen the brown mold changed suddenly to softest fur the glintings of white and yellow were the dappled sides of two little fawns lying there very still and frightened just where their mother had hidden them when she went away  they were but a few days old when i found them each had on his little josephs coat and each i think must have had also a magic cloak somewhere about him for he had only to lie down anywhere to become invisible the curious markings like the play of light and shadow through the leaves hid the little owners perfectly so long as they held themselves still and let the sunbeams dance over them their beautiful heads were a study for an artistdelicate graceful exquisitely colored and their great soft eyes had a questioning innocence as they met yours which went straight to your heart and made you claim the beautiful creatures for your own instantly indeed there is nothing in all the woods that so takes your heart by storm as the face of a little fawn  they were timid at first lying close without motion of any kind the instinct of obediencethe first and strongest instinct of every creature born into this worldkept them loyal to the mothers command to stay where they were and be still till she came back so even after the hemlock curtain was brushed aside and my eyes saw and my hand touched them they kept their heads flat to the ground and pretended that they were only parts of the brown forest floor and that the spots on their bright coats were but flecks of summer sunshine  i felt then that i was an intruder that i ought to go straight away and leave them but the little things were too beautiful lying there in their wonderful old den with fear and wonder and questionings dancing in their soft eyes as they turned them back at me like a mischievous child playing peekaboo it is a tribute to our higher nature that one cannot see a beautiful thing anywhere without wanting to draw near to see to touch to possess it and here was beauty such as one rarely finds and though i was an intruder i could not go away  the hand that touched the little wild things brought no sense of danger with it it searched out the spots behind their velvet ears where they love to be rubbed it wandered down over their backs with a little wavy caress in its motion it curled its palm up softly under their moist muzzles and brought their tongues out instantly for the faint suggestion of salt that was in it suddenly their heads came up all deception was over now they had forgotten their hiding their first lesson they turned and looked at me full with their great innocent questioning eyes it was wonderful i was undone one must give his life if need be to defend the little things after they had looked at him just once like that  when i rose at last after petting them to my hearts content they staggered up to their feet and came out of their house their mother had told them to stay but here was another big kind animal evidently whom they might safely trust take the gifts the gods provide thee was the thought in their little heads and the salty taste in their tongues ends when they licked my hand was the nicest thing they had ever known as i turned away they ran after me with a plaintive little cry to bring me back when i stopped they came close nestling against me one on either side and lifted their heads to be petted and rubbed again  standing so all eagerness and wonder they were a perfect study in first impressions of the world their ears had already caught the deer trick of twitching nervously and making trumpets at every sound a leaf rustled a twig broke the brooks song swelled as a floating stick jammed in the current and instantly the fawns were all alert eyes ears noses questioned the phenomenon then they would raise their eyes slowly to mine this is a wonderful world this big wood is full of music we know so little please tell us all about itthat is what the beautiful eyes were saying as they lifted up to mine full of innocence and delight at the joy of living then the hands that rested fondly one on either soft neck moved down from their ears with a caressing sweep and brought up under their moist muzzles instantly the wood and its music vanished the questions ran away out of their eyes their eager tongues were out and all the unknown sounds were forgotten in the new sensation of lapping a mans palm which had a wonderful taste hidden somewhere under its friendly roughnesses they were still licking my hands nestling close against me when a twig snapped faintly far behind us  now twig snapping is the great index to all that passes in the wilderness curiously enough no two animals can break even a twig under their feet and give the same warning the crack under a bears foot except when he is stalking his game is heavy and heedless the hoof of a moose crushes a twig and chokes the sound of it before it can tell its message fairly when a twig speaks under a deer in his passage through the woods the sound is sharp dainty alert it suggests the plop of a raindrop into the lake and the sound behind us now could not be mistaken the mother of my little innocents was coming  i hated to frighten her and through her to destroy their new confidence so i hurried back to the den the little ones running close by my side ere i was halfway a twig snapped sharply again there was a swift rustle in the underbrush and a doe sprang out with a low bleat as she saw the home log  at sight of me she stopped short trembling violently her ears pointing forward like two accusing fingers an awful fear in her soft eyes as she saw her little ones with her archenemy between them his hands resting on their innocent necks her body swayed away every muscle tense for the jump but her feet seemed rooted to the spot slowly she swayed back to her balance her eyes holding mine then away again as the danger scent poured into her nose but still the feet stayed she could not move could not believe then as i waited quietly and tried to make my eyes say all sorts of friendly things the harsh throaty kaaah kaaah the danger cry of the deer burst like a trumpet blast through the woods and she leaped back to cover  at the sound the little ones jumped as if stung and plunged into the brush in the opposite direction but the strange place frightened them the hoarse cry that went crashing through the startled woods filled them with nameless dread in a moment they were back again nestling close against me growing quiet as the hands stroked their sides without tremor or hurry  around us out of sight ran the fearhaunted mother calling calling now showing her head with the terror deep in her eyes now dashing away with her white flag up to show her little ones the way they must take but the fawns gave no heed after the first alarm they felt the change their ears were twitching nervously and their eyes which had not yet grown quick enough to measure distances and find their mother in her hiding were full of strange terror as they questioned mine still under the alarm they felt the kindness which the poor mother dogdriven and waylaid by guns had never known therefore they stayed with a deep wisdom beyond all her cunning where they knew they were safe  i led them slowly back to their hiding place gave them a last lick at my hands and pushed them gently under the hemlock curtain when they tried to come out i pushed them back again stay there and mind your mother stay there and follow your mother i kept whispering and to this day i have a half belief that they understood not the word but the feeling behind it for they grew quiet after a time and looked out with wideopen wondering eyes then i dodged out of sight jumped the fallen log to throw them off the scent should they come out crossed the brook and glided out of sight into the underbrush once safely out of hearing i headed straight for the open a few yards away where the blasted stems of the burned hillside showed faintly through the green of the big woods and climbed and looked and changed my position till at last i could see the fallen tree under whose roots my little innocents were hiding  the hoarse danger cry had ceased the woods were all still again a movement in the underbrush and i saw the doe glide out beyond the brook and stand looking listening she bleated softly the hemlock curtain was thrust aside and the little ones came out at sight of them she leaped forward a great gladness showing eloquently in every line of her graceful body rushed up to them dropped her head and ran her keen nose over them ears to tail and down their sides and back again to be sure that they were her own little ones and were not harmed all the while the fawns nestled close to her as they had done a moment before to me and lifted their heads to touch her sides with their noses and ask in their own dumb way what it was all about and why she had run away  illustration the white flag showing like a beacon light as she jumped away  then as the smell of the man came to her from the tainted underbrush the absolute necessity of teaching them their neglected second lesson before another danger should find them swept over her in a flood she sprang aside with a great bound and the hoarse kaaah kaaah crashed through the woods again her tail was straight up the white flag showing like a beacon light as she jumped away behind her the fawns stood startled a moment trembling with a new wonder then their flags went up too and they wabbled away on slender legs through the tangles and over the rough places of the wood bravely following their leader and i watching from my hiding with a vague regret that they could never again be mine not even for a moment saw only the crinkling lines of underbrush and here and there the flash of a little white flag so they went up the hill and out of sight  first lie still and second follow the white flag when i saw them again it needed no danger cry of the mother to remind them of these two things that every fawn must know who would live to grow up in the big woods  illustration     a cry in the night  illustration   this is the rest of the story just as i saw it of the little fawns that i found under the mossy log by the brook there were two of them you remember and though they looked alike at first glance i soon found out that there is just as much difference in fawns as there is in folks eyes faces dispositions charactersin all things they were as unlike as the virgins of the parable one of them was wise and the other was very foolish the one was a follower a learner he never forgot his second lesson to follow the white flag the other followed from the first only his own willful head and feet and discovered too late that obedience is life until the bear found him i have no doubt he was thinking in his own dumb foolish way that obedience is only for the weak and ignorant and that government is only an unfair advantage which all the wilderness mothers take to keep little wild things from doing as they please  the wise old mother took them both away when she knew i had found them and hid them in a deeper solitude of the big woods nearer the lake where she could the sooner reach them from her feeding grounds for days after the wonderful discovery i used to go in the early morning or the late afternoon while mother deer are away feeding along the watercourses and search the dingle from one end to the other hoping to find the little ones again and win their confidence but they were not there and i took to watching instead a family of mink that lived in a den under a root and a big owl that always slept in the same hemlock then one day when a flock of partridges led me out of the wild berry bushes into a cool green island of the burned lands i ran plump upon the deer and her fawns lying all together under a fallen treetop dozing away the heat of the day  they did not see me but were only scared into action as a branch upon which i stood looking for my partridges gave way beneath my feet and let me down with a great crash under the fallen tree there looking out i could see them perfectly while kookooskoos himself could hardly have seen me at the first crack they all jumped like jackinabox when you touch his spring the mother put up her white flagwhich is the snowy underside of her useful tail and shows like a beacon by day or nightand bounded away with a hoarse kaaaah of warning one of the little ones followed her on the instant jumping squarely in his mothers tracks his own little white flag flying to guide any that might come after him but the second fawn ran off at a tangent and stopped in a moment to stare and whistle and stamp his tiny foot in an odd mixture of curiosity and defiance the mother had to circle back twice before he followed her at last unwillingly as she stole back each time her tail was down and wiggling nervouslywhich is the sure sign when you see it that some scent of you is floating off through the woods and telling its warning into the deers keen nostrils but when she jumped away the white flag was straight up flashing in the very face of her foolish fawn telling him as plain as any language what sign he must follow if he would escape danger and avoid breaking his legs in the tangled underbrush  i did not understand till long afterwards when i had watched the fawns many times how important is this latter suggestion one who follows a frightened deer and sees or hears him go bounding off at breakneck pace over loose rocks and broken trees and tangled underbrush rising swift on one side of a windfall without knowing what lies on the other side till he is already falling driving like an arrow over ground where you must follow like a snail lest you wrench a foot or break an anklefinds himself asking with unanswered wonder how any deer can live half a season in the wilderness without breaking all his legs and when you run upon a deer at night and hear him go smashing off in the darkness at the same reckless speed over a tangled blowdown perhaps through which you can barely force your way by daylight then you realize suddenly that the most wonderful part of a deers education shows itself not in keen eyes or trumpet ears or in his finely trained nose more sensitive a hundred times than any barometer but in his forgotten feet which seem to have eyes and nerves and brains packed into their hard shells instead of the senseless matter you see there  watch the doe yonder as she bounds away wigwagging her heedless little one to follow she is thinking only of him and now you see her feet free to take care of themselves as she rises over the big windfall they hang from the ankle joints limp as a glove out of which the hand has been drawn yet seeming to wait and watch one hoof touches a twig like lightning it spreads and drops after running for the smallest fraction of a second along the obstacle to know whether to relax or stiffen or rise or fall to meet it just before she strikes the ground on the down plunge see the wonderful hind hoofs sweep themselves forward surveying the ground by touch and bracing themselves in a fraction of time so small that the eye cannot follow for the shock of what lies beneath them whether rock or rotten wood or yielding moss the fore feet have followed the quick eyes above and shoot straight and sure to their landing but the hind hoofs must find the spot for themselves as they come down and almost ere they find it brace themselves again for the push of the mighty muscles above  once only i found where a fawn with untrained feet had broken its leg and once i heard of a wounded buck driven to death by dogs that had fallen in the same way never to rise again those were rare cases the marvel is that it does not happen to every deer that fear drives through the wilderness  and that is another reason why the fawns must learn to obey a wiser head than their own till their little feet are educated the mother must choose the way for them and a wise fawn will jump squarely in her tracks that explains also why deer even after they are full grown will often walk in single file a halfdozen of them sometimes following a wise leader stepping in his tracks and leaving but a single trail it is partly perhaps to fool their old enemy the wolf and their new enemy the man by hiding the weaklings trail in the stride and hoof mark of a big buck but it shows also the old habit and the training which begins when the fawns first learn to follow the flag  after that second discovery i used to go in the afternoon to a point on the lake nearest the fawns hiding place and wait in my canoe for the mother to come out and show me where she had left her little ones as they grew and the drain upon her increased from their feeding she seemed always half starved waiting in my canoe i would hear the crackle of brush as she trotted straight down to the lake almost heedlessly and see her plunge through the fringe of bushes that bordered the water with scarcely a look or a sniff to be sure the coast was clear she would jump for the lily pads sometimes the canoe was in plain sight but she gave no heed as she tore up the juicy buds and stems and swallowed them with the appetite of a famished wolf then i would paddle away and taking my direction from her trail as she came hunt diligently for the fawns until i found them  this last happened only two or three times the little ones were already wild they had forgotten all about our first meeting and when i showed myself or cracked a twig too near them they would promptly bolt into the brush one always ran straight away his white flag flying to show that he remembered his lesson the other went off zigzag stopping at every angle of his run to look back and question me with his eyes and ears  there was only one way in which such disobedience could end i saw it plainly enough one afternoon when had i been one of the fierce prowlers of the wilderness the little fellows history would have stopped short under the paw of upweekis the shadowy lynx of the burned lands it was late afternoon when i came over a ridge following a deer path on my way to the lake and looked down into a long narrow valley filled with berry bushes and with a few fireblasted trees standing here and there to point out the perfect loneliness and desolation of the place  just below me a deer was feeding hungrily only her hind quarters showing out of the underbrush i watched her awhile then dropped on all fours and began to creep towards her to see how near i could get and what new trait i might discover but at the first motion i had stood at first like an old stump on the ridge a fawn that had evidently been watching me all the time from his hiding sprang into sight with a sharp whistle of warning the doe threw up her head looking straight at me as if she had understood more from the signal than i had thought possible there was not an instants hesitation or searching her eyes went direct to me as if the fawns cry had said behind you mother in the path by the second gray rock then she jumped away shooting up the opposite hill over roots and rocks as if thrown by steel springs blowing hoarsely at every jump and followed in splendid style by her watchful little one  at the first snort of danger there was a rush in the underbrush near where she had stood and a second fawn sprang into sight i knew him instantlythe heedless oneand knew also that he had neglected too long the matter of following the flag he was confused frightened chuckleheaded now he came darting up the deer path in the wrong direction straight towards me to within two jumps before he noticed the man kneeling in the path before him and watching him quietly  at the startling discovery he stopped short seeming to shrink smaller and smaller before my eyes then he edged sidewise to a great stump hid himself among the roots and stood stockstilla beautiful picture of innocence and curiosity framed in the rough brown roots of the spruce stump it was his first teaching to hide and be still just as he needed it most he had forgotten absolutely the second lesson  we watched each other full five minutes without moving an eyelash then his first lesson ebbed away he sidled out into the path again came towards me two dainty halting steps and stamped prettily with his left fore foot he was a young buck and had that trick of stamping without any instruction it is an old old ruse to make you move to startle you by the sound and threatening motion into showing who you are and what are your intentions  but still the man did not move the fawn grew frightened at his own boldness and ran away down the path far up the opposite hill i heard the mother calling him but he heeded not he wanted to find out things for himself there he was in the path again watching me i took out my handkerchief and waved it gently at which great marvel he trotted back stopping anon to look and stamp his little foot to show me that he was not afraid  brave little chap i like you i thought my heart going out to him as he stood there with his soft eyes and beautiful face stamping his little foot but what my thoughts went on had happened to you ere now had a bear or lucivee lifted his head over the ridge next month alas the law will be off then there will be hunters in these woods some of whom leave their hearts with their wives and children behind them you cant trust them believe me little chap your mother is right you cant trust them  the night was coming swiftly the mothers call growing ever more anxious more insistent swept over the darkening hillside perhaps i thought with sudden twinges and alarms of conscience perhaps i set you all wrong little chap in giving you the taste of salt that day and teaching you to trust things that meet you in the wilderness that is generally the way when we meddle with mother nature who has her own good reasons for doing things as she does but no there were two of you under the old log that day and the otherhes up there with his mother now where you ought to behe knows that old laws are safer than new thoughts especially new thoughts in the heads of foolish youngsters you are all wrong little chap for all your pretty curiosity and the stamp of your little foot that quite wins my heart perhaps i am to blame after all anyway ill teach you better now  at the thought i picked up a large stone and sent it crashing jumping tearing down the hillside straight at him all his bravado vanished like a wink up went his flag and away he went over the logs and rocks of the great hillside where presently i heard his mother running in a great circle till she found him with her nose thanks to the wood wires and the winds message and led him away out of danger  one who lives for a few weeks in the wilderness with eyes and ears open soon finds that instead of the lawlessness and blind chance which seem to hold sway there he lives in the midst of law and orderan order of things much older than that to which he is accustomed with which it is not well to interfere i was uneasy following the little deer path through the twilight stillness and my uneasiness was not decreased when i found on a log within fifty yards of the spot where the fawn first appeared the signs of a big lucivee with plenty of fawns hair and finecracked bones to tell me what he had eaten for his midnight dinner                                       down at the lower end of the same deer path where it stopped at the lake to let the wild things drink was a little brook outside the mouth of this brook among the rocks was a deep pool and in the pool lived some big trout i was there one night some two weeks later trying to catch some of the big trout for my next breakfast  those were wise fish it was of no use to angle for them by day any more they knew all the flies in my book could tell the new jenny lind from the old bumble bee before it struck the water and seemed to know perfectly both by instinct and experience that they were all frauds which might as well be called jenny bee and bumble lind for any sweet reasonableness that was in them besides all this the water was warm the trout were logy and would not rise  by night however the case was different a few of the trout would leave the pool and prowl along the shores in shallow water to see what tidbits the darkness might bring in the shape of night bugs and careless piping frogs and sleepy minnows then if you built a fire on the beach and cast a whitewinged fly across the path of the firelight you would sometimes get a big one  it was fascinating sport always whether the trout were rising or not one had to fish with his ears and keep most of his wits in his hand ready to strike quick and hard when the moment came after an hour of casting half the time you would not see your fish at all but only hear the savage plunge as he swirled down with your fly at other times as you struck sharply at the plunge your fly would come back to you or tangle itself up in unseen snags and far out where the verge of the firelight rippled away into darkness you would see a sharp wavewedge shooting away which told you that your trout was only a musquash swimming quietly by he had seen you and your fire and slapped his tail down hard on the water to make you jump that is a way musquash has in the night so that he can make up his mind what queer thing you are and what you are doing  all the while as you fish the great dark woods stand close about you silent listening the air is full of scents and odors that steal abroad only by night while the air is dewladen strange cries calls squeaks rustlings run along the hillside or float in from the water or drop down from the air overhead to make you guess and wonder what wood folk are abroad at such unseemly hours and what they are about so that it is good to fish by night as well as by day and go home with heart and head full even though your creel be empty  i was standing very still by my fire waiting for a big trout that had risen and missed my fly to regain his confidence when i heard cautious rustlings in the brush behind me i turned instantly and there were two great glowing spots the eyes of a deer flashing out of the dark woods a swift rustle and two more coals glow lower down flashing and scintillating with strange colors and then two more and i know that the doe and her fawns are there stopped and fascinated on their way to drink by the great wonder of the light and by the witchery of the dancing shadows that rush up at timid wild things as if to frighten them but only jump over them and back again as if inviting them to join the silent play  i knelt down quietly beside my fire slipping on a great roll of birch bark which blazed up brightly filling the woods with light there under a spruce where a dark shadow had been a moment agone stood the mother her eyes all ablaze with the wonder of the light now staring steadfastly into the fire now starting nervously with low questioning snorts as a troop of shadows ran up to play hopscotch with the little ones which stood close behind her one on either side  a moment only it lasted then one fawni knew the heedless one even in the firelight by his face and by his brightdappled josephs coatcame straight towards me stopping to stare with flashing eyes when the fire jumped up and then to stamp his little foot at the shadows to show them that he was not afraid  illustration her eyes all ablaze with the wonder of the light  the mother called him anxiously but still he came on stamping prettily she grew uneasy trotting back and forth in a half circle warning calling pleading then as he came between her and the fire and his little shadow stretched away up the hill where she was showing how far away he was from her and how near the light she broke away from its fascination with an immense effort kaaah kaaah the hoarse cry rang through the startled woods like a pistol shot and she bounded away her white flag shining like a wave crest in the night to guide her little ones  the second fawn followed her instantly but the heedless one barely swung his head to see where she was going and then came on towards the light staring and stamping in foolish wonder  i watched him a little while fascinated myself by his beauty his dainty motions his soft ears with a bright oval of light about them his wonderful eyes glowing like burning rainbows kindled by the firelight far behind him the mothers cry ran back and forth along the hillside suddenly it changed a danger note leaped into it and again i heard the call to follow and the crash of brush as she leaped away i remembered the lynx and the sad little history written on the log above as the quickest way of saving the foolish youngster i kicked my fire to pieces and walked out towards him then as the wonder vanished in darkness and the scent of the man poured up to him on the lakes breath the little fellow bounded awayalas straight up the deer path at right angles to the course his mother had taken a moment before  five minutes later i heard the mother calling a strange note in the direction he had taken and went up the deer path very quietly to investigate at the top of the ridge where the path dropped away into a dark narrow valley with dense underbrush on either side i heard the fawn answering her below me among the big trees and knew instantly that something had happened he called continuously a plaintive cry of distress in the black darkness of the spruces the mother ran around him in a great circle calling him to come while he lay helpless in the same spot telling her he could not and that she must come to him so the cries went back and forth in the listening nighthoowuh come here blaaa blrrt i cant come here kaaah kaaah danger followand then the crash of brush as she rushed away followed by the second fawn whom she must save though she abandoned the heedless one to prowlers of the night  it was clear enough what had happened the cries of the wilderness all have their meaning if one but knows how to interpret them running through the dark woods his untrained feet had missed their landing and he lay now under some rough windfall with a broken leg to remind him of the lesson he had neglected so long  i was stealing along towards him feeling my way among the trees in the darkness stopping every moment to listen to his cry to guide me when a heavy rustle came creeping down the hill and passed close before me something perhaps in the sounda heavy though almost noiseless onward push which only one creature in the woods can possibly makesomething perhaps in a faint new odor in the moist air told me instantly that keener ears than mine had heard the cry that mooween the bear had left his blueberry patch and was stalking the heedless fawn whom he knew by the hearing of his ears to have become separated from his watchful mother in the darkness  i regained the path silentlythough mooween heeds nothing when his game is afootand ran back to the canoe for my rifle ordinarily a bear is timid as a rabbit but i had never met one so late at night before and knew not how he would act should i take his game away besides there is everything in the feeling with which one approaches an animal if one comes timidly doubtfully the animal knows it and if one comes swift silent resolute with his power gripped tight and the hammer back and a forefinger resting lightly on the trigger guard the animal knows it too you may depend anyway they always act as if they knew and you may safely follow the rule that whatever your feeling is whether fear or doubt or confidence the large and dangerous animals will sense it instantly and adopt the opposite feeling for their rule of action that is the way i have always found it in the wilderness i met a bear once on a narrow pathbut i must tell about that elsewhere  the cries had ceased the woods were all dark and silent when i came back i went as swiftly as possiblewithout heed or caution for whatever crackling i made the bear would attribute to the desperate motherto the spot where i had turned back thence i went on cautiously taking my bearings from one great tree on the ridge that lifted its bulk against the sky slower and slower till just this side a great windfall a twig cracked sharply under my foot it was answered instantly by a grunt and a jump beyond the windfalland then the crashing rush of a bear up the hill carrying something that caught and swished loudly on the bushes as it passed till the sounds vanished in a faint rustle far away and the woods were still again  all night long from my tent over beyond an arm of the big lake i heard the mother calling at intervals she seemed to be running back and forth along the ridge above where the tragedy had occurred her nose told her of the bear and the man but what awful thing they were doing with her little one she knew not fear and questioning were in the calls that floated down the ridge and across the water to my little tent  at daylight i went back to the spot i found without trouble where the fawn had fallen the moss told mutely of his struggle and a stain or two showed where mooween grabbed him the rest was a plain trail of crushed moss and bent grass and stained leaves and a tuft of soft hair here and there on the jagged ends of knots in the old windfalls so the trail hurried up the hill into a wild rough country where it was of no use to follow  as i climbed the last ridge on my way back to the lake i heard rustlings in the underbrush and then the unmistakable crack of a twig under a deers foot the mother had winded me she was now following and circling down wind to find out whether her lost fawn were with me as yet she knew not what had happened the bear had frightened her into extra care of the one fawn of whom she was sure the other had simply vanished into the silence and mystery of the great woods  where the path turned downward in sight of the lake i saw her for a moment plainly standing half hid in the underbrush looking intently at my old canoe she saw me at the same instant and bounded away quartering up the hill in my direction near a thicket of evergreen that i had just passed she sounded her hoarse kaah kaah and threw up her flag there was a rush within the thicket a sharp kaah answered hers then the second fawn burst out of the cover where she had hidden him and darted along the ridge after her jumping like a big red fox from rock to rock rising like a hawk over the windfalls hitting her tracks wherever he could and keeping his little nose hard down to his one needful lesson of following the white flag  illustration     ismaques the fishhawk  illustration   whit whit chwee whit whit whit chweeeeee over my head went the shrill whistling the hunting cry of ismaques looking up from my fishing i could see the broad wings sweeping over me and catch the bright gleam of his eye as he looked down into my canoe or behind me at the cold place among the rocks to see if i were catching anything then as he noted the pile of fisha blanket of silver on the black rocks where i was stowing away chub for bear baithe would drop lower in amazement to see how i did it when the trout were not rising and his keen glance saw no gleam of red and gold in my canoe he would circle off with a cheery kweee the goodluck call of a brother fisherman for there is no envy nor malice nor any uncharitableness in ismaques he lives in harmony with the world and seems glad when you land a big one even though he be hungry himself and the clamor from his nest where his little ones are crying be too keen for his hearts content  what is there in going afishing i wonder that seems to change even the leopards spots and that puts a new heart into the man who hies him away to the brook when buds are swelling there is keeonekh the otter before he turned fisherman he was probably fierce cruel bloodthirsty with a vile smell about him like all the other weasels now he lives at peace with all the world and is clean gentle playful as a kitten and faithful as a dog when you make a pet of him and there is ismaques the fishhawk before he turned fisherman he was probably hated like every other hawk for his fierceness and his bandit ways the shadow of his wings was the signal for hiding to all the timid ones jay and crow cried thief thief and kingbird sounded his war cry and rushed out to battle now the little birds build their nests among the sticks of his great house and the shadow of his wings is a sure protection for owl and hawk and wildcat have learned long since the wisdom of keeping well away from ismaques dwelling  not only the birds but men also feel the change in ismaques disposition i hardly know a hunter who will not go out of his way for a shot at a hawk but they send a hearty goodluck after this winged fisherman of the same fierce family even though they see him rising heavily out of the very pool where the big trout live and where they expect to cast their flies at sundown along the southern new england shores his comingregular as the calendar itselfis hailed with delight by the fishermen one state at least where he is most abundant protects him by law and even our puritan forefathers who seem to have neither made nor obeyed any game laws looked upon him with a kindly eye and made him an exception to the general license for killing to their credit be it known they once publikly reeprimanded one master eliphalet bodman a son of belial evidently for violently with powder and shot doing away with one fishhawk and wickedly destroying the nest and eggs of another  whether this last were also done violently with powder and shot by blowing the nest to pieces with an old gun or in simple boyfashion by shinning up the tree the quaint old town record does not tell but all this goes to show that our ancestors of the coast were kindly people at heart that they looked upon this brave simple fisherman who built his nest by their doors much as the german village people look upon the stork that builds upon their chimneys and regarded his coming as an omen of good luck and plenty to the fisher folk  far back in the wilderness where ismaques builds his nest and goes afishing just as his ancestors did a thousand years ago one finds the same honest bird unspoiled alike by plenty or poverty that excited our boyish imagination and won the friendly regard of our ancestors of the coast opposite my camp on the lake where i tarried long one summer charmed by the beauty of the place and the good fishing a pair of fishhawks had built their nest in the top of a great spruce on the mountain side it was this pair of birds that came daily to circle over my canoe or over the rocks where i fished for chub to see how i fared and to send back a cheery chwee chip chweeee good luck and good fishing as they wheeled away it would take a good deal of argument now to convince me that they did not at last recognize me as a fellowfisherman and were not honestly interested in my methods and success  at first i went to the nest not so much to study the fishhawks as to catch fleeting glimpses of a shy wild life of the woods which is hidden from most eyes the fishing was good and both birds were expert fishermen while the young were growing there was always an abundance in the big nest on the spruce top the overflow of this abundance in the shape of heads bones and unwanted remnants was cast over the sides of the nest and furnished savory pickings for a score of hungry prowlers mink came over from frog hunting in the brook drawn by the good smell in the air skunks lumbered down from the hill with a curious hollow bumping sound to announce their coming weasels and one grizzly old pine marten too slow or rheumatic for successful tree hunting glided out of the underbrush and helped themselves without asking leave wildcats quarreled like fiends over the pickings more than once i heard them there screeching in the night and one late afternoon as i lingered in my hiding among the rocks while the shadows deepened a big lucivee stole out of the bushes as if ashamed of himself and took to nosing daintily among the fish bones  it was his first appearance evidently he did not know that the feast was free but thought all the while that he was stealing somebodys catch one could see it all in his attitudes his starts and listenings his low growlings to himself he was bigger than anybody else there and had no cause to be afraid but there is a tremendous respect among all animals for the chase law and the rights of others and the big cat felt it he was hungry for fish but big as he was his every movement showed that he was ready to take to his heels before the first little creature that should rise up and screech in his face this is mine later when he grew accustomed to things and the fishhawks generosity in providing a feast for all who might come in from the wilderness byways and hedges he would come in boldly enough and claim his own but now moving stealthily about halting and listening timidly he furnished a study in animal rights that repaid in itself all the long hours of watching  but the hawks themselves were more interesting than their unbidden guests ismaques honest fellow that he is mates for life and comes back to the same nest year after year the only exception to this rule that i know is in the case of a fishhawk whom i knew well as a boy and who lost his mate one summer by an accident the accident came from a gun in the hands of an unthinking sportsman the grief of ismaques was evident even to the unthinking one could hear it in the lonely questioning cry that he sent out over the still summer woods and see it in the sweep of his wings as he went far afield to other ponds not to fish for ismaques never fishes on his neighbors preserves but to search for his lost mate for weeks he lingered in the old haunts calling and searching everywhere but at last the loneliness and the memories were too much for him he left the place long before the time of migration had come and the next spring a strange couple came to the spot repaired the old nest and went fishing in the pond ordinarily the birds respect each others fishing grounds and especially the old nests but this pair came and took possession without hesitation as if they had some understanding with the former owner who never came back again  the old spruce on the mountain side had been occupied many years by my fishing friends as is usually the case it had given up its life to its bird masters the oil from their frequent feastings had soaked into the bark following down and down checking the saps rising till at last it grew discouraged and ceased to climb then the tree died and gave up its branches one by one to repair the nest above the jagged broken ends showed everywhere how they had been broken off to supply the hawks necessities  there is a curious bit of building lore suggested by these broken branches that one may learn for himself any springtime by watching the birds at their nest building large sticks are required for a foundation the ground is strewed with such but ismaques never comes down to the ground if he can avoid it even when he drops an unusually heavy fish in his flight above the trees he looks after it regretfully but never follows he may be hungry but he will not set his huge hooked talons on the earth he cannot walk and loses all his power there so he goes off and fishes patiently hours long to replace his lost catch  when he needs sticks for his nest he searches out a tree and breaks off the dead branches by his weight if the stick be stubborn he rises far above it and drops like a cannon ball gripping it in his claws and snapping it short off at the same instant by the force of his blow twice i have been guided to where ismaques and his mate were collecting material by reports like pistol shots ringing through the wood as the great birds fell upon the dead branches and snapped them off once when he came down too hard i saw him fall almost to the ground flapping lustily before he found his wings and sailed away with his fourfoot stick triumphantly  there is another curious bit of bird lore that i discovered here in the autumn when much later than usual i came back through the lake ismaques when he goes away for the long winter at the south does not leave his house to the mercy of the winter storms until he has first repaired it large fresh sticks are wedged in firmly across the top of the nest doubtful ones are pulled out and carefully replaced and the whole structure made shipshape for stormy weather this careful repair together with the fact that the nest is always well soaked in oil which preserves it from the rain saves a deal of trouble for ismaques he builds for life and knows when he goes away in the fall that barring untoward accidents his house will be waiting for him with the quiet welcome of old associations when he comes back in the spring whether this is a habit of all ospreys or only of the two on big squatuk lakewho were very wise birds in other waysi am unable to say  what becomes of the young birds is also to me a mystery the home ties are very strong and the little ones stay with the parents much longer than most other birds do but when the spring comes you will see only the old birds at the home nest the young come back to the same general neighborhood i think but where the lake is small they never build nor trespass on the same waters as with the kingfishers and sheldrakes each pair of birds seem to have their own pond or portion but by what old law of the waters they find and stake their claim is yet to be discovered  there were two little ones in the nest when i first found it and i used to watch them in the intervals when nothing was stirring in the underbrush near my hiding place they were happy whistling little fellows well fed and contented with the world at times they would stand for hours on the edge of the nest looking down over the slanting treetops to the lake finding the great rustling green world and the passing birds and the glinting of light on the sparkling water and the hazy blue of the distant mountains marvelously interesting if one could judge from their attitude and their pipings then a pair of broad wings would sweep into sight and they would stretch their wings wide and break into eager whistlingspip pip chwee chip chweeeeee did you get him is he a big one mother and they would stand tiptoeing gingerly about the edge of the great nest stretching their necks eagerly for a first glimpse of the catch  at times only one of the old birds would go afishing while the other watched the nest but when luck was poor both birds would seek the lake at such times the mother bird larger and stronger than the male would fish along the shore within sight and hearing of her little ones the male meanwhile would go sweeping down the lake to the trout pools at the outlet where the big chub lived in search of better fishing grounds if the wind were strong you would see a curious bit of sea lore as he came back with his fish he would never fly straight against the wind but tack back and forth as if he had learned the trick from watching the sailor fishermen of the coast beating back into harbor and watching him through your glass you would see that he always carried his fish endwise and head first so as to present the least possible resistance to the breeze  while the young were being fed you were certain to gain new respect for ismaques by seeing how well he brought up his little ones if the fish were large it was torn into shreds and given piecemeal to the young each of whom waited for his turn with exemplary patience there was no crowding or pushing for the first and biggest bite such as you see in a nest of robins if the fish were small it was given entire to one of the young who worried it down as best he could while the mother bird swept back to the lake for another the second nestling stood on the edge of the nest meanwhile whistling good luck and waiting his turn without a thought apparently of seizing a share from his mate beside him                                       just under the hawks a pair of jays had built their nest among the sticks of ismaques dwelling and raised their young on the abundant crumbs which fell from the rich mans table it was curious and intensely interesting to watch the change which seemed to be going on in the jays disposition by reason of the unusual friendship deedeeaskh the jay has not a friend among the wood folk they all know he is a thief and a meddler and hunt him away without mercy if they find him near their nests but the great fishhawks welcomed him trusted him and he responded nobly to the unusual confidence he never tried to steal from the young not even when the mother bird was away but contented himself with picking up the stray bits that they had left and he more than repaid ismaques by the sharp watch which he kept over the nest and indeed over all the mountain side nothing passes in the woods without the jays knowledge and here he seemed for all the world like a watchful terrier knowing that he had only to bark to bring a power of wing and claw sufficient to repel any danger when prowlers came down from the mountain to feast on the heads and bones scattered about the foot of the tree deedeeaskh dropped down among them and went dodging about whistling his insatiable curiosity so long as they took only what was their own he made no fuss about it but he was there to watch and he let them know sharply their mistake if they showed any desire to cast evil eyes at the nest above  illustration presently they began to swoop fiercely at some animal  once as my canoe was gliding along the shore i heard the jays unmistakable cry of danger the fishhawks were wheeling in great circles over the lake watching for the glint of fish near the surface when the cry came and they darted away for the nest pushing out into the lake i saw them sweeping above the treetops in swift circles uttering short sharp cries of anger presently they began to swoop fiercely at some animala fisher probablythat was climbing the tree below i stole up to see what it was but ere i reached the place they had driven the intruder away i heard one of the jays far off in the woods following the robber and screaming to let the fishhawks know just where he was the other jay sat close by her own little ones cowering under the shadow of the great dark wings above and presently deedeeaskh came back bubbling over with the excitement whistling to them in his own way that he had followed the rascal clear to his den and would keep a sharp watch over him in future  when a big hawk came near or when on dark afternoons a young owl took to hunting in the neighborhood the jays sounded the alarm and the fishhawks swept up from the lake on the instant whether deedeeaskh were more concerned for his own young than for the young fishhawks i have no means of knowing the fishermens actions at such times showed a curious mixture of fear and defiance the mother would sit on the nest while ismaques circled over it both birds uttering a shrill whistling challenge but they never attacked the feathered robbers as they had done with the fisher and so far as i could see there was no need kookooskoos the owl and hawahak the hawk might be very hungry but the sight of those great wings circling over the nest and the shrill cry of defiance in their ears sent them hurriedly away to other hunting grounds  there was only one enemy that ever seriously troubled the fishhawks and he did it in as decent a sort of way as was possible under the circumstances that was cheplahgan the eagle when he was hungry and had found nothing himself and his two eaglets far away in their nest on the mountain needed a bite of fish to vary their diet he would set his wings to the breeze and mount up till he could see both ospreys at their fishing there sailing in slow circles he would watch for hours till he saw ismaques catch a big fish when he would drop like a bolt and hold him up at the point of his talons like any other highwayman it was of no use trying to escape sometimes ismaques would attempt it but the great dark wings would whirl around him and strike down a sharp and unmistakable warning it always ended the same way ismaques being wise would drop his fish and the eagle would swoop down after it often seizing it ere it reached the water but he never injured the fishhawks and he never disturbed the nest so they got along well enough together cheplahgan had a bite of fish now and then in his own highhanded way and honest ismaques who never went long hungry made the best of a bad situation which shows that fishing has also taught him patience and a wise philosophy of living  the jays took no part in these struggles occasionally they cried out a sharp warning as cheplahgan came plunging down out of the blue over the head of ismaques but they seemed to know perfectly how the unequal contest must end and they always had a deal of jabber among themselves over it the meaning of which i could never make out  as for myself i am sure that deedeeaskh could never make up his mind what to think of me at first when i came he would cry out a danger note that brought the fishhawks circling over their nest looking down into the underbrush with wild yellow eyes to see what danger threatened but after i had hidden myself away a few times and made no motion to disturb either the nest or the hungry prowlers that came to feast on the fishhawks bounty deedeeaskh set me down as an idle harmless creature who would nevertheless bear watching he never got over his curiosity to know what brought me there sometimes when i thought him far away i would find him suddenly on a branch just over my head looking down at me intently when i went away he would follow me whistling to my canoe but he never called the fishhawks again unless some unusual action of mine aroused his suspicion and after one look they would circle away as if they knew they had nothing to fear they had seen me fishing so often that they thought they understood me undoubtedly  there was one curious habit of these birds that i had never noticed before occasionally when the weather threatened a change or when the birds and their little ones had fed full ismaques would mount up to an enormous altitude where he would sail about in slow circles his broad vans steady to the breeze as if he were an ordinary hen hawk enjoying himself and contemplating the world from an indifferent distance suddenly with one clear sharp whistle to announce his intention he would drop like a plummet for a thousand feet catch himself in midair and zigzag down to the nest in the spruce top whirling diving tumbling and crying aloud the while in wild ecstatic exclamationsjust as a woodcock comes whirling plunging twittering down from a height to his brown mate in the alders below then ismaques would mount up again and repeat his dizzy plunge while his larger mate stood quiet in the spruce top and the little fishhawks tiptoed about the edge of the nest pippipping their wonder and delight at their own papas dazzling performance  this is undoubtedly one of ismaques springtime habits by which he tries to win an admiring look from the keen yellow eyes of his mate but i noticed him using it more frequently as the little fishhawks wings spread to a wonderful length and he was trying with his mate by every gentle means to induce them to leave the nest and i have wonderedwithout being able at all to prove my theorywhether he were not trying in this remarkable way to make his little ones want to fly by showing them how wonderful a thing flying could be made to be  illustration     a school for little fishermen  illustration   there came a day when as i sat fishing among the rocks the cry of the mother osprey changed as she came sweeping up to my fishing groundschip chwee chip chip chweeeee that was the fishermans hail plainly enough but there was another note in it a lookhere cry of triumph and satisfaction before i could turn my head for a fish was nibbling there came other sounds behind itpip pip pip chweee pip chwee pip chweeee a curious medley a hail of goodluck cries and i knew without turning that two other fishermen had come to join the brotherhood  the mother birdone can tell her instantly by her greater size and darker breast markingsveered in as i turned to greet the newcomers and came directly over my head her two little ones flapping lustily behind her two days before when i went down to another lake on an excursion after bigger trout the young fishhawks were still standing on the nest turning a deaf ear to all the old birds assurances that the time had come to use their big wings the last glimpse i had of them through my glass showed me the mother bird in one tree the father in another each holding a fish which they were showing the young across a tantalizing short stretch of empty air telling the young in fishhawk language to come across and get it while the young birds on their part stretched wings and necks hungrily and tried to whistle the fish over to them as one would call a dog across the street  in the short interval that i was absent mother wiles and mother patience had done their good work the young were already flying well now they were out for their first lesson in fishing evidently and i stopped fishing myself letting my bait sink into the mudwhere an eel presently tangled my hooks into an old rootto see how it was done for fishing is not an instinct with ismaques but a simple matter of training as with young otters they know only from daily experience that fish and not grouse and rabbits are their legitimate food left to themselves especially if one should bring them up on flesh and then turn them loose they would go straight back to the old hawk habit of hunting the woods which is much easier to catch fish therefore they must be taught from the first day they leave the nest and it is a fascinating experience for any man to watch the way they go about it  the young ospreys flew heavily in short irregular circles scanning the water with their inexperienced eyes for their first strike over them wheeled the mother bird on broad even wings whistling directions to the young neophytes who would presently be initiated into the old sweet mysteries of going afishing fish were plenty enough but that means nothing to a fishhawk who must see his game reasonably near the surface before making his swoop there was a good jump on the lake and the sun shone brightly into it between the glare and the motion on the surface the young fishermen were having a hard time of it their eyes were not yet quick enough to tell them when to swoop at every gleam of silver in the depths below they would stop short and cry out pip there he is pip pip here goes like a boy with his first nibble but a short clear whistle from the mother stopped them ere they had begun to fall and they would flap up to her protesting eagerly that they could catch that fellow sure if she would only let them try  as they wheeled in over me on their way down the lake one of the youngsters caught the gleam of my pile of chub among the rocks pip chweee he whistled and down they came both of them like rockets they were hungry here at hand were fish galore and they had not noticed me at all sitting very still among the rocks pip pip pip hurrah they piped as they came down  but the mother bird who had noted me and my pile of fish the first thing as she rounded the point swept in swiftly with a curious halfangry halfanxious chiding that i had never heard from her beforechip chip chip chip chipgrowing sharper and shriller at each repetition till they heeded it and swerved aside as i looked up they were just over my head looking down at me now with eager wondering eyes then they were led aside in a wide circle and talked to with wise quiet whistlings before they were sent back to their fishing again  and now as they sweep round and round over the edge of a shoal one of the little fellows sees a fish and drops lower to follow it the mother sees it too notes that the fish is slanting up to the surface and wisely lets the young fisherman alone he is too near the water now the glare and the dancing waves bother him he loses his gleam of silver in the flash of a whitecap mother bird mounts higher and whistles him up where he can see better but there is the fish again and the youngster hungry and heedless sets his wings for a swoop chip chip wait hes going down cautions the mother but the little fellow too hungry to wait shoots down like an arrow he is a yard above the surface when a big whitecap jumps up at him and frightens him he hesitates swerves flaps lustily to save himself then under the whitecap is a gleam of silver again down he goes on the instantugh boolike a boy taking his first dive he is out of sight for a full moment while two waves race over him and i hold my breath waiting for him to come up then he bursts out sputtering and shaking himself and of course without his fish  as he rises heavily the mother who has been circling over him whistling advice and comfort stops short with a single blow of her pinions against the air she has seen the same fish watched him shoot away under the plunge of her little one and now sees him glancing up to the edge of the shoal where the minnows are playing she knows that the young pupils are growing discouraged and that the time has come to hearten them chip chipwatch ill show you she whistlescheeeep with a sharp upslide at the end which i soon grow to recognize as the signal to strike at the cry she sets her wings and shoots downward with strong even plunge strikes a wave squarely as it rises passes under it and is out on the other side gripping a big chub the little ones follow her whistling their delight and telling her that perhaps now they will go back to the nest and take a look at the fish before they go on with their fishing which means of course that they will eat it and go to sleep perfectly satisfied with the good fun of fishing and then lessons are over for the day  illustration gripping his fish and pippipping his exultation  the mother however has other thoughts in her wise head she knows that the little ones are not yet tired only hungry and that there is much to teach them before the chub stop shoaling and fishhawks must be off to the coast she knows also that they have thus far missed the two things she brought them out to learn to take a fish always as he comes up and to hit a wave always on the front side under the crest gripping her fish tightly she bends in her slow flight and paralyzes it by a single blow in the spine from her hooked beak then she drops it back into the whitecaps where jumping to the top of my rock i can see it occasionally struggling near the surface  cheeeep try it now she whistles  pip pip here goes cries the little one who failed before and down he drops souse going clear under in his impatient hunger forgetting precept and example and past experience  again the waves race over him but there is a satisfied note in the mothers whistle which tells me that she sees him and that he is doing well in a moment he is out again with a great rush and sputter gripping his fish and pippipping his exultation away he goes in low heavy flight to the nest the mother circles over him a moment to be sure he is not overloaded then she goes back with the other neophyte and ranges back and forth over the shoals edge  it is clear now to even my eyes that there is a vast difference in the characters of young fishhawks the first was eager headstrong impatient the second is calmer stronger more obedient he watches the mother he heeds her signals five minutes later he makes a clean beautiful swoop and comes up with his fish the mother whistles her praise as she drops beside him my eyes follow them as gossiping like two old cronies they wing their slow way over the dancing whitecaps and climb the slanting treetops to the nest  the days lessons are over now and i go back to my baitcatching with a new admiration for these winged members of the brotherhood perhaps there is also a bit of envy or regret in my meditation as i tie on a new hook to replace the one that an uneasy eel is trying to rid himself of down in the mud if i had only had some one to teach me like that i should certainly now be a better fisherman  next day when the mother came up the lake to the shoal with her two little ones there was a surprise awaiting them for half an hour i had been watching from the point to anticipate their coming there were some things that puzzled me and that puzzle me still in ismaques fishing if he caught his fish in his mouth after the methods of loon and otter i could understand it better but to catch a fishwhose dart is like lightningunder the water with his feet when after his plunge he can see neither his fish nor his feet must require some puzzling calculation and i had set a trap in my head to find out how it is done  when the fishermen hove into sight and their eager pipings came faintly up the lake ahead of them i paddled hastily out and turned loose a halfdozen chub in the shallow water i had kept them alive as long as possible in a big pail and they still had life enough to fin about near the surface when the fishermen arrived i was sitting among the rocks as usual and turned to acknowledge the mother birds chwee but my deeplaid scheme to find out their method accomplished nothing except perhaps to spoil the days lesson they saw my bait on the instant one of the youngsters dove headlong without poising went under missed his fish rose plunged again he got him that time and went away sputtering the second took his time came down on a long swift slant and got his fish without going under almost before the lesson began it was over the mother circled about for a few moments in a puzzled sort of way watching the young fishermen flapping up the slope to their nest something was wrong she had fished enough to know that success means something more than good luck and this morning success had come too easily she wheeled slowly over the shallows noting the fish there where they plainly did not belong and dropping to examine with suspicion one big chub that was floating belly up on the water then she went under with a rush where i could not see came out again with a fish for herself and followed her little ones to the nest  next day i set the trap again in the same way but the mother with her lesson well laid out before her remembered yesterdays unearned success and came over to investigate leaving her young ones circling along the farther shore there were the fish again in shallow water and theretoo easy altogetherwere two dead ones floating among the whitecaps she wheeled away in a sharp turn as if she had not seen anything whistled her pupils up to her and went on to other fishing grounds  presently above the next point i heard their pipings and the sharp upsliding cheeeep which was the mothers signal to swoop paddling up under the point in my canoe i found them all wheeling and diving over a shoal where i knew the fish were smaller and more nimble and where there were lily pads for a haven of refuge whither no hawk could follow them twenty times i saw them swoop only to miss while the mother circled above or beside them whistling advice and encouragement and when at last they struck their fish and bore away towards the mountain there was an exultation in their lusty wing beats and in the whistling cry they sent back to me which was not there the day before  the mother followed them at a distance veering in when near my shoal to take another look at the fish there three were floating now instead of two the otherswhat were left of themstruggled feebly at the surface chip chweee she whistled disdainfully plenty fish here but mighty poor fishing then she swooped passed under came out with a big chub and was gone leaving me only a blinding splash and a widening circle of laughing dancing tantalizing wavelets to tell me how she catches them     when you meet a bear   there are always two surprises when you meet a bear you have one and he has the other on your tramps and camps in the big woods you may be on the lookout for mooween you may be eager and even anxious to meet him but when you double the point or push into the blueberry patch and suddenly there he is blocking the path ahead looking intently into your eyes to fathom at a glance your intentions then i fancy the experience is like that of people who have the inquisitive habit of looking under their beds nightly for a burglar and at last find him there stowed away snugly just where they always expected him to be  mooween on his part is always looking for you when once he has learned that you have moved into his woods but not from any desire to see you he is like a lazy man looking for work and hoping devoutly that he may not find it a bear has very little curiosityless than any other of the wood folk he loves to be alone and so when he goes hunting for you to find out just where you are it is always with the creditable desire to leave you in as large a room as possible while he himself goes quietly away into deeper solitudes as this desire of his is much stronger than your mere idle curiosity to see something new you rarely see mooween even where he is most at home and that is but another bit of the poetic justice which you stumble upon everywhere in the big woods  it is more and more evident i think that nature adapts her gifts not simply to the necessities but more largely to the desires of her creatures the force and influence of that intense desiremore intense because usually each animal has but onewe have not yet learned to measure the owl has a silent wing not simply because he needs itfor his need is no greater than that of the hawk who has no silent wingbut more probably because of his wholehearted desire for silence as he glides through the silent twilight and so with the panthers foot and so with the deers eye and the wolfs nose whose one idea of bliss is a good smell and so with every other strongly marked gift which the wild things have won from nature chiefly by desiring it in the long years of their development  this theory may possibly account for some of mooweens peculiarities nature who measures her gifts according to the desires of her creatures remembers his love of peace and solitude and endows him accordingly he cares little to see you or anybody else therefore his eyes are weakhis weakest point in fact he desires ardently to avoid your society and all society but his own therefore his nose and ears are marvelously alert to discover your coming often when you think yourself quite alone in the woods mooween is there the wind has told your story to his nose the clatter of your heedless feet long ago reached his keen ears and he vanishes at your approach leaving you to your noise and inquisitiveness and the other things you like his gifts of concealment are so much greater than your powers of detection that he has absolutely no thought of ever seeing you his surprise therefore when you do meet unexpectedly is correspondingly greater than yours  what he will do under the unusual circumstances depends largely not upon himself but upon you with one exception his feelings are probably the reverse of your own if you are bold he is timid as a rabbit if you are panicstricken he knows exactly what to do if you are fearful he has no fear if you are inquisitive he is instantly shy and like all other wild creatures he has an almost uncanny way of understanding your thought it is as if in that intent penetrating gaze of his he saw your soul turned inside out for his inspection the only exception is when you meet him without fear or curiosity with the desire simply to attend to your own affairs as if he were a stranger and an equal that rare mental attitude he understands perfectlyfor is it not his ownand he goes his way quietly as if he had not seen you  for every chance meeting mooween seems to have a plan of action ready which he applies without a question or an instants hesitation make an unknown sound behind him as he plods along the shore and he hurls himself headlong into the cover of the bushes as if your voice had touched a button that released a coiled spring beneath him afterwards he may come back to find out what frightened him sit perfectly still and he rises on his hind legs for a look and a long sniff to find out who you are jump at him with a yell and a flourish the instant he appears and he will hurl chips and dirt back at you as he digs his toes into the hillside for a better grip and scrambles away whimpering like a scared puppy  once in a way as you steal through the autumn woods or hurry over the trail you will hear sudden loud rustlings and shakings on the hardwood ridge above you as if a small cyclone were perched there for a while amusing itself among the leaves before blowing on then if you steal up toward the sound you will find mooween standing on a big limb of a beech tree grasping the narrowing trunk with his powerful forearms tugging and pushing mightily to shake down the ripe beechnuts the rattle and dash of the falling fruit are such music to mooweens ears that he will not hear the rustle of your approach nor the twig that snaps under your careless foot  if you cry aloud now to your friends under the hilarious impression that you have mooween sure at last there is another surprise awaiting you and that suggests a bit of advice which is most pertinent dont stand under the bear when you cry out if he is a little fellow he will shoot up the tree faster than ever a jumping jack went up his stick and hide in a cluster of leaves as near the top as he can get but if he is a big bear he will tumble down on you before you know what has happened no slow climbing for him he just lets go and comes down by gravitation as uncle remus sayswho has some keen knowledge of animal ways under his storytelling humorbrer bar he scramble bout halfway down de bee tree en den he turn eveything loose en hit de groun kerbiff look like t wuz nuff ter jolt de life outn im  somehow it never does jolt the life out of him notwithstanding his great weight nor does it interfere in any way with his speed of action which is like lightning the instant he touches the ground like the coon who can fall from an incredible distance without hurting himself mooween comes down perfectly limp falling on himself like a great cushion but the moment he strikes all his muscles seem to contract at once and he bounds off like a rubber ball into the densest bit of cover at hand  twice have i seen him come down in this way the first time there were two cubs nearly fullgrown in a tree one went up at our shout the other came down with such startling suddenness that the man who stood ready with his rifle to shoot the bear jumped for his life to get out of the way and before he had blinked the astonishment out of his eyes mooween was gone leaving only a violent nodding of the ground spruces to tell what had become of him  all these plans of ready action in mooweens head for the rare occasions when he meets you unexpectedly are the result of careful training by his mother if you should ever have the good fortune to watch a mother bear and her cubs when they have no idea that you are near them you will note two characteristic things first when they are travelingand mooween is the most restless tramp in all the woodsyou will see that the cubs follow the mother closely and imitate her every action with ludicrous exactness sniffing where she sniffs jumping where she jumps rising on their hind legs with forearms hanging loosely and pointed noses thrust sharp up into the wind on the instant that she rises and then drawing silently away from the shore into the shelter of the friendly alders when some subtle warning tells the mothers nose that the coast ahead is not perfectly clear so they learn to sift the sounds and smells of the wilderness and to govern their actions accordingly and second when they are playing you will see that the mother watches the cubs every action as keenly as they watched hers an hour ago she will sit flat on her haunches her fore paws planted between her outstretched hind legs her great head on one side noting every detail of their boxing and wrestling and climbing as if she had showed them once how it ought to be done and were watching now to see how well they remembered their lessons and now and then one or the other of the cubs receives a sound cuffing for which i am unable to account except on the theory that he was doing something contrary to his plain instructions  it is only when mooween meets some new object or some circumstance entirely outside of his training that instinct and native wit are set to work and then you see for the first time some trace of hesitation on the part of this selfconfident prowler of the big woods once i startled him on the shore whither he had come to get the fore quarters of a deer that had been left there he jumped for cover at the first alarm without even turning his head just as he had seen his mother do a score of times when he was a cub then he stopped and for three or four seconds considered the danger in plain sighta thing i have never seen any other bear imitate he wavered for a moment more doubtful whether my canoe were swifter than he and more dangerous then satisfied that at least he had a good chance he jumped back grabbed the deer and dragged it away into the woods  another time i met him on a narrow path where he could not pass me and where he did not want to turn back for something ahead was calling him strongly that short meeting furnished me the best study in bear nature and bear instinct that i have ever been allowed to make and at this distance i have small desire to repeat the experience  it was on the little souwest mirimichi a very wild river in the heart of the wilderness just above my camp not half a mile away was a salmon pool that so far as i know had never been fished one bank of the river was an almost sheer cliff against which the current fretted and hissed in a strong deep rush to the rapids and a great silent pool far below there were salmon under the cliff plenty of them balancing themselves against the arrowy run of the current but so far as my flies were concerned they might as well have been in the yukon one could not fish from the opposite shorethere was no room for a back cast and the current was too deep and swift for wadingand on the shore where the salmon were there was no place to stand if i had had a couple of good indians i might have dropped down to the head of the swift water and fished while they held the canoe with poles braced on the bottom but i had no two good indians and the one i did have was unwilling to take the risk so we went hungry almost within sight and sound of the plunge of heavy fish fresh run from the sea  one day in following a porcupine to see where he was going i found a narrow path running for a few hundred yards along the side of the cliff just over where the salmon loved to lie and not more than thirty feet above the swift rush of water i went there with my rod and without attempting to cast dropped my fly into the current and paid out from my reel when the line straightened i raised the rods tip and set my fly dancing and skittering across the surface to an eddy behind a great rock in a flash i had raised and struck a twentyfive pound fish and in another flash he had gone straight downstream in the current where from my precarious seat i could not control him down he went leaping wildly high out of water in a glorious rush till all my line buzzed out of the reel down to the very knot at the bottom and the leader snapped as if it had been made of spiders web  i reeled in sadly debating with myself the unanswerable question of how i should ever have reached down thirty feet to gaff my salmon had i played him to a standstill then because human nature is weak i put on a stronger double leader and dropped another fly into the current i might not get my salmon but it was worth the price of fly and leader just to raise him from the deeps and see his terrific rush downstream jumping jumping as if the witch of endor were astride of his tail in lieu of her broomstick  a lively young grilse plunged headlong at the second fly and thanks to my strong leader i played him out in the current and led him listlessly all the jump and fight gone out of him to the foot of the cliff there was no apparent way to get down so taking my line in hand i began to lift him bodily up he came easily enough till his tail cleared the water then the wiggling jerky strain was too much the fly pulled out and he vanished with a final swirl and slap of his broad tail to tell me how big he was  just below me a bowlder lifted its head and shoulders out of the swirling current with the canoe line i might easily let myself down to that rock and make sure of my next fish getting back would be harder but salmon are worth some trouble so i left my rod and started back to camp for the stout rope that lay coiled in the bow of my canoe it was late afternoon and i was hurrying along the path giving chief heed to my feet in the ticklish walking with the cliff above and the river below when a loud hoowuff brought me up with a shock there at a turn in the path not ten yards ahead stood a huge bear calling unmistakable halt and blocking me in as completely as if the mountain had toppled over before me  there was no time to think the shock and scare were too great i just gasped hoowuff instinctively as the bear had shot it out of his deep lungs a moment before and stood stockstill as he was doing he was startled as well as i that was the only thing that i was sure about  i suppose that in each of our heads at first there was just one thought im in a fix how shall i get out and in his training or mine there was absolutely nothing to suggest an immediate answer he was anxious evidently to go on something a mate perhaps must be calling him up river else he would have whirled and vanished at the first alarm but how far might he presume on the big animals timidity who stood before him blocking the way that was his question plainly enough had i been a moment sooner or he a moment later we would have met squarely at the turn he would have clinched with me in sudden blind ferocity and that would have been the end of one of us as it was he saw me coming heedlessly and being peaceably inclined had stopped me with his sharp hoowuff before i should get too near there was no snarl or growl no savageness in his expression only intense wonder and questioning in the look which fastened upon my face and seemed to bore its way through to find out just what i was thinking  i met his eyes squarely with mine and held them which was perhaps the most sensible thing i could have done though it was all unconscious on my part in the brief moment that followed i did a lot of thinking there was no escape up or down i must go on or turn back if i jumped forward with a yell as i had done before under different circumstances would he not rush at me savagely as all wild creatures do when cornered no the time for that had passed with the first instant of our meeting the bluff would now be too apparent it must be done without hesitation or not at all on the other hand if i turned back he would follow me to the end of the ledge growing bolder as he came on and beyond that it was dangerous walking where he had all the advantage and all the knowledge of his ground besides it was late and i wanted a salmon for my supper  i have wondered since how much of this hesitation he understood and how he came to the conclusion which he certainly reached that i meant him no harm but only wanted to get on and was not disposed to give him the path all the while i looked at him steadily until his eyes began to lose their intentness my hand slipped back and gripped the handle of my hunting knife some slight confidence came with the feel of the heavy weapon though i would certainly have gone over the cliff and taken my chances in the current rather than have closed with him with all his enormous strength in that narrow place suddenly his eyes wavered from mine he swung his head to look down and up and i knew instantly that i had won the first moveand the path also if i could keep my nerve  i advanced a step or two very quietly still looking at him steadily there was a suggestion of white teeth under his wrinkled chops but he turned his head to look back over the way he had come and presently he disappeared it was only for a moment then his nose and eyes were poked cautiously by the corner of rock he was peeking to see if i were still there when the nose vanished again i stole forward to the turn and found him just ahead looking down the cliff to see if there were any other way below  he was uneasy now a low whining growl came floating up the path then i sat down on a rock squarely in his way and for the first time some faint suggestion of the humor of the situation gave me a bit of consolation i began to talk to him not humorously but as if he were a scotchman and open only to argument youre in a fix mooween a terrible fix i kept saying softly but if you had only stayed at home till twilight as a bear ought to do we should be happy now both of us you have put me in a fix too you see and now youve just got to get me out of it im not going back i dont know the path as well as you do besides it will be dark soon and i should probably break my neck its a shame mooween to put any gentleman in such a fix as i am in this minute just by your blundering carelessness why didnt you smell me anyway as any but a fool bear would have done and take some other path over the mountain why dont you climb that spruce now and get out of the way  i have noticed that all wild animals grow uneasy at the sound of the human voice speaking however quietly there is in it something deep unknown mysterious beyond all their powers of comprehension and they go away from it quickly when they can i have a theory also that all animals wild and domestic understand more of our mental attitude than we give them credit for and the theory gains rather than loses strength whenever i think of mooween on that narrow pass i can see him now turning twisting uneasily and the halftimid look in his eyes as they met mine furtively as if ashamed and again the low troubled whine comes floating up the path and mingles with the rush and murmur of the salmon pool below  a bear hates to be outdone quite as much as a fox does if you catch him in a trap he seldom growls or fights or resists as lynx and otter and almost all other wild creatures do he has outwitted you and shown his superiority so often that he is utterly overwhelmed and crushed when you find him at last helpless and outdone he seems to forget all his great strength all his frightful power of teeth and claws he just lays his head down between his paws turns his eyes aside and refuses to look at you or to let you see how ashamed he is that is what you are chiefly conscious of nine times out of ten when you find a bear or a fox held fast in your trap and something of that was certainly in mooweens look and actions now as i sat there in his path enjoying his confusion  near him a spruce tree sprang out of the rocks and reached upward to a ledge far above slowly he raised himself against this but turned to look at me again sitting quietly in his own paththat he could no longer consider hisand smiling at his discomfiture as i remember how ashamed he is to be outdone then an electric shock seemed to hoist him out of the trail he shot up the tree in a succession of nervous jerky jumps rising with astonishing speed for so huge a creature smashing the little branches ripping the rough bark with his great claws sending down a clattering shower of chips and dust behind him till he reached the level of the ledge above and sprang out upon it where he stopped and looked down to see what i would do next and there he stayed his great head hanging over the edge of the rock looking at me intently till i rose and went quietly down the trail  it was morning when i came back to the salmon pool unlike the mossy forest floor the hard rock bore no signs to tell mewhat i was most curious to knowwhether he came down the tree or found some other way over the mountain at the point where i had stood when his deep hoowuff first startled me i left a big salmon for a taste of which any bear will go far out of his way next morning it was gone and so it may be that mooween on his next journey found another and a pleasanter surprise awaiting him at the turn of the trail  illustration     quoskh the keen eyed  illustration   sometimes at night as you drift along the shore in your canoe sifting the night sounds and smells of the wilderness when all harsher cries are hushed and the silence grows tense and musical like a great stretched chord over which the wind is thrumming low suggestive melodies a sudden rush and flapping in the grasses beside you breaks noisily into the gamut of halfheard primary tones and rising vanishing harmonics then as you listen and before the silence has again stretched the chords of her eolian harp tight enough for the winds fingers another sound a cry comes floating down from the airquoskh quoskhquoskh a wild questioning call as if the startled night were asking who you are it is only a blue heron wakened out of his sleep on the shore by your noisy approach that you thought was still as the night itself he circles over your head for a moment seeing you perfectly though you catch never a shadow of his broad wings then he vanishes into the vast dark silence crying quoskh quoskh as he goes and the cry with its strange wild interrogation vanishing away into the outer darkness has given him his most fascinating indian name quoskh the nights question  to many indeed even to some indians he has no other name and no definite presence he rarely utters the cry by dayhis voice then is a harsh croakand you never see him as he utters it out of the solemn upper darkness so that there is often a mystery about this voice of the night which one never thinks of associating with the quiet patient longlegged fisherman that one may see any summer day along the borders of lonely lake or stream a score of times i have been asked by old campers what is that as a sharp questioning quoskhquoskh seemed to tumble down into the sleeping lake yet they knew the great blue heron perfectlyor thought they did  quoskh has other names however which describe his attributes and doings sometimes when fishing alongshore with my indian at the paddle the canoe would push its nose silently around a point and i would see the herons heavy slanting flight already halfway up to the treetops long before our coming had been suspected by the watchful little mother sheldrake or even by the deer feeding close at hand among the lily pads then simmo who could never surprise one of the great birds however silently he paddled would mutter something which sounded like quoskh ksobeqh quoskh the keen eyed at other times when we noticed him spearing frogs with his long bill simmo who could not endure the sight of a frogs leg on my fry pan would speak of him disdainfully in his own musical language as quoskh the frog eater for my especial benefit again if i stopped casting suddenly at the deep trout pool opposite a grassy shore to follow with my eyes a tall grayblue shadow on stilts moving dimly alongshore in sevenleagueboot strides for the next bog where frogs were plenty simmo would point with his paddle and say see ol fader longlegs go catchum more frogs for his babies funny kin babies dat eatum bullfrog don chu tink so  of all his namesand there were many more that i picked up from watching him in a summers outingold father longlegs seemed always the most appropriate there is a suggestion of hoary antiquity about this solemn wader of our lakes and streams indeed of all birds he is the nearest to those ancient uncouth monsters which nature made to people our earth in its uncouth infancy other herons and bitterns have grown smaller and more graceful with shorter legs and necks to suit our diminishing rivers and our changed landscape quoskh is also undoubtedly much smaller than he once was but still his legs and neck are disproportionately long when one thinks of the waters he wades and the nest he builds and the tracks he leaves in the mud are startlingly like those fossilized footprints of giant birds that one finds in the rocks of the pliocene era deep under the earths surface to tell what sort of creatures lived in the vast solitudes before man came to replenish the earth and subdue it  closely associated with this suggestion of antiquity in quoskhs demeanor is the opposite suggestion of perpetual youth which he carries with him age has no apparent effect on him whatsoever he is as old and young as the earth itself is he is a march day with winter and spring in its sunset and sunrise who ever saw a blue heron with his jewel eye dimmed or his natural force abated who ever caught one sleeping or saw him tottering weakly on his long legs as one so often sees our common wild birds clinging feebly to a branch with their last grip a cape cod sailor once told me that far out from land his schooner had passed a blue heron lying dead on the sea with outstretched wings that is the only heron that i have ever heard of who was found without all his wits about him possibly if quoskh ever dies it may suggest a solution to the question of what becomes of him with his last strength he may fly boldly out to explore that great ocean mystery along the borders of which his ancestors for untold centuries lived and moved back and forth back and forth on their endless unnecessary migrations restless unsatisfied wandering as if the voice of the sea were calling them whither they dared not follow                                       just behind my tent on the big lake one summer a faint woodsy little trail wandered away into the woods with endless turnings and twistings and without the faintest indication anywhere till you reached the very end whither it intended going this little trail was always full of interesting surprises red squirrels peeked down at you over the edge of a limb chattering volubly and getting into endless mischief along its borders moose birds flitted silently over it on their mysterious errands now a jumping smashing crackling rush through the underbrush halts you suddenly with quick beating heart as you climb over one of the many windfalls across your path a white flag followed by another little one flashing rising sinking and rising again over the fallen timber tells you that a doe and her fawn were lying behind the windfall all unconscious of your quiet approach again at a turn of the trail something dark gray massive looms before you blocking the faint path and as you stop short and shrink behind the nearest tree a huge head and antlers swing toward you with widespread nostrils and keen dilating eyes and ears like two trumpets pointing straight at your heada bull moose sh  for a long two minutes he stands there motionless watching the new creature that he has never seen before and it will be well for you to keep perfectly quiet and let him surrender the path when he is so disposed motion on your part may bring him nearer to investigate and you can never know at what slight provocation the red danger light will blaze into his eyes at last he moves away quietly at first turning often to look and to make trumpets of his ears at you then he lays his great antlers back on his shoulders sticks his nose far up ahead of him and with long smooth strides lunges away over the windfalls and is gone  so every day the little trail had some new surprise for youowl or hare or prickly porcupine rattling his quills like a quiver of arrows and proclaiming his indian name unkwunk unkwunk as he loafed along when you had followed far and were sure that the loitering trail had certainly lost itself it crept at last under a dark hemlock and there through an oval frame of rustling whispering green was the loneliest loveliest little deerhaunted beaver pond in the world where quoskh lived with his mate and his little ones  the first time i came down the trail and peeked through the oval frame of bushes i saw him and the very first glimpse made me jump at the thought of what a wonderful discovery i had made namely that little herons play with dolls as children do but i was mistaken quoskh had been catching frogs and hiding them one by one as i came along he heard me before i knew he was there and jumped for his last frog a big fat one with which he slanted up heavily on broad vanswith a hump on his back and a crook in his neck and his long legs trailing below and behindtowards his nest in the hemlock beyond the beaver pond when i saw him plainly he was just crossing the oval frame through which i looked he had gripped the frog across the middle in his long beak much as one would hold it with a pair of blunt shears swelling it out at either side like a string tied tight about a pillow the head and short arms were forced up at one side the limp legs dangled down on the other looking for all the world like a stuffed rag doll that quoskh was carrying home for his babies to play with  undoubtedly they liked the frog much better but my curious thought about them in that brief romantic instant gave me an interest in the little fellows which was not satisfied till i climbed to the nest long afterwards and saw them and how they lived  when i took to studying quoskh so as to know him more intimately i found a fascinating subject not simply because of his queer ways but also because of his extreme wariness and the difficulties i met in catching him doing things quoskh ksobeqh was the name that at first seemed most appropriate till i had learned his habits and how best to get the weather of himwhich happened only two or three times in the course of a whole summer  one morning i went early to the beaver pond and sat down against a gray stump on the shore with berry bushes growing to my shoulders all about me now i shall keep still and see everything that comes i thought and nothing not even a blue jay will see me  that was almost true little birds that had never seen a man in the woods before came for the berries and billed them off within six feet of my face before they noticed anything unusual when they did see me they would turn their heads so as to look at me first with one eye then with the other and shoot up at last with a sharp burr of their tiny wings to a branch over my head there they would watch me keenly for a wink or a minute according to their curiosity then swoop down and whirr their wings loudly in my face so as to make me move and show what i was  across a little arm of the pond a stones throw away a fine buck came to the water put his muzzle into it then began to fidget uneasily some vague subtle flavor of me floated across and made him uneasy though he knew not what i was he kept tonguing his nostrils as a cow does so as to moisten them and catch the scent of me better on my right and nearer a doe was feeding unconcernedly among the lily pads a mink ran hopping and halting along the shore at my feet dodging in and out among roots and rocks cheokhes always runs that way he knows how glistening black his coat is how shining a mark he makes for owl and hawk against the sandy shore and so he never runs more than five feet without dodging out of sight and he always prefers the roots and rocks that are blackest to travel on  a kingfisher dropped with his musical kplop into the shoal of minnows that were rippling the water in their play just in front of me farther out a fishhawk came down heavily souse and rose with a big chub and none of these sharpeyed wood folk saw me or knew that they were watched then a wide wavy blue line like a great cupids bow came gliding swiftly along the opposite bank of green and quoskh hove into sight for his mornings fishing  opposite me just where the buck had stood he folded his great wings his neck crooked sharply his long legs which had been trailed gracefully behind him in his swift flight swung under him like two pendulums as he landed lightly on the muddy shore he knew his ground perfectly knew every stream and froghaunted bay in the pond as one knows his own village yet no amount of familiarity with his surroundings can ever sing lullaby to quoskhs watchfulness the instant he landed he drew himself up straight standing almost as tall as a man and let his keen glance run along every shore just once his head with its bright yellow eye and long yellow beak glistening in the morning light veered and swung over his long neck like a gilded weathervane on a steeple as the vane swung up the shore toward me i held my breath so as to be perfectly motionless thinking i was hidden so well that no eye could find me at that distance as it swung past me slowly i chuckled thinking that quoskh was deceived i forgot altogether that a bird never sees straight ahead when his bill had moved some thirty degrees off my nose just enough so as to bring his left eye to bear it stopped swinging instantlyhe had seen me at the first glance and knew that i did not belong there  for a long moment while his keen eye seemed to look through and through me he never moved a muscle one could easily have passed over him thinking him only one of the gray wavewashed roots on the shore then he humped himself together in that indescribably awkward way that all herons have at the beginning of their flight slanted heavily up to the highest tree on the shore and stopped for a longer period on a dead branch to look back at me i had not moved so much as an eyelid nevertheless he saw me too plainly to trust me again he humped himself rose high over the treetops and bore away in strong even graceful flight for a lonelier lake where there was no man to watch or bother him  far from disappointing me this keenness of quoskh only whetted my appetite to know more about him and especially to watch him close at hand at his fishing near the head of the little bay where frogs were plenty i built a screen of boughs under the low thick branches of a spruce tree and went away to watch other wood folk  next morning he did not come back nor were there any fresh tracks of his on the shore this was my first intimation that quoskh knows well the rule of good fishermen and does not harry a pool or a place too frequently however good the fishing the third morning he came back and again the sixth evening and then the ninth morning alternating with great regularity as long as i kept tabs on him at other times i would stumble upon him far afield fishing in other lakes and streams or see him winging homeward high over the woods from waters far beyond my ken but these appearances were too irregular to count in a theory i have no doubt however that he fished the nearby waters with as great regularity as he fished the beaver pond and went wider afield only when he wanted a bit of variety or bigger frogs as all fishermen do or when he had poor luck in satisfying the clamorous appetite of his growing brood  it was on the sixth afternoon that i had the best chance of studying his queer ways of fishing i was sitting in my little blind at the beaver pond waiting for a deer when quoskh came striding along the shore he would swing his weathervane head till he saw a frog ahead then stalk him slowly deliberately with immense caution as if he knew as well as i how watchful the frogs are at his approach and how quickly they dive headlong for cover at the first glint of his stiltlike legs nearer and nearer he would glide standing motionless as a gray root when he thought his game was watching him then on again more cautiously bending far forward and drawing his neck back to the angle of greatest speed and power for a blow a quick start a thrust like lightningthen you would see him shake his frog savagely beat it upon the nearest stone or root glide to a tuft of grass hide his catch cunningly and go on unincumbered for the next stalk his weathervane swinging swinging in the ceaseless search for frogs or possible enemies  if the swirl of a fish among the sedges caught his keen eye he would change his tactics letting his game come to him instead of stalking it as he did with the frogs whatever his position was both feet down or one foot raised for a stride when the fish appeared he never changed it knowing well that motion would only send his game hurriedly into deeper water he would stand sometimes for a half hour on one leg letting his head sink slowly down on his shoulders his neck curled back his long sharp bill pointing always straight at the quivering line which marked the playing fish his eyes half closed till the right moment came then you would see his long neck shoot down hear the splash and later the whack of his catch against the nearest root to kill it and watch with curious feelings of sympathy as he hid it in the grass and covered it over lest hawahak the hawk should see or cheokhes the mink smell it and rob him while he fished  if he were near his last catch he would stride back and hide the two together if not he covered it over in the nearest good place and went on no danger of his ever forgetting however numerous the catch whether he counts his frogs and fish or simply remembers the different hiding places i have no means of knowing  sometimes when i surprised him on a muddy shore and he flew away without taking even one of his tidbits i would follow his back track and uncover his hiding places to see what he had caught frogs fish pollywogs mussels a baby muskratthey were all there each hidden cunningly under a bit of dried grass and mud and once i went away and hid on the opposite shore to see if he would come back after an hour or more he appeared looking first at my tracks then at all the shore with greater keenness than usual then he went straight to three different hiding places that i had found and two more that i had not seen and flew away to his nest a fringe of frogs and fish hanging at either side of his long bill as he went  he had arranged them on the ground like the spokes of a wheel as a fox does heads all out on either side and one leg or the tail of each crossed in a common pile in the middle so that he could bite down over the crossed members and carry the greatest number of little frogs and fish with the least likelihood of dropping any in his flight  the mussels which he found were invariably i think eaten as his own particular tidbits for i never saw him attempt to carry them away though once i found two or three where he had hidden them generally he could crack their shells easily by blows of his powerful beak or by whacking them against a root and so he had no need and probably no knowledge of the trick which every gull knows of mounting up to a height with some obstinate hardshell and dropping it on a rock to crack it  if quoskh were fishing for his own dinner instead of for his hungry nestlings he adopted different tactics for them he was a hunter sly silent crafty stalking his game by approved stillhunting methods for himself he was the true fisherman quiet observant endlessly patient he seemed to know that for himself he could afford to take his time and be comfortable knowing that all things especially fish come to him who waits long enough while for his little ones he must hurry else their croakings from too long fasting would surely bring hungry unwelcome prowlers to the big nest in the hemlock  once i saw him fishing in a peculiar way which reminded me instantly of the chumming process with which every mackerel fisherman on the coast is familiar he caught a pollywog for bait with which he waded to a deep cool place under a shady bank there he whacked his pollywog into small bits and tossed them into the water where the chum speedily brought a shoal of little fish to feed quoskh meanwhile stood in the shadow where he would not be noticed kneedeep in water his head drawn down into his shoulders and a friendly leafy branch bending over him to screen him from prying eyes as a fish swam up to his chum he would spear it like lightning throw his head back and wriggle it headfirst down his long neck then settle down to watch for the next one and there he stayed alternately watching and feasting till he had enough when he drew his head farther down into his shoulders shut his eyes and went fast asleep in the cool shadowsa perfect picture of fishing indolence and satisfaction                                       when i went to the nest and hid myself in the underbrush to watch day after day i learned more of quoskhs fishing and hunting the nest was in a great evergreen in a gloomy swampa villainous place of bogs and treacherous footing with here and there a little island of large trees on one of these islands a small colony of herons were nesting during the day they trailed far afield scattering widely each pair to its own particular fishing grounds but when the shadows grew long and night prowlers stirred abroad the herons came trailing back again making curious wavy graceful lines athwart the sunset glow to croak and be sociable together and help each other watch the long night out  illustration  quoskh the watchfuli could tell my great birds mate by sight or hearing from all others either by her greater size or a peculiar double croak she hadhad hidden her nest in the top of a great green hemlock near by in the high crotch of a dead tree was another nest which she had built evidently years before and added to each successive spring only to abandon it at last for the evergreen both birds used to go to the old nest freely and i have wondered since if it were not a bit of great shrewdness on their part to leave it there in plain sight where any prowler might see and climb to it while the young were securely hidden meanwhile in the top of the nearby hemlock where they could see without being seen only at a distance could you find the nest when under the hemlock the mass of branches screened it perfectly and your attention was wholly taken by the other nest standing out in bold relief in the dead treetop  such wisdom if wisdom it were and not chance is gained only by experience it took at least one brood of young herons sacrificed to the appetite of lucivee or fisher to teach quoskh the advantage of that decoy nest to tempt hungry prowlers upon the bare tree hole where she could have a clear field to spear them with her powerful bill and beat them down with her great wings before they should discover their mistake  by watching the birds through my glass as they came to the young i could generally tell what kind of game was afoot for their following once a long snake hung from the mother birds bill once it was a bird of some kind twice she brought small animals whose species i could not make out in the brief moment of alighting on the nests edgeall these besides the regular fare of fish and frogs of which i took no account and then one day while i lay in my hiding i saw the mother heron slide swiftly down from the nest make a sharp wheel over the lake and plunge into the fringe of berry bushes on the shore after some animal that her keen eyes had caught moving there was a swift rustling in the bushes a blow of her wing to head off a runaway two or three lightning thrusts of her javelin beak then she rose heavily taking a leveret with her and i saw her pulling it to pieces awkwardly on the nest to feed her hungry little ones  it was partly to see these little herons the thought of which had fascinated me ever since i had seen quoskh taking home what i thought at first glance was a rag doll for them to play with and partly to find out more of quoskhs hunting habits by seeing what he brought home that led me at last to undertake the difficult task of climbing the huge tree to the nest one day when the mother had brought home some unknown small animala mink i thoughti came suddenly out of my hiding and crossed over to the nest it had always fascinated me under it at twilight i had heard the mother heron croaking softly to her little onesa husky lullaby but sweet enough to themand then as i paddled away i would see the nest dark against the sunset with mother quoskh standing over it a tall graceful silhouette against the glory of twilight keeping sentinel watch over her little ones now i would solve the mystery of the high nest by looking into it  the mother alarmed by my sudden appearanceshe had no idea that she had been watchedshot silently away hoping i would not notice her home through the dense screen of branches i climbed up with difficulty but not till i was within ten feet could i make out the mass of sticks above me the surroundings were getting filthy and evilsmelling by this time for quoskh teaches the young herons to keep their nest perfectly clean by throwing all refuse over the sides of the great home a dozen times i had watched the mother birds of the colony push their little ones to the edge of the nest to teach them this rule of cleanliness so different from most other birds  as i hesitated about pushing through the filthladen branches something bright on the edge of the nest caught my attention it was a young herons eye looking down at me over a long bill watching my approach with a keenness that was but thinly disguised by the halfdrawn eyelids i had to go round the tree at this point for a standing on a larger branch and when i looked up there was another eye watching down over another long bill so however i turned they watched me closely getting nearer and nearer till i reached up my hand to touch the nest then there was a harsh croak three long necks reached down suddenly over the edge of the nest on the side where i was three long bills opened wide just over my head and three young herons grew suddenly seasick as if they had swallowed ipecac  illustration  i never saw the inside of that home at the moment i was in too much of a hurry to get down and wash in the lake and after that so large were the young birds so keen and powerful the beaks that no man or beast might expect to look over the edge of the nest with hands or paws engaged in holding on and keep his eyes for a single instant it is more dangerous to climb for young herons than for young eagles a heron always strikes for the eye and his blow means blindness or death unless you watch like a cat and ward it off  when i saw the young again they were taking their first lessons a dismal croaking in the treetops attracted me and i came over cautiously to see what my herons were doing the young were standing up on the big nest stretching necks and wings and croaking hungrily while the mother stood on a treetop some distance away showing them food and telling them plainly in heron language to come and get it they tried it after much coaxing and croaking but their long awkward toes missed their hold upon the slender branch on which she was balancing delicatelyjust as she expected it to happen as they fell flapping lustily she shot down ahead of them and led them in a long curving slant to an open spot on the shore there she fed them with the morsels she held in her beak brought more food from a tuft of grass where she had hidden it near at hand praised them with gurgling croaks till they felt some confidence on their awkward legs then the whole family started up the shore on their first frogging expedition  it was intensely interesting for a man who as a small boy had often gone afrogging himselfto catch big ones for a woodsy corn roast or little ones for pickerel baitto sit now on a bog and watch the little herons try their luck mother quoskh went ahead cautiously searching the lily pads the young trailed behind her awkwardly lifting their feet like a shanghai rooster and setting them down with a splash to scare every frog within hearing exactly where the mothers foot had rested a moment before so they went on the mothers head swinging like a weathervane to look far ahead the little ones stretching their necks so as to peek by her on either side full of wonder at the new world full of hunger for things that grew there till a startled young frog said ktung from behind a lily bud where they did not see him and dove headlong into the mud leaving a long crinkly brown trail to tell exactly how far he had gone  a frog is like an ostrich when he sees nothing because his head is hidden he thinks nothing can see him at the sudden alarm mother quoskh would stretch her neck watching the frogs flight then turn her head so that her long bill pointed directly at the bump on the muddy bottom which marked the hiding place of chigwooltz and croak softly as a signal at the sound one of the young herons would hurry forward eagerly follow his mothers bill which remained motionless pointing all the while twist his head till he saw the frogs back in the mud and then lunge at it like lightning generally he got his frog and through your glass you would see the unfortunate creature wriggling and kicking his way into quoskhs yellow beak if the lunge missed the mothers keen eye followed the frogs frantic rush through the mud with a longer trail this time behind him till he hid again whereupon she croaked the same youngster up for another try and then the whole family moved jerkily along like a row of boys on stilts to the next clump of lily pads  as the young grew older and stronger on their legs i noticed the rudiments at least of a curious habit of dancing which seems to belong to most of our longlegged wading birds sometimes sitting quietly in my canoe i would see the young birds sail down in a long slant to the shore immediately on alighting before they gave any thought to frogs or fish or carnal appetite they would hop up and down balancing swaying spreading their wings and hopping again round about each other as if bewitched a few moments of this crazy performance and then they would stalk sedately along the shore as if ashamed of their ungainly levity but at any moment the ecstasy might seize them and they would hop again as if they simply could not help it this occurred generally towards evening when the birds had fed full and were ready for play or for stretching their broad wings in preparation for the long autumn flight  watching them one evening i remembered suddenly a curious scene that i had stumbled upon when a boy i had seen a great blue heron sail croaking croaking into an arm of the big pond where i was catching bullpouts and crept down through dense woods to find out what he was croaking about instead of one i found eight or ten of the great birds on an open shore hopping ecstatically through some kind of a crazy dance a twig snapped as i crept nearer and they scattered in instant flight it was september and the instinct to flock and to migrate was at work among them when they came together for the first time some dim old remembrance of generations long gone bythe shreds of an ancient instinct whose meaning we can only guess athad set them to dancing wildly though i doubted at the time whether they understood much what they were doing  illustration  perhaps i was wrong in this watching the young birds at their ungainly hopping the impulse to dance seemed uncontrollable yet they were immensely dignified about it at times and again they appeared to get some fun out of itas much perhaps as we do out of some of our peculiar dances of which a visiting chinaman once asked innocently why dont you let your servants do it for you  i have seen little green herons do the same thing in the woods at mating time and once in the zoölogical gardens at antwerp i saw a magnificent hopping performance by some giant cranes from africa our own sandhill and whooping cranes are notorious dancers and undoubtedly it is more or less instinctive with all the tribes of the cranes and herons from the least to the greatest but what the instinct meansunless like our own dancing it is a pure bit of pleasuremaking as crows play games and loons swim racesnobody can tell                                       before the young were fully grown and while yet they were following the mother to learn the ways of frogging and fishing a startling thing occurred which made me ever afterwards look up to quoskh with honest admiration i was stillfishing in the middle of the big lake one late afternoon when quoskh and her little ones sailed over the trees from the beaver pond and lit on a grassy shore a shallow little brook stole into the lake there and mother quoskh left her young to frog for themselves while she went fishing up the brook under the alders i was watching the young herons through my glass when i saw a sudden rush in the tall grass near them all three humped themselves heron fashion on the instant two got away safely the other had barely spread his wings when a black animal leaped out of the grass for his neck and pulled him down flapping and croaking desperately  i pulled up my killick on the instant and paddled over to see what was going on and what the creature was that had leaped out of the grass before my paddle had swung a dozen strokes i saw the alders by the brook open swiftly and mother quoskh sailed out and drove like an arrow straight at the struggling wing tips which still flapped spasmodically above the grass almost before her feet had dropped to a solid landing she struck two fierce blinding downward blows of her great wings her neck curved back and shot straight out driving the keen sixinch bill before it quicker than ever a roman arm drove its javelin above the laplap of my canoe i heard a savage cry of pain the same black animal leaped up out of the tangled grass snapping for the neck and a desperate battle began with short gasping croaks and snarls that made caution unnecessary as i sped over to see who the robber was and how quoskh was faring in the good fight  the canoe shot up behind a point where looking over the low bank i had the arena directly under my eye the animal was a fisherblackcat the trappers call himthe most savage and powerful fighter of his size in the whole world i think in the instant that i first saw him quicker than thought he had hurled himself twice at the towering birds breast each time he was met by a lightning blow in the face from quoskhs stiffened wing his teeth ground the big quills to pulp his claws tore them into shreds but he got no grip in the feathery mass and he slipped clawing and snarling into the grass only to spring again like a flash again the stiff wing blow but this time his jump was higher one claw gripped the shoulder tore its way through flying feathers to the bone while his weight dragged the big bird down then quoskh shortened her neck in a great curve like a snake it glided over the edge of her own wing for two short sharp downthrusts of the deadly javelinso quick that my eye caught only the double yellow flash of it with a sharp screech the blackcat leaped away and whirled towards me blindly one eye was gone an angry red welt showed just over the other telling how narrowly the second thrust had missed its mark  a shiver ran over me as i remembered how nearly i had once come myself to the blackcats condition and from the same keen weapon i was a small boy at the time following a big goodnatured hunter that i met in the woods one day from pure love of the wilds and for the glory of carrying the game bag he shot a great blue heron which fell with a broken wing into some soft mud and water grass carelessly he sent me to fetch it not caring to wet his own feet as i ran up the heron lay resting quietly his neck drawn back his long keen bill pointing always straight at my face i had never seen so big a bird before and bent over him wondering at his long bill admiring his intensely bright eye  i did not know thenwhat i have since learned wellthat you can always tell when the rush or spring or blow of any beast or birdor of any man for that matterwill surely come by watching the eye closely there is a fire that blazes in the eye before the blow comes before ever a muscle has stirred to do the brains quick bidding as i bent over fascinated by the keen bright look of the wounded bird and reached down my hand to pick him up there was a flash deep in the eye like the glint of sunshine from a mirror and i dodged instinctively well for me that i did so something shot by my face like lightning opening up a long red gash across my left temple from eyebrow to ear as i jumped i heard a careless laugh look out sonny he may bite yougosh what a close call and with a white scared face as he saw the ugly wound that the herons beak had opened he dragged me away as if there had been a bear in the water grass  the blackcat had not yet received punishment enough he is one of the largest of the weasel family and has a double measure of the weasels savageness and tenacity he darted about the heron in a quick nervous jumping circle looking for an opening behind while quoskh lifted her great torn wings as a shield and turned slowly on the defensive so as always to face the danger a dozen times the fisher jumped filling the air with feathers a dozen times the stiffened wings struck down to intercept his spring and every blow was followed by a swift javelin thrust then as the fisher crouched snarling in the grass off his guard for an instant i saw mother quoskh take a sudden step forward her first offensive movejust as i had seen her twenty times at the finish of a frog stalkand her bill shot down with the whole power of her long neck behind it a harsh screech of pain followed the swift blow then the fisher wobbled away with blind uncertain jumps towards the shelter of the woods  illustration a dozen times the fisher jumped filling the air with feathers  and now with her savage enemy in full flight a fierce hot anger seemed to flare within the mother heron burning out all the previous cool calculating defense her wings heaved aloft as the soldiers of old threw up their shields in the moment of victory while her whole frame seemed to swell with power like a hero whose fight is won she darted after the fisher first on the run then with heavy wing beats till she headed him and with savage blows of pinion and beak drove him back seeing nothing guided only by fear and instinct towards the water for five minutes more she chevied him hither and yon through the trampled grass driving him from water to bush and back again jabbing him at every turn till a rustle of leaves invited him and he dashed blindly into thick underbrush where her broad wings could not follow then with marvelous watchfulness she saw me standing near in my canoe and without a thought apparently for the young heron lying so still in the grass close beside her she spread her torn wings and flapped away heavily in the path of her more fortunate younglings  i followed the fishers trail into the woods and found him curled up in a hollow stump he made slight resistance as i pulled him out all his ferocity was already lulled to sleep in the vague dreamy numbness which nature always sends to her stricken creatures he suffered nothing apparently though he was fearfully wounded he just wanted to be let alone both eyes were gone and there was nothing left for me except to finish mercifully what little quoskh had left undone  illustration  when september came and family cares were over the colony beyond the beaver pond scattered widely returning each one to the shy wild solitary life that quoskh likes best almost anywhere in the loneliest places i might come upon a solitary heron stalking frogs or chumming little fish or treading the soft mud expectantly like a clam digger to find where the mussels were hidden by means of his long toes or just standing still to enjoy the sleepy sunshine till the late afternoon came when he likes best to go abroad  they slept no more on the big nest standing like sentinels against the twilight glow and the setting moon but each one picked out a good spot on the shore and slept as best he could on one leg waiting for the early fishing it was astonishing how carefully even the young birds picked out a safe position by day they would stand like statues in the shade of a bank or among the tall grasses where they were almost invisible by reason of their soft colors and wait for hours for fish and frogs to come to them by night each one picked out a spot on the clean open shore off a point generally where he could see up and down where there was no grass to hide an enemy and where the bushes on the bank were far enough away so that he could hear the slight rustle of leaves before the creature that made it was within springing distance and there he would sleep safe through the long night unless disturbed by my canoe or by some other prowler herons see almost as well by night as by day and their ears are keen as a weasels so i could never get near enough to surprise them however silently i paddled i would hear only a startled rush of wings and then a questioning call as they sailed over me before winging away to quieter beaches  if i were jacking with a light blazing brightly before me in my canoe to see what night folk i might surprise on the shore quoskh was the only one for whom my jack had no fascination deer and moose foxes and wild ducks frogs and fishall seemed equally charmed by the great wonder of a light shining silently out of the vast darkness i saw them all at different times and glided almost up to them before timidity drove them away from the strange bright marvel but quoskh was not to be watched in that way nor to be caught by any such trick i would see a vague form on the far edge of the lights pathway catch the bright flash of either eye as he swung his weathervane head then the vague form would slide into the upper darkness a moments waiting then above me and behind where the light did not dazzle his eyes i would hear his night crywith more of anger than of questioning in itand as i turned the jack upward i would catch a single glimpse of his broad wings sailing over the lake nor would he ever come back like the fox on the bank for a second look to be quite sure what i was  when the bright moonlit nights came there was uneasiness in quoskhs wild breast the solitary life that he loves best claimed him by day but at night the old gregarious instinct drew him again to his fellows once when drifting over the beaver pond through the delicate witchery of the moonlight i heard five or six of the great birds croaking excitedly at the heronry which they had deserted weeks before the lake and especially the lonely little pond at the end of the trail was lovelier than ever before but something in the south was calling him away i think that quoskh was also moonstruck as so many wild creatures are for instead of sleeping quietly on the shore he spent his time circling aimlessly over the lake and woods crying his name aloud or calling wildly to his fellows  at midnight of the day before i broke camp i was out on the lake for a last paddle in the moonlight the night was perfectclear cool intensely still not a ripple broke the great burnished surface of the lake a silver pathway stretched away and away over the bow of my gliding canoe leading me on to where the great forest stood silent awake expectant and flooded through all its dim mysterious arches with marvelous light the wilderness never sleeps if it grow silent it is to listen tonight the woods were tense as a waiting fox watching to see what new thing would come out of the lake or what strange mystery would be born under their own soft shadows  quoskh was abroad too bewitched by the moonlight i heard him calling and paddled down he knew me long before he was anything more to me than a voice of the night and swept up to meet me for the first time after darkness fell i saw himjust a vague gray shadow with edges touched softly with silver light which whirled once over my canoe and looked down into it then he vanished and from far over on the edge of the waiting woods where the mystery was deepest came a cry a challenge a riddle the nights wild question which no man has ever yet answeredquoskh quoskh  illustration     unk wunk the porcupine  illustration   a rustling in the brakes just outside my little tent roused me from a light slumber there it was again the push of some heavy animal trying to move noiselessly through the tangle close at hand while from the old lumber camp in the midst of the clearing a low gnawing sound floated up through the still night i sat up quickly to listen but at the slight movement all was quiet again the night prowlers had heard me and were on their guard  one need have no fear of things that come round in the night they are much shyer than you are and can see you better so that if you blunder towards them they mistake your blindness for courage and take to their heels promptly as i stepped out there was a double rush in some bushes behind my tent and by the light of a halfmoon i caught one glimpse of a bear and her cub jumping away for the shelter of the woods  the gnawing still went on behind the old shanty by the river another cub i thoughtfor i was new to the big woodsand stole down to peek by the corner of the camp in whose yard i had pitched my tent the first night out in the wilderness  there was an old molasses hogshead lying just beyond the log camp its mouth looking black as ink in the moonlight and the scratchinggnawing sounds went on steadily within its shadow hes inside i thought with elation scraping off the crusted sugar now to catch him  i stole round the camp so as to bring the closed end of the hogshead between me and the prize crept up breathlessly and with a quick jerk hove the old tub up on end trapping the creature inside there was a thump a startled scratching and rustling a violent rocking of the hogshead which i tried to hold down then all was silent in the trap ive got him i thought forgetting all about the old shebear and shouted for simmo to wake up and bring the ax  we drove a ring of stakes close about the hogshead weighted it down with heavy logs and turned in to sleep in the morning with cooler judgment we decided that a bear cub was too troublesome a pet to keep in a tent so i stood by with a rifle while simmo hove off the logs and cut the stakes keeping a wary eye on me meanwhile to see how far he might trust his life to my nerve in case the cub should be big and troublesome for an indian takes no chances a stake fell the hogshead toppled over by a push from within simmo sprang away with a yell and out wobbled a big porcupine the biggest i ever saw and tumbled away straight towards my tent after him went the indian making sweeping cuts at the stupid thing with his ax and grunting his derision at my bear cub  halfway to the tent unk wunk stumbled across a bit of pork rind and stopped to nose it daintily i caught simmos arm and stayed the blow that would have made an end of my catch then between us unk wunk sat up on his haunches took the pork in his fore paws and sucked the salt out of it as if he had never a concern and never an enemy in the wide world a half hour later he loafed into my tent where i sat repairing a favorite salmon fly that some hungry seatrout had torn to tatters and drove me unceremoniously out of my own bailiwick in his search for more salt  such a philosopher whom no prison can dispossess of his peace of mind and whom no danger can deprive of his simple pleasures deserves more consideration than the naturalists have ever given him i resolved on the spot to study him more carefully as if to discourage all such attempts and make himself a target for my rifle he nearly spoiled my canoe the next night by gnawing a hole through the bark and ribs for some suggestion of salt that only his greedy nose could possibly have found  once i found him on the trail some distance from camp and having nothing better to do i attempted to drive him home my intention was to share hospitality to give him a bit of bacon and then study him as i ate my own dinner he turned at the first suggestion of being driven came straight at my legs and by a vicious slap of his tail left some of his quills in me before i could escape then i drove him in the opposite direction whereupon he turned and bolted past me and when i arrived at camp he was busily engaged in gnawing the end from simmos ax handle  however you take him unk wunk is one of the mysteries he is a perpetual question scrawled across the forest floor which nobody pretends to answer a problem that grows only more puzzling as you study to solve it  of all the wild creatures he is the only one that has no intelligent fear of man and that never learns either by instinct or experience to avoid mans presence he is everywhere in the wilderness until he changes what he would call his mind and then he is nowhere and you cannot find him he delights in solitude and cares not for his own kind yet now and then you will stumble upon a whole convention of porcupines at the base of some rocky hill each one loafing around rattling his quills grunting his name unk wunk unk wunk and doing nothing else all day long  you meet him today and he is timid as a rabbit tomorrow he comes boldly into your tent and drives you out if you happen to be caught without a club handy he never has anything definite to do nor any place to go to yet stop him at any moment and he will risk his life to go just a foot farther now try to drive or lead him another foot in the same direction and he will bolt back as full of contrariness as two pigs on a road and let himself be killed rather than go where he was heading a moment before he is perfectly harmless to every creature yet he lies still and kills the savage fisher that attacks him or even the big canada lynx that no other creature in the woods would dare to tackle  above all these puzzling contradictions is the prime question of how nature ever produced such a creature and what she intended doing with him for he seems to have no place nor use in the natural economy of things recently the maine legislature has passed a bill forbidding the shooting of porcupines on the curious ground that he is the only wild animal that can easily be caught and killed without a gun so that a man lost in the woods need not starve to death but may feed on porcupine as the indians sometimes do this is the only suggestion thus far from a purely utilitarian standpoint that unk wunk is no mistake but may have his uses  once to test the law and to provide for possible future contingencies i added unk wunk to my bill of farea vile malodorous suffix that might delight a lover of strong cheese it is undoubtedly a good law but i cannot now imagine any one being grateful for it unless the stern alternative were death or porcupine  the prowlers of the woods would eat him gladly enough but that they are sternly forbidden they cannot even touch him without suffering the consequences it would seem as if nature when she made this block of stupidity in a world of wits provided for him tenderly as she would for a halfwitted or idiot child he is the only wild creature for whom starvation has no terrors all the forest is his storehouse buds and tender shoots delight him in their season and when the cold becomes bitter in its intensity and the snow packs deep and all other creatures grow gaunt and savage in their hunger unk wunk has only to climb the nearest tree chisel off the rough outer shell with his powerful teeth and then feed full on the soft inner layer of bark which satisfies him perfectly and leaves him as fat as an alderman  of hungry beasts unk wunk has no fear whatever generally they let him severely alone knowing that to touch him would be more foolish than to mouth a sunfish or to bite a petergrunter if driven by hunger in the killing march days they approach him savagely he simply rolls up and lies still protected by an armor that only a steel glove might safely explore and that has no joint anywhere visible to the keenest eye  now and then some cunning lynx or weasel wise from experience but desperate with hunger throws himself flat on the ground close by unk wunk and works his nose cautiously under the terrible bur searching for the neck or the underside of the body where there are no quills one grip of the powerful jaws one taste of blood in the famished throat of the prowlerand that is the end of both animals for unk wunk has a weapon that no prowler of the woods ever calculates upon his broad heavy tail is armed with hundreds of barbs smaller but more deadly than those on his back and he swings this weapon with the vicious sweep of a rattlesnake it is probably this power of driving his barbs home by a lightning blow of his tail that has given rise to the curious delusion that unk wunk can shoot his quills at a distance as if he were filled with compressed airwhich is of course a harmless absurdity that keeps people from meddling with him too closely  sometimes when attacked unk wunk covers his face with this weapon more often he sticks his head under a root or into a hollow log leaving his tail out ready for action at the first touch of his enemy the tail snaps right and left quicker than thought driving the hostile head and sides full of the deadly quills from which there is no escape for every effort every rub and writhe of pain only drives them deeper and deeper till they rest in heart or brain and finish their work  mooween the bear is the only one of the wood folk who has learned the trick of attacking unk wunk without injury to himself if when very hungry he finds a porcupine he never attacks him directlyhe knows too well the deadly sting of the barbs for thatbut bothers and irritates the porcupine by flipping earth at him until at last unk wunk rolls all his quills outward and lies still then mooween with immense caution slides one paw under him and with a quick flip hurls him against the nearest tree and knocks the life out of him  illustration bothers and irritates the porcupine by flipping earth at him  if he find unk wunk in a tree he will sometimes climb after him and standing as near as the upper limbs allow will push and tug mightily to shake him off that is usually a vain attempt for the creature that sleeps sound and secure through a gale in the treetops has no concern for the ponderous shakings of a bear in that case mooween if he can get near enough without risking a fall from too delicate branches will wrench off the limb on which unk wunk is sleeping and throw it to the ground that also is usually a vain proceeding for before mooween can scramble down after his game unk wunk is already up another tree and sleeping as if nothing had happened on another branch  other prowlers with less strength and cunning than mooween fare badly when driven by famine to attack this useless creature of the woods for whom nature nevertheless cares so tenderly trappers have told me that in the late winter when hunger is sharpest they sometimes catch a wildcat or lynx or fisher in their traps with his mouth and sides full of porcupine quills showing to what straits he had been driven for food these rare trapped animals are but an indication of many a silent struggle that only the trees and stars are witnesses of and the trappers deadfall with its quick sure blow is only a merciful ending to what else had been a long slow painful trail ending at last under a hemlock tip with the snow for a covering  last summer in a little glade in the wilderness i found two skeletons one of a porcupine the other of a large lynx lying side by side in the latter three quills lay where the throat had once been the shaft of another stood firmly out of an empty eye orbit a dozen more lay about in such a way that one could not tell by what path they had entered the body it needed no great help of imagination to read the story here of a starving lynx too famished to remember caution and of a dinner that cost a life  once also i saw a curious bit of animal education in connection with unk wunk two young owls had begun hunting under direction of the mother bird along the foot of a ridge in the early twilight from my canoe i saw one of the young birds swoop downward at something in the bushes on the shore an instant later the big mother owl followed with a sharp angry hoohoohoohoo of warning the youngster dropped into the bushes but the mother fairly knocked him away from his game in her fierce rush and led him away silently into the woods i went over on the instant and found a young porcupine in the bushes where the owl had swooped while two more were eating lily stems farther along the shore  evidently kookooskoos who swoops by instinct at everything that moves must be taught by wiser heads the wisdom of letting certain things severely alone  that he needs this lesson was clearly shown by an owl that my friend once shot at twilight there was a porcupine quill imbedded for nearly its entire length in his leg two more were slowly working their way into his body and the shaft of another projected from the corner of his mouth like a toothpick whether he were a young owl and untaught or whether driven by hunger he had thrown counsel to the winds and swooped at unk wunk will never be known that he should attack so large an animal as the porcupine would seem to indicate that like the lynx hunger had probably driven him beyond all consideration for his mothers teaching  unk wunk on his part knows so very little that it may fairly be doubted whether he ever had the discipline of the school of the woods whether he rolls himself into a chestnut bur by instinct as the possum plays dead or whether that is a matter of slow learning is yet to be discovered whether his dense stupidity which disarms his enemies and brings him safe out of a hundred dangers where wits would fail is like the possums blank idiocy only a mask for the deepest wisdom or whether he is quite as stupid as he acts and looks is also a question  more and more i incline to the former possibility he has learned unconsciously the strength of lying still a thousand generations of fat and healthy porcupines have taught him the folly of trouble and rush and worry in a world that somebody else has planned and for which somebody else is plainly responsible so he makes no effort and lives in profound peace but this also leaves you with a question which may take you overseas to explore hindu philosophy indeed if you have one question when you meet unk wunk for the first time you will have twenty after you have studied him for a season or two his paragraph in the woods journal begins and ends with a question mark and a dash for what is left unsaid  the only indication of deliberate plan and effort that i have ever noted in unk wunk was in regard to teaching two young ones the simple art of swimmingwhich porcupines by the way rarely use and for which there seems to be no necessity i was drifting along the shore in my canoe when i noticed a mother porcupine and two little ones a prickly pair indeed on a log that reached out into the lake she had brought them there to make her task of weaning them more easy by giving them a taste of lily buds when they had gathered and eaten all the buds and stems that they could reach she deliberately pushed both little ones into the water when they attempted to scramble back she pushed them off again and dropped in beside them and led them to a log farther down the shore where there were more lily pads  the numerous hollow quills floated them high in the water like so many corks and they paddled off with less effort than any other young animals that i have ever seen in the water but whether this were a swimming lesson or a rude direction to shift and browse for themselves is still a question with the exception of one solitary old genius who had an astonishing way of amusing himself and scaring all the other wood folk this was the only plain bit of forethought and sweet reasonableness that i have ever found in a porcupine  illustration     a lazy fellows fun  illustration   a new sound a purring rustle of leaves stopped me instantly as i climbed the beech ridge one late afternoon to see what wood folk i might surprise feeding on the rich mast prrrrush prrrrush a curious combination of the rustling of squirrels feet and the soft crackling purr of an eagles wings growing nearer clearer every instant i slipped quietly behind the nearest tree to watch and listen  something was coming down the hill but what it was not an animal running no animal that i knew unless he had gone suddenly crazy would ever make such a racket to tell everybody where he was it was not squirrels playing nor grouse scratching among the newfallen leaves their alternate rustlings and silences are unmistakable it was not a bear shaking down the ripe beechnutsnot heavy enough for that yet too heavy for the feet of any prowler of the woods to make on his stealthy hunting prrrrush swish thump something struck the stem of a bush heavily and brought down a rustling shower of leaves then out from under the low branches rolled something that i had never seen beforea heavy grayish ball as big as a halfbushel basket so covered over with leaves that one could not tell what was inside it was as if some one had covered a big kettle with glue and sent it rolling down the hill picking up dead leaves as it went so the queer thing tumbled past my feet purring crackling growing bigger and more ragged every moment as it gathered up more leaves till it reached the bottom of a sharp pitch and lay still  i stole after it cautiously suddenly it moved unrolled itself then out of the ragged mass came a big porcupine he shook himself stretched wobbled around a moment as if his long roll had made him dizzy then he meandered aimlessly along the foot of the ridge his quills stuck full of dead leaves looking big and strange enough to frighten anything that might meet him in the woods  here was a new trick a new problem concerning one of the stupidest of all the wood folk when you meet a porcupine and bother him he usually rolls himself into a huge pincushion with all its points outward covers his face with his thorny tail and lies still knowing well that you cannot touch him anywhere without getting the worst of it now had he been bothered by some animal and rolled himself up where it was so steep that he lost his balance and so tumbled unwillingly down the long hill or with his stomach full of sweet beechnuts had he rolled down lazily to avoid the trouble of walking or is unk wunk brighter than he looks to discover the joy of roller coasting and the fun of feeling dizzy afterwards  there was nothing on the hill above no rustle or suggestion of any hunting animal to answer the question so i followed unk wunk on his aimless wanderings along the foot of the ridge  a slight movement far ahead caught my eye and i saw a hare gliding and dodging among the brown ferns he came slowly in our direction hopping and halting and wiggling his nose at every bush till he heard our approach and rose on his hind legs to listen he gave a great jump as unk wunk hove into sight covered all over with the dead leaves that his barbed quills had picked up on his way downhill and lay quiet where he thought the ferns would hide him  the procession drew nearer moktaques full of curiosity lifted his head cautiously out of the ferns and sat up straight on his haunches again his paws crossed his eyes shining in fear and curiosity at the strange animal rustling along and taking the leaves with him for a moment wonder held him as still as the stump beside him then he bolted into the bush in a series of high scared jumps and i heard him scurrying crazily in a half circle around us  illustration  unk wunk gave no heed to the interruption but yewyawed hither and yon after his stupid nose like every other porcupine that i have followed he seemed to have nothing whatever to do and nowhere in the wide world to go he loafed along lazily too full to eat any of the beechnuts that he nosed daintily out of the leaves he tried a bit of bark here and there only to spit it out again once he started up the hill but it was too steep for a lazy fellow with a full stomach again he tried it but it was not steep enough to roll down afterwards suddenly he turned and came back to see who it was that followed him about  i kept very quiet and he brushed two or three times past my legs eyeing me sleepily then he took to nosing a beechnut from under my foot as if i were no more interesting than alexander was to diogenes  i had never made friends with a porcupinehe is too briery a fellow for intimaciesbut now with a small stick i began to search him gently wondering if under all that armor of spears and brambles i might not find a place where it would please him to be scratched at the first touch he rolled himself together all his spears sticking straight out on every side like a huge chestnut bur one could not touch him anywhere without being pierced by a dozen barbs gradually however as the stick touched him gently and searched out the itching spots under his armor he unrolled himself and put his nose under my foot again he did not want the beechnut but he did want to nose it out unk wunk is like a pig he has very few things to do besides eating but when he does start to go anywhere or do anything he always does it then i bent down to touch him with my hand  that was a mistake he felt the difference in the touch instantly also he smelled the salt in my hand for a taste of which unk wunk will put aside all his laziness and walk a mile if need be he tried to grasp the hand first with his paws then with his mouth but i had too much fear of his great cutting teeth to let him succeed instead i touched him behind the ears feeling my way gingerly through the thick tangle of spines testing them cautiously to see how easily they would pull out  the quills were very loosely set in and every arrowheaded barb was as sharp as a needle anything that pressed against them roughly would surely be pierced the spines would pull out of the skin and work their way rapidly into the unfortunate hand or paw or nose that touched them each spine was like a south sea islanders sword set for half its length with sharks teeth once in the flesh it would work its own way unless pulled out with a firm hand spite of pain and terrible laceration no wonder unk wunk has no fear or anxiety when he rolls himself into a ball protected at every point by such terrible weapons  the hand moved very cautiously as it went down his side within reach of unk wunks one swift weapon there were thousands of the spines rough as a saws edge crossing each other in every direction yet with every point outward unk wunk was irritated probably because he could not have the salt he wanted as the hand came within range his tail snapped back like lightning i was watching for the blow but was not half quick enough at the rustling snap like the voice of a steel trap i jerked my hand away two of his tail spines came with it and a dozen more were in my coat sleeve i jumped away as he turned and so escaped the quick double swing of his tail at my legs then he rolled into a chestnut bur again and proclaimed mockingly at every point touch me if you dare  i pulled the two quills with sharp jerks out of my hand pushed all the others through my coat sleeve and turned to unk wunk again sucking my wounded hand which pained me intensely all your own fault i kept telling myself to keep from whacking him across the nose his one vulnerable point with my stick  unk wunk on his part seemed to have forgotten the incident he unrolled himself slowly and loafed along the foot of the ridge his quills spreading and rustling as he went as if there were not such a thing as an enemy or an inquisitive man in all the woods  he had an idea in his head by this time and was looking for something as i followed close behind him he would raise himself against a small tree survey it solemnly for a moment or two and go on unsatisfied a breeze had come down from the mountain and was swaying all the treetops above him he would look up steadily at the tossing branches and then hurry on to survey the next little tree he met with paws raised against the trunk and dull eyes following the motion overhead  at last he found what he wantedtwo tall saplings growing close together and rubbing each other as the wind swayed them he climbed one of these clumsily higher and higher till the slender top bent with his weight towards the other then he reached out to grasp the second top with his fore paws hooked his hind claws firmly into the first and lay there binding the treetops together while the wind rose and began to rock him in his strange cradle  wider and wilder he swung now stretched out thin like a rubber string his quills lying hard and flat against his sides as the treetops separated in the wind now jammed up against himself as they came together again pressing him into a flat ring with spines sticking straight out like a chestnut bur that has been stepped upon and there he swayed for a full hour till it grew too dark to see him stretching contracting stretching contracting as if he were an accordion and the wind were playing him his only note meanwhile was an occasional squealing grunt of satisfaction after some particularly good stretch or when the motion changed and both trees rocked together in a wide wild exhilarating swing now and then the note was answered farther down the ridge by another porcupine going to sleep in his lofty cradle a storm was coming and unk wunk who is one of the woods best barometers to foretell the changing weather was crying it aloud where all might hear  so my question was answered unexpectedly unk wunk was out for fun that afternoon and had rolled down the hill for the joy of the swift motion and the dizzy feeling afterwards as other wood folk do i have watched young foxes whose den was on a steep hill side rolling down one after the other and sometime varying the programme by having one cub roll as fast as he could while another capered alongside snapping and worrying him in his brainmuddling tumble  that is all very well for foxes one expects to find such an idea in wise little heads but who taught unk wunk to roll downhill and stick his spines full of dry leaves to scare the wood folk and when did he learn to use the treetops for his swing and the wind for his motive power  perhapssince most of what the wood folk know is a matter of learning not of instincthis mother teaches him some things that we have never yet seen if so unk wunk has more in his sleepy stupid head than we have given him credit for and there is a very interesting lesson awaiting him who shall first find and enter the porcupine school  illustration     the partridges roll call  illustration   i was fishing one september afternoon in the pool at the foot of the lake trying in twenty ways as the dark evergreen shadows lengthened across the water to beguile some wary old trout into taking my flies they lived there a score of them in a dark well among the lily pads where a cold spring bubbled up from the bottom and their moods and humors were a perpetual source of worry or amusement according to the humor of the fisherman himself  for days at a time they would lie in the deep shade of the lily pads in stupid or sullen indifference then nothing tempted them flies worms crickets redfins bumblebeesall at the end of dainty hair leaders were drawn with crinkling wavelets over their heads or dropped gently beside them but they only swirled sullenly aside grouty as king ahab when he turned his face to the wall and would eat no bread  at such times scores of little fish swarmed out of the pads and ran riot in the pool chub shiners punkinseeds perch boiled up at your flies or chased each other in savage warfare through the forbidden water which seemed to intoxicate them by its cool freshness you had only to swing your canoe up near the shadowy edge of the pool and draw your cast once across the open water to know whether or not you would eat trout for breakfast if the small fish chased your flies then you might as well go home or study nature you would certainly get no trout but you could never tell when the change would come with the smallest occasion sometimesa coolness in the air the run of a catspaw breeze a cloud shadow drifting overa transformation would sweep over the speckled ahabs lying deep under the lily pads some blind unknown warning would run through the pool before ever a trout had changed his position looking over the side of your canoe you would see the little fish darting helterskelter away among the pads seeking safety in shallow water leaving the pool to its tyrant masters now is the time to begin casting your trout are ready to rise  a playful mood would often follow the testy humor the plunge of a threepound fish the slapdash of a dozen smaller ones would startle you into nervous casting but again you might as well spare your efforts which only served to acquaint the trout with the best frauds in your fly book they would rush at hackle or coachman or silver doctor swirl under it jump over it but never take it in they played with floating leaves their wonderful eyes caught the shadow of a passing mosquito across the silver mirror of their roof and their broad tails flung them up to intercept it but they wanted nothing more than play or exercise and they would not touch your flies  once in a way there would come a day when your study and patience found their rich reward the slish of a line the flutter of a fly dropping softly on the farther edge of the pooland then the shriek of your reel buzzing up the quiet hillside was answered by a loud snort as the deer that lived there bounded away in alarm calling her two fawns to follow but you scarcely noticed your head and hands were too full trying to keep the big trout away from the lily pads where you would certainly lose him with your light tackle  on the afternoon of which i write the trout were neither playful nor sullen no more were they hungry the first cast of my midget flies across the pool brought no answer that was good the little fish had been ordered out evidently larger flies followed but the big trout neither played with them nor let them alone they followed cautiously a foot astern to the near edge of the lily pads till they saw me and swirled down again to their cool haunts they were suspicious clearly and with the lower orders as with men the best rule in such a case is to act naturally with more quietness than usual and give them time to get over their suspicion  as i waited my flies resting among the pads near the canoe curious sounds came floating down the hillsideprut prut prrrrt whitkwit whitkwit prrrt prrrt oooit oooit prrreeee this last with a swift burr of wings and the curious sounds half questioning half muffled in extreme caution gave a fleeting impression of gliding in and out among the tangled underbrush a flock of partridgesruffed grouse i thought and turned to listen more intently  the shadows had grown long with a suggestion of coming night and other ears than mine had heard the sounds with interest a swifter shadow fell on the water and i looked up quickly to see a big owl sail silently out from the opposite hill and perch on a blasted stub overlooking the pool kookooskoos had been sleeping in a dark spruce when the sounds waked him and he started out instantly not to huntit was still too brightbut to locate his game and follow silently to the roosting place near which he would hide and wait till the twilight fell darkly i could see it all in his attitude as he poised forward swinging his round head to and fro like a dog on an air trail locating the flock accurately before he should take another flight  up on the hillside the eager sounds had stopped for a moment as if some strange sixth sense had warned the birds to be silent the owl was puzzled but i dared not move because he was looking straight over me some faint sound too faint for my ears made him turn his head and on the instant i reached for the tiny rifle lying before me in the canoe just as he spread his wings to investigate the new sound the little rifle spoke and he tumbled heavily to the shore  one robber the less i was thinking when the canoe swung slightly on the water there was a heavy plunge a vicious rush of my unheeded line and i seized my rod to find myself fast to a big trout which had been watching my flies from his hiding among the lily pads till his suspicions were quieted and the first slight movement brought him up with a rush  ten minutes later he lay in my canoe where i could see him plainly to my hearts content i was waiting for the pool to grow quiet again when a new sound came from the underbrush a rapid plop lop lop lop lop like the sound in a sunken bottle as water pours in and the air rushes out  there was a brook near the sounds a lazy little stream that had lost itself among the alders and forgotten all its music and my first thought was that some animal was standing in the water to drink and waking the voice of the brook as the current rippled past his legs the canoe glided over to find out what he was when in the midst of the sounds came the unmistakable whitkwit of partridgesand there they were just vanishing glimpses of alert forms and keen eyes gliding among the tangled alder stems when near the brook they had changed the soft gossipy chatter by which a flock holds itself together in the wild tangle of the burned lands into a curious liquid sound so like the gurgling of water by a mossy stone that it would have deceived me completely had i not seen the birds it was as if they tried to remind the little alder brook of the music it had lost far back among the hills  now i had been straitly charged on leaving camp to bring back three partridges for our sunday dinner my own little flock had grown a bit tired of trout and canned foods and a taste of young broiled grouse which i had recently given them had left them hungry for more so i left the pool and my fishing rod just as the trout began to rise to glide into the alders with my pocket rifle  there were at least a dozen birds there fullgrown and strong of wing that had not yet decided to scatter to the four winds as had most of the coveys which one might meet on the burned lands all summer long while berries are plenty the flocks hold together finding ten pairs of quiet eyes much better protection against surprises than one frightened pair each flock is then under the absolute authority of the mother bird and one who follows them gets some curious and intensely interesting glimpses of a partridges education if the mother bird is killed by owl or hawk or weasel the flock still holds together while berries last under the leadership of one of their own number more bold or cunning than the others but with the ripening autumn when the birds have learned or think they have learned all the sights and sounds and dangers of the wilderness the covey scatters partly to cover a wider range in feeding as food grows scarcer partly in natural revolt at maternal authority which no bird or animal likes to endure after he has once learned to take care of himself  i followed the flock rapidly though cautiously through an interminable tangle of alders that bordered the little stream and learned some things about them though they gave me no chance whatever for a rifle shot the mother was gone their leader was a foxy bird the smallest of the lot who kept them moving in dense cover running crouching hiding inquisitive about me and watching me yet keeping themselves beyond reach of harm all the while the leader talked to them a curious language of cheepings and whistlings and they answered back with questions or sharp exclamations as my head appeared in sight for a moment where the cover was densest they waited till i was almost upon them before they whisked out of sight and where there was a bit of opening they whirred up noisily on strong wings or sailed swiftly away from a fallen log with the noiseless flight that a grouse knows so well how to use when the occasion comes  already the instinct to scatter was at work among them during the day they had probably been feeding separately along the great hillside but with lengthening shadows they came together again to face the wilderness night in the peace and security of the old companionship and i had fortunately been quiet enough at my fishing to hear when the leader began to call them together and they had answered here and there from their feeding  i gave up following them after a whilethey were too quick for me in the alder tangleand came out of the swamp to the ridge there i ran along a deer path and circled down ahead of them to a thicket of cedar where i thought they might pass the night  presently i heard them comingwhitkwit prrr prrr prut prutand saw five or six of them running rapidly the little leader saw me at the same instant and dodged back out of sight most of his flock followed him but one bird more inquisitive than the rest jumped to a fallen log drew himself up straight as a string and eyed me steadily the little rifle spoke at his head promptly and i stowed him away comfortably a fine plump bird in a big pocket of my hunting shirt  at the report another partridge questioning the unknown sound flew to a thick spruce pressed close against the trunk to hide himself and stood listening intently whether he was waiting to hear the sound again or was frightened and listening for the call of the leader i could not tell i fired at his head quickly and saw him sail down against the hillside with a loud thump and a flutter of feathers behind him to tell me that he was hard hit  i followed him up the hill hearing an occasional flutter of wings to guide my feet till the sounds vanished into a great tangle of underbrush and fallen trees i searched here ten minutes or more in vain then listened in the vast silence for a longer period but the bird had hidden himself away in some hole or covert where an owl might pass by without finding him reluctantly i turned away toward the swamp  close beside me was a fallen log on my right was another and the two had fallen so as to make the sides of a great angle their tops resting together against the hill between the two were several huge trees growing among the rocks and underbrush i climbed upon one of these fallen trees and moved along it cautiously some eight or ten feet above the ground looking down searchingly for a stray brown feather to guide me to my lost partridge  suddenly the log under my feet began to rock gently i stopped in astonishment looking for the cause of the strange teetering but there was nothing on the log beside myself after a moment i went on again looking again for my partridge again the log rocked heavily this time almost throwing me off then i noticed that the tip of the other log which lay balanced across a great rock was under the tip of my log and was being pried up by something on the other end some animal was there and it flashed upon me suddenly that he was heavy enough to lift my weight with his stout lever i stole along so as to look behind a great treeand there on the other log not twenty feet away a big bear was standing twisting himself uneasily trying to decide whether to go on or go back on his unstable footing  he discovered me at the instant that my face appeared behind the tree such surprise such wonder i have seldom seen in an animals face for a long moment he met my eyes steadily with his then he began to twist again while the logs rocked up and down again he looked at the strange animal on the other log but the face behind the tree had not moved nor changed the eyes looked steadily into his with a startled movement he plunged off into the underbrush and but for a swift grip on a branch the sudden lurch would have sent me off backward among the rocks as he jumped i heard a swift flutter of wings i followed it timidly not knowing where the bear was and in a moment i had the second partridge stowed away comfortably with his brother in my hunting shirt  the rest of the flock had scattered widely by this time i found one or two and followed them but they dodged away into the thick alders where i could not find their heads quick enough with my rifle sight after a vain hasty shot or two i went back to my fishing  woods and lake were soon quiet again the trout had stopped rising in one of their sudden moods a vast silence brooded over the place unbroken by any buzz of my noisy reel and the twilight shadows were growing deeper and longer when the soft gliding questioning chatter of partridges came floating out of the alders the leader was there in the thickest tanglei had learned in an hour to recognize his peculiar prut prutand from the hillside and the alder swamp and the big evergreens his scattered flock were answering here a kwit and there a prut and beyond a swift burr of wings all drawing closer and closer together  i had still a third partridge to get for my own hungry flock so i stole swiftly back into the alder swamp there i found a little game path and crept along it on hands and knees drawing cautiously near to the leaders continued calling  illustration they would turn their heads and listen intently  in the midst of a thicket of low black alders surrounded by a perfect hedge of bushes i found him at last he was on the lower end of a fallen log gliding rapidly up and down spreading wings and tail and budding ruff as if he were drumming and sending out his peculiar call at every pause above him in a long line on the same log five other partridges were sitting perfectly quiet save now and then when an answer came to the leaders call they would turn their heads and listen intently till the underbrush parted cautiously and another bird flitted up beside them then another call and from the distant hillside a faint kwitkwit and a rush of wings in answer and another partridge would shoot in on swift pinions to pull himself up on the log beside his fellows the line would open hospitably to let him in then the row grew quiet again as the leader called turning their heads from side to side for the faint answers  there were nine on the log at last the calling grew louder and louder yet for several minutes now no answer came back the flock grew uneasy the leader ran from his log into the brush and back again calling loudly while a low chatter the first break in their strange silence ran back and forth through the family on the log there were others to come but where were they and why did they tarry it was growing late already an owl had hooted and the roosting place was still far away prut prut prrrreee called the leader and the chatter ceased as the whole flock listened  i turned my head to the hillside to listen also for the laggards but there was no answer save for the cry of a lowflying loon and the snap of a twigtoo sharp and heavy for little feet to makethe woods were all silent as i turned to the log again something warm and heavy rested against my side then i knew and with the knowledge came a swift thrill of regret that made me feel guilty and out of place in the silent woods the leader was calling the silent flock were waiting for two of their number who would never answer the call again  i lay scarcely ten yards from the log on which the sad little drama went on in the twilight shadows while the great silence grew deep and deeper as if the wilderness itself were in sympathy and ceased its cries to listen once at the first glimpse of the group i had raised my rifle and covered the head of the largest bird but curiosity to know what they were doing held me back now a deeper feeling had taken its place the rifle slid from my hand and lay unnoticed among the fallen leaves  again the leader called the flock drew itself up like a row of graybrown statues every eye bright every ear listening till some vague sense of fear and danger drew them together and they huddled on the ground in a close group all but the leader who stood above them counting them over and over apparently and anon sending his cry out into the darkening woods  i took one of the birds out of my pocket and began to smooth the rumpled brown feathers how beautiful he was how perfectly adapted in form and color for the wilderness in which he had lived and i had taken his life the only thing he had its beauty and something deeper which is the sad mystery of all life were gone forever all summer long he had run about on glad little feet delighting in natures abundance calling brightly to his fellows as they glided in and out in eager search through the lights and shadows fear on the one hand absolute obedience to his mother on the other had been the two great factors of his life between them he grew strong keen alert knowing perfectly when to run and when to fly and when to crouch motionless as danger passed close with blinded eyes then when his strength was perfect and he glided alone through the wilderness coverts in watchful selfdependencea moments curiosity a quick eager glance at the strange animal standing so still under the cedar a flash a noise and all was over the call of the leader went searching searching through the woods but he gave no heed any more  the hand had grown suddenly very tender as it stroked his feathers i had taken his life i must try to answer for him now at the thought i raised my head and gave the clear whitkwit of a running partridge instantly the leader answered the flock sprang to the log again and turned their heads in my direction to listen another call and now the flock dropped to the ground and lay close while the leader drew himself up straight on the log and became part of a dead stub beside him  something was wrong in my call the birds were suspicious knowing not what danger had kept their fellows silent so long and now threatened them out of the black alders a moments intent listening then the leader stepped slowly down from his log and came towards me cautiously halting hiding listening gliding swinging far out to one side and back again in stealthy advance till he drew himself up abruptly at sight of my face peering out of the underbrush for a long two minutes he never stirred so much as an eyelid then he glided swiftly back with a faint puzzled questioning kwitkwit to where his flock were waiting a low signal that i could barely hear a swift movementthen the flock thundered away in scattered flight into the silent friendly woods  ten minutes later i was crouched in some thick underbrush looking up into a great spruce when i could just make out the leader standing by an upright branch in sharp silhouette against the glowing west i had followed his swift flight and now lay listening again to his searching call as it went out through the twilight calling his little flock to the roosting tree from the swamp and the hillside and far down by the quiet lake they answered faintly at first then with clearer call and the whirr of swift wings as they came in  but already i had seen and heard enough too much indeed for my peace of mind i crept away through the swamp the eager calls following me even to my canoe first a plaint as if something were lacking to the placid lake and quiet woods and the soft beauty of twilight and then a faint question always heard in the kwit of a partridge as if only i could explain why two eager voices would never again answer to roll call when the shadows lengthened  illustration     umquenawis the mighty  illustration   umquenawis the mighty is lord of the woodlands none other among the wood folk is half so great as he none has senses so keen to detect a danger nor powers so terrible to defend himself against it so he fears nothing moving through the big woods like a master and when you see him for the first time in the wilderness pushing his stately silent way among the giant trees or plunging like a great engine through underbrush and over windfalls his nose up to try the wind his broad antlers far back on his mighty shoulders while the dead tree that opposes him cracks and crashes down before his rush and the alders beat a rattling snapping tattoo on his branching hornswhen you see him thus something within you rises up like a soldier at salute and says milord the moose and though the rifle is in your hand its deadly muzzle never rises from the trail  illustration plunging like a great engine through underbrush and over windfalls  that great head with its massive crown is too big for any house hung stupidly on a wall in a room full of bricabrac as you usually see it with its shriveled ears that were once living trumpets its bulging eyes that were once so small and keen and its huge muzzle stretched out of all proportion it is but misplaced misshapen ugliness it has no more and scarcely any higher significance than a scalp on the pole of a savages wigwam only in the wilderness with the irresistible push of his twelvehundred pound forcepacked body behind it the crackling underbrush beneath and the lofty spruce aisles towering overhead can it give the tingling impression of magnificent power which belongs to umquenawis the mighty in his native wilds there only is his head at home and only as you see it there whether looking out in quiet majesty from a lonely point over a silent lake or leading him in his terrific rush through the startled forest will your heart ever jump and your nerves tingle in that swift thrill which stirs the sluggish blood to your very finger tips and sends you quietly back to camp with your soul at peacewell satisfied to leave umquenawis where he is rather than pack him home to your admiring friends in a freight car  though umquenawis be lord of the wilderness there are two things and two things only which he sometimes fears the smell of man and the spiteful crack of a rifle for milord the moose has been hunted and has learned fear which formerly he was stranger to but when you go deep into the wilderness where no hunter has ever gone and where the bang of a rifle following the roar of a birchbark trumpet has never broken the twilight stillness there you may find him still as he was before fear came there he will come smashing down the mountain side at your call and never circle to wind an enemy and there when the mood is on him he will send you scrambling up the nearest tree for your life as a squirrel goes when the fox is after him once in such a mood i saw him charge a little wiry guide who went up a spruce tree with his snowshoes on and never a bear did the trick quicker spite of the fourfoot webs in which his feet were tangled  we were pushing upstream late one afternoon to the big lake at the headwaters of a wilderness river above the roar of rapids far behind and the fret of the current near at hand the rhythmical clunk clunk of the poles and the lap lap of my little canoe as she breasted the ripples were the only sounds that broke the forest stillness we were silent as men always are to whom the woods have spoken their deepest message and to whom the next turn of the river may bring its thrill of unexpected things  suddenly as the bow of our canoe shot round a point we ran plump upon a big cow moose crossing the river at simmos grunt of surprise she stopped short and whirled to face us and there she stood one huge question mark from nose to tail while the canoe edged in to the lee of a great rock and hung there quivering with poles braced firmly on the bottom  we were already late for camping and the lake was still far ahead i gave the word at last after a few minutes silent watching and the canoe shot upward but the big moose instead of making off into the woods as a wellbehaved moose ought to do splashed straight toward us simmo in the bow gave a sweeping flourish of his pole and we all yelled in unison but the moose came on steadily quietly bound to find out what the queer thing was that had just come up river and broken the solemn stillness  bes keep still big moose makeum trouble sometime muttered noel behind me and we dropped back silently into the lee of the friendly rock to watch awhile longer and let the big creature do as she would  for ten minutes more we tried every kind of threat and persuasion to get the moose out of the way ending at last by sending a bullet zipping into the water under her body but beyond an angry stamp of the foot there was no response and no disposition whatever to give us the stream then i bethought me of a trick that i had discovered long before by accident dropping down to the nearest bank i crept up behind the moose hidden in the underbrush and began to break twigs softly at first then more and more sharply as if something were coming through the woods fearlessly at the first suspicious crack the moose whirled hesitated started nervously across the stream twitching her nostrils and wigwagging her big ears to find out what the crackle meant and hurrying more and more as the sounds grated harshly upon her sensitive nerves next moment the river was clear and our canoe was breasting the rippling shallows while the moose watched us curiously half hidden in the alders  that is a good trick for occasions the animals all fear twig snapping only never try it at night with a bull in the calling season as i did once unintentionally then he is apt to mistake you for his tantalizing mate and come down on you like a tempest giving you a big scare and a monkey scramble into the nearest tree before he is satisfied  within the next hour i counted seven moose old and young from the canoe and when we ran ashore at twilight to the camping ground on the big lake the tracks of an enormous bull were drawn sharply across our landing the water was still trickling into them showing that he had just vacated the spot at our approach  how do i know it was a bull at this season the bulls travel constantly and the points of the hoofs are worn to a clean even curve the cows which have been living in deep retirement all summer teaching their ungainly calves the sounds and smells and lessons of the woods travel much less their hoofs in consequence are generally long and pointed and overgrown  two miles above our camp was a little brook with an alder swale on one side and a dark gloomy spruce tangle on the otheran ideal spot for a moose to keep her little school i thought when i discovered the place a few days later there were tracks on the shore plenty of them and i knew i had only to watch long enough to see the mother and her calf and to catch a glimpse perhaps of what no man has ever yet seen clearly that is a moose teaching her little one how to hide his bulk how to move noiselessly and undiscovered through underbrush where one would think a fox must make his presence known how to take a windfall on the run how to breast down a young birch or maple tree and keep it under his body while he feeds on the topand a score of other things that every moose must know before he is fit to take care of himself in the big woods  i went there one afternoon in my canoe grasped a few lily stems to hold the little craft steady and snuggled down till only my head showed above the gunwales so as to make canoe and man look as much like an old windblown log as possible it was getting toward the hour when i knew the cow would be hungry but while it was yet too light to bring her little one to the open shore after an hours watching the cow came cautiously down the brook she stopped short at sight of the floating log watched it steadily for two or three minutes wigwagging her ears then began to feed greedily on the lily pads that fringed all the shore when she went back i followed guided now by the crack of a twig now by a swaying of brush tops now by the flip of a nervous ear or the push of a huge dark body keeping carefully to leeward all the time and making the big unconscious creature guide me to where she had hidden her little one  just above me and a hundred yards in from the shore a tree had fallen its bushy top bending down two small spruces and making a low den so dark that an owl could scarcely have seen what was inside thats the spot i told myself instantly but the mother passed well above it without noting apparently how good a place it was fifty yards farther on she turned and circled back below the spot trying the wind with ears and nose as she came on straight towards me  aha the old moose trick i thought remembering how a hunted moose never lies down to rest without first circling back for a long distance parallel to his trail and to leeward to find out from a safe distance whether anything is following him when he lies down at last it will be close beside his trail but hidden from it so that he hears or smells you as you go by and when you reach the place far ahead where he turned back he will be miles away plunging along down wind at a pace that makes your snowshoe swing like a babys toddle so you camp where he lay down and pick up the trail in the morning  when the big cow turned and came striding back i knew that i should find her little one in the spruce den but would she not find me instead and drive me out of her bailiwick you can never be sure what a moose will do if she finds you near her calf generally they runalways in factbut sometimes they run your way and besides i had been trying for years to see a mother moose teaching in her little school now i dropped on all fours and crawled away down wind so as to get beyond ken of the mothers inquisitive nose if possible  she came on steadily moving with astonishing silence through the tangle till she stood where i had been a moment before when she started violently and threw her head up into the wind some scent of me was there clinging faintly to the leaves and the moist earth for a moment she stood like a rock sifting the air in her nose then finding nothing in the wind she turned slowly in my direction to use her ears and eyes i was lying very still behind a mossy log by this time and she did not see me suddenly she turned and called a low bleat there was an instant stir in the spruce den an answering bleat and a moose calf scrambled out and ran straight to the mother there was an unvoiced command to silence that no human sense could understand the mother put her great head down to earthsmell of that mark that and remember she was saying in her own way and the calf put his little head down beside hers and i heard him sniffsniffing the leaves then the mother swung her head savagely bunted the little fellow out of his tracks and drove him hurriedly ahead of her away from the placeget out hurry danger was what she was saying now and emphasizing her teaching with an occasional bunt from behind that lifted the calf over the hard places so they went up the hill the calf wondering and curious yet ever reminded by the hard head at his flank that obedience was his business just now the mother turning occasionally to sniff and listen till they vanished silently among the dark spruces  for a week or more i haunted the spot but though i saw the pair occasionally in the woods or on the shore i learned no more of umquenawis secrets the moose schools are kept in faraway shady dingles beyond reach of inquisitive eyes then one morning at daylight as my canoe shot round a grassy point there were the mother and her calf standing kneedeep among the lily pads with a yell i drove the canoe straight at the little one  now it takes a young moose or caribou a long time to learn that when sudden danger threatens he is to follow not his own frightened head but his mothers guiding tail to young fawns this is practically the first thing taught by the mothers but caribou are naturally stupid or trustful or burningly inquisitive according to their several dispositions and moose with their great strength are naturally fearless so that this needful lesson is slowly learned if you surprise a mother moose or caribou with her young at close quarters and rush at them instantly with a whoop or two to scatter their wits the chances are that the mother will bolt into the brush where safety lies and the calf into the lake or along the shore where the going is easiest  several times i have caught young moose and caribou in this way either swimming or stogged in the mud and after turning them back to shore have watched the mothers cautious return and her treatment of the lost one once i paddled up beside a young bull moose half grown and grasping the coarse hair on his back had him tow me a hundred yards to the next point while i studied his expression  as my canoe shot up to the two moose they did exactly what i had expected the mother bolted for the woods in mighty floundering jumps mud and water flying merrily about her while the calf darted along the shore got caught in the lily pads and with a despairing bleat settled down in the mud of a soft place up to his back and turned his head to see what i was  i ran my canoe ashore and approached the little fellow quietly without hurry or excitement nose eyes and ears questioned me and his fear gradually changed to curiosity as he saw how harmless a thing had frightened him he even tried to pull his awkward little legs out of the mud in my direction meanwhile the big mother moose was thrashing around in the bushes in a terrible swither calling her calf to come  i had almost reached the little fellow when the wind brought him the strong scent that he had learned in the woods a few days before and he bleated sharply there was an answering crash of brush a pounding of hoofs that told one unmistakably to look out for his rear and out of the bushes burst the mother her eyes red as a wild pigs and the long hair standing straight up along her back in a terrifying bristle stand not upon the order of your mogging but mog at onceeeeunh unh she grunted and i turned otter instantly and took to the lake diving as soon as the depth allowed and swimming under water to escape the old furys attention there was little need of fine tactics however as i found out when my head appeared again cautiously anything in the way of an unceremonious retreat of the enemy satisfied her as perfectly as if she had been a boer general she went straight to her calf thrust her great head under his belly hiked him roughly out of the mud and then butted him ahead of her into the bushes  it was stern rough discipline but the youngster needed it to teach him the wisdom of the woods from a distance i watched the quivering line of brush tops that marked their course and then followed softly when i found them again in the twilight of the great spruces the mother was licking the sides of her calf lest he should grow cold too suddenly after his unwonted bath all the fury and harshness were gone her great head lowered tenderly over the foolish ungainly youngster tonguing him caressing him drying and warming his poor sides telling him in mother language that it was all right now and that next time he would do better                                       there were other moose on the lake all of them as uncertain as the big cow and her calf probably most of them had never seen a man before our arrival and it kept ones expectations on tiptoe to know what they would do when they saw the strange twolegged creature for the first time if a moose smelled me before i saw him he would make off quietly into the woods as all wild creatures do and watch from a safe distance but if i stumbled upon him unexpectedly when the wind brought no warning to his nostrils he was fearless usually and full of curiosity  the worst of them all was the big bull whose tracks were on the shore when we arrived he was a morose ugly old brute living apart by himself with his temper always on edge ready to bully anything that dared to cross his path or question his lordship whether he was an outcast grown surly from living too much alone or whether he bore some old bullet wound to account for his hostility to man i could never find out far down the river a hunter had been killed ten years before by a bull moose that he had wounded and this may have been as noel declared the same animal cherishing his resentment with a memory as merciless as an indians  before we had found this out i stumbled upon the big bull one afternoon and came near paying the penalty of my ignorance i had been stillfishing for togue lake trout and was on my way back to camp when doubling a point i ran plump upon a bull moose feeding among the lily pads my approach had been perfectly silentthat is the only way to see things in the woodsand he was quite unconscious that anybody but himself was near  he would plunge his great head under water till only his antler tips showed and nose around on the bottom till he found a lily root with a heave and a jerk he would drag it out and stand chewing it endwise with huge satisfaction while the muddy water trickled down over his face when it was all eaten he would grope under the lily pads for another root in the same way  without thinking much of the possible risk i began to steal towards him while his head was under i would work the canoe along silently simply rolling the paddle without lifting it from the water at the first lift of his antlers i would stop and sit low in the canoe till he finished his juicy morsel and ducked for more then one could slip along easily again without being discovered  two or three times this was repeated successfully and still the big unconscious brute facing away from me fortunately had no idea that he was being watched his head went under water againnot so deep this time but i was too absorbed in the pretty game to notice that he had found the end of a root above the mud and that his ears were out of water a ripple from the bow of my canoe or perhaps the faint brush of a lily leaf against the side reached him his head burst out of the pads unexpectedly with a snort and a mighty flounder he whirled upon me and there he stood quivering ears eyes noseeverything about him reaching out to me and shooting questions at my head with an insistence that demanded instant answer  i kept quiet though i was altogether too near the big brute for comfort till an unfortunate breeze brushed the bow of my canoe still nearer to where he stood threatening now instead of questioning the mane on his back began to bristle and i knew that i had but a small second in which to act to get speed i swung the bow of the canoe outward instead of backing away the movement brought me a trifle nearer yet gave me a chance to shoot by him at the first sudden motion he leaped the red fire blazed out in his eyes and he plunged straight at the canoeone two splashing jumps and the huge velvet antlers were shaking just over me and the deadly fore foot was raised for a blow  i rolled over on the instant startling the brute with a yell as i did so and upsetting the canoe between us there was a splintering crack behind me as i struck out for deep water when i turned at a safe distance the bull had driven one sharp hoof through the bottom of the upturned canoe and was now trying awkwardly to pull his leg out from the clinging cedar ribs he seemed frightened at the queer dumb thing that gripped his foot for he grunted and jumped back and thrashed his big antlers in excitement but he was getting madder every minute  to save the canoe from being pounded to pieces was now the only pressing business on hand all other considerations took to the winds in the thought that if the bulls fury increased and he leaped upon the canoe as he does when he means to kill one jump would put the frail thing beyond repair and we should have to face the dangerous river below in a spruce bark of our own building i swam quickly to the shore and splashed and shouted and then ran away to attract the bulls attention he came after me on the instantunh unh chock chocketychock till he was close enough for discomfort when i took to water again the bull followed deeper and deeper till his sides were awash the bottom was muddy and he trod gingerly but there was no fear of his swimming after me he knows his limits and they stop him shoulder deep  when he would follow no farther i swam to the canoe and tugged it out into deep water umquenawis stood staring now in astonishment at the sight of this queer manfish the red light died out of his eyes for the first time and his ears wigwagged like flags in the wind he made no effort to follow but stood as he was shoulder deep staring wondering till i landed on the point above whipped the canoe over and spilled the water out of it  the paddle was still fast to its cordas it should always be in trying experimentsand i tossed it into the canoe the rattle roused umquenawis from his wonder as if he had heard the challenging clack of antlers on the alder stems he floundered out in mighty jumps and came swinging along the shore chocking and grunting fiercely he had seen the man again and knew it was no fishunh unh eeeeeunhunh he grunted with a twisting jerky wriggle of his neck and shoulders at the last squeal as if he felt me already beneath his hoofs but before he reached the point i had stuffed my flannel shirt into the hole in the canoe and was safely afloat once more he followed along the shore till he heard the sound of voices at camp when he turned instantly and vanished in the woods  a few days later i saw the grumpy old brute again in a curious way i was sweeping the lake with my field glasses when i saw what i thought was a pair of black ducks near a grassy shore i paddled over watching them keenly till a root seemed to rise out of the water between them before i could get my glasses adjusted again they had disappeared i dropped the glasses and paddled faster they were diving perhapsan unusual thing for black ducksand i might surprise them there they were again and there again was the old root bobbing up unexpectedly between them i whipped my glasses upthe mystery vanished the two ducks were the tips of umquenawis big antlers the root that rose between them was his head as he came up to breathe  it was a close sultry afternoon the flies and mosquitos were out in myriads and umquenawis had taken a philosophical way of getting rid of them he was lying in the water over a bed of mud his body completely submerged as the swarm of flies that pestered him rose to his head he would sink it slowly drowning them off through my glass as i drew near i could see a cloud of them hovering above the wavelets or covering the exposed antlers after a few moments there would be a bubbling grumble down in the mud as umquenawis blew the air from his great lungs his head would come up lazily to breathe among the popping bubbles the flies would settle upon him like a cloud and he would disappear again blinking sleepily as he went down with an air of immense satisfaction  it seemed too bad to disturb such comfort but i wanted to know more about the surly old tyrant that had treated me with such scant courtesy so i stole near him again running up when his head disappeared and lying quiet whenever he came up to breathe he saw me at last when i was quite near and leaped up with a terrible start there was fear in his eyes this time here was the manfish again the creature that lived on land or water and that could approach him so silently that the senses in which he had always trusted gave him no warning he stared hard for a moment then as the canoe glided rapidly straight towards him without fear or hesitation he waded out stopping every instant to turn and look and try the wind till he reached the fringe of woods beyond the grasses there he thrust his nose up ahead of him laid his big antlers back on his shoulders and plowed straight through the tangle like a great engine the alders snapping and crashing merrily about him as he went  in striking contrast was the next meeting i was out at midnight jacking and passed close by a point where i had often seen the big bulls tracks he was not there and i closed the jack and went on along the shore listening for any wood folk that might be abroad when i came back a few minutes later there was a suspicious ripple on the point i opened the jack and there was umquenawis my big bull standing out huge and magnificent against the shadowy background his eyes glowing and flashing in fierce wonder at the sudden brightness he had passed along the shore within twenty yards of me through dense underbrushas i found out from his tracks next morningyet so silently did he push his great bulk through the trees halting listening trying the ground at every step for telltale twigs ere he put his weight down that i had heard no sound though i was listening intently in the dead hush that was on the lake  it may have been curiosity or the uncomfortable sense of being watched and followed by the manfish who neither harmed nor feared him that brought umquenawis at last to our camp to investigate one day noel was washing some clothes of mine in the lake when some subtle warning made him turn his head there stood the big bull half hidden by the dwarf spruces watching him intently on the instant noel left the duds where they were and bolted along the shore under the bushes calling me loudly to come quick and bring my rifle when we went back umquenawis had trodden the clothes into the mud and vanished as silently as he came  the indians grew insistent at this telling me of the hunter that had been killed claiming now beyond a doubt that this was the same bull and urging me to kill the ugly brute and rid the woods of a positive danger but umquenawis was already learning the fear of me and i thought the lesson might be driven home before the summer was ended so it was but before that time there was almost a tragedy  one day a timber cruisera lonely silent man with the instincts of an animal for finding his way in the woods whose business it is to go over timber lands to select the best sites for future cuttingcame up to the lake and not knowing that we were there pitched by a spring a mile or two below us i saw the smoke of his camp fire from the lake where i was fishing and wondered who had come into the great solitude that was in the morning towards twilight i went down to bid the stranger welcome and to invite him to share our camp if he would i found him stiff and sore by his fire eating rawpork sandwiches with the appetite of a wolf almost at the same glance i saw the ground about a tree torn up and the hoof marks of a big bull moose all about  hello friend whats up i hailed him  got a rifle he demanded with a rich irish burr in his voice paying no heed to my question when i nodded he bolted for my canoe grabbed my rifle and ran away into the woods  queer dick unbalanced perhaps by living too much alone in the woods i thought and took to examining the torn ground and the bulls tracks to find out for myself what had happened  but there was no queerness in the frank kindly face that met mine when the stranger came out of the bush a half hour later  th ould baste hes had me perrched up in that three there like a blackburrd the last tin hours an niver a song in me throat or a bite in me stomach he wint just as you camei thought i could returrn his compliments wid a bullet he said apologetically as he passed me back the rifle  then sitting by his fire he told me his story he had just lit his fire that morning and was taking off his wet stockings to dry them when there was a fierce crashing and grunting behind him and a bull moose charged out of the bushes like a fury the cruiser jumped and dodged then as the bull whirled again he swung himself into a tree and sat there astride a limb while the bull grunted and pushed and hammered the ground below with his sharp hoofs all day long the moose had kept up the siege now drawing off cunningly to hide in the bushes now charging out savagely as the timber cruiser made effort to come down from his uncomfortable perch  a few minutes before my approach a curious thing happened which seems to indicate as do many other things in the woods that certain animalsperhaps all animals including manhave at times an unknown sixth sense for which there is no name and no explanation i was still half a mile or more away hidden by a point and paddling silently straight into the wind no possible sight or sound or smell of me could have reached any known sense of any animal yet the big brute began to grow uneasy he left his stand under the tree and circled nervously around it looking listening wigwagging his big ears trying the wind at every step and setting his hoofs down as if he trod on dynamite suddenly he turned and vanished silently into the brush mcgarven the timber cruiser who had no idea that there was any man but himself on the lake watched the bull with growing wonder and distrust thinking him possessed of some evil demon in his long life in the woods he had met hundreds of moose but had never been molested before  illustration  with the rifle at full cock and his heart hot within him he had followed the trail which stole away cautiously at first a long swinging stride straight towards the mountainoh tis the quare baste he is altogether he said as he finished his story     at the sound of the trumpet  illustration   it was now near the calling season and the nights grew keen with excitement now and then as i fished or followed the brooks or prowled through the woods in the late afternoon the sudden bellow of a cow moose would break upon the stillness so strange and uncertain in the thick coverts that i could rarely describe much less imitate the sound or even tell the direction whence it had come under the dusk of the lake shore i would sometimes come upon a pair of the huge animals the cow restless wary impatient the bull now silent as a shadow now ripping and rasping the torn velvet from his great antlers among the alders and now threatening and browbeating every living thing that crossed his trail and even the unoffending bushes in his testy humor  one night i went to the landing just below my tent with simmo and tried for the first time the long call of the cow moose he and noel refused absolutely to give it unless i should agree to shoot the ugly old bull at sight several times of late they had seen him near our camp or had crossed his deep trail on the nearer shores and they were growing superstitious as well as fearful  there was no answer to our calling for the space of an hour silence brooded like a living watchful thing over sleeping lake and forest a silence that grew only deeper and deeper after the last echoes of the bark trumpet had rolled back on us from the distant mountain suddenly simmo lowered the horn just as he had raised it to his lips for a call  moose near he whispered  how do you know i breathed for i had heard nothing  don know how just know he said sullenly an indian hates to be questioned as a wild animal hates to be watched as if in confirmation of his opinion there was a startling crash and plunge across the little bay over against us and a bull moose leaped the bank into the lake within fifty yards of where we crouched on the shore  shoot shootum quick cried simmo and the fear of the old bull was in his voice  for answer there came a grunt from the moosea ridiculously small squeaking grunt like the voice of a penny trumpetas the huge creature swung rapidly along the shore in our direction  uh young bull lil fool moose whispered simmo and breathed a soft questioning whooowuh through the bark horn to bring him nearer  he came close to where we were hidden then entered the woods and circled silently about our camp to get our wind in the morning his tracks within five feet of my rear tent pole showed how little he cared for the dwelling of man but though he circled back and forth for an hour answering simmos low call with his ridiculous little grunt he would not show himself again on the open shore  i stole up after a while to where i had heard the last twig snap under his hoofs simmo held me back whispering of danger but there was a question in my head which has never received a satisfactory answer why does a bull come to a call anyway it is held generallyand with truth i thinkthat he comes because he thinks the sound is made by a cow moose but how his keen ears could mistake such a palpable fraud is the greatest mystery in the woods i have heard a score of hunters and indians call all differently and have sometimes brought a bull into the open at the wail of my own bark trumpet but i have never yet listened to a call that has any resemblance to the bellow of a cow moose as i have often heard it in the woods nor have i ever heard or ever met anybody who has heard a cow moose give forth any sound like the long call which is made by hunters and which is used successfully to bring the bull from a distance  others claim and with some reason that the bull more fearless and careless at this season than at other times comes merely to investigate the sound as he and most other wild creatures do with every queer or unknown thing they hear the alaskan indians stretch a skin into a kind of tambourine and beat it with a club to call a bull which sound however might not be unlike one of the many peculiar bellows that i have heard from cow moose in the wilderness and i have twice known bulls to come to the chuck of an ax on a block which sound at a distance has some resemblance to the peculiar chockchocking that the bulls use to call their mates from a distance  from any point of view the thing has contradictions enough to make one wary of a too positive opinion here at hand was a lil fool moose who knew no fear and who might therefore enlighten me on the obscure subject i told simmo to keep on calling softly at intervals while i crept up into the woods to watch the effect  it was all as dark as a pocket beyond the open shore one had to feel his way along and imitate the moose himself in putting his feet down spite of my precaution a bush whispered a twig cracked instantly there was a swift answering rustle ahead as the bull glided towards me he had heard the faint message and was coming to see if it were not his tantalizing mate ready to whack her soundly according to his wont for causing him so much worry and to beat her out ahead of him to the open where he could watch her closely and prevent any more of her hiding tricks  i stood motionless behind a tree grasping a branch above ready to swing up out of reach when the bull charged a vague black hulk thrust itself out of the dark woods close in front of me and stood still against the faint light which showed from the lake through the fringe of trees the great head and antlers stood out like an upturned root but i had never known that a living creature stood there were it not for a soft clucking rumble that the bull kept going in his throata ponderous kind of love note intended no doubt to let his elusive mate know that he was near  he took another step in my direction brushing the leaves softly a low whining grunt telling of his impatience two more steps and he must have discovered me when fortunately an appealing gurgle and a measured plop plop ploplike the feet of a moose falling in shallow watersounded from the shore below where simmo was concealed instantly the bull turned and glided away a shadow among the shadows a few minutes later i heard him running off in the direction whence he had first come  after that the twilight always found him near our camp he was convinced that there was a mate hiding somewhere near and he was bound to find her we had only to call a few times from our canoe or from the shore and presently we would hear him coming blowing his penny trumpet and at last see him break out upon the shore with a crashing plunge to waken all the echoes then one night as we lay alongside a great rock in deep shadow watching the puzzled young bull as he ranged along the shore in the moonlight simmo grunted softly to call him nearer at the sound a larger bull that we had not suspected leaped out of the bushes close beside us with a sudden terrifying plunge and splashed straight at the canoe only the quickest kind of work saved us simmo swung the bow off with a startled grunt of his own and i paddled away while the bull mistaking us in the dim light for the exasperating cow that had been calling and hiding herself for a week followed after us into deep water  there was no doubt whatever that this moose at least had come to what he thought was the call of a mate moonlight is deceptive beyond a few feet so when the low grunt sounded in the shadow of the great rock he was sure he had found the coy creature at last and broke out of his concealment resolved to keep her in sight and not to let her get away again that is why he swam after us had he been investigating some new sound or possible danger he would never have left the land where alone his great power and his wonderful senses have full play in the water he is harmless as most other wild creatures are  i paddled cautiously just ahead of him so near that looking over my shoulder i could see the flash of his eye and the waves crinkling away before the push of his great nose after a short swim he grew suspicious of the queer thing that kept just so far ahead whether he swam fast or slow and turned in towards the shore whining his impatience i followed slowly letting him get some distance ahead and just as his feet struck bottom whispered to simmo for his softest call at the sound the bull whirled and plunged after us again recklessly and i led him across to where the younger bull was still ranging up and down the shore calling imploringly to his phantom mate  i expected a battle when the two rivals should meet but they paid little attention to each other the common misfortune or the common misery seemed to kill the fierce natural jealousy whose fury i had more than once been witness of they had lost all fear by this time they ranged up and down the shore or smashed recklessly through the swamps as the elusive smells and echoes called them hither and yon in their frantic search  far up on the mountain side the sharp challenging grunt of a master bull broke out of the startled woods in one of the lulls of our exciting play simmo heard and turned in the bow to whisper excitedly nother bull fetchum ol devl this time sartin raising his horn he gave the long rolling bellow of a cow moose a fiercer trumpet call from the mountain side answered then the sound was lost in the crashcrash of the first two bulls as they broke out upon the shore on opposite sides of the canoe  we gave little heed now to the nearer play our whole attention was fixed on a hoarse grunting roaruh uh uh eeeyuh rrrrunhunhwith a rattling snapping crash of underbrush for an accompaniment the younger bull heard it listened for a moment like a great black statue under the moonlight then he glided away into the shadows under the bank the larger bull heard it threw up his great head defiantly and came swinging along the shore hurling a savage challenge back on the echoing woods at every stride  there was an ominous silence up on the ridge where a moment before all was fierce commotion simmo was silent too the uproar had been appalling with the sleeping lake below us and the vast forest where silence dwells at home stretching up and away on every hand to the sky line but the spirit of mischief was tingling all over me as i seized the horn and gave the low appealing grunt that a cow would have uttered under the same circumstances like a shot the answer was hurled back and down came the great bullsmash crack rrrunh till he burst like a tempest out on the open shore where the second bull with a challenging roar leaped to meet him  simmo was begging me to shoot shoot telling me excitedly that ol devl as he called him would be more dangerous now than ever if i let him get away but i only drove the canoe in closer to the splashing grunting uproar among the shadows under the bank  illustration a mighty spring of his crouching haunches finished the work  there was a terrific duel under way when i swung the canoe alongside a moment later the bulls crashed together with a shock to break their heads mud and water flew over them their great antlers clashed and rang like metal blades as they pushed and tugged grunting like demons in the fierce struggle but the contest was too onesided to last long the big bull that had almost killed me but in whom i now found myself taking an almost savage pride had smashed down from the mountain in a frightful rage and with a power that nothing could resist with a quick lunge he locked antlers in the grip he wanted a twist of his massive neck and shoulders forced the opposing head aside and a mighty spring of his crouching haunches finished the work the second moose went over with a plunge like a boltstruck pine as he rolled up to his feet again the savage old bull jumped for him and drove the brow antlers into his flanks the next moment both bulls had crashed away into the woods one swinging off in giant strides through the crackling underbrush for his life the other close behind charging like a batteringram into his enemys rear grunting like a huge wild boar in his rage and exultation so the chase vanished over the ridge into the valley beyond and silence stole back like a chinese empress into her disturbed dominions  from behind a great windfall on the point above where he had evidently been watching the battle the first young bull stole out and came halting and listening along the shore to the scene of the conflict to the discreet belong the spoils was written in every timorous step and stealthy movement a low grunt from my horn reassured him he grew confident now he would find the phantom mate that had occasioned so much trouble and run away with her before the conqueror should return from his chase he swung along rapidly rumbling the low call in his throat then up on the ridge sounded again the crackle of brush and the roar of a challenge rage had not made the victor to forget indeed here he was coming back swiftly for his reward on the instant all confidence vanished from the young bulls attitude he slipped away into the woods there was no sound scarcely a definite motion a shadow seemed to glide away into the darker shadows the underbrush closed softly behind it and he was gone  next morning at daybreak i found my old bull on the shore a mile below and with him was the great cow that had hunted me away from her little one the youngster was well grown and sturdy now but still he followed his mother obediently and the big bull had taken them both under his protection i left them there undisturbed with a thought of the mighty offspring that shall some day come smashing down from the mountain to delight the heart of camper or hunter and set his nerves atingle when the lake shall again be visited and the roar of a bark trumpet roll over the sleeping lake and the startled woods let them kill

pages illustrated list price 75 cents mailing price 80 cents  no book for common schools in recent years has aroused such widespread interest and been so universally commended as this little volume its adoption in two great states before its publication and in still another state immediately after its appearance indicates the unusually high merit of the work  the authors believe that there is no line of separation between the science of agriculture and the practical art of agriculture and that the subject is eminently teachable theory and practice are presented at one and the same time so that the pupil is taught the fundamental principles of farming just as he is taught the fundamental truths of arithmetic geography or grammar  the work is planned for use in grammarschool classes it thus presents the subject to the pupil when his aptitudes are the most rapidly developing and when he is forming life habits it will give to him therefore at the vital period of his life a training which will go far toward making his life work profitable and delightful the text is clear interesting and teachable while primarily intended for class work in the public schools it will no doubt appeal to all who desire a knowledge of the simple scientific truths which lie at the foundation of most farm operations  the two hundred and eighteen illustrations are unusually excellent and are particularly effective in illuminating the text the book is supplied throughout with practical exercises simple and interesting experiments and helpful suggestions the appendix devoted to spraying mixtures and fertilizer formulas the glossary in which are explained unusual and technical words and the complete index are important  in mechanical executionin the attractive and durable binding in the clear wellprinted page and in the illustrationsthe book is easily superior to any other elementary work on agriculture  ginn  company publishers
