64112536	second  thoughts are best  or a  further improvement  of a late  scheme  to prevent  street robberies  by which  our streets will be strongly guarded and so gloriously illuminated that any part of london will be as safe and pleasant at midnight as at noonday and burglary totally impracticable  with  some thoughts for suppressing robberies in all the public roads of england c  humbly  offered for the good of his country submitted to the consideration of the parliament and dedicated to his sacred majesty king george ii    by andrew moreton esq    london   printed for w meadows at the angel in cornhill and sold by j roberts in warwicklane 1729 price six pence     to the  kings  most excellent  majesty  sacred and most august   permit a loyal subject in the sincerity of his heart to press through the crowds of courtiers who surround your royal person and lay his little mite humbly offered for the public welfare at your majestys feet  happy is it for me as well as the whole kingdom we have a king of such humanity and affability a king naturalized to us a king who loves us a king in whose person as well as mind the whole hero appears the king of our hearts the king of our wishes  those who are dissatisfied with such a monarch deserve to be abandoned of god and have the devil sent to reign over them yet such there are pity they should wear human forms or breathe the free air of britain who are so scandalously fickle that if god himself was to reign they would yearn after their darling monarch the prince of darkness  these are they who fly in the face of majesty who so abuse the liberty of the press that from a benefit it becomes an evil and demands immediate regulation  not against your majesty only but against many of your loyal subjects are arrows shot in the dark by lurking villains who wound the reputations of the innocent in sport our public newspapers which ought to contain nothing but what is instructive and communicative being now become public nuisances vehicles of personal private slander and scandalous pasquins  let the glory be yours most gracious sovereign to suppress this growing evil and if any hints from your most faithful subject can be of the least use i live but to serve to admire and pray for your majesty                 who am         most gracious sovereign             your majestys   most loyal most dutiful most obedient                  subject and servant                               andrew moreton     the preface   nothing is more easy than to discover a thing already found out this is verified in me and that anonymous gentleman whom the public prints have lately complimented with a discovery to prevent street robberies though by the by we have only his vain ipse dixit and the ostentatious outcry of venal newswriters in his behalf  but to strip him of his borrowed plumes these are to remind the public that about six months ago in a treatise entituled augusta triumphans or the way to make london the most flourishing city in the universe i laid down a plain and practicable scheme for the total suppression and prevention of street robberies which scheme has been approved of by several learned and judicious persons  oh but say the advocates of this secondhand schemist our project is to be laid before the parliament does that make his better or mine worse have not many silly projects been laid before parliaments ere now admit it be not the same as i have but too much reason to fear it is cannot the members of both houses read print as well as written hand or does he think they are so prejudiced to dislike a thing the worse for being offered without view of gain i trust andrew moretons scheme generously offered for the public good will meet with as fair a reception as that of this hireling projector  mine is already published let him generously follow my example and no doubt if his scheme be preferred the government will reward him  if my antagonist be necessitous where is the merit he does it for his own sake not for the public if he be not necessitous what a sordid wretch is he to withhold his scheme for lucre putting it up at public sale so that if you do not give him his price you shall not have it  some people indeed are so fond of mysteries they run down everything that is plain and intelligible they love darkness whispers and freemasonry despising whatever comes in the shape of a pamphlet be it never so useful or commendable but in spite of prejudice truth is the standard by which i hope all honest and impartial men will judge me  though i must confess i am not a little piqued to be jockeyed out of my labours yet not to be behindhand with my gentleman in the clouds who would have the parliament buy his pig in a poke and build up his fortune at my expense i have so amply enlarged and amended my scheme that it is now scarce like the same i have taken in everything possible of comprehension or practice nor have i left him room to edge in one single hint i have debated the objections of divers wise and learned men and corrected my project accordingly so that on comparison my first thoughts will appear but as a rude and imperfect sketch only valuable in that it gave the idea of this more laboured and finished performance on which i pledge my whole reputation being ready to stand or fall by its success  in order to which i have presented copies of this book to the king and queens most excellent majesties to several of the lords spiritual and divers honourable and worthy members of both houses and time must show whose scheme shall have the precedence  in the mean time i stand prepared for the sneers of those who despise everything and everybody but their own dear selves as also the objections of the puzzle causes who will turrylugg a thing out of all sense and meaning and by the cloudiness of their explanations darken what is most plain and obvious my business is to go straight forward and let the end crown the work if men of sense approve me i need not value the laughter of fools whose very approbation is scandal for if a thinking man is to be laughed out of every good intention or invention nothing will ever be done for the public good     second thoughts c   the principal encouragement and opportunity given to our street robbers is that our streets are so poorly watched the watchmen for the most part being decrepit superannuated wretches with one foot in the grave and the other ready to follow so feeble that a puff of breath can blow them down poor crazy mortals much fitter for an almshouse than a watchhouse a city watched and guarded by such animals is wretchedly watched indeed  nay so little terror do they carry with them that hardy thieves make a mere jest of them and oftentimes oblige even the very watchman who should apprehend to light them in their roguery and what can a poor creature do in terror of his life surrounded by a pack of ruffians and no assistance near  add to this that our rogues are grown more wicked than ever and vice in all kinds is so much winked at that robbery is accounted a petty crime we take pains to puff them up in their villany and thieves are set out in so amiable a light in the beggars opera it has taught them to value themselves on their profession rather than to be ashamed of it  there was some cessation of street robberies from the time of bunworth and blewitts execution until the introduction of this pious opera now we find the cartouchian villanies revived and london that used to be the most safe and peaceful city in the universe is now become a scene of rapine and danger if some of cartouchs gang be not come over hither to instruct our thieves we have doubtless a cartouch of our own and a gang which if not suppressed may be full as pernicious as was ever cartouchs and london may be as dangerous as paris if due care be not taken  not content with the mischief done by the beggars opera we must have a quakers opera forsooth of much more evil tendency than the former for in this jack shepherd is made the hero of the drama and runs through such a scene of riot and success that but too many weak minds have been drawn away and many unwary persons so charmed with his appearance on the stage dressed in that elegant manner and his pockets so well lined they have forthwith commenced streetrobbers or housebreakers so that every idle fellow weary of honest labour need but fancy himself a macheath or a shepherd and there is a rogue made at once since therefore example has such force the stage ought to be reformed and nothing exhibited but what might be represented before a bishop they may be merry and wise let them take the provoked husband for a pattern  a good physician seeks the cause and weighs the symptoms before he proceeds to prescribe and if we trace this evil from its radix we shall find a cause antecedent to the two operas aforesaid namely accursed geneva the bane and ruin of our lower class of people  those who deny an inferior class of people to be necessary in a body politic contradict reason and experience itself since they are most useful when industrious and equally pernicious when lazy by their industry our manufactures trade and commerce are carried on the merchant in his countinghouse and the captain in his cabin would find but little employment were it not that many hands carried on the different branches of the concerns they superintended  but now so far are our common people infatuated with geneva that half the work is not done now as formerly it debilitates and enervates them nor are they near so strong and healthy as formerly  so that if this abuse of geneva be not stopped we may go whoop for husbandmen labourers c trade must consequently stand still and the credit of the nation sink nor is the abatement of the excise though very considerable and most worthy notice any ways comparable to the corruption of manners destruction of health and all the train of evils we are threatened with from pernicious geneva  we will suppose a man able to maintain himself and family by his trade and at the same time to be a geneva drinker this fellow first makes himself incapable of working by being continually drunk which runs him behindhand so that he either pawns or neglects his work for which reason nobody will employ him at last fear of arrests his own hunger the cries of a family for bread his natural desire to support an irregular life and a propense hatred to labour turn but too many an honest tradesman into an arrant desperate rogue and these are commonly the means that furnish us with thieves and villains in general  thus is a man who might be useful in a body politic rendered obnoxious to the same so that if this trade of wickedness goes on they will increase upon us so much that we shall not dare to stir out of our habitations nay it will be well if they arrive not to the impudence of plundering our houses at noonday  where is the courage of the english nation that a gentleman with six or seven servants shall be robbed by one single highwayman yet we have lately had instances of this and for this we may thank our effeminacy our toupee wigs and powdered pates our tea and other scandalous fopperies and above all the disuse of noble and manly sports so necessary to a brave people once in vogue but now totally lost amongst us  let not the reader think i run from my subject if i search the bottom of the distemper before i propose a cure which having done though indeed but slightly for this is an argument could be carried to a much greater length i proceed to the purpose in manner following  let the watch be composed of stout ablebodied men and of those a sufficient number that is to say a watchman to every forty houses twenty on one side of the way and twenty on the other for it is observable that a man cannot well see distinctly beyond the extent of twenty houses in a row if it is a single row and no opposite houses the charge must be greater or their safety less  this man should be elected and paid by the housekeepers themselves to prevent misapplication and abuse so much complained of in the distribution of the public money  he should be allowed ten shillings per annum by each housekeeper which at forty houses as above specified amounts to 20l per annum almost treble to what is at present allowed and yet most housekeepers are charged at least 2s 6d a quarter to the watch whose beat is generally speaking little less than the compass of half a mile  what a shame it is that at least 100l should be collected in some beats and the poor watchman should not have the onetenth part of the money and this i leave to the consideration of any housekeeper who will take the pains to inquire into the extent of a watchmans beat and after that cast up what is collected in the said beat as they say for the watch but this is a small abuse in comparison of other parochial misapplications for a proof of which i refer my reader to a treatise of mine entituled parochial tyranny  this salary of 20l per annum is something of encouragement and a pretty settlement for a poor man who with frugality may live decently thereon and by due rest be enabled to give due and vigilant attendance that is to say from evening dusk to morning light  if a housekeeper break or a house is empty the poor watchman ought not to suffer the deficiency should be made up by the housekeepers remaining  the watch thus stationed strengthened and encouraged let every watchman be armed with firearms and sword and let no watchman stand above twenty doors distant from his fellow  this has already been put in practice in the parish of st giless in the fields and has had so good an effect that it is hoped other parishes will follow their example which redounds not a little to the credit of our project  let each watchman be provided with a horn to sound an alarm or in time of danger and let it be made penal if not felony for any but a watchman to sound a horn in and about the city from the time of their going on to that of their going off  i know an objection will be here made on account of the postboys to obviate which i had thoughts of a bell but that would be too ponderous and troublesome for a watchman to carry besides his arms and lantern whereas a horn is portable always ready and most alarming  let the postboys therefore use some other signal since this is most convenient to this more material purpose they may carry a bell in a holster with ease and give notice by that as well as those who collect the letters  that the watchmen may see from one end of their walks to the other let a convenient number of lamps be set up and those not of the convex kind which blind the eyes and are of no manner of use they dazzle but give no distinct light and further rather than prevent robberies many persons deceived and blinded by these ignes fatui have been run over by coaches carts c people stumbling more even under these very lamps than in the dark in short they are most unprofitable lights and in my opinion rather abuses than benefits  besides i see no reason why every ten housekeepers cannot find a lamp among themselves which would be four lamps in a beat and let their watchman dress it rather than fatten a crew of directors  but we are so fond of companies it is a wonder we have not our shoes blacked by one and a set of directors made rich at the expense of our very blackguards  the watch ought to be in view as well as in the hearing of each other or they may be overpowered and much danger may happen  the streets being thus gloriously illuminated and so strongly guarded by stout and able fellows well armed and well paid all within the view of one another proceed we to secure all byturnings courts alleys lanes c which may favour a streetrobbers escape and make our project ineffectual  a street court lane alley or other place where the number of houses or poverty of the inhabitants will not afford a watchman on the terms before mentioned should be gated in and the inhabitants let in and out by the watchman of the street  where there are even but twelve houses in a court and the inhabitants people of credit they may have a separate watch to themselves as is practised in boswellcourt by lincolnsinnfields angelcourt in throckmortonstreet and many other places in london  this i think an unexceptionable way to secure the cities and suburbs of london and westminster the only difficulty i can conceive is that persons after dark may now and then go a little way round about by keeping the street way but the pleasantness and safety occasioned by the lights and watch aforesaid make ample amends let those go through byways and in the dark whose deeds are so i am for providing security for honest men and obstacle for rogues  and now we have put a stop to their roguery let us endeavour to suppress the rogues themselves in order to which i shall begin with their harlots who are generally speaking the first motives to their villany and egg them on to all manner of mischief  and these are generally servant wenches who stroll from place to place and at last weary of working throw themselves on the public to maintain these creatures many a man turns rogue it behoves the government therefore to oblige all young wenches to keep in service masters and mistresses ought likewise to see that servants of both sexes go not a rambling when sent to church but that they keep good hours for many have been ruined by junketing and staying out instead of being at church or at home  our common women ought to be restrained in the liberties they have lately taken they openly swear and talk so obscenely it is a shame to a christian country  having fully handled this topic in two treatises viz everybodys business is nobodys business and parochial tyranny i shall not tire my readers with repetition but referring them to the treatises themselves return to my subject which is  after we have reformed the ladies let us take their sparks in hand and first let all shoecleaners i mean boys and sturdy vagrants be suppressed according to my scheme in everybodys business c as for linkboys alias thieves with lights there will be no need of them when the streets are illuminated according to my project  that sailors as well as soldiers may not give cause of suspicion it is fit they should also be quartered after the same nature and more to enforce it surveyors of quarters should have rounds allotted them  these surveyors should call at the quarters of every soldier or sailor at a limited hour to see if they are there or no and register them at home or absent accordingly absence to be penal  every soldier or sailor leaving his quarters till morning after he has been found at home and registered should be punished  i must be excused if i ward every obstacle my design being to break up streetrobbers nest and egg  and that thieves may not stroll about under pretence of being destitute of lodging barracks or barns should be built at convenient ends of the town where all vagrants should be obliged to render themselves at a stated hour where they should have clean straw allowed them and be kept orderly and out of harms way they may be let loose if they have apparent means of honest livelihood otherwise they should be sent to the workhouse of their respective parish or to a general workhouse of which there is great need and of which more hereafter  all publichouses and ginshops if they should be tolerated should be shut up at ten  if the government should think fit to tolerate ginshops i see no reason why they may not be subject to licenses and come into the potact as well as alehouses especially considering there is as much gin as ale consumed nowadays  night houses and cellars above all should be totally suppressed these are the harbours and refuge of villains and strumpets these are their houses of call where there hellish trade is carried on it is here they wait for the signal of their scouts here they cast their schemes and bring in advices here they encourage and initiate young thieves here they barter and sell their stolen goods these are their exchanges and asylums after mischief  hackney coach drivers next require our care they are the scum of the people and generally speaking the worst of rogues  so many and such frequent robberies can never be committed without the connivance of these villains and it is but too much to be feared that at the same time they take up a fare they take up a robber who is ready to mark his prey and gets up either on the box or behind and alights at a convenient place to perpetrate his hellish design as for a snack of the coal as they term it no doubt but the coachman and he have proper understanding and rendezvous  many who go to the coachoffice nowadays may be mistaken in their hopes of redress not but the commissioners to a man treat complainants with the utmost civility but the penalty which used to be on the renter being now on the driver the renter or owner of that figure is clear and the driver has nothing to do but to be absent and laugh at the complainant an instance of which take in the following case  a hackney coachman took eighteenpence of a gentleman for a twelvepenny fare the gentleman took his number and complained the driver appeared and was fined fifteen shillings but the renter escaped what was the result the driver absconded the gentleman sits down at his loss of attendance and money had robbery or assault been the complaint the consequence had been the same the gentleman is but where he was he has since called several times at the office but to no purpose all the answer he can get is the fellow cannot be found i write this therefore to undeceive those persons who think when they have taken the number of a coach they can punish the driver for insolence or extortion  the law in this case ought to be turned into its old channel that is to say the owner of the figure should be answerable he ought to employ a driver he can answer for or drive himself  every renter therefore should be obliged to register and respond for his driver or commissioners figures and all other forms are to little purpose  beggars should next be suppressed who lounge about all day to see where they can steal at night it is a shame we should suffer real objects of charity to beg and for those who are not so it is a shame but they should work  i shall close all with these observations  that the extortions and cabals of tradesmen by enhancing the prices of provisions is most detrimental to a state and worthy the notice of its legislature for men not being able to support their families by honest labour and being made beggars by reason of the dearness of provisions ofttimes grow desperate and turn rogues this assertion is but too true to prove which i appeal to the late conduct of    the coal merchants   the bakers   the butchers   and above all the tallow chandlers  the cabals of coal traders have for many years jockeyed us in the price of coals they have raised and fell them at pleasure and made mere stockjobbing work of it but never so much as in his late majestys reign on a great impress for seamen they in less than a fortnight raised the price of coals from twentythree shillings to almost fifty what a pinch must this be on the poor who live only from hand to mouth and buy their coals poor souls some by the half peck  the bakers are yet more flagrant and vile they turn plenty to famine and push up the price of bread without rule or reason they have already been detected in one bite ie procuring some of the fraternity to buy a small quantity of corn much above the market price and then by making oath thereof abuse a wellintended law and raise the price of bread accordingly  thus are the poor ground to dust in order to fatten a pack of misers who know no mercy but i hope the government will make them honest even against their will  the butchers are now so extravagant in their way of living that usual and moderate profit will not content them they cannot drink malt liquor and the poor must pay for the wine which they swill down at an unmerciful rate  the price of meat should therefore be regulated according to the price of cattle but not according to the bakers rule afore mentioned  but as for the tallowchandlers their oppressions call aloud for redress to what an exorbitant pitch have they raised candles just double what it was some years ago nay they threaten to have them at tenpence per pound how can the poor work when candles are so dear but we may thank our own luxury for these impositions i see no reason why we should not humble these upstarts by making our own candles aye and our own bread too as our forefathers have done before us  the tallowchandlers to excuse themselves lay the fault on the melters the melters shift it from themselves to the butchers and so the game goes round  oh but say they the government will lose part of its revenue to which i answer that rather than they shall raise candles to double their value on pretence of paying a penny per pound excise in case the parliament will take off the duty on candles for the ease of the poor i will present them with a project gratis which shall bring in almost double the money now levied by candles and that without the least hardship on the subject  having i hope taken sufficient care of streetrobbers i proceed now to clear the roads from highwaymen footpads c  let parties of horse be stationed at all the outgoings from the city of london so that if a coach wagon c want a convoy two three or more may be detached by the commanding officer these shall be registered and answerable for their charge and for encouragement shall receive so much per mile or in the whole convoy money  this may be likewise practised from town to town all over england so that the roads will be as safe as the streets and they who scruple the trifle of convoy money above proposed merit not safety  for those who walk on foot to the adjacent villages parties of foot may be stationed in like manner so that not only the subject will be free from danger but the soldier employed and prevented from corrupt measures by this additional perquisite to his pay  nothing remains but that robbers be prosecuted at the public charge the trials fixed to respective days that prosecutors may not lose so much time and the rewards paid in court without deduction or delay nor should any robber be admitted an evidence after he is taken or pardoned after conviction
