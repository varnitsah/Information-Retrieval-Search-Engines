presently at gods great judgment seat        but there is neither east nor west border nor breed nor birth        when two strong men stand face to face          tho they come from the ends of the earth    kamal is out with twenty men to raise the borderside   and he has lifted the colonels mare that is the colonels pride   he has lifted her out of the stabledoor between the dawn and the day   and turned the calkins upon her feet and ridden her far away   then up and spoke the colonels son that led a troop of the guides   is there never a man of all my men can say where kamal hides   then up and spoke mahommed khan the son of the ressaldar   if ye know the track of the morningmist ye know where his pickets are   at dusk he harries the abazai  at dawn he is into bonair   but he must go by fort bukloh to his own place to fare   so if ye gallop to fort bukloh as fast as a bird can fly   by the favour of god ye may cut him off ere he win to the tongue of jagai   but if he be past the tongue of jagai right swiftly turn ye then   for the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with kamals men   there is rock to the left and rock to the right and low lean thorn between   and ye may hear a breechbolt snick where never a man is seen   the colonels son has taken a horse and a raw rough dun was he   with the mouth of a bell and the heart of hell     and the head of the gallowstree   the colonels son to the fort has won they bid him stay to eat    who rides at the tail of a border thief he sits not long at his meat   hes up and away from fort bukloh as fast as he can fly   till he was aware of his fathers mare in the gut of the tongue of jagai   till he was aware of his fathers mare with kamal upon her back   and when he could spy the white of her eye he made the pistol crack   he has fired once he has fired twice but the whistling ball went wide   ye shoot like a soldier kamal said  show now if ye can ride   its up and over the tongue of jagai as blown dustdevils go   the dun he fled like a stag of ten but the mare like a barren doe   the dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above   but the red mare played with the snafflebars as a maiden plays with a glove   there was rock to the left and rock to the right and low lean thorn between   and thrice he heard a breechbolt snick tho never a man was seen   they have ridden the low moon out of the sky their hoofs drum up the dawn   the dun he went like a wounded bull but the mare like a newroused fawn   the dun he fell at a watercourse  in a woful heap fell he   and kamal has turned the red mare back and pulled the rider free   he has knocked the pistol out of his hand  small room was there to strive   twas only by favour of mine quoth he ye rode so long alive   there was not a rock for twenty mile there was not a clump of tree   but covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee   if i had raised my bridlehand as i have held it low   the little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row   if i had bowed my head on my breast as i have held it high   the kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly   lightly answered the colonels son  do good to bird and beast   but count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast   if there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away   belike the price of a jackals meal were more than a thief could pay   they will feed their horse on the standing crop     their men on the garnered grain   the thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain   but if thou thinkest the price be fair  thy brethren wait to sup   the hound is kin to the jackalspawn  howl dog and call them up   and if thou thinkest the price be high in steer and gear and stack   give me my fathers mare again and ill fight my own way back   kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet   no talk shall be of dogs said he when wolf and gray wolf meet   may i eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath   what dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with death   lightly answered the colonels son  i hold by the blood of my clan   take up the mare for my fathers gift  by god she has carried a man   the red mare ran to the colonels son and nuzzled against his breast   we be two strong men said kamal then but she loveth the younger best   so she shall go with a lifters dower my turquoisestudded rein   my broidered saddle and saddlecloth and silver stirrups twain   the colonels son a pistol drew and held it muzzleend   ye have taken the one from a foe said he     will ye take the mate from a friend   a gift for a gift said kamal straight a limb for the risk of a limb   thy father has sent his son to me ill send my son to him   with that he whistled his only son that dropped from a mountaincrest    he trod the ling like a buck in spring and he looked like a lance in rest   now here is thy master kamal said who leads a troop of the guides   and thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides   till death or i cut loose the tie at camp and board and bed   thy life is his  thy fate it is to guard him with thy head   so thou must eat the white queens meat and all her foes are thine   and thou must harry thy fathers hold for the peace of the borderline   and thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power    belike they will raise thee to ressaldar when i am hanged in peshawur    they have looked each other between the eyes and there they found no fault   they have taken the oath of the brotherinblood on leavened bread and salt   they have taken the oath of the brotherinblood on fire and freshcut sod   on the hilt and the haft of the khyber knife and the wondrous names of god   the colonels son he rides the mare and kamals boy the dun   and two have come back to fort bukloh where there went forth but one   and when they drew to the quarterguard full twenty swords flew clear    there was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer   ha done ha done said the colonels son     put up the steel at your sides   last night ye had struck at a border thief      tonight tis a man of the guides         oh east is east and west is west and never the twain shall meet        till earth and sky stand presently at gods great judgment seat        but there is neither east nor west border nor breed nor birth        when two strong men stand face to face          tho they come from the ends of the earth     the last suttee         not many years ago a king died in one of the rajpoot states        his wives disregarding the orders of the english against suttee        would have broken out of the palace had not the gates been barred        but one of them disguised as the kings favourite dancinggirl        passed through the line of guards and reached the pyre  there        her courage failing she prayed her cousin a baron of the court        to kill her  this he did not knowing who she was     udai chand lay sick to death       in his hold by gungra hill   all night we heard the deathgongs ring   for the soul of the dying rajpoot king   all night beat up from the womens wing       a cry that we could not still    all night the barons came and went       the lords of the outer guard   all night the cressets glimmered pale   on ulwar sabre and tonk jezail   mewar headstall and marwar mail       that clinked in the palace yard    in the golden room on the palace roof       all night he fought for air   and there was sobbing behind the screen   rustle and whisper of women unseen   and the hungry eyes of the boondi queen       on the death she might not share    he passed at dawn  the deathfire leaped       from ridge to riverhead   from the malwa plains to the abu scars   and wail upon wail went up to the stars   behind the grim zenanabars       when they knew that the king was dead    the dumb priest knelt to tie his mouth       and robe him for the pyre   the boondi queen beneath us cried   see now that we die as our mothers died   in the bridalbed by our masters side       out women  to the fire    we drove the great gates home apace       white hands were on the sill   but ere the rush of the unseen feet   had reached the turn to the open street   the bars shot down the guarddrum beat        we held the dovecot still    a face looked down in the gathering day       and laughing spoke from the wall   ohe they mourn here  let me by    azizun the  lucknow nautchgirl i   when the house is rotten the rats must fly       and i seek another thrall    for i ruled the king as neer did queen        tonight the queens rule me   guard them safely but let me go   or ever they pay the debt they owe   in scourge and torture  she leaped below       and the grim guard watched her flee    they knew that the king had spent his soul       on a northbred dancinggirl   that he prayed to a flatnosed lucknow god   and kissed the ground where her feet had trod   and doomed to death at her drunken nod       and swore by her lightest curl    we bore the king to his fathers place       where the tombs of the sunborn stand   where the gray apes swing and the peacocks preen   on fretted pillar and jewelled screen   and the wild boar couch in the house of the queen       on the drift of the desert sand    the herald read his titles forth       we set the logs aglow   friend of the english free from fear   baron of luni to jeysulmeer   lord of the desert of bikaneer       king of the jungle  go    all night the red flame stabbed the sky       with wavering windtossed spears   and out of a shattered temple crept   a woman who veiled her head and wept   and called on the king  but the great king slept       and turned not for her tears    small thought had he to mark the strife        cold fear with hot desire    when thrice she leaped from the leaping flame   and thrice she beat her breast for shame   and thrice like a wounded dove she came       and moaned about the fire    one watched a bowshot from the blaze       the silent streets between   who had stood by the king in sport and fray   to blade in ambush or boar at bay   and he was a baron old and gray       and kin to the boondi queen    he said  o shameless put aside       the veil upon thy brow   who held the king and all his land   to the wanton will of a harlots hand   will the white ash rise from the blistered brand       stoop down and call him now    then she  by the faith of my tarnished soul       all things i did not well   i had hoped to clear ere the fire died   and lay me down by my masters side   to rule in heaven his only bride       while the others howl in hell    but i have felt the fires breath       and hard it is to die   yet if i may pray a rajpoot lord   to sully the steel of a thakurs sword   with baseborn blood of a trade abhorred        and the thakur answered ay    he drew and struck  the straight blade drank       the life beneath the breast   i had looked for the queen to face the flame   but the harlot dies for the rajpoot dame    sister of mine pass free from shame       pass with thy king to rest    the black log crashed above the white       the little flames and lean   red as slaughter and blue as steel   that whistled and fluttered from head to heel   leaped up anew for they found their meal       on the heart of  the boondi queen     the ballad of the kings mercy               abdhur rahman the durani chief of him is the story told             his mercy fills the khyber hills  his grace is manifold             he has taken toll of the north and the south                his glory reacheth far             and they tell the tale of his charity from balkh to kandahar    before the old peshawur gate where kurd and kaffir meet   the governor of kabul dealt the justice of the street   and that was strait as running noose and swift as plunging knife   tho he who held the longer purse might hold the longer life    there was a hound of hindustan had struck a euzufzai   wherefore they spat upon his face and led him out to die   it chanced the king went forth that hour when throat was bared to knife   the kaffir grovelled underhoof and clamoured for his life    then said the king  have hope o friend  yea death disgraced is hard   much honour shall be thine and called the captain of the guard   yar khan a bastard of the blood so citybabble saith   and he was honoured of the king  the which is salt to death   and he was son of daoud shah the reiver of the plains   and blood of old durani lords ran fire in his veins   and twas to tame an afghan pride nor hell nor heaven could bind   the king would make him butcher to a yelping cur of hind    strike said the king  kings blood art thou      his death shall be his pride   then louder that the crowd might catch  fear not  his arms are tied   yar khan drew clear the khyber knife and struck and sheathed again   o man thy will is done quoth he a king this dog hath slain              abdhur rahman the durani chief to the north and the south is sold             the north and the south shall open their mouth               to a ghilzai flag unrolled             when the big guns speak to the khyber peak and his dogheratis fly             ye have heard the song  how long  how long               wolves of the abazai    that night before the watch was set when all the streets were clear   the governor of kabul spoke  my king hast thou no fear   thou knowest  thou hast heard  his speech died at his masters face   and grimly said the afghan king  i rule the afghan race   my path is mine  see thou to thine  tonight upon thy bed   think who there be in kabul now that clamour for thy head    that night when all the gates were shut to city and to throne   within a little gardenhouse the king lay down alone   before the sinking of the moon which is the night of night   yar khan came softly to the king to make his honour white   the children of the town had mocked beneath his horses hoofs   the harlots of the town had hailed him butcher from their roofs   but as he groped against the wall two hands upon him fell   the king behind his shoulder spake  dead man thou dost not well   tis ill to jest with kings by day and seek a boon by night   and that thou bearest in thy hand is all too sharp to write   but three days hence if god be good and if thy strength remain   thou shalt demand one boon of me and bless me in thy pain   for i am merciful to all and most of all to thee   my butcher of the shambles rest  no knife hast thou for me              abdhur rahman the durani chief               holds hard by the south and the north             but the ghilzai knows ere the melting snows               when the swollen banks break forth             when the redcoats crawl to the sungar wall               and his usbeg lances fail             ye have heard the song  how long  how long               wolves of the zuka kheyl    they stoned him in the rubbishfield when dawn was in the sky   according to the written word see that he do not die    they stoned him till the stones were piled above him on the plain   and those the labouring limbs displaced they tumbled back again    one watched beside the dreary mound that veiled the battered thing   and him the king with laughter called the herald of the king    it was upon the second night the night of ramazan   the watcher leaning earthward heard the message of yar khan   from shattered breast through shrivelled lips broke forth the rattling breath   creature of god deliver me from agony of death    they sought the king among his girls and risked their lives thereby   protector of the pitiful give orders that he die    bid him endure until the day a lagging answer came   the night is short and he can pray and learn to bless my name    before the dawn three times he spoke and on the day once more   creature of god deliver me and bless the king therefor    they shot him at the morning prayer to ease him of his pain   and when he heard the matchlocks clink he blessed the king again    which thing the singers made a song for all the world to sing   so that the outer seas may know the mercy of the king              abdhur rahman the durani chief of him is the story told             he has opened his mouth to the north and the south               they have stuffed his mouth with gold             ye know the truth of his tender ruth  and sweet his favours are             ye have heard the song  how long  how long               from balkh to kandahar     the ballad of the kings jest     when springtime flushes the desert grass   our kafilas wind through the khyber pass   lean are the camels but fat the frails   light are the purses but heavy the bales   as the snowbound trade of the north comes down   to the marketsquare of peshawur town    in a turquoise twilight crisp and chill   a kafila camped at the foot of the hill   then blue smokehaze of the cooking rose   and tentpeg answered to  hammernose   and the picketed ponies shag and wild   strained at their ropes as the feed was piled   and the bubbling camels beside the load   sprawled for a furlong adown the road   and the persian pussycats brought for sale   spat at the dogs from the camelbale   and the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food   and the campfires twinkled by fort jumrood   and there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk   a savour of camels and carpets and musk   a murmur of voices a reek of smoke   to tell us the trade of the khyber woke    the lid of the fleshpot chattered high   the knives were whetted and  then came i   to mahbub ali the muleteer   patching his bridles and counting his gear   crammed with the gossip of half a year   but mahbub ali the kindly said   better is speech when the belly is fed   so we plunged the hand to the midwrist deep   in a cinnamon stew of the fattailed sheep   and he who never hath tasted the food   by allah he knoweth not bad from good    we cleansed our beards of the muttongrease   we lay on the mats and were filled with peace   and the talk slid north and the talk slid south   with the sliding puffs from the hookahmouth   four things greater than all things are    women and horses and power and war   we spake of them all but the last the most   for i sought a word of a russian post   of a shifty promise an unsheathed sword   and a graycoat guard on the helmund ford   then mahbub ali lowered his eyes   in the fashion of one who is weaving lies   quoth he  of the russians who can say   when the night is gathering all is gray   but we look that the gloom of the night shall die   in the morning flush of a bloodred sky   friend of my heart is it meet or wise   to warn a king of his enemies   we know what heaven or hell may bring   but no man knoweth the mind of the king   that unsought counsel is cursed of god   attesteth the story of wali dad    his sire was leaky of tongue and pen   his dam was a clucking khuttuck hen   and the colt bred close to the vice of each   for he carried the curse of an unstanched speech   therewith madness  so that he sought   the favour of kings at the kabul court   and travelled in hope of honour far   to the line where the graycoat squadrons are   there have i journeyed too  but i   saw naught said naught and  did not die   he harked to rumour and snatched at a breath   of this one knoweth and that one saith    legends that ran from mouth to mouth   of a graycoat coming and sack of the south   these have i also heard  they pass   with each new spring and the winter grass    hotfoot southward forgotten of god   back to the city ran wali dad   even to kabul  in full durbar   the king held talk with his chief in war   into the press of the crowd he broke   and what he had heard of the coming spoke    then gholam hyder the red chief smiled   as a mother might on a babbling child   but those who would laugh restrained their breath   when the face of the king showed dark as death   evil it is in full durbar   to cry to a ruler of gathering war   slowly he led to a peachtree small   that grew by a cleft of the city wall   and he said to the boy  they shall praise thy zeal   so long as the red spurt follows the steel   and the russ is upon us even now   great is thy prudence  await them thou   watch from the tree  thou art young and strong   surely thy vigil is not for long   the russ is upon us thy clamour ran   surely an hour shall bring their van   wait and watch  when the host is near   shout aloud that my men may hear    friend of my heart is it meet or wise   to warn a king of his enemies   a guard was set that he might not flee    a score of bayonets ringed the tree   the peachbloom fell in showers of snow   when he shook at his death as he looked below   by the power of god who alone is great   till the seventh day he fought with his fate   then madness took him and men declare   he mowed in the branches as ape and bear   and last as a sloth ere his body failed   and he hung as a bat in the forks and wailed   and sleep the cord of his hands untied   and he fell and was caught on the points and died    heart of my heart is it meet or wise   to warn a king of his enemies   we know what heaven or hell may bring   but no man knoweth the mind of the king   of the graycoat coming who can say   when the night is gathering all is gray   two things greater than all things are   the first is love and the second war   and since we know not how war may prove   heart of my heart let us talk of love     with scindia to delhi          more than a hundred years ago in a great battle fought near delhi        an indian prince rode fifty miles after the day was lost        with a beggargirl who had loved him and followed him in all his camps        on his saddlebow  he lost the girl when almost within sight of safety        a maratta trooper tells the story     the wreath of banquet overnight lay withered on the neck    our hands and scarfs were saffrondyed for signal of despair   when we went forth to paniput to battle with the mlech     ere we came back from paniput and left a kingdom there    thrice thirty thousand men were we to force the jumna fords     the hawkwinged horse of damajee mailed squadrons of the bhao   stark levies of the southern hills the deccans sharpest swords    and he the harlots traitor son the goatherd mulhar rao    thrice thirty thousand men were we before the mists had cleared    the low white mists of morning heard the warconch scream and bray   we called upon bhowani and we gripped them by the beard    we rolled upon them like a flood and washed their ranks away    the children of the hills of khost before our lances ran    we drove the black rohillas back as cattle to the pen   twas then we needed mulhar rao to end what we began    a thousand men had saved the charge he fled the field with ten    there was no room to clear a sword  no power to strike a blow    for foot to foot ay breast to breast the battle held us fast    save where the naked hillmen ran and stabbing from below    brought down the horse and rider and we trampled them and passed    to left the roar of musketry rang like a falling flood     to right the sunshine rippled red from redder lance and blade    above the dark upsaras flew beneath us plashed the blood    and bellying black against the dust the bhagwa jhanda swayed     the choosers of the slain    i saw it fall in smoke and fire the banner of the bhao    i heard a voice across the press of one who called in vain    ho anand rao nimbalkhur ride  get aid of mulhar rao    go shame his squadrons into fight  the bhao  the bhao is slain    thereat as when a sandbar breaks in clotted spume and spray     when rain of later autumn sweeps the jumna waterhead   before their charge from flank to flank our riven ranks gave way    but of the waters of that flood the jumna fords ran red    i held by scindia my lord as close as man might hold    a soobah of the deccan asks no aid to guard his life   but holkars horse were flying and our chiefest chiefs were cold    and like a flame among us leapt the long lean northern knife    i held by scindia  my lance from butt to tuft was dyed    the froth of battle bossed the shield and roped the bridlechain    what time beneath our horses feet a maiden rose and cried    and clung to scindia and i turned a swordcut from the twain    he set a spell upon the maid in woodlands long ago    a hunter by the tapti banks she gave him water there   he turned her heart to water and she followed to her woe    what need had he of lalun who had twenty maids as fair    now in that hour strength left my lord he wrenched his mare aside    he bound the girl behind him and we slashed and struggled free   across the reeling wreck of strife we rode as shadows ride    from paniput to delhi town but not alone were we    twas lutufullah populzai laid horse upon our track    a swinefed reiver of the north that lusted for the maid   i might have barred his path awhile but scindia called me back    and  i  o woe for scindia  i listened and obeyed    league after league the formless scrub took shape and glided by     league after league the white road swirled behind the white mares feet    league after league when leagues were done we heard the populzai    where sure as time and swift as death the tireless footfall beat    noons eye beheld that shame of flight the shadows fell we fled    where steadfast as the wheeling kite he followed in our train   the black wolf warred where we had warred the jackal mocked our dead    and terror born of twilighttide made mad the labouring brain    i gasped  a kingdom waits my lord her love is but her own    a day shall mar a day shall cure for her but what for thee   cut loose the girl  he follows fast  cut loose and ride alone    then scindia twixt his blistered lips  my queens queen shall she be    of all who ate my bread last night twas she alone that came    to seek her love between the spears and find her crown therein   one shame is mine today what need the weight of double shame    if once we reach the delhi gate though all be lost i win    we rode  the white mare failed  her trot a staggering stumble grew     the cookingsmoke of even rose and weltered and hung low   and still we heard the populzai and still we strained anew    and delhi town was very near but nearer was the foe    yea delhi town was very near when lalun whispered  slay    lord of my life the mare sinks fast  stab deep and let me die   but scindia would not and the maid tore free and flung away    and turning as she fell we heard the clattering populzai    then scindia checked the gasping mare that rocked and groaned for breath    and wheeled to charge and plunged the knife a handsbreadth in her side    the hunter and the hunted know how that last pause is death     the blood had chilled about her heart she reared and fell and died    our gods were kind  before he heard the maidens piteous scream    a log upon the delhi road beneath the mare he lay    lost mistress and lost battle passed before him like a dream    the darkness closed about his eyes  i bore my king away     the ballad of boh da thone               this is the ballad of boh da thone             erst a pretender to theebaws throne             who harried the district of alalone             how he met with his fate and the vpp             at the hand of harendra mukerji             senior gomashta gbt        value payable parcels post  in which the government      collects the money for the sender    boh da thone was a warrior bold   his sword and his snider were bossed with gold    and the peacock banner his henchmen bore   was stiff with bullion but stiffer with gore    he shot at the strong and he slashed at the weak   from the salween scrub to the chindwin teak    he crucified noble he sacrificed mean   he filled old ladies with kerosene    while over the water the papers cried   the patriot fights for his countryside    but little they cared for the native press   the worn white soldiers in khaki dress    who tramped through the jungle and camped in the byre   who died in the swamp and were tombed in the mire    who gave up their lives at the queens command   for the pride of their race and the peace of the land    now first of the foemen of boh da thone   was captain oneil of the black tyrone    and his was a company seventy strong   who hustled that dissolute chief along    there were lads from galway and louth and meath   who went to their death with a joke in their teeth    and worshipped with fluency fervour and zeal   the mud on the bootheels of crook oneil    but ever a blight on their labours lay   and ever their quarry would vanish away    till the sundried boys of the black tyrone   took a brotherly interest in boh da thone    and sooth if pursuit in possession ends   the boh and his trackers were best of friends    the word of a scout  a march by night    a rush through the mist  a scattering fight     a volley from cover  a corpse in the clearing    the glimpse of a loincloth and heavy jade earring     the flare of a village  the tally of slain    and  the boh was abroad on the raid again    they cursed their luck as the irish will   they gave him credit for cunning and skill    they buried their dead they bolted their beef   and started anew on the track of the thief    till in place of the kalends of greece men said   when crook and his darlings come back with the head    they had hunted the boh from the hills to the plain    he doubled and broke for the hills again    they had crippled his power for rapine and raid   they had routed him out of his pet stockade    and at last they came when the day star tired   to a camp deserted  a village fired    a black cross blistered the morninggold   and the body upon it was stark and cold    the wind of the dawn went merrily past   the high grass bowed her plumes to the blast    and out of the grass on a sudden broke   a spirtle of fire a whorl of smoke     and captain oneil of the black tyrone   was blessed with a slug in the ulnarbone    the gift of his enemy boh da thone    now a slug that is hammered from telegraphwire   is a thorn in the flesh and a rankling fire                             the shotwound festered  as shotwounds may   in a steaming barrack at mandalay    the left arm throbbed and the captain swore   id like to be after the boh once more    the fever held him  the captain said   id give a hundred to look at his head    the hospital punkahs creaked and whirred   but babu harendra gomashta heard    he thought of the canebrake green and dank   that girdled his home by the dacca tank    he thought of his wife and his high school son   he thought  but abandoned the thought  of a gun    his sleep was broken by visions dread   of a shining boh with a silver head    he kept his counsel and went his way   and swindled the cartmen of half their pay                             and the months went on as the worst must do   and the boh returned to the raid anew    but the captain had quitted the longdrawn strife   and in far simoorie had taken a wife    and she was a damsel of delicate mould   with hair like the sunshine and heart of gold    and little she knew the arms that embraced   had cloven a man from the brow to the waist    and little she knew that the loving lips   had ordered a quivering lifes eclipse    and the eye that lit at her lightest breath   had glared unawed in the gates of death    for these be matters a man would hide   as a general rule from an innocent bride    and little the captain thought of the past   and of all men babu harendra last                             but slow in the sludge of the kathun road   the government bullock train toted its load    speckless and spotless and shining with ghee   in the rearmost cart sat the babujee    and ever a phantom before him fled   of a scowling boh with a silver head    then the leadcart stuck though the coolies slaved   and the cartmen flogged and the escort raved    and out of the jungle with yells and squeals   pranced boh da thone and his gang at his heels    then belching blunderbuss answered back   the sniders snarl and the carbines crack    and the blithe revolver began to sing   to the blade that twanged on the lockingring    and the brown flesh blued where the baynet kissed   as the steel shot back with a wrench and a twist    and the great white bullocks with onyx eyes   watched the souls of the dead arise    and over the smoke of the fusillade   the peacock banner staggered and swayed    oh gayest of scrimmages man may see   is a wellworked rush on the gbt    the babu shook at the horrible sight   and girded his ponderous loins for flight    but fate had ordained that the boh should start   on a lonehand raid of the rearmost cart    and out of that cart with a bellow of woe   the babu fell  flat on the top of the boh    for years had harendra served the state   to the growth of his purse and the girth of his pet    there were twenty stone as the tallyman knows   on the broad of the chest of this best of bohs    and twenty stone from a height discharged   are bad for a boh with a spleen enlarged    oh short was the struggle  severe was the shock    he dropped like a bullock  he lay like a block    and the babu above him convulsed with fear   heard the labouring lifebreath hissed out in his ear    and thus in a fashion undignified   the princely pest of the chindwin died                             turn now to simoorie where lapped in his ease   the captain is petting the bride on his knees    where the whit of the bullet the wounded mans scream   are mixed as the mist of some devilish dream     forgotten forgotten the sweat of the shambles   where the hilldaisy blooms and the gray monkey gambols    from the swordbelt set free and released from the steel   the peace of the lord is with captain oneil                             up the hill to simoorie  most patient of drudges    the bags on his shoulder the mailrunner trudges    for captain oneil sahib  one hundred and ten   rupees to collect on delivery                                    then    their breakfast was stopped while the screwjack and hammer   tore waxcloth split teakwood and chipped out the dammer    openeyed openmouthed on the naperys snow   with a crash and a thud rolled  the head of the boh    and gummed to the scalp was a letter which ran                   in fielding force service                       encampment                                 10th jan    dear sir  i have honour to send as you said

as the rabbit is drawn to the rattlesnakes power   as the smokers eye fills at the opium hour    as a horse reaches up to the manger above   as the waiting ear yearns for the whisper of love    from the arms of the bride ironvisaged and slow   the captain bent down to the head of the boh    and een as he looked on the thing where it lay   twixt the winking new spoons and the napkins array    the freed mind fled back to the longago days    the handtohand scuffle  the smoke and the blaze     the forced march at night and the quick rush at dawn    the banjo at twilight the burial ere morn     the stench of the marshes  the raw piercing smell   when the overhand stabbingcut silenced the yell     the oaths of his irish that surged when they stood   where the black crosses hung oer the kuttamow flood    as a derelict ship drifts away with the tide   the captain went out on the past from his bride    back back through the springs to the chill of the year   when he hunted the boh from maloon to tsaleer    as the shape of a corpse dimmers up through deep water   in his eye lit the passionless passion of slaughter    and men who had fought with oneil for the life   had gazed on his face with less dread than his wife    for she who had held him so long could not hold him    though a fourmonth eternity should have controlled him     but watched the twin terror  the head turned to head    the scowling scarred black and the flushed savage red     the spirit that changed from her knowing and flew to   some grim hidden past she had never a clue to    but it knew as it grinned for he touched it unfearing   and muttered aloud so you kept that jade earring    then nodded and kindly as friend nods to friend   old man you fought well but you lost in the end                             the visions departed and shame followed passion    he took what i said in this horrible fashion    ill write to harendra  with language unsainted   the captain came back to the bride  who had fainted                             and this is a fiction  no  go to simoorie   and look at their baby a twelvemonth old houri    a pert little irisheyed kathleen mavournin    shes always about on the mall of a mornin     and youll see if her right shoulderstrap is displaced   this  gules upon argent a bohs head erased      the lament of the border cattle thief     o woe is me for the merry life    i led beyond the bar   and a treble woe for my winsome wife    that weeps at shalimar    they have taken away my long jezail    my shield and sabre fine   and heaved me into the central jail    for lifting of the kine    the steer may low within the byre    the jat may tend his grain   but therell be neither loot nor fire    till i come back again    and god have mercy on the jat    when once my

of the zukka kheyl    and if i fall to your hand afresh    i give you leave for the sin   that you cram my throat with the foul pigs flesh    and swing me in the skin     the rhyme of the three captains          this ballad appears to refer to one of the exploits of the notorious        paul jones the american pirate  it is founded on fact           at the close of a winter day   their anchors down by london town the three great captains lay   and one was admiral of the north from solway firth to skye   and one was lord of the wessex coast and all the lands thereby   and one was master of the thames from limehouse to blackwall   and he was captain of the fleet  the bravest of them all   their good guns guarded their great gray sides     that were thirty foot in the sheer   when there came a certain tradingbrig with news of a privateer   her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a northern breeze   her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the eastern seas   light she rode in the rude tiderip to left and right she rolled   and the skipper sat on the scuttlebutt and stared at an empty hold   i ha paid port dues for your law quoth he and where is the law ye boast   if i sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a christian coast   ye have smoked the hives of the laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk   we tack not now to a gallang prow or a plunging peiho junk   i had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare   till i met with a limewashed yankee brig that rode off finisterre   there were canvas blinds to his bowgun ports to screen the weight he bore   and the signals ran for a merchantman from sandy hook to the nore   he would not fly the rovers flag  the bloody or the black   but now he floated the gridiron and now he flaunted the jack   he spoke of the law as he crimped my crew  he swore it was only a loan   but when i would ask for my own again he swore it was none of my own   he has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the line   he has stripped my rails of the shaddockfrails and the green unripened pine   he has taken my bale of dammer and spice i won beyond the seas   he has taken my grinning heathen gods  and what should he want o these   my foremast would not mend his boom my deckhouse patch his boats   he has whittled the two this yank yahoo to peddle for shoepeg oats   i could not fight for the failing light and a rough beamsea beside   but i hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied   had i had guns as i had goods to work my christian harm   i had run him up from his quarterdeck to trade with his own yardarm   i had nailed his ears to my capstanhead and ripped them off with a saw   and soused them in the bilgewater and served them to him raw   i had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark   i had towed him aft of his own craft a bait for his brother shark   i had lapped him round with cocoa husk and drenched him with the oil   and lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil   i had stripped his hide for my hammockside     and tasselled his beard i the mesh   and spitted his crew on the live bamboo     that grows through the gangrened flesh   i had hove him down by the mangroves brown     where the mudreef sucks and draws   moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the landcrabs claws   he is lazar within and lime without ye can nose him far enow   for he carries the taint of a musky ship  the reek of the slavers dhow   the skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold   and the captains three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold   and the captains three called courteously from deck to scuttlebutt    good sir we ha dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut   your words be words of a lawless race and the law it standeth thus   he comes of a race that have never a law and he never has boarded us   we ha sold him canvas and rope and spar  we know that his price is fair   and we know that he weeps for the lack of a law as he rides off finisterre   and since he is damned for a gallowsthief by you and better than you   we hold it meet that the english fleet should know that we hold him true   the skipper called to the tall taffrail  and what is that to me   did ever you hear of a yankee brig that rifled a seventythree   do i loom so large from your quarterdeck that i lift like a ship o the line   he has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine   there is never a law on the cocos keys to hold a white man in   but we do not steal the niggers meal for that is a niggers sin   must he have his law as a quid to chaw or laid in brass on his wheel   does he steal with tears when he buccaneers     fore gad then why does he steal   the skipper bit on a deepsea word and the word it was not sweet   for he could see the captains three had signalled to the fleet   but three and two in white and blue the whimpering flags began    we have heard a tale of a  foreign sail but he is a merchantman   the skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the great horn spoon    fore gad the chaplain of the fleet would bless my picaroon   by two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air    we have sold our spars to the merchantman  we know that his price is fair   the skipper winked his western eye and swore by a china storm    they ha rigged him a josephs jurycoat to keep his honour warm   the halliards twanged against the tops the bunting bellied broad   the skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord   masthead  masthead the signal sped by the line o the british craft   the skipper called to his lascar crew and put her about and laughed    its mainsail haul my bully boys all  well out to the seas again    ere they set us to paint their pirate saint or scrub at his grapnelchain   its foresheet free with her head to the sea     and the swing of the unbought brine    well make no sport in an english court till we come as a ship o the line   till we come as a ship o the line my lads of thirty foot in the sheer   lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer   flying his pluck at our mizzentruck for weft of admiralty   heaving his head for our dipseylead in sign that we keep the sea   then foresheet home as she lifts to the foam  we stand on the outward tack   we are paid in the coin of the white mans trade      the bezant is hard ay and black   the frigatebird shall carry my word to the kling and the oranglaut   how a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed in a christian port   how a man may be robbed in christian port while three great captains there   shall dip their flag to a slavers rag  to show that his trade is fair     the ballad of the clampherdown     it was our warship clampherdown    would sweep the channel clean   wherefore she kept her hatches close   when the merry channel chops arose    to save the bleached marine    she had one bowgun of a hundred ton    and a great sterngun beside   they dipped their noses deep in the sea   they racked their stays and stanchions free    in the wash of the windwhipped tide    it was our warship clampherdown    fell in with a cruiser light   that carried the dainty hotchkiss gun   and a pair o heels wherewith to run    from the grip of a closefought fight    she opened fire at seven miles     as ye shoot at a bobbing cork    and once she fired and twice she fired   till the bowgun drooped like a lily tired    that lolls upon the stalk    captain the bowgun melts apace    the deckbeams break below   twere well to rest for an hour or twain   and botch the shattered plates again    and he answered make it so    she opened fire within the mile     as ye shoot at the flying duck    and the great sterngun shot fair and true   with the heave of the ship to the stainless blue    and the great sternturret stuck    captain the turret fills with steam    the feedpipes burst below    you can hear the hiss of the helpless ram   you can hear the twisted runners jam    and he answered turn and go    it was our warship clampherdown    and grimly did she roll   swung round to take the cruisers fire   as the white whale faces the threshers ire    when they war by the frozen pole    captain the shells are falling fast    and faster still fall we   and it is not meet for english stock   to bide in the heart of an eightday clock    the death they cannot see    lie down lie down my bold ab    we drift upon her beam   we dare not ram for she can run   and dare ye fire another gun    and die in the peeling steam    it was our warship clampherdown    that carried an armourbelt   but fifty feet at stern and bow   lay bare as the paunch of the pursers sow    to the hail of the nordenfeldt    captain they hack us through and through    the chilled steel bolts are swift   we have emptied the bunkers in open sea   their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be    and he answered let her drift    it was our warship clampherdown    swung round upon the tide   her two dumb guns glared south and north   and the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth    and she ground the cruisers side    captain they cry the fight is done    they bid you send your sword   and he answered grapple her stern and bow   they have asked for the steel  they shall have it now    out cutlasses and board    it was our warship clampherdown    spewed up four hundred men   and the scalded stokers yelped delight   as they rolled in the waist and heard the fight    stamp oer their steelwalled pen    they cleared the cruiser end to end    from conningtower to hold   they fought as they fought in nelsons fleet   they were stripped to the waist they were bare to the feet    as it was in the days of old    it was the sinking clampherdown    heaved up her battered side    and carried a million pounds in steel   to the cod and the corpsefed congereel    and the scour of the channel tide    it was the crew of the clampherdown    stood out to sweep the sea   on a cruiser won from an ancient foe   as it was in the days of long ago    and as it still shall be     the ballad of the bolivar          seven men from all the world back to docks again        rolling down the ratcliffe road drunk and raising cain        give the girls another drink fore we sign away         we that took the bolivar out across the bay    we put out from sunderland loaded down with rails    we put back to sunderland cause our cargo shifted   we put out from sunderland  met the winter gales     seven days and seven nights to the start we drifted       racketing her rivets loose smokestack white as snow       all the coals adrift adeck half the rails below       leaking like a lobsterpot steering like a dray        out we took the bolivar out across the bay    one by one the lights came up winked and let us by    mile by mile we waddled on coal and focsle short   met a blow that laid us down heard a bulkhead fly    left the wolf behind us with a twofoot list to port       trailing like a wounded duck working out her soul       clanging like a smithyshop after every roll       just a funnel and a mast lurching through the spray        so we threshed the bolivar out across the bay    felt her hog and felt her sag betted when shed break    wondered every time she raced if shed stand the shock   heard the seas like drunken men pounding at her strake    hoped the lord ud keep his thumb on the plummerblock       banged against the iron decks bilges choked with coal       flayed and frozen foot and hand sick of heart and soul       last we prayed shed buck herself into judgment day        hi we cursed the bolivar knocking round the bay    o her nose flung up to sky groaning to be still     up and down and back we went never time for breath   then the money paid at lloyds caught her by the heel    and the stars ran round and round dancin at our death       aching for an hours sleep dozing off between       heard the rotten rivets draw when she took it green       watched the compass chase its tail like a cat at play        that was on the bolivar south across the bay    once we saw between the squalls lyin head to swell     mad with work and weariness wishin they was we    some damned liners lights go by like a long hotel    cheered her from the bolivar swampin in the sea       then a grayback cleared us out then the skipper laughed       boys the wheel has gone to hell  rig the winches aft       yoke the kicking rudderhead  get her under way       so we steered her pulleyhaul out across the bay    just a pack o rotten plates puttied up with tar   in we came an time enough cross bilbao bar       overloaded

raising cain        seven men from out of hell  aint the owners gay        cause we took the bolivar safe across the bay     the sacrifice of erheb          erheb beyond the hills of aosafai

weltered in the valley bluishwhite   like water very silent  spread abroad   like water very silent from the shrine   unlighted of taman to where the stream   is dammed to fill our cattletroughs  sent up   white waves that rocked and heaved and then were still   till all the valley glittered like a marsh   beneath the moonlight filled with sluggish mist   kneedeep so that men waded as they walked    that night the red horse grazed above the dam   beyond the cattletroughs  men heard him feed   and those that heard him sickened where they lay    thus came the sickness to erheb and slew   ten men strong men and of the women four   and the red horse went hillward with the dawn   but near the cattletroughs his hoofprints lay    that night the slow mists of the evening dropped   dropped as a cloth upon the dead but rose   a little higher to a young girls height   till all the valley glittered like a lake   beneath the moonlight filled with sluggish mist    that night the red horse grazed beyond the dam   a stonesthrow from the troughs  men heard him feed   and those that heard him sickened where they lay   thus came the sickness to erheb and slew   of men a score and of the women eight   and of the children two                              because the road   to gorukh was a road of enemies   and aosafai was blocked with early snow   we could not flee from out the valley  death   smote at us in a slaughterpen and kysh   was mute as yabosh though the goats were slain   and the red horse grazed nightly by the stream   and later outward towards the unlighted shrine   and those that heard him sickened where they lay    then said bisesa to the priests at dusk   when the white mist rose up breasthigh and choked   the voices in the houses of the dead    yabosh and kysh avail not  if the horse   reach the unlighted shrine we surely die   ye have forgotten of all gods the chief   taman  here rolled the thunder through the hills   and yabosh shook upon his pedestal   ye have forgotten of all gods the chief   too long  and all were dumb save one who cried   on yabosh with the sapphire twixt his knees   but found no answer in the smoky roof   and being smitten of the sickness died   before the altar of the sapphire shrine    then said bisesa  i am near to death   and have the wisdom of the grave for gift   to bear me on the path my feet must tread   if there be wealth on earth then i am rich   for armod is the first of all erheb   if there be beauty on the earth  her eyes   dropped for a moment to the temple floor    ye know that i am fair  if there be love   ye know that love is mine  the chief in war   the man of sixty spears broke from the press   and would have clasped her but the priests withstood   saying  she has a message from taman   then said bisesa  by my wealth and love   and beauty i am chosen of the god   taman  here rolled the thunder through the hills   and kysh fell forward on the mound of skulls    in darkness and before our priests the maid   between the altars cast her bracelets down   therewith the heavy earrings armod made   when he was young out of the watergold   of gorukh  threw the breastplate thick with jade   upon the turquoise anklets  put aside   the bands of silver on her brow and neck   and as the trinkets tinkled on the stones   the thunder of taman lowed like a bull    then said bisesa stretching out her hands   as one in darkness fearing devils  help   o priests i am a woman very weak   and who am i to know the will of gods   taman hath called me  whither shall i go   the chief in war the man of sixty spears   howled in his torment fettered by the priests   but dared not come to her to drag her forth   and dared not lift his spear against the priests   then all men wept                        there was a priest of kysh   bent with a hundred winters hairless blind   and taloned as the great snoweagle is   his seat was nearest to the altarfires   and he was counted dumb among the priests   but whether kysh decreed or from taman   the impotent tongue found utterance we know   as little as the bats beneath the eaves   he cried so that they heard who stood without    to the unlighted shrine and crept aside   into the shadow of his fallen god   and whimpered and bisesa went her way    that night the slow mists of the evening dropped   dropped as a cloth upon the dead and rose   above the roofs and by the unlighted shrine   lay as the slimy water of the troughs   when murrain thins the cattle of erheb   and through the mist men heard the red horse feed    in armods house they burned bisesas dower   and killed her black bull tor and broke her wheel   and loosed her hair as for the marriagefeast   with cries more loud than mourning for the dead    across the fields from armods dwellingplace   we heard bisesa weeping where she passed   to seek the unlighted shrine the red horse neighed   and followed her and on the rivermint   his hooves struck dead and heavy in our ears    out of the mists of evening as the star   of aosafai climbs through the black snowblur   to show the pass is clear bisesa stepped   upon the great gray slope of mortised stone   the causeway of taman  the red horse neighed   behind her to the unlighted shrine  then fled   north to the mountain where his stable lies    they know who dared the anger of taman   and watched that night above the clinging mists   far up the hill bisesas passing in    she set her hand upon the carven door   fouled by a myriad bats and black with time   whereon is graved the glory of taman   in letters older than the aosafai   and twice she turned aside and twice she wept   cast down upon the threshold clamouring   for him she loved  the man of sixty spears   and for her father  and the black bull tor   hers and her pride  yea twice she turned away   before the awful darkness of the door   and the great horror of the wall of man   where man is made the plaything of taman   an eyeless face that waits above and laughs    but the third time she cried and put her palms   against the hewn stone leaves and prayed taman   to spare erheb and take her life for price    they know who watched the doors were rent apart   and closed upon bisesa and the rain   broke like a flood across the valley washed   the mist away but louder than the rain   the thunder of taman filled men with fear    some say that from the unlighted shrine she cried   for succour very pitifully thrice   and others that she sang and had no fear   and some that there was neither song nor cry   but only thunder and the lashing rain    howbeit in the morning men rose up   perplexed with horror crowding to the shrine   and when erheb was gathered at the doors   the priests made lamentation and passed in   to a strange temple and a god they feared   but knew not                   from the crevices the grass   had thrust the altarslabs apart the walls   were gray with stains unclean the roofbeams swelled   with manycoloured growth of rottenness   and lichen veiled the image of taman   in leprosy  the basin of the blood   above the altar held the morning sun   a winking ruby on its heart  below   face hid in hands the maid bisesa lay         erheb beyond the hills of aosafai        bears witness to the truth and aosafai        hath told the men of gorukh  thence the tale        comes westward oer the peaks to india     the explanation     love and death once ceased their strife   at the tavern of mans life   called for wine and threw  alas    each his quiver on the grass   when the bout was oer they found   mingled arrows strewed the ground   hastily they gathered then   each the loves and lives of men   ah the fateful dawn deceived   mingled arrows each one sheaved   deaths dread armoury was stored   with the shafts he most abhorred   loves light quiver groaned beneath   venomheaded darts of death    thus it was they wrought our woe   at the tavern long ago   tell me do our masters know   loosing blindly as they fly   old men love while young men die     the gift of the sea     the dead child lay in the shroud    and the widow watched beside   and her mother slept and the channel swept    the gale in the teeth of the tide    but the mother laughed at all    i have lost my man in the sea   and the child is dead  be still she said    what more can ye do to me    the widow watched the dead    and the candle guttered low   and she tried to sing the passing song    that bids the poor soul go    and mary take you now she sang    that lay against my heart   and mary smooth your crib tonight    but she could not say depart    then came a cry from the sea    but the searime blinded the glass   and heard ye nothing mother she said    tis the child that waits to pass    and the nodding mother sighed    tis a lambing ewe in the whin   for why should the christened soul cry out    that never knew of sin    o feet i have held in my hand    o hands at my heart to catch   how should they know the road to go    and how should they lift the latch    they laid a sheet to the door    with the little quilt atop   that it might not hurt from the cold or the dirt    but the crying would not stop    the widow lifted the latch    and strained her eyes to see   and opened the door on the bitter shore    to let the soul go free    there was neither glimmer nor ghost    there was neither spirit nor spark   and heard ye nothing mother she said    tis crying for me in the dark    and the nodding mother sighed    tis sorrow makes ye dull   have ye yet to learn the cry of the tern    or the wail of the windblown gull    the terns are blown inland    the gray gull follows the plough   twas never a bird the voice i heard    o mother i hear it now    lie still dear lamb lie still    the child is passed from harm   tis the ache in your breast that broke your rest    and the feel of an empty arm    she put her mother aside    in marys name let be   for the peace of my soul i must go she said    and she went to the calling sea    in the heel of the windbit pier    where the twisted weed was piled   she came to the life she had missed by an hour    for she came to a little child    she laid it into her breast    and back to her mother she came   but it would not feed and it would not heed    though she gave it her own childs name    and the dead child dripped on her breast    and her own in the shroud lay stark   and god forgive us mother she said    we let it die in the dark     evarra and his gods     read here   this is the story of evarra  man    maker of gods in lands beyond the sea    because the city gave him of her gold    because the caravans brought turquoises    because his life was sheltered by the king    so that no man should maim him none should steal    or break his rest with babble in the streets    when he was weary after toil he made    an image of his god in gold and pearl    with turquoise diadem and human eyes    a wonder in the sunshine known afar    and worshipped by the king but drunk with pride    because the city bowed to him for god    he wrote above the shrine  thus gods are made    and whoso makes them otherwise shall die    and all the city praised him     then he died    read here the story of evarra  man    maker of gods in lands beyond the sea    because the city had no wealth to give    because the caravans were spoiled afar    because his life was threatened by the king    so that all men despised him in the streets    he hewed the living rock with sweat and tears    and reared a god against the morninggold    a terror in the sunshine seen afar    and worshipped by the king but drunk with pride    because the city fawned to bring him back    he carved upon the plinth  thus gods are made    and whoso makes them otherwise shall die    and all the people praised him     then he died    read here the story of evarra  man    maker of gods in lands beyond the sea    because he lived among a simple folk    because his village was between the hills    because he smeared his cheeks with blood of ewes    he cut an idol from a fallen pine    smeared blood upon its cheeks and wedged a shell    above its brows for eyes and gave it hair    of trailing moss and plaited straw for crown    and all the village praised him for this craft    and brought him butter honey milk and curds    wherefore because the shoutings drove him mad    he scratched upon that log  thus gods are made    and whoso makes them otherwise shall die    and all the people praised him     then he died    read here the story of evarra  man    maker of gods in lands beyond the sea    because his god decreed one clot of blood    should swerve one hairsbreadth from the pulses path    and chafe his brain evarra mowed alone    ragwrapped among the cattle in the fields    counting his fingers jesting with the trees    and mocking at the mist until his god    drove him to labour  out of dung and horns    dropped in the mire he made a monstrous god    abhorrent shapeless crowned with plantain tufts    and when the cattle lowed at twilighttime    he dreamed it was the clamour of lost crowds    and howled among the beasts  thus gods are made    and whoso makes them otherwise shall die    thereat the cattle bellowed     then he died    yet at the last he came to paradise   and found his own four gods and that he wrote   and marvelled being very near to god   what oaf on earth had made his toil gods law   till god said mocking  mock not  these be thine   then cried evarra  i have sinned  not so   if thou hadst written otherwise thy gods   had rested in the mountain and the mine   and i were poorer by four wondrous gods   and thy more wondrous law evarra  thine   servant of shouting crowds and lowing kine   thereat with laughing mouth but tearwet eyes   evarra cast his gods from paradise    this is the story of evarra  man    maker of gods in lands beyond the sea     the conundrum of the workshops     when the flush of a newborn sun fell first on edens green and gold   our father adam sat under the tree and scratched with a stick in the mould   and the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart   till the devil whispered behind the leaves its pretty but is it art    wherefore he called to his wife and fled to fashion his work anew    the first of his race who cared a fig for the first most dread review   and he left his lore to the use of his sons  and that was a glorious gain   when the devil chuckled is it art in the ear of the branded cain    they fought and they talked in the north and the south     they talked and they fought in the west   till the waters rose on the pitiful land and the poor red clay had rest    had rest till that dank blankcanvas dawn when the dove was preened to start   and the devil bubbled below the keel  its human but is it art    they builded a tower to shiver the sky and wrench the stars apart   till the devil grunted behind the bricks  its striking but is it art   the stone was dropped at the quarryside and the idle derrick swung   while each man talked of the aims of art and each in an alien tongue    the tale is as old as the eden tree  and new as the newcut tooth    for each man knows ere his lipthatch grows he is master of art and truth   and each man hears as the twilight nears to the beat of his dying heart   the devil drum on the darkened pane  you did it but was it art    we have learned to whittle the eden tree to the shape of a surplicepeg   we have learned to bottle our parents twain in the yelk of an addled egg   we know that the tail must wag the dog for the horse is drawn by the cart   but the devil whoops as he whooped of old  its clever but is it art    when the flicker of london sun falls faint on the clubrooms green and gold   the sons of adam sit them down and scratch with their pens in the mould    they scratch with their pens in the mould of their graves     and the ink and the anguish start   for the devil mutters behind the leaves  its pretty but is it art    now if we could win to the eden tree where the four great rivers flow   and the wreath of eve is red on the turf as she left it long ago   and if we could come when the sentry slept and softly scurry through   by the favour of god we might know as much  as our father adam knew     the legend of evil       i    this is the sorrowful story    told when the twilight fails   and the monkeys walk together    holding their neighbours tails     our fathers lived in the forest    foolish people were they   they went down to the cornland    to teach the farmers to play    our fathers frisked in the millet    our fathers skipped in the wheat   our fathers hung from the branches    our fathers danced in the street    then came the terrible farmers    nothing of play they knew   only  they caught our fathers    and set them to labour too    set them to work in the cornland    with ploughs and sickles and flails   put them in mudwalled prisons    and  cut off their beautiful tails    now we can watch our fathers    sullen and bowed and old   stooping over the millet    sharing the silly mould    driving a foolish furrow    mending a muddy yoke   sleeping in mudwalled prisons    steeping their food in smoke    we may not speak to our fathers    for if the farmers knew   they would come up to the forest    and set us to labour too    this is the horrible story    told as the twilight fails   and the monkeys walk together    holding their kinsmens tails       ii    twas when the rain fell steady an the

the incident  daily papers     winds of the world give answer  they are whimpering to and fro    and what should they know of england who only england know    the poor little streetbred people that vapour and fume and brag   they are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the english flag    must we borrow a clout from the boer  to plaster anew with dirt   an irish liars bandage or an

main   where the seaegg flames on the coral and the longbacked breakers croon   their endless ocean legends to the lazy locked lagoon    strayed amid lonely islets mazed amid outer keys   i waked the palms to laughter  i tossed the scud in the breeze    never was isle so little never was sea so lone   but over the scud and the palmtrees an english flag was flown    i have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang for a wisp on the horn   i have chased it north to the lizard  ribboned and rolled and torn   i have spread its fold oer the dying adrift in a hopeless sea   i have hurled it swift on

 the day that the laugh of a maiden made light of the lords of their hands     tomlinson     now tomlinson gave up the ghost in his house in berkeley square   and a spirit came to his bedside and gripped him by the hair    a spirit gripped him by the hair and carried him far away   till he heard as the roar of a rainfed ford the roar of the milky way   till he heard the roar of the milky way die down and drone and cease   and they came to the gate within the wall where peter holds the keys   stand up stand up now tomlinson and answer loud and high   the good that ye did for the sake of men or ever ye came to die    the good that ye did for the sake of men in little earth so lone   and the naked soul of tomlinson grew white as a rainwashed bone   o i have a friend on earth he said that was my priest and guide   and well would he answer all for me if he were by my side    for that ye strove in neighbourlove it shall be written fair   but now ye wait at heavens gate and not in berkeley square   though we called your friend from his bed this night     he could not speak for you   for the race is run by one and one and never by two and two   then tomlinson looked up and down and little gain was there   for the naked stars grinned overhead and he saw that his soul was bare   the wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knife   and tomlinson took up his tale and spoke of his good in life   this i have read in a book he said and that was told to me   and this i have thought that another man thought of a prince in muscovy   the good souls flocked like homing doves and bade him clear the path   and peter twirled the jangling keys in weariness and wrath   ye have read ye have heard ye have thought he said     and the tale is yet to run   by the worth of the body that once ye had give answer  what ha ye done   then tomlinson looked back and forth and little good it bore   for the darkness stayed at his shoulderblade and heavens gate before    o this i have felt and this i have guessed and this i have heard men say   and this they wrote that another man wrote of a carl in norroway    ye have read ye have felt ye have guessed good lack     ye have hampered heavens gate   theres little room between the stars in idleness to prate   o none may reach by hired speech of neighbour priest and kin   through borrowed deed to gods good meed that lies so fair within   get hence get hence to the lord of wrong for doom has yet to run   and  the faith that ye share with berkeley square uphold you tomlinson                             the spirit gripped him by the hair and sun by sun they fell   till they came to the belt of naughty stars that rim the mouth of hell   the first are red with pride and wrath the next are white with pain   but the third are black with clinkered sin that cannot burn again   they may hold their path they may leave their path     with never a soul to mark   they may burn or freeze but they must not cease     in the scorn of the outer dark   the wind that blows between the worlds it nipped him to the bone   and he yearned to the flare of hellgate     there as the light of his own hearthstone   the devil he sat behind the bars where the desperate legions drew   but he caught the hasting tomlinson and would not let him through   wot ye the price of good pitcoal that i must pay said he   that ye rank yoursel so fit for hell and ask no leave of me   i am all oersib to adams breed that ye should give me scorn   for i strove with god for your first father the day that he was born   sit down sit down upon the slag and answer loud and high   the harm that ye did to the sons of men or ever you came to die   and tomlinson looked up and up and saw against the night   the belly of a tortured star bloodred in hellmouth light   and tomlinson looked down and down and saw beneath his feet   the frontlet of a tortured star milkwhite in hellmouth heat   o i had a love on earth said he that kissed me to my fall   and if ye would call my love to me i know she would answer all    all that ye did in love forbid it shall be written fair   but now ye wait at hellmouth gate and not in berkeley square   though we whistled your love from her bed tonight i trow she would not run   for the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one   the wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knife   and tomlinson took up the tale and spoke of his sin in life    once i ha laughed at the power of love and twice at the grip of the grave   and thrice i ha patted my god on the head that men might call me brave   the devil he blew on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool    do ye think i would waste my good pitcoal on the hide of a brainsick fool   i see no worth in the hobnailed mirth or the jolthead jest ye did   that i should waken my gentlemen that are sleeping three on a grid   then tomlinson looked back and forth and there was little grace   for hellgate filled the houseless soul with the fear of naked space   nay this i ha heard quo  tomlinson and this was noised abroad   and this i ha got from a belgian book on the word of a dead french lord    ye ha heard ye ha read ye ha got good lack     and the tale begins afresh    have ye sinned one sin for the pride o the eye     or the sinful lust of the flesh   then tomlinson he gripped the bars and yammered let me in    for i mind that i borrowed my neighbours wife to sin the deadly sin   the devil he grinned behind the bars and banked the fires high   did ye read of that sin in a book said he and tomlinson said ay   the devil he blew upon his nails and the little devils ran   and he said  go husk this whimpering thief that comes in the guise of a man   winnow him out twixt star and star and sieve his proper worth   theres sore decline in adams line if this be spawn of earth   empusas crew so nakednew they may not face the fire   but weep that they bin too small to sin to the height of their desire   over the coal they chased the soul and racked it all abroad   as children rifle a caddiscase or the ravens foolish hoard   and back they came with the tattered thing as children after play   and they said  the soul that he got from god he has bartered clean away   we have threshed a stook of print and book and winnowed a chattering wind   and many a soul wherefrom he stole but his we cannot find   we have handled him we have dandled him we have seared him to the bone   and sure if tooth and nail show truth he has no soul of his own   the devil he bowed his head on his breast and rumbled deep and low    im all oersib to adams breed that i should bid him go   yet close we lie and deep we lie and if i gave him place   my gentlemen that are so proud would flout me to my face   theyd call my house a common stews and me a careless host   and  i would not anger my gentlemen for the sake of a shiftless ghost   the devil he looked at the mangled soul that prayed to feel the flame   and he thought of holy charity but he thought of his own good name    now ye could haste my coal to waste and sit ye down to fry   did ye think of that theft for yourself said he and tomlinson said ay   the devil he blew an outward breath for his heart was free from care    ye have scarce the soul of a louse he said     but the roots of sin are there   and for that sin should ye come in were i the lord alone   but sinful pride has rule inside  and mightier than my own   honour and wit foredamned they sit to each his priest and whore   nay scarce i dare myself go there and you theyd torture sore   ye are neither spirit nor spirk he said ye are neither book nor brute    go get ye back to the flesh again for the sake of mans repute   im all oersib to adams breed that i should mock your pain   but look that ye win to worthier sin ere ye come back again   get hence the hearse is at your door  the grim black stallions wait    they bear your clay to place today  speed lest ye come too late   go back to earth with a lip unsealed  go back with an open eye   and carry my word to the sons of men or ever ye come to die   that the sin they do by two and two they must pay for one by one    and  the god that you took from a printed book be with you tomlinson     lenvoi to lifes handicap     my newcut ashlar takes the light    where crimsonblank the windows flare   by my own work before the night

 mine was the woman to me darkling i found her   haling her dumb from the camp took her and bound her   hot rose her tribe on our track ere i had proved her   hearing her laugh in the gloom greatly i loved her    swift through the forest we ran none stood to guard us   few were my people and far then the flood barred us    him we call son of the sea sullen and swollen   panting we waited the death stealer and stolen    yet ere they came to my lance laid for the slaughter   lightly she leaped to a log lapped in the water   holding on high and apart skins that arrayed her   called she the god of the wind that he should aid her    life had the tree at that word praise we the giver   otterlike left he the bank for the full river   far fell their axes behind flashing and ringing   wonder was on me and fear  yet she was singing    low lay the land we had left  now the blue bound us   even the floor of the gods level around us   whisper there was not nor word shadow nor showing   till the light stirred on the deep glowing and growing    then did he leap to his place flaring from under   he the compeller the sun bared to our wonder   nay not a league from our eyes blinded with gazing   cleared he the gate of the world huge and amazing    this we beheld and we live  the pit of the burning   then the god spoke to the tree for our returning   back to the beach of our flight fearless and slowly   back to our slayers went he  but we were holy    men that were hot in that hunt women that followed   babes that were promised our bones trembled and wallowed   over the necks of the tribe crouching and fawning    prophet and priestess we came back from the dawning     the last chantey    and there was no more sea     thus said the lord in the vault above the cherubim    calling to the angels and the souls in their degree     lo  earth has passed away     on the smoke of judgment day    that our word may be established shall we gather up the sea    loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners    plague upon the hurricane that made us furl and flee     but the war is done between us     in the deep the lord hath seen us     our bones well leave the barracout and god may sink the sea    then said the soul of judas that betray\ed him    lord hast thou forgotten thy covenant with me     how once a year i go     to cool me on the floe    and ye take my day of mercy if ye take away the sea    then said the soul of the angel of the offshore wind    he that bits the thunder when the bullmouthed breakers flee     i have watch and ward to keep     oer thy wonders on the deep    and ye take mine honour from me if ye take away the sea    loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners    nay but we were angry and a hasty folk are we     if we worked the ship together     till she foundered in foul weather    are we babes that we should clamour for a vengeance on the sea    then said the souls of the slaves that men threw overboard    kennelled in the picaroon a weary band were we     but thy arm was strong to save     and it touched us on the wave    and we drowsed the long tides idle till thy trumpets tore the sea    then cried the soul of the stout apostle paul to god    once we frapped a ship and she laboured woundily     there were fourteen score of these     and they blessed thee on their knees    when they learned thy grace and glory under malta by the sea    loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners    plucking at their harps and they plucked unhandily     our thumbs are rough and tarred     and the tune is something hard     may we lift a deepsea chantey such as seamen use at sea    then said the souls of the gentlemenadventurers     fettered wrist to bar all for red iniquity     ho we revel in our chains     oer the sorrow that was spains    heave or sink it leave or drink it we were masters of the sea    up spake the soul of a gray gothavn speckshioner     he that led the flinching in the fleets of fair dundee     oh the iceblink white and near     and the bowhead breaching clear    will ye whelm them all for wantonness that wallow in the sea    loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners    crying  under heaven here is neither lead nor lee     must we sing for evermore     on the windless glassy floor    take back your golden fiddles and well beat to open sea    then stooped the lord and he called the good sea up to him    and stablished his borders unto all eternity     that such as have no pleasure     for to praise the lord by measure    they may enter into galleons and serve him on the sea         sun wind and cloud shall fail not from the face of it         stinging ringing spindrift nor the fulmar flying free          and the ships shall go abroad          to the glory of the lord         who heard the silly sailorfolk and gave them back their sea     the merchantmen     king solomon drew merchantmen    because of his desire   for peacocks apes and ivory    from tarshish unto tyre   with

and floe   and the northern lights come down o nights to dance with the houseless snow   and god who clears the grounding berg and steers the grinding floe   he hears the cry of the little kitfox and the wind along the snow   but since our women must walk gay and money buys their gear   the sealingboats they filch that way at hazard year by year   english they be and japanee that hang on the brown bears flank   and some be scot but the worst of the lot and the boldest thieves be yank    it was the sealer northern light to the smoky seas she bore   with a stovepipe stuck from a starboard port and the russian flag at her fore   baltic stralsund and northern light      oh they were birds of a feather    slipping away to the smoky seas three sealthieves together   and at last she came to a sandy cove and the baltic lay therein   but her men were up with the herding seal to drive and club and skin   there were fifteen hundred skins abeach cool pelt and proper fur   when the northern light drove into the bight     and the seamist drove with her   the baltic called her men and weighed  she could not choose but run    for a stovepipe seen through the closing mist it shows like a fourinch gun   and loss it is that is sad as death to lose both trip and ship   and lie for a rotting contraband on vladivostock slip   she turned and dived in the seasmother as a rabbit dives in the whins   and the northern light sent up her boats to steal the stolen skins   they had not brought a load to side or slid their hatches clear   when they were aware of a sloopofwar ghostwhite and very near   her flag she showed and her guns she showed  three of them black abeam   and a funnel white with the crusted salt but never a show of steam    there was no time to man the brakes they knocked the shackle free   and the northern light stood out again goosewinged to open sea   for life it is that is worse than death by force of russian law   to work in the mines of mercury that loose the teeth in your jaw   they had not run a mile from shore  they heard no shots behind    when the skipper smote his hand on his thigh and threw her up in the wind   bluffed  raised out on a bluff said he for if my names tom hall   you must set a thief to catch a thief  and a thief has caught us all   by every butt in oregon and every spar in maine   the hand that spilled the wind from her sail was the hand of reuben paine   he has rigged and trigged her with paint and spar     and faith he has faked her well    but id know the stralsunds deckhouse yet from here to the booms o hell   oh once we ha met at baltimore and twice on boston pier   but the sickest day for you reuben paine was the day that you came here    the day that you came here my lad to scare us from our seal   with your funnel made o your painted cloth and your guns o rotten deal   ring and blow for the baltic now and head her back to the bay   and well come into the game again  with a double deck to play    they rang and blew the sealers call  the poaching cry of the sea    and they raised the baltic out of the mist and an angry ship was she   and blind they groped through the whirling white and blind to the bay again   till they heard the creak of the stralsunds boom     and the clank of her mooring chain   they laid them down by bitt and boat their pistols in their belts   and  will you fight for it reuben paine or will you share the pelts    a dogtoothed laugh laughed reuben paine and bared his flenchingknife   yea skin for skin and all that he hath a man will give for his life   but ive six thousand skins below and yeddo port to see   and theres never a law of god or man runs north of fiftythree   so go in peace to the naked seas with empty holds to fill   and ill be good to your seal this catch as many as i shall kill    answered the snap of a closing lock and the jar of a gunbutt slid   but the tender fog shut fold on fold to hide the wrong they did   the weeping fog rolled fold on fold the wrath of man to cloak   and the flamespurts pale ran down the rail as the sealingrifles spoke   the bullets bit on bend and butt the splinter slivered free   little they trust to sparrowdust that stop the seal in his sea   the thick smoke hung and would not shift leaden it lay and blue   but three were down on the baltics deck and two of the stralsunds crew   an armslength out and overside the banked fog held them bound   but as they heard or groan or word they fired at the sound   for one cried out on the name of god and one to have him cease   and the questing volley found them both and bade them hold their peace   and one called out on a heathen joss and one on the virgins name   and the schooling bullet leaped across and showed them whence they came   and in the waiting silences the rudder whined beneath   and each man drew his watchful breath slow taken tween the teeth    trigger and ear and eye acock knit brow and harddrawn lips    bracing his feet by chock and cleat for the rolling of the ships   till they heard the cough of a wounded man that fought in the fog for breath   till they heard the torment of reuben paine that wailed upon his death    the tides theyll go through fundy race but ill go nevermore   and see the hogs from ebbtide mark turn scampering back to shore   no more ill see the trawlers drift below the bass rock ground   or watch the tall fall steamer lights tear blazing up the sound   sorrow is me in a lonely sea and a sinful fight i fall   but if theres law o god or man youll swing for it yet tom hall   tom hall stood up by the quarterrail  your words in your teeth said he   theres never a law of god or man runs north of fiftythree   so go in grace with him to face and an illspent life behind   and ill be good to your widows rube as many as i shall find    a stralsund man shot blind and large and a warlock finn was he   and he hit tom hall with a bursting ball a handsbreadth over the knee   tom hall caught hold by the toppinglift and sat him down with an oath   youll wait a little rube he said the devil has called for both   the devil is driving both this tide and the killinggrounds are close   and well go up to the wrath of god as the holluschickie goes   o men put back your guns again and lay your rifles by   weve fought our fight and the best are down  let up and let us die   quit firing by the bow there  quit  call off the baltics crew   youre sure of hell as me or rube  but wait till we get through   there went no word between the ships but thick and quick and loud   the lifeblood drummed on the dripping decks     with the fogdew from the shroud   the seapull drew them side by side gunnel to gunnel laid   and they felt the sheerstrakes pound and clear but never a word was said    then reuben paine cried out again before his spirit passed   have i followed the sea for thirty years to die in the dark at last   curse on her work that has nipped me here with a shifty trick unkind    i have gotten my death where i got my bread but i dare not face it blind   curse on the fog  is there never a wind of all the winds i knew   to clear the smother from off my chest and let me look at the blue   the good fog heard  like a splitten sail to left and right she tore   and they saw the sundogs in the haze and the seal upon the shore   silver and gray ran spit and bay to meet the steelbacked tide   and pinched and white in the clearing light the crews stared overside   o rainbowgay the red pools lay that swilled and spilled and spread   and gold raw gold the spent shell rolled between the careless dead    the dead that rocked so drunkenwise to weather and to lee   and they saw the work their hands had done as god had bade them see    and a little breeze blew over the rail that made the headsails lift   but no man stood by wheel or sheet and they let the schooners drift   and the rattle rose in reubens throat and he cast his soul with a cry   and gone already tom hall he said  then its time for me to die   his eyes were heavy with great sleep and yearning for the land   and he spoke as a man that talks in dreams his wound beneath his hand   oh there comes no good o the westering wind that backs against the sun   wash down the decks  theyre all too red  and share the skins and run   baltic stralsund and northern light  clean share and share for all   youll find the fleets off tolstoi mees but you will not find tom hall   evil he did in shoalwater and blacker sin on the deep   but now hes sick of watch and trick and now hell turn and sleep   hell have no more of the crawling sea that made him suffer so   but hell lie down on the killinggrounds where the holluschickie go   and west youll sail and south again beyond the seafogs rim   and tell the yoshiwara girls to burn a stick for him   and youll not weight him by the heels and dump him overside   but carry him up to the sandhollows to die as bering died   and make a place for reuben paine that knows the fight was fair   and leave the two that did the wrong to talk it over there         halfsteam ahead by guess and lead for the sun is mostly veiled         through fog to fog by luck and log sail ye as bering sailed        and if the light shall lift aright to give your landfall plain        north and by west from zapne crest ye raise the crosses twain        fair marks are they to the inner bay the reckless poacher knows        what time the scarred seecatchie lead their sleek seraglios        ever they hear the floepack clear and the blast of the old bullwhale        and the deep sealroar that beats offshore above the loudest gale        ever they wait the winters hate as the thundering boorga calls        where northward look they to st george and westward to st pauls        ever they greet the hunted fleet  lone keels off headlands drear         when the sealingschooners flit that way at hazard year by year        ever in yokohama port men tell the tale anew         of a hidden sea and a hidden fight         when the baltic ran from the northern light        and the stralsund fought the two     the derelict    and reports the derelict mary pollock still at sea                                      shipping news             i was the staunchest of our fleet           till the sea rose beneath our feet        unheralded in hatred past all measure           into his pits he stamped my crew           buffeted blinded bound and threw        bidding me eyeless wait upon his pleasure       man made me and my will      is to my maker still   whom now the currents con the

bonebleached my decks windscoured to the graining      and jarred at every roll      the gear that was my soul   answers the anguish of my beams complaining       for life that crammed me full      gangs of the prying gull   that shriek and scrabble on the riven hatches      for roar that dumbed the gale      my hawsepipes guttering wail   sobbing my heart out through the uncounted watches

    trailed smoke along the sky   falling afraid lest any keel come near     the answer     a rose in tatters on the garden path   cried out to god and murmured gainst his wrath   because a sudden wind at twilights hush   had snapped her stem alone of all the bush   and god who hears both sundried dust and sun   had pity whispering to that luckless one   sister in that thou sayest we did not well    what voices heardst thou when thy petals fell   and the rose answered in that evil hour   a voice said father wherefore falls the flower   for lo the very gossamers are still   and a voice answered son by allahs will    then softly as a rainmist on the sward   came to the rose the answer of the lord   sister before we smote the dark in twain   ere yet the stars saw one another plain   time tide and space we bound unto the task   that thou shouldst fall and such an one should ask   whereat the withered flower all content   died as they die whose days are innocent   while he who questioned why the flower fell   caught hold of god and saved his soul from hell     the song of the banjo     you couldnt pack a broadwood half a mile     you mustnt leave a fiddle in the damp    you couldnt raft an organ up the nile    and play it in an equatorial swamp   i travel with the cookingpots and pails     im sandwiched tween the coffee and the pork    and when the dusty column checks and tails    you should hear me spur the rearguard to a walk       with my pillywillywinkywinky popp        oh its any tune that comes into my head       so i keep em moving forward till they drop        so i play em up to water and to bed    in the silence of the camp before the fight    when its good to make your will and say your prayer   you can hear my strumptytumpty overnight    explaining ten to one was always fair   im the prophet of the utterly absurd    of the patently impossible and vain    and when the thing that couldnt has occurred    give me time to change my leg and go again       with my tumpatumpatumpatumpa tump        in the desert where the dungfed campsmoke curled       there was never voice before us till i led our lonely chorus        i  the wardrum of the white man round the world    by the bitter road the younger son must tread    ere he win to hearth and saddle of his own    mid the riot of the shearers at the shed    in the silence of the herders hut alone    in the twilight on a bucket upside down    hear me babble what the weakest wont confess    i am memory and torment  i am town    i am all that ever went with evening dress       with my tunka tunkatunkatunkatunk        so the lights  the london lights  grow near and plain       so i rowel em afresh towards the devil and the flesh        till i bring my broken rankers home again    in desire of many marvels over sea    where the newraised tropic city sweats and roars   i have sailed with young ulysses from the quay    till the anchor rumbled down on stranger shores   he is blooded to the open and the sky    he is taken in a snare that shall not fail   he shall hear me singing strongly till he die    like the shouting of a backstay in a gale       with my hya  heeya  heeya

gorge that gives the stars at noonday clear     up the pass that packs the scud beneath our wheel    round the bluff that sinks her thousand fathom sheer     down the valley with our guttering brakes asqueal   where the trestle groans and quivers in the snow    where the manyshedded levels loop and twine   so i lead my reckless children from below    till we sing the song of roland to the pine       with my tinkatinkatinkatinkatink        and the axe has cleared the mountain croup and crest       so we ride the iron stallions down to drink        through the canyons to the waters of the west    and the tunes that mean so much to you alone     common tunes that make you choke and blow your nose   vulgar tunes that bring the laugh that brings the groan     i can rip your very heartstrings out with those   with the feasting and the folly and the fun     and the lying and the lusting and the drink   and the merry play that drops you when youre done    to the thoughts that burn like irons if you think       with my plunkalunkalunkalunkalunk        heres a trifle on account of pleasure past       ere the wit that made you win gives you eyes to see your sin        and the heavier repentance at the last    let the organ moan her sorrow to the roof     i have told the naked stars the grief of man   let the trumpets snare the foeman to the proof     i have known defeat and mocked it as we ran   my bray ye may not alter nor mistake    when i stand to jeer the fatted soul of things   but the song of lost endeavour that i make    is it hidden in the twanging of the strings       with my tararararararararrrp        is it naught to you that hear and pass me by       but the word  the word is mine when the order moves the line        and the lean locked ranks go roaring down to die    of the driven dust of speech i make a flame    and a scourge of broken withes that men let fall   for the words that had no honour till i came     lo i raise them into honour over all   by the wisdom of the centuries i speak     to the tune of yestermorn i set the truth    i the joy of life unquestioned  i the greek     i the everlasting wonder song of youth       with my tinkatinkatinkatinkatink

left us their blessing     they taught us and groomed us and crammed   but weve shaken the clubs and the messes    to go and find out and be damned                       dear boys    to go and get shot and be damned    so some of us chivy the slaver    and some of us cherish the black   and some of us hunt on the oil coast    and some on  the wallaby track   and some of us drift to sarawak    and some of us drift up the fly   and some share our tucker with tigers    and some with the gentle masai                       dear boys    take tea with the giddy masai    weve painted the islands vermilion    weve pearled on halfshares in the bay   weve shouted on sevenounce nuggets    weve starved on a seedeeboys pay   weve laughed at the world as we found it     its women and cities and men    from sayyid burgash in a tantrum    to the smokereddened eyes of loben                       dear boys    weve a little account with loben    the ends o the earth were our portion    the ocean at large was our share   there was never a skirmish to windward    but the leaderless legion was there   yes somehow and somewhere and always    we were first when the trouble began   from a lotteryrow in manila    to an idb race on the pan                       dear boys    with the mounted police on the pan    we preach in advance of the army    we skirmish ahead of the church   with never a gunboat to help us    when were scuppered and left in the lurch   but we know as the cartridges finish    and were filed on our last little shelves   that the legion that never was listed    will send us as good as ourselves                       good men    five hundred as good as ourselves    then a health we must drink it in whispers    to our wholly unauthorised horde    to the line of our dusty foreloopers    the gentlemen rovers abroad    yes a health to ourselves ere we scatter    for the steamer wont wait for the train   and the legion that never was listed    goes back into

casts them over sea    and some are drowned in deep water    and some in sight o shore   and word goes back to the weary wife    and ever she sends more    for since that wife had gate or gear    or hearth or garth or bield   she willed her sons to the white harvest    and that is a bitter yield    she wills her sons to the wet ploughing    to ride the horse of tree   and syne her sons come back again    farspent from out the sea    the good wifes sons come home again    with little into their hands   but the lore of men that ha dealt with men    in the new and naked lands    but the faith of men that ha brothered men    by more than easy breath   and the eyes o men that ha read wi men    in the open books of death    rich are they rich in wonders seen    but poor in the goods o men   so

called for priest and cup    the king has taken spur and blade   to dub true thomas a belted knight    and all for the sake o the songs he made    they have sought him high they have sought him low    they have sought him over down and lea   they have found him by the milkwhite thorn    that guards the gates o faerie         twas bent beneath and blue above         their eyes were held that they might not see        the kine that grazed beneath the knowes         oh they were the queens o faerie    now cease your song the king he said    oh cease your song and get you dight   to vow your vow and watch your arms    for i will dub you a belted knight    for i will give you a horse o pride    wi blazon and spur and page and squire   wi keep and tail and seizin and law    and land to hold at your desire    true thomas smiled above his harp    and turned his face to the naked sky   where blown before the wastrel wind    the thistledown she floated by    i ha vowed my vow in another place    and bitter oath it was on me   i ha watched my arms the leelong night    where fivescore fighting men would flee    my lance is tipped o the hammered flame    my shield is beat o the moonlight cold   and i won my spurs in the middle world    a thousand fathom beneath the mould    and what should i make wi a horse o pride    and what should i make wi a sword so brown   but spill the rings o the gentle folk    and flyte my kin in the fairy town    and what should i make wi blazon and belt    wi keep and tail and seizin and fee   and what should i do wi page and squire    that am a king in my own countrie    for i send east and i send west    and i send far as my will may flee   by dawn and dusk and the drinking rain    and syne my sendings return to me    they come wi news of the groanin earth    they come wi news o the roarin sea   wi word of spirit and ghost and flesh    and man thats mazed among the three    the king he bit his nether lip    and smote his hand upon his knee   by the faith o my soul true thomas he said    ye waste no wit in courtesie    as i desire unto my pride    can i make earls by three and three   to run before and ride behind    and serve the sons o my body    and what care i for your rowfoot earls    or all the sons o your body   before they win to the pride o name    i trow they all ask leave o me    for i make honour wi muckle mouth    as i make shame wi mincin feet   to sing wi the priests at the marketcross    or run wi the dogs in the naked street    and some they give me the good red gold    and some they give me the white money   and some they give me a clout o meal    for they be people o low degree    and the song i sing for the counted gold    the same i sing for the white money   but best i sing for the clout o meal    that simple people given me    the king cast down a silver groat    a silver groat o scots money   if i come wi a poor mans dole he said    true thomas will ye harp to me    whenas i harp to the children small    they press me close on either hand   and who are you true thomas said    that you should ride while they must stand    light down light down from your horse o pride    i trow ye talk too loud and hie   and i will make you a triple word    and syne if ye dare ye shall noble me    he has lighted down from his horse o pride    and set his back against the stone   now guard you well true thomas said    ere i rax your heart from your breastbone    true thomas played upon his harp    the fairy harp that couldna lee   and the first least word the proud king heard    it harpit the salt tear out o his ee    oh i see the love that i lost long syne    i touch the hope that i may not see   and all that i did o hidden shame    like little snakes they hiss at me    the sun is lost at noon  at noon    the dread o doom has grippit me   true thomas hide me under your cloak    god wot im little fit to dee         twas bent beneath and blue above          twas open field and running flood         where hot on heath and dike and wall         the high sun warmed the adders brood    lie down lie down true thomas said    the god shall judge when all is done   but i will bring you a better word    and lift the cloud that i laid on    true thomas played upon his harp    that birled and brattled to his hand   and the next least word true thomas made    it garred the king take horse and brand    oh i hear the tread o the fighting men    i see the sun on splent and spear   i mark the arrow outen the fern    that flies so low and sings so clear    advance my standards to that war    and bid my good knights prick and ride   the gled shall watch as fierce a fight    as eer was fought on the border side         twas bent beneath and blue above         twas nodding grass and naked sky        where ringing up the wastrel wind         the eyas stooped upon the pie    true thomas sighed above his harp    and turned the song on the midmost string   and the last least word true thomas made    he harpit his dead youth back to the king    now i am prince and i do well    to love my love withouten fear   to walk wi man in fellowship    and breathe my horse behind the deer    my hounds they bay unto the death    the buck has couched beyond the burn   my love she waits at her window    to wash my hands when i return    for that i live am i content    oh i have seen my true loves eyes   to stand wi adam in edenglade    and run in the woods o paradise         twas naked sky and nodding grass         twas running flood and wastrel wind        where checked against the open pass         the red deer belled to call the hind    true thomas laid his harp away    and louted low at the saddleside   he has taken stirrup and hauden rein    and set the king on his horse o pride    sleep ye or wake true thomas said    that sit so still that muse so long   sleep ye or wake  till the latter sleep    i trow yell not forget my song    i ha harpit a shadow out o the sun    to stand before your face and cry   i ha armed the earth beneath your heel    and over your head i ha dusked the sky    i ha harpit ye up to the throne o god    i ha harpit your midmost soul in three   i ha harpit ye down to the hinges o hell    and  ye  would  make  a knight o me     in the neolithic age     in the neolithic age savage warfare did i wage    for food and fame and woolly horses pelt   i was singer to my clan in that dim red dawn of man    and i sang of all we fought and feared and felt    yea i sang as now i sing when the prehistoric spring    made the piled biscayan icepack split and shove   and the troll and gnome and dwerg and the gods of cliff and berg    were about me and beneath me and above    but a rival of solutre told the tribe my style was outre     neath a tomahawk of diorite he fell   and i left my views on art barbed and tanged below the heart    of a mammothistic etcher at grenelle    then i stripped them scalp from skull and my hunting dogs fed full    and their teeth i threaded neatly on a thong   and i wiped my mouth and said it is well that they are dead    for i know my work is right and theirs was wrong    but my totem saw the shame from his ridgepole shrine he came    and he told me in a vision of the night    there are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays    and every single one of them is right                             then the silence closed upon me till they put new clothing on me    of whiter weaker flesh and bone more frail   and i stepped beneath times finger once again a tribal singer    and a minor poet certified by trll    still they skirmish to and fro men my messmates on the snow    when we headed off the aurochs turn for turn   when the rich allobrogenses never kept amanuenses    and our only plots were piled in lakes at berne    still a cultured christian age sees us scuffle squeak and rage    still we pinch and slap and jabber scratch and dirk   still we let our business slide  as we dropped the halfdressed hide     to show a fellowsavage how to work    still the world is wondrous large  seven seas from marge to marge     and it holds a vast of various kinds of man   and the wildest dreams of kew are the facts of khatmandhu    and the crimes of clapham chaste in martaban    heres my wisdom for your use as i learned it when the moose    and the reindeer roared where paris roars tonight    there are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays    and  every  single  one  of  them  is  right     the story of ung     once on a glittering icefield ages and ages ago   ung a maker of pictures fashioned an image of snow   fashioned the form of a tribesman  gaily he whistled and sung   working the snow with his fingers  read ye the story of ung    pleased was his tribe with that image  came in their hundreds to scan    handled it smelt it and grunted  verily this is a man   thus do we carry our lances  thus is a warbelt slung   lo it is even as we are  glory and honour to ung    later he pictured an aurochs  later he pictured a bear    pictured the sabretooth tiger dragging a man to his lair    pictured the mountainous mammoth hairy abhorrent alone    out of the love that he bore them scribing them clearly on bone    swift came the tribe to behold them peering and pushing and still    men of the bergbattered beaches men of the boulderhatched hill    hunters and fishers and trappers presently whispering low   yea they are like  and it may be   but how does the pictureman know    ung  hath he slept with the aurochs  watched where the mastodon roam   spoke on the ice with the bowhead  followed the sabretooth home   nay  these are toys of his fancy  if he have cheated us so   how is there truth in his image  the man that he fashioned of snow    wroth was that maker of pictures  hotly he answered the call   hunters and fishers and trappers children and fools are ye all   look at the beasts when ye hunt them  swift from the tumult he broke   ran to the cave of his father and told him the shame that they spoke    and the father of ung gave answer that was old and wise in the craft   maker of pictures aforetime he leaned on his lance and laughed   if they could see as thou seest they would do what thou hast done   and each man would make him a picture and  what would become of my son    there would be no pelts of the reindeer flung down at thy cave for a gift   nor dole of the oily timber that comes on the baltic drift   no store of welldrilled needles nor ouches of amber pale   no newcut tongues of the bison nor meat of the stranded whale    thou hast not toiled at the fishing when the sodden trammels freeze   nor worked the warboats outward through the rush of the rockstaked seas   yet they bring thee fish and plunder  full meal and an easy bed    and all for the sake of thy pictures  and ung held down his head    thou hast not stood to the aurochs when the red snow reeks of the fight   men have no time at the houghing to count his curls aright   and the heart of the hairy mammoth thou sayest they do not see   yet they save it whole from the beaches and broil the best for thee    and now do they press to thy pictures with opened mouth and eye   and a little gift in the doorway and the praise no gift can buy   but  sure they have doubted thy pictures and that is a grievous stain    son that can see so clearly return them their gifts again    and ung looked down at his deerskins  their broad shelltasselled bands    and ung drew downward his mitten and looked at his naked hands   and he gloved himself and departed and he heard his father behind   son that can see so clearly rejoice that thy tribe is blind    straight on the glittering icefield by the caves of the lost dordogne   ung a maker of pictures fell to his scribing on bone   even to mammoth editions  gaily he whistled and sung   blessing his tribe for their blindness  heed ye the story of ung     the threedecker    the threevolume novel is extinct     full thirty foot she towered from waterline to rail   it cost a watch to steer her and a week to shorten sail   but spite all modern notions i found her first and best    the only certain packet for the islands of the blest    fair held the breeze behind us  twas warm with lovers prayers   wed stolen wills for ballast and a crew of missing heirs   they shipped as able bastards till the wicked nurse confessed   and they worked the old threedecker to the islands of the blest    by ways no gaze could follow a course unspoiled of cook   per fancy fleetest in man our titled berths we took   with maids of matchless beauty and parentage unguessed   and a church of england parson for the islands of the blest    we asked no social questions  we pumped no hidden shame    we never talked obstetrics when the little stranger came   we left the lord in heaven we left the fiends in hell   we werent exactly yussufs but  zuleika didnt tell    no moral doubt assailed us so when the port we neared   the villain had his flogging at the gangway and we cheered   twas fiddle in the forcsle  twas garlands on the mast   for every one got married and i went ashore at last    i left em all in couples akissing on the decks   i left the lovers loving and the parents signing cheques   in endless english comfort by countyfolk caressed   i left the old threedecker at the islands of the blest    that route is barred to steamers  youll never lift again   our purplepainted headlands or the lordly keeps of spain   theyre just beyond your skyline howeer so far you cruise   in a ramyoudamnyou liner with a brace of bucking screws    swing round your aching searchlight  twill show no havens peace   ay blow your shrieking sirens to the deaf graybearded seas   boom out the dripping oilbags to skin the deeps unrest    and you arent one knot the nearer to the islands of the blest    but when youre threshing crippled with broken bridge and rail   at a drogue of dead convictions to hold you head to gale   calm as the flying dutchman from truck to taffrail dressed   youll see the old threedecker for the islands of the blest    youll see her tiering canvas in sheeted silver spread   youll hear the longdrawn thunder neath her leaping figurehead   while far so far above you her tall pooplanterns shine   unvexed by wind or weather like the candles round a shrine    hull down  hull down and under  she dwindles to a speck   with noise of pleasant music and dancing on her deck   alls well  alls well aboard her  shes left you far behind   with a scent of oldworld roses through the fog that ties you blind    her crew are babes or madmen  her port is all to make   youre manned by truth and science and you steam for steamings sake   well tinker up your engines  you know your business best    shes taking tired people to the islands of the blest     an american     the american spirit speaks     if the led striker call it a strike    or the papers call it a war   they know not much what i am like    nor what he is my avatar    through many roads by me possessed    he shambles forth in cosmic guise   he is the jester and the jest    and he the text himself applies    the celt is in his heart and hand    the gaul is in his brain and nerve   where cosmopolitanly planned    he guards the redskins dry reserve    his easy unswept hearth he lends    from labrador to guadeloupe   till elbowed out by sloven friends    he camps at sufferance on the stoop    calmeyed he scoffs at sword and crown    or panicblinded stabs and slays   blatant he bids the world bow down    or cringing begs a crust of praise    or sombredrunk at mine and mart    he dubs his dreary brethren kings   his hands are black with blood  his heart    leaps as a babes at little things    but through the shift of mood and mood    mine ancient humour saves him whole    the cynic devil in his blood    that bids him mock his hurrying soul    that bids him flout the law he makes    that bids him make the law he flouts   till dazed by many doubts he wakes    the drumming guns that  have no doubts    that checks him foolish  hot and fond    that chuckles through his deepest ire   that gilds the slough of his despond    but dims the goal of his desire    inopportune shrillaccented    the acrid asiatic mirth   that leaves him careless mid his dead    the scandal of the elder earth    how shall he clear himself how reach    your bar or weighed defence prefer   a brother hedged with alien speech    and lacking all interpreter    which knowledge vexes him a space    but while reproof around him rings   he turns a keen untroubled face    home to the instant need of things    enslaved illogical elate    he greets th embarrassed gods nor fears   to shake the iron hand of fate    or match with destiny for beers    lo imperturbable he rules    unkempt disreputable vast    and in the teeth of all the schools    i  i shall save him at the last     the mary gloster

houses and staying the boilers square   but mcullough e wanted cabins with marble and maple and all   and brussels an utrecht velvet and baths and a social hall   and pipes for closets all over and cutting the frames too light   but mcullough he died in the sixties and   well im dying tonight      i knew  i knew what was coming when we bid on the byfleets keel    they piddled and piffled with

it and i gave em the scripture text   you keep your light so shining a little in front o the next   they copied all they could follow but they couldnt copy my mind   and i left em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind   then came the armourcontracts but that was mculloughs side   he was always best in the foundry but better perhaps he died   i went through his private papers the
