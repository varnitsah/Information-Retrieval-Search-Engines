52992153	on the frontier  by bret harte     contents   at the mission of san carmel  a blue grass penelope  left out on lone star mountain     at the mission of san carmel     prologue   it was noon of the 10th of august 1838 the monotonous coast line between monterey and san diego had set its hard outlines against the steady glare of the californian sky and the metallic glitter of the pacific ocean the weary succession of rounded domelike hills obliterated all sense of distance the rare whaling vessel or still rarer trader drifting past saw no change in these rusty undulations barren of distinguishing peak or headland and bald of wooded crest or timbered ravine the withered ranks of wild oats gave a dull procession of uniform color to the hills unbroken by any relief of shadow in their smooth round curves as far as the eye could reach sea and shore met in one bleak monotony flecked by no passing cloud stirred by no sign of life or motion even sound was absent the angelus rung from the invisible mission tower far inland was driven back again by the steady northwest trades that for half the year had swept the coast line and left it abraded of all umbrage and color  but even this monotony soon gave way to a change and another monotony as uniform and depressing the western horizon slowly contracting before a wall of vapor by four oclock had become a mere cold steely strip of sea into which gradually the northern trend of the coast faded and was lost as the fog stole with soft step southward all distance space character and locality again vanished the hills upon which the sun still shone bore the same monotonous outlines as those just wiped into space last of all before the red sun sank like the descending host it gleamed upon the sails of a trading vessel close in shore it was the last object visible a damp breath breathed upon it a soft hand passed over the slate the sharp pencilling of the picture faded and became a confused gray cloud  the wind and waves too went down in the fog the now invisible and hushed breakers occasionally sent the surf over the sand in a quick whisper with grave intervals of silence but with no continuous murmur as before in a curving bight of the shore the creaking of oars in their rowlocks began to be distinctly heard but the boat itself although apparently only its length from the sands was invisible  steady now way enough the voice came from the sea and was low as if unconsciously affected by the fog silence  the sound of a keel grating the sand was followed by the order stern all from the invisible speaker  shall we beach her asked another vague voice  not yet hail again and all together  ah hoyoioioy  there were four voices but the hail appeared weak and ineffectual like a cry in a dream and seemed hardly to reach beyond the surf before it was suffocated in the creeping cloud a silence followed but no response  its no use to beach her and go ashore until we find the boat said the first voice gravely and well do that if the current has brought her here are you sure youve got the right bearings  as near as a man could off a shore with not a blasted pint to take his bearings by  there was a long silence again broken only by the occasional dip of oars keeping the invisible boathead to the sea  take my word for it lads its the last well see of that boat again or of jack cranch or the captains baby  it does look mighty queer that the painter should slip jack cranch aint the man to tie a granny knot  silence said the invisible leader listen  a hail so faint and uncertain that it might have been the longdeferred faroff echo of their own came from the sea abreast of them  its the captain he hasnt found anything or he couldnt be so far north hark  the hail was repeated again faintly dreamily to the seamens trained ears it seemed to have an intelligent significance for the first voice gravely responded aye aye and then said softly oars  the word was followed by a splash the oars clicked sharply and simultaneously in the rowlocks then more faintly then still fainter and then passed out into the darkness  the silence and shadow both fell together for hours sea and shore were impenetrable yet at times the air was softly moved and troubled the surrounding gloom faintly lightened as with a misty dawn and then was dark again or drowsy faroff cries and confused noises seemed to grow out of the silence and when they had attracted the weary ear sank away as in a mocking dream and showed themselves unreal nebulous gatherings in the fog seemed to indicate stationary objects that even as one gazed moved away the recurring lap and ripple on the shingle sometimes took upon itself the semblance of faint articulate laughter or spoken words but towards morning a certain monotonous grating on the sand that had for many minutes alternately cheated and piqued the ear asserted itself more strongly and a moving vacillating shadow in the gloom became an opaque object on the shore  with the first rays of the morning light the fog lifted as the undraped hills one by one bared their cold bosoms to the sun the long line of coast struggled back to life again everything was unchanged except that a stranded boat lay upon the sands and in its stern sheets a sleeping child     chapter i   the 10th of august 1852 brought little change to the dull monotony of wind fog and treeless coast line only the sea was occasionally flecked with racing sails that outstripped the old slowcreeping trader or was at times streaked and blurred with the trailing smoke of a steamer there were a few strange footprints on those virgin sands and a fresh track that led from the beach over the rounded hills dropped into the bosky recesses of a hidden valley beyond the coast range  it was here that the refectory windows of the mission of san carmel had for years looked upon the reverse of that monotonous picture presented to the sea it was here that the trade winds shorn of their fury and strength in the heated ovenlike air that rose from the valley lost their weary way in the tangled recesses of the wooded slopes and breathed their last at the foot of the stone cross before the mission it was on the crest of those slopes that the fog halted and walled in the sunillumined plain below it was in this plain that limitless fields of grain clothed the fat adobe soil here the mission garden smiled over its hedges of fruitful vines and through the leaves of fig and gnarled pear trees and it was here that father pedro had lived for fifty years found the prospect good and had smiled also  father pedros smile was rare he was not a las casas nor a junipero serra but he had the deep seriousness of all disciples laden with the responsible wording of a gospel not their own and his smile had an ecclesiastical as well as a human significance the pleasantest object in his prospect being the fair and curly head of his boy acolyte and chorister francisco which appeared among the vines and his sweetest pastoral music the high soprano humming of a chant with which the boy accompanied his gardening  suddenly the acolytes chant changed to a cry of terror running rapidly to father pedros side he grasped his sotana and even tried to hide his curls among its folds  st st said the padre disengaging himself with some impatience what new alarm is this is it luzbel hiding among our catalan vines or one of those heathen americanos from monterey speak  neither holy father said the boy the color struggling back into his pale cheeks and an apologetic bashful smile lighting his clear eyes neither but oh such a gross lethargic toad and it almost leaped upon me  a toad leaped upon thee repeated the good father with evident vexation what next i tell thee child those foolish fears are most unmeet for thee and must be overcome if necessary with prayer and penance frightened by a toad blood of the martyrs tis like any foolish girl  father pedro stopped and coughed  i am saying that no christian child should shrink from any of gods harmless creatures and only last week thou wast disdainful of poor murietas pig forgetting that san antonio himself did elect one his faithful companion even in glory  yes but it was so fat and so uncleanly holy father replied the young acolyte and it smelt so  smelt so echoed the father doubtfully have a care child that this is not luxuriousness of the senses i have noticed of late you gather overmuch of roses and syringa excellent in their way and in moderation but still not to be compared with the flower of holy church the lily  but lilies dont look well on the refectory table and against the adobe wall returned the acolyte with a pout of a spoilt child and surely the flowers cannot help being sweet any more than myrrh or incense and i am not frightened of the heathen americanos either now there was a small one in the garden yesterday a boy like me and he spoke kindly and with a pleasant face  what said he to thee child asked father pedro anxiously  nay the matter of his speech i could not understand laughed the boy but the manner was as gentle as thine holy father  st child said the padre impatiently thy likings are as unreasonable as thy fears besides have i not told thee it ill becomes a child of christ to chatter with those sons of belial but canst thou not repeat the wordsthe words he said he continued suspiciously  tis a harsh tongue the americanos speak in their throat replied the boy but he said devilishnisse and prettyasagirl and looked at me  the good father made the boy repeat the words gravely and as gravely repeated them after him with infinite simplicity they are but heretical words he replied in answer to the boys inquiring look it is well you understand not english enough run away child and be ready for the angelus i will commune with myself awhile under the pear trees  glad to escape so easily the young acolyte disappeared down the alley of fig trees not without a furtive look at the patches of chickweed around their roots the possible ambuscade of creeping or saltant vermin the good priest heaved a sigh and glanced round the darkening prospect the sun had already disappeared over the mountain wall that lay between him and the sea rimmed with a faint white line of outlying fog a cool zephyr fanned his cheek it was the dying breath of the vientos generales beyond the wall as father pedros eyes were raised to this barrier which seemed to shut out the boisterous world beyond he fancied he noticed for the first time a slight breach in the parapet over which an advanced banner of the fog was fluttering was it an omen his speculations were cut short by a voice at his very side  he turned quickly and beheld one of those heathens against whom he had just warned his young acolyte one of that straggling band of adventurers whom the recent gold discoveries had scattered along the coast luckily the fertile alluvium of these valleys lying parallel with the sea offered no indications to attract the gold seekers nevertheless to father pedro even the infrequent contact with the americanos was objectionable they were at once inquisitive and careless they asked questions with the sharp perspicacity of controversy they received his grave replies with the frank indifference of utter worldliness powerful enough to have been tyrannical oppressors they were singularly tolerant and gentle contenting themselves with a playful goodnatured irreverence which tormented the good father more than opposition they were felt to be dangerous and subversive  the americano however who stood before him did not offensively suggest these national qualities a man of middle height strongly built bronzed and slightly gray from the vicissitudes of years and exposure he had an air of practical seriousness that commended itself to father pedro to his religious mind it suggested selfconsciousness expressed in the dialect of the stranger it only meant business  im rather glad i found you out here alone began the latter it saves time i havent got to take my turn with the rest in therehe indicated the church with his thumband you havent got to make an appointment you have got a clear forty minutes before the angelus rings he added consulting a large silver chronometer and i reckon i kin git through my part of the job inside of twenty leaving you ten minutes for remarks i want to confess  father pedro drew back with a gesture of dignity the stranger however laid his hand upon the padres sleeve with the air of a man anticipating objection but never refusal and went on  of course i know you want me to come at some other time and in there you want it in the reglar style thats your way and your time my answer is it aint my way and my time the main idea of confession i take it is gettin at the facts im ready to give em if youll take em out here now if youre willing to drop the church and confessional and all that sort o thing i on my side am willing to give up the absolution and all that sort o thing you might he added with an unconscious touch of pathos in the suggestion heave in a word or two of advice after i get through for instance what youd do in the circumstances you see thats all but thats as you please it aint part of the business  irreverent as this speech appeared there was really no trace of such intention in his manner and his evident profound conviction that his suggestion was practical and not at all inconsistent with ecclesiastical dignity would alone have been enough to touch the padre had not the strangers dominant personality already overridden him he hesitated the stranger seized the opportunity to take his arm and lead him with the half familiarity of powerful protection to a bench beneath the refectory window taking out his watch again he put it in the passive hands of the astonished priest saying time me cleared his throat and began  fourteen years ago there was a ship cruisin in the pacific jest off this range that was ez nigh on to a hell afloat as anything rigged kin be if a chap managed to dodge the capens belayinpin for a time he was bound to be fetched up in the ribs at last by the mates boots there was a chap knocked down the fore hatch with a broken leg in the gulf and another jumped overboard off cape corrientes crazy as a loon along a clip of the head from the capens trumpet thems facts the ship was a brigantine trading along the mexican coast the capen had his wife aboard a little timid mexican woman hed picked up at mazatlan i reckon she didnt get on with him any better than the men for she ups and dies one day leavin her baby a yearold gal one of the crew was fond o that baby he used to get the black nurse to put it in the dingy and hed tow it astern rocking it with the painter like a cradle he did ithatin the capen all the same one day the black nurse got out of the dingy for a moment when the baby was asleep leavin him alone with it an idea took hold on him jest from cussedness youd say but it was partly from revenge on the capen and partly to get away from the ship the ship was well inshore and the current settin towards it he slipped the painterthat manand set himself adrift with the baby it was a crazy act youd reckon for there wasnt any oars in the boat but he had a crazy mans luck and he contrived by sculling the boat with one of the seats he tore out to keep her out of the breakers till he could find a bight in the shore to run her in the alarm was given from the ship but the fog shut down upon him he could hear the other boats in pursuit they seemed to close in on him and by the sound he judged the capen was just abreast of him in the gig bearing down upon him in the fog he slipped out of the dingy into the water without a splash and struck out for the breakers he got ashore after havin been knocked down and dragged in four times by the undertow he had only one idea then thankfulness that he had not taken the baby with him in the surf you kin put that down for him its a fact he got off into the hills and made his way up to monterey  and the child asked the padre with a sudden and strange asperity that boded no good to the penitent the child thus ruthlessly abandonedwhat became of it  thats just it the child assented the stranger gravely well if that man was on his deathbed instead of being here talking to you hed swear that he thought the capen was sure to come up to it the next minit thats a fact but it wasnt until one day that hethats meran across one of that crew in frisco hallo cranch sez he to me so you got away didnt you and hows the capens baby grown a young gal by this time aint she what are you talkin about ez i how should i know he draws away from me and sez d it sez he you dont mean that you    i grabs him by the throat and makes him tell me all and then it appears that the boat and the baby were never found again and every man of that crew capen and all believed i had stolen it  he paused father pedro was staring at the prospect with an uncompromising rigidity of head and shoulder  its a bad lookout for me aint it the stranger continued in serious reflection  how do i know said the priest harshly without turning his head that you did not make away with this child  beg pardon  that you did not complete your revenge bybykilling it as your comrade suspected you ah holy trinity continued father pedro throwing out his hands with an impatient gesture as if to take the place of unutterable thought  how do you know echoed the stranger coldly  yes  the stranger linked his fingers together and threw them over his knee drew it up to his chest caressingly and said quietly because you do know  the padre rose to his feet  what mean you he said sternly fixing his eyes upon the speaker their eyes met the strangers were gray and persistent with hanging corner lids that might have concealed even more purpose than they showed the padres were hollow open and the whites slightly brown as if with tobacco stains yet they were the first to turn away  i mean returned the stranger with the same practical gravity that you know it wouldnt pay me to come here if id killed the baby unless i wanted you to fix things right with me up there pointing skywards and get absolution and ive told you that wasnt in my line  why do you seek me then demanded the padre suspiciously  because i reckon i thought a man might be allowed to confess something short of a murder if youre going to draw the line below that  this is but sacrilegious levity interrupted father pedro turning as if to go but the stranger did not make any movement to detain him  have you implored forgiveness of the fatherthe man you wrongedbefore you came here asked the priest lingering  not much it wouldnt pay if he was living and he died four years ago  you are sure of that  i am  there are other relations perhaps  none  father pedro was silent when he spoke again it was with a changed voice what is your purpose then he asked with the first indication of priestly sympathy in his manner you cannot ask forgiveness of the earthly father you have injured you refuse the intercession of holy church with the heavenly father you have disobeyed speak wretched man what is it you want  i want to find the child  but if it were possible if she were still living are you fit to seek her to even make yourself known to her to appear before her  well if i made it profitable to her perhaps  perhaps echoed the priest scornfully so be it but why come here  to ask your advice to know how to begin my search you know this country you were here when that boat drifted ashore beyond that mountain  ah indeed i have much to do with it it is an affair of the alcaldethe authoritiesof youryour police  is it  the padre again met the strangers eyes he stopped with the snuff box he had somewhat ostentatiously drawn from his pocket still open in his hand  why is it not senor he demanded  if she lives she is a young lady by this time and might not want the details of her life known to any one  and how will you recognize your baby in this young lady asked father pedro with a rapid gesture indicating the comparative heights of a baby and an adult  i reckon ill know her and her clothes too and whoever found her wouldnt be fool enough to destroy them  after fourteen years good you have faith senor  cranch supplied the stranger consulting his watch but times up business is business goodby dont let me keep you  he extended his hand  the padre met it with a dry unsympathetic palm as sere and yellow as the hills when their hands separated the father still hesitated looking at cranch if he expected further speech or entreaty from him he was mistaken for the american without turning his head walked in the same serious practical fashion down the avenue of fig trees and disappeared beyond the hedge of vines the outlines of the mountain beyond were already lost in the fog father pedro turned into the refectory  antonio  a strong flavor of leather onions and stable preceded the entrance of a short stout vaquero from the little patio  saddle pinto and thine own mule to accompany francisco who will take letters from me to the father superior at san jose tomorrow at daybreak  at daybreak reverend father  at daybreak hark ye go by the mountain trails and avoid the highway stop at no posada nor fonda but if the child is weary rest then awhile at don juan briones or at the rancho of the blessed fisherman have no converse with stragglers least of all those gentile americanos so     the first strokes of the angelus came from the nearer tower with a gesture father pedro waved antonio aside and opened the door of the sacristy  ad majorem dei gloria     chapter ii   the hacienda of don juan briones nestling in a wooded cleft of the foothills was hidden as father pedro had wisely reflected from the straying feet of travelers along the dusty highway to san jose as francisco emerging from the canada put spurs to his mule at the sight of the whitewashed walls antonio grunted  oh aye little priest thou wast tired enough a moment ago and though we are not three leagues from the blessed fisherman thou couldst scarce sit thy saddle longer mother of god and all to see that little mongrel juanita  but good antonio juanita was my playfellow and i may not soon again chance this way and juanita is not a mongrel no more than i am  she is a mestiza and thou art a child of the church though this following of gypsy wenches does not show it  but father pedro does not object urged the boy  the reverend father has forgotten he was ever young replied antonio sententiously or he wouldnt set fire and tow together  what sayest thou good antonio asked francisco quickly opening his blue eyes in frank curiosity who is fire and who is tow  the worthy muleteer utterly abashed and confounded by this display of the acolytes direct simplicity contented himself by shrugging his shoulders and a vague quien sabe  come said the boy gayly confess it is only the aguardiente of the blessed fisherman thou missest never fear juanita will find thee some and see here she comes  there was a flash of white flounces along the dark brown corridor the twinkle of satin slippers the flying out of long black braids and with a cry of joy a young girl threw herself upon francisco as he entered the patio and nearly dragged him from his mule  have a care little sister laughed the acolyte looking at antonio or there will be a conflagration am i the fire he continued submitting to the two sounding kisses the young girl placed upon either cheek but still keeping his mischievous glance upon the muleteer  quien sabe repeated antonio gruffly as the young girl blushed under his significant eyes it is no affair of mine he added to himself as he led pinto away perhaps father pedro is right and this young twig of the church is as dry and sapless as himself let the mestiza burn if she likes  quick pancho said the young girl eagerly leading him along the corridor this way i must talk with thee before thou seest don juan that is why i ran to intercept thee and not as that fool antonio would signify to shame thee wast thou ashamed my pancho  the boy threw his arm familiarly round the supple stayless little waist accented only by the belt of the light flounced saya and said but why this haste and feverishness nita and now i look at thee thou hast been crying  they had emerged from a door in the corridor into the bright sunlight of a walled garden the girl dropped her eyes cast a quick glance around her and said  not here to the arroyo and half leading half dragging him made her way through a copse of manzanita and alder until they heard the faint tinkling of water dost thou remember said the girl it was here pointing to an embayed pool in the dark current that i baptized thee when father pedro first brought thee here when we both played at being monks they were dear old days for father pedro would trust no one with thee but me and always kept us near him  aye and he said i would be profaned by the touch of any other and so himself always washed and dressed me and made my bed near his  and took thee away again and i saw thee not till thou camest with antonio over a year ago to the cattle branding and now my pancho i may never see thee again she buried her face in her hands and sobbed aloud  the little acolyte tried to comfort her but with such abstraction of manner and inadequacy of warmth that she hastily removed his caressing hand  but why what has happened he asked eagerly  the girls manner had changed her eyes flashed and she put her brown fist on her waist and began to rock from side to side  but ill not go she said viciously  go where asked the boy  oh where she echoed impatiently hear me francisco thou knowest i am like thee an orphan but i have not like thee a parent in the holy church for alas she added bitterly i am not a boy and have not a lovely voice borrowed from the angels i was like thee a foundling kept by the charity of the reverend fathers until don juan a childless widower adopted me i was happy not knowing and caring who were the parents who had abandoned me happy only in the love of him who became my adopted father and now she paused  and now echoed francisco eagerly  and now they say it is discovered who are my parents  and they live  mother of god no said the girl with scarcely filial piety there is some one a thing a mere don fulano who knows it all it seems who is to be my guardian  but how tell me all dear juanita said the boy with a feverish interest that contrasted so strongly with his previous abstraction that juanita bit her lips with vexation  ah how santa barbara an extravaganza for children a necklace of lies i am lost from a ship of which my fatherheaven rest himis general and i am picked up among the weeds on the seashore like moses in the bulrushes a pretty story indeed  oh how beautiful exclaimed francisco enthusiastically ah juanita would it had been me  thee said the girl bitterlythee noit was a girl wanted enough it was me  and when does the guardian come persisted the boy with sparkling eyes  he is here even now with that pompous fool the american alcalde from monterey a wretch who knows nothing of the country or the people but who helped the other american to claim me i tell thee francisco like as not it is all a folly some senseless blunder of those americanos that imposes upon don juans simplicity and love for them  how looks he this americano who seeks thee asked francisco  what care i how he looks said juanita or what he is he may have the four ss for all i care yet she added with a slight touch of coquetry he is not bad to look upon now i recall him  had he a long moustache and a sad sweet smile and a voice so gentle and yet so strong that you felt he ordered you to do things with out saying it and did his eye read your thoughtsthat very thought that you must obey him  saints preserve thee pancho of whom dost thou speak  listen juanita it was a year ago the eve of natividad he was in the church when i sang look where i would i always met his eye when the canticle was sung and i was slipping into the sacristy he was beside me he spoke kindly but i understood him not he put into my hand gold for an aguinaldo i pretended i understood not that also and put it into the box for the poor he smiled and went away often have i seen him since and last night when i left the mission he was there again with father pedro  and father pedro what said he of him asked juanita  nothing the boy hesitated perhapsbecause i said nothing of the stranger  juanita laughed so thou canst keep a secret from the good father when thou carest but why dost thou think this stranger is my new guardian  dost thou not see little sister he was even then seeking thee said the boy with joyous excitement doubtless he knew we were friends and playmatesmay be the good father has told him thy secret for it is no idle tale of the alcalde believe me i see it all it is true  then thou wilt let him take me away exclaimed the girl bitterly withdrawing the little hand he had clasped in his excitement  alas juanita what avails it now i am sent to san jose charged with a letter to the father superior who will give me further orders what they are or how long i must stay i know not but i know this the good father pedros eyes were troubled when he gave me his blessing and he held me long in his embrace pray heaven i have committed no fault still it may be that the reputation of my gift hath reached the father superior and he would advance me and franciscos eyes lit up with youthful pride at the thought  not so juanita her black eyes snapped suddenly with suspicion she drew in her breath and closed her little mouth firmly then she began a crescendo  mother of god was that all was he a child to be sent away for such time or for such purpose as best pleased the fathers was he to know no more than that with such gifts as god had given him was he not at least to have some word in disposing of them ah she would not stand it  the boy gazed admiringly at the piquant energy of the little figure before him and envied her courage it is the mestizo blood he murmured to himself then aloud thou shouldst have been a man nita  and thou a woman  or a priest eh what is that  they had both risen juanita defiantly her black braids flying as she wheeled and suddenly faced the thicket francisco clinging to her with trembling hands and whitened lips a stone loosened from the hillside had rolled to their feet there was a crackling in the alders on the slope above them  is it a bear or a brigand whispered francisco hurriedly sounding the uttermost depths of his terror in the two words  it is an eavesdropper said juanita impetuously and who and why i intend to know and she started towards the thicket  do not leave me good juanita said the young acolyte grasping the girls skirt  nay run to the hacienda quickly and leave me to search the thicket run  the boy did not wait for a second injunction but scuttled away his long coat catching in the brambles while juanita darted like a kitten into the bushes her search was fruitless however and she was returning impatiently when her quick eye fell upon a letter lying amidst the dried grass where she and francisco had been seated the moment before it had evidently fallen from his breast when he had risen suddenly and been overlooked in his alarm it was father pedros letter to the father superior of san jose  in an instant she had pounced upon it as viciously as if it had been the interloper she was seeking she knew that she held in her fingers the secret of franciscos sudden banishment she felt instinctively that this yellowish envelope with its red string and its blotch of red seal was his sentence and her own the little mestiza had not been brought up to respect the integrity of either locks or seals both being unknown in the patriarchal life of the hacienda yet with a certain feminine instinct she looked furtively around her and even managed to dislodge the clumsy wax without marring the pretty effigy of the crossed keys impressed upon it then she opened the letter and read  suddenly she stopped and put back her hair from her brown temples then a succession of burning blushes followed each other in waves from her neck up and died in drops of moisture in her eyes this continued until she was fairly crying dropping the letter from her hands and rocking to and fro in the midst of this she quickly stopped again the clouds broke a sunshine of laughter started from her eyes she laughed shyly she laughed loudly she laughed hysterically then she stopped again as suddenly knitted her brows swooped down once more upon the letter and turned to fly but at the same moment the letter was quietly but firmly taken from her hand and mr jack cranch stood beside her  juanita was crimson but unconquered she mechanically held out her hand for the letter the american took her little fingers kissed them and said  how are you again  the letter replied juanita with a strong disposition to stamp her foot  but said cranch with business directness youve read enough to know it isnt for you  nor for you either responded juanita  true it is for the reverend father superior of san jose mission ill give it to him  juanita was becoming alarmed first at this prospect second at the power the stranger seemed to be gaining over her she recalled franciscos description of him with something like superstitious awe  but it concerns francisco it contains a secret he should know  then you can tell him it perhaps it would come easier from you  juanita blushed again why she asked half dreading his reply  because said the american quietly you are old playmates you are attached to each other  juanita bit her lips why dont you read it yourself she asked bluntly  because i dont read other peoples letters and if it concerns me youll tell me  what if i dont  then the father superior will  i believe you know franciscos secret already said the girl boldly  perhaps  then mother of god senor crancho what do you want  i do not want to separate two such good friends as you and francisco  perhaps youd like to claim us both said the girl with a sneer that was not devoid of coquetry  i should be delighted  then here is your occasion senor for here comes my adopted father don juan and your friend senor brrown the american alcalde  two men appeared in the garden path below them the stiff glazed broadbrimmed black hat surmounting a dark face of quixotic gravity and romantic rectitude indicated don juan briones his companion lazy specious and redfaced was senor brown the american alcalde  well i reckon we kin about call the thing fixed said senor brown with a large wave of the hand suggesting a sweeping away of all trivial details ez i was saying to the don yer when two hightoned gents like you and him come together in a delicate matter of this kind it aint no hoss trade nor sharp practice the don is that lofty in principle that hes willin to sacrifice his affections for the good of the gal and you on your hand kalkilate to see all hes done for her and go your whole pile better youll make the legal formalities good i reckon that old injin woman who can swear to the finding of the baby on the shore will set things all right yet for the matter o that if you want anything in the way of a certificate im on hand always  juanita and myself are at your disposition caballeros said don juan with a grave exaltation never let it be said that the mexican nation was outdone by the great americanos in deeds of courtesy and affection let it rather stand that juanita was a sacred trust put into my hands years ago by the goddess of american liberty and nurtured in the mexican eagles nest is it not so my soul he added more humanly to the girl when he had quite recovered from the intoxication of his own speech we love thee little one but we keep our honor  theres nothing mean about the old man said brown admiringly with a slight dropping of his left eyelid his head is level and he goes with his party  thou takest my daughter senor cranch continued the old man carried away by his emotion but the american nation gives me a son  you know not what you say father said the young girl angrily exasperated by a slight twinkle in the americans eye  not so said cranch perhaps one of the american nation may take him at his word  then caballeros you will for the moment at least possess yourselves of the house and its poor hospitality said don juan with timehonored courtesy producing the rustic key of the gate of the patio it is at your disposition caballeros he repeated leading the way as his guests passed into the corridor  two hours passed the hills were darkening on their eastern slopes the shadows of the few poplars that sparsedly dotted the dusty highway were falling in long black lines that looked like ditches on the dead level of the tawny fields the shadows of slowly moving cattle were mingling with their own silhouettes and becoming more and more grotesque a keen wind rising in the hills was already creeping from the canada as from the mouth of a funnel and sweeping the plains antonio had forgathered with the servants had pinched the ears of the maids had partaken of aguardiente had saddled the mulesantonio was becoming impatient  and then a singular commotion disturbed the peaceful monotony of the patriarchal household of don juan briones the stagnant courtyard was suddenly alive with peons and servants running hither and thither the alleys and gardens were filled with retainers a confusion of questions orders and outcrys rent the air the plains shook with the galloping of a dozen horsemen for the acolyte francisco of the mission san carmel had disappeared and vanished and from that day the hacienda of don juan briones knew him no more     chapter iii   when father pedro saw the yellow mules vanish under the low branches of the oaks beside the little graveyard caught the last glitter of the morning sun on pintos shining headstall and heard the last tinkle of antonios spurs something very like a mundane sigh escaped him to the simple wonder of the majority of early worshipersthe halfbreed converts who rigorously attended the spiritual ministrations of the mission and ate the temporal provisions of the reverend fathershe deputed the functions of the first mass to a coadjutor and breviary in hand sought the orchard of venerable pear trees whether there was any occult sympathy in his reflections with the contemplation of their gnarled twisted gouty and knotty limbs still bearing gracious and goodly fruit i know not but it was his private retreat and under one of the most rheumatic and misshapen trunks there was a rude seat here father pedro sank his face towards the mountain wall between him and the invisible sea the relentless dry practical californian sunlight falling on his face grimly pointed out a night of vigil and suffering the snuffy yellow of his eyes was injected yet burning his temples were ridged and veined like a tobacco leaf the odor of desiccation which his garments always exhaled was hot and feverish as if the fire had suddenly awakened among the ashes  of what was father pedro thinking  he was thinking of his youth a youth spent under the shade of those pear trees even then venerable as now he was thinking of his youthful dreams of heathen conquest emulating the sacrifices and labors of junipero serra a dream cut short by the orders of the archbishop that sent his companion brother diego north on a mission to strange lands and condemned him to the isolation of san carmel he was thinking of that fierce struggle with envy of a fellow creatures better fortune that conquered by prayer and penance left him patient submissive and devoted to his humble work how he raised up converts to the faith even taking them from the breast of heretic mothers  he recalled how once with the zeal of propagandism quickening in the instincts of a childless man he had dreamed of perpetuating his work through some sinless creation of his own of dedicating some virgin soul one over whom he could have complete control restricted by no human paternal weakness to the task he had begun but how of all the boys eagerly offered to the church by their parents there seemed none sufficiently pure and free from parental taint he remembered how one night through the intercession of the blessed virgin herself as he firmly then believed this dream was fulfilled an indian woman brought him a waugee childa babygirl that she had picked up on the seashore there were no parents to divide the responsibility the child had no past to confront except the memory of the ignorant indian woman who deemed her duty done and whose interest ceased in giving it to the padre the austere conditions of his monkish life compelled him to the first step in his adoption of itthe concealment of its sex this was easy enough as he constituted himself from that moment its sole nurse and attendant and boldly baptized it among the other children by the name of francisco no others knew its origin nor cared to know father pedro had taken a muchacho foundling for adoption his jealous seclusion of it and his personal care was doubtless some sacerdotal formula at once high and necessary  he remembered with darkening eyes and impeded breath how his close companionship and daily care of this helpless child had revealed to him the fascinations of that paternity denied to him how he had deemed it his duty to struggle against the thrill of baby fingers laid upon his yellow cheeks the pleading of inarticulate words the eloquence of wonderseeing and mutely questioning eyes how he had succumbed again and again and then struggled no more seeing only in them the suggestion of childhood made incarnate in the holy babe and yet even as he thought he drew from his gown a little shoe and laid it beside his breviary it was franciscos baby slipper a duplicate to those worn by the miniature waxen figure of the holy virgin herself in her niche in the transept  had he felt during these years any qualms of conscience at this concealment of the childs sex none for to him the babe was sexless as most befitted one who was to live and die at the foot of the altar there was no attempt to deceive god what mattered else nor was he withholding the child from the ministrations of the sacred sisters there was no convent near the mission and as each year passed the difficulty of restoring her to the position and duties of her sex became greater and more dangerous and then the acolytes destiny was sealed by what again appeared to father pedro as a direct interposition of providence the child developed a voice of such exquisite sweetness and purity that an angel seemed to have strayed into the little choir and kneeling worshipers below transported gazed upwards half expectant of a heavenly light breaking through the gloom of the raftered ceiling the fame of the little singer filled the valley of san carmel it was a miracle vouchsafed the mission don jose peralta remembered ah yes to have heard in old spain of boy choristers with such voices  and was this sacred trust to be withdrawn from him was this life which he had brought out of an unknown world of sin unstained and pure consecrated and dedicated to god just in the dawn of power and promise for the glory of the mother church to be taken from his side and at the word of a selfconvicted man of sina man whose tardy repentance was not yet absolved by the holy church never never father pedro dwelt upon the strangers rejection of the ministrations of the church with a pitiable satisfaction had he accepted it he would have had a sacred claim upon father pedros sympathy and confidence yet he rose again uneasily and with irregular steps returned to the corridor passing the door of the familiar little cell beside his own the window the table and even the scant toilette utensils were filled with the flowers of yesterday some of them withered and dry the white gown of the little chorister was hanging emptily against the wall father pedro started and trembled it seemed as if the spiritual life of the child had slipped away with its garments  in that slight chill which even in the hottest days in california always invests any shadow cast in that white sunlight father pedro shivered in the corridor passing again into the garden he followed in fancy the wayfaring figure of francisco saw the child arrive at the rancho of don juan and with the fateful blindness of all dreamers projected a picture most unlike the reality he followed the pilgrims even to san jose and saw the child deliver the missive which gave the secret of her sex and condition to the father superior that the authority at san jose might dissent with the padre of san carmel or decline to carry out his designs did not occur to the oneidead priest like all solitary people isolated from passing events he made no allowances for occurrences outside of his routine yet at this moment a sudden thought whitened his yellow cheek what if the father superior deemed it necessary to impart the secret to francisco would the child recoil at the deception and perhaps cease to love him it was the first time in his supreme selfishness he had taken the acolytes feelings into account he had thought of him only as one owing implicit obedience to him as a temporal and spiritual guide  reverend father  he turned impatiently it was his muleteer jose father pedros sunken eye brightened  ah jose quickly then hast thou found sanchicha  truly your reverence and i have brought her with me just as she is though if your reverence make more of her than to fill the sixfoot hole and say a prayer over her ill give the mule that brought her here for food for the bulls horns she neither hears nor speaks but whether from weakness or sheer wantonness i know not  peace then and let thy tongue take example from hers bring her with thee into the sacristy and attend without go  father pedro watched the disappearing figure of the muleteer and hurriedly swept his thin dry hand veined and ribbed like a brown november leaf over his stony forehead with a sound that seemed almost a rustle then he suddenly stiffened his fingers over his breviary dropped his arms perpendicularly before him and with a rigid step returned to the corridor and passed into the sacristy  for a moment in the halfdarkness the room seemed to be empty tossed carelessly in the corner appeared some blankets topped by a few straggling black horse tails like an unstranded riata a trembling agitated the mass as father pedro approached he bent over the heap and distinguished in its midst the glowing black eyes of sanchicha the indian centenarian of the mission san carmel only her eyes lived helpless boneless and jellylike old age had overtaken her with a mild form of deliquescence  listen sanchicha said the father gravely it is important that thou shouldst refresh thy memory for a moment look back fourteen years mother it is but yesterday to thee thou dost remember the babya little muchacha thou broughtest me thenfourteen years ago  the old womans eyes became intelligent and turned with a quick look towards the open door of the church and thence towards the choir  the padre made a motion of irritation no no thou dost not understand thou dost not attend me knowest thou of any mark of clothing trinket or amulet found upon the babe  the light of the old womans eyes went out she might have been dead father pedro waited a moment and then laid his hand impatiently on her shoulder  dost thou mean there are none  a ray of light struggled back into her eyes  none  and thou hast kept back or put away no sign nor mark of her parentage tell me on this crucifix  the eyes caught the crucifix and became as empty as the orbits of the carven christ upon it  father pedro waited patiently a moment passed only the sound of the muleteers spurs was heard in the courtyard  it is well he said at last with a sigh of relief pepita shall give thee some refreshment and jose will bring thee back again i will summon him  he passed out of the sacristy door leaving it open a ray of sunlight darted eagerly in and fell upon the grotesque heap in the corner sanchichas eyes lived again more than that a singular movement came over her face the hideous caverns of her toothless mouth openedshe laughed the step of jose was heard in the corridor and she became again inert  the third day which should have brought the return of antonio was nearly spent father pedro was impatient but not alarmed the good fathers at san jose might naturally detain antonio for the answer which might require deliberation if any mischance had occurred to francisco antonio would have returned or sent a special messenger at sunset he was in his accustomed seat in the orchard his hands clasped over the breviary in his listless lap his eyes fixed upon the mountain between him and that mysterious sea that had brought so much into his life he was filled with a strange desire to see it a vague curiosity hitherto unknown to his preoccupied life he wished to gaze upon that strand perhaps the very spot where she had been found he doubted not his questioning eyes would discover some forgotten trace of her under his persistent will and aided by the holy virgin the sea would give up its secret he looked at the fog creeping along the summit and recalled the latest gossip of san carmel how that since the advent of the americanos it was gradually encroaching on the mission the hated name vividly recalled to him the features of the stranger as he had stood before him three nights ago in this very garden so vividly that he sprang to his feet with an exclamation it was no fancy but senor cranch himself advancing from under the shadow of a pear tree  i reckoned id catch you here said mr cranch with the same dry practical business fashion as if he was only resuming an interrupted conversation and i reckon i aint going to keep you a minit longer than i did tother day he mutely referred to his watch which he already held in his hand and then put it back in his pocket well we found her  francisco interrupted the priest with a single stride laying his hand upon cranchs arm and staring into his eyes  mr cranch quietly removed father pedros hand i reckon that wasnt the name as i caught it he returned dryly hadnt you better sit down  pardon mepardon me senor said the priest hastily sinking back upon his bench i was thinking of other things youyoucame upon me suddenly i thought it was the acolyte go on senor i am interested  i thought youd be said cranch quietly thats why i came and then you might be of service too  true true said the priest with rapid accents and this girl senor this girl is  juanita the mestiza adopted daughter of don juan briones over on the santa clare valley replied cranch jerking his thumb over his shoulder and then sitting down upon the bench beside father pedro  the priest turned his feverish eyes piercingly upon his companion for a few seconds and then doggedly fixed them upon the ground cranch drew a plug of tobacco from his pocket cut off a portion placed it in his cheek and then quietly began to strap the blade of his jackknife upon his boot father pedro saw it from under his eyelids and even in his preoccupation despised him  then you are certain she is the babe you seek said the father without looking up  i reckon as near as you can be certain of anything her age tallies she was the only foundling girl baby baptized by you you knowhe partly turned round appealingly to the padrethat year injin woman says she picked up a baby looks like a pretty clear case dont it  and the clothes friend cranch said the priest with his eyes still on the ground and a slight assumption of easy indifference  they will be forthcoming like enough when the time comes said cranch the main thing at first was to find the girl that was my job the lawyers i reckon can fit the proofs and say whats wanted later on  but why lawyers continued padre pedro with a slight sneer he could not repress if the child is found and senor cranch is satisfied  on account of the property business is business  the property  mr cranch pressed the back of his knifeblade on his boot shut it up with a click and putting it in his pocket said calmly  well i reckon the million of dollars that her father left when he died which naturally belongs to her will require some proof that she is his daughter  he had placed both his hands in his pockets and turned his eyes full upon father pedro the priest arose hurriedly  but you said nothing of this before senor cranch said he with a gesture of indignation turning his back quite upon cranch and taking a step towards the refectory  why should i i was looking after the girl not the property returned cranch following the padre with watchful eyes but still keeping his careless easy attitude  ah well will it be said so think you eh bueno what will the world think of your sacred quest eh continued the padre pedro forgetting himself in his excitement but still averting his face from his companion  the world will look after the proofs and i reckon not bother if the proofs are all right replied cranch carelessly and the girl wont think the worse of me for helping her to a fortune hallo youve dropped something he leaped to his feet picked up the breviary which had fallen from the padres fingers and returned it to him with a slight touch of gentleness that was unsuspected in the man  the priests dry tremulous hand grasped the volume without acknowledgment  but these proofs he said hastily these proofs senor  oh well youll testify to the baptism you know  but if i refuse if i will have nothing to do with this thing if i will not give my word that there is not some mistake said the priest working himself into a feverish indignation that there are not slips of memory eh of so many children baptized is it possible for me to know which eh and if this juanita is not your girl eh  then youll help me to find who is said cranch coolly  father pedro turned furiously on his tormentor overcome by his vigil and anxiety he was oblivious of everything but the presence of the man who seemed to usurp the functions of his own conscience who are you who speak thus he said hoarsely advancing upon cranch with outstretched and anathematizing fingers who are you senor heathen who dare to dictate to me a father of holy church i tell you i will have none of this never i will not from this moment you understandnothing i will never     he stopped the first stroke of the angelus rang from the little tower the first stroke of that bell before whose magic exorcism all human passions fled the peaceful bell that had for fifty years lulled the little fold of san carmel to prayer and rest came to his throbbing ear his trembling hands groped for the crucifix carried it to his left breast his lips moved in prayer his eyes were turned to the cold passionless sky where a few faint farspaced stars had silently stolen to their places the angelus still rang his trembling ceased he remained motionless and rigid  the american who had uncovered in deference to the worshiper rather than the rite waited patiently the eyes of father pedro returned to the earth moist as if with dew caught from above he looked half absently at cranch  forgive me my son he said in a changed voice i am only a worn old man i must talk with thee more of thisbut not tonightnot tonighttomorrowtomorrowtomorrow  he turned slowly and appeared to glide rather than move under the trees until the dark shadow of the mission tower met and encompassed him cranch followed him with anxious eyes then he removed the quid of tobacco from his cheek  just as i reckoned remarked he quite audibly hes clean gold on the bed rock after all     chapter iv   that night father pedro dreamed a strange dream how much of it was reality how long it lasted or when he awoke from it he could not tell the morbid excitement of the previous day culminated in a febrile exaltation in which he lived and moved as in a separate existence  this is what he remembered he thought he had risen at night in a sudden horror of remorse and making his way to the darkened church had fallen upon his knees before the high altar when all at once the acolytes voice broke from the choir but in accents so dissonant and unnatural that it seemed a sacrilege and he trembled he thought he had confessed the secret of the childs sex to cranch but whether the next morning or a week later he did not know he fancied too that cranch had also confessed some trifling deception to him but what or why he could not remember so much greater seemed the enormity of his own transgression he thought cranch had put in his hands the letter he had written to the father superior saying that his secret was still safe and that he had been spared the avowal and the scandal that might have ensued but through all and above all he was conscious of one fixed idea to seek the seashore with sanchicha and upon the spot where she had found francisco meet the young girl who had taken his place and so part from her forever he had a dim recollection that this was necessary to some legal identification of her as arranged by cranch but how or why he did not understand enough that it was a part of his penance  it was early morning when the faithful antonio accompanied by sanchicha and jose rode forth with him from the mission of san carmel except on the expressionless features of the old woman there was anxiety and gloom upon the faces of the little cavalcade he did not know how heavily his strange abstraction and hallucinations weighed upon their honest hearts as they wound up the ascent of the mountain he noticed that antonio and jose conversed with bated breath and many pious crossings of themselves but with eyes always wistfully fixed upon him he wondered if as part of his penance he ought not to proclaim his sin and abase himself before them but he knew that his devoted followers would insist upon sharing his punishment and he remembered his promise to cranch that for her sake he would say nothing before they reached the summit he turned once or twice to look back upon the mission how small it looked lying there in the peaceful valley contrasted with the broad sweep of the landscape beyond stopped at the further east only by the dim ghostlike outlines of the sierras but the strong breath of the sea was beginning to be felt in a few moments more they were facing it with lowered sombreros and flying serapes and the vast glittering illimitable pacific opened out beneath them  dazed and blinded as it seemed to him by the shining restless expanse father pedro rode forward as if still in a dream suddenly he halted and called antonio to his side  tell me child didst thou not say that this coast was wild and desolate of man beast and habitation  truly i did reverend father  then what is that pointing to the shore  almost at their feet nestled a cluster of houses at the head of an arroyo reaching up from the beach they looked down upon the smoke of a manufactory chimney upon strange heaps of material and curious engines scattered along the sands with here and there moving specks of human figures in a little bay a schooner swung at her cables  the vaquero crossed himself in stupefied alarm i know not your reverence it is only two years ago before the rodeo that i was here for strayed colts and i swear by the blessed bones of san antonio that it was as i said  ah it is like these americanos responded the muleteer i have it from my brother diego that he went from san jose to pescadero two months ago across the plains with never a hut nor fonda to halt at all the way he returned in seven days and in the midst of the plain there were three houses and a mill and many people and why was it ah mother of god one had picked up in the creek where he drank that much of gold and the muleteer tapped one of the silver coins that fringed his jacket sleeves in place of buttons  and they are washing the sands for gold there now said antonio eagerly pointing to some men gathered round a machine like an enormous cradle let us hasten on  father pedros momentary interest had passed the words of his companions fell dull and meaningless upon his dreaming ears he was conscious only that the child was more a stranger to him as an outcome of this hard bustling life than when he believed her borne to him over the mysterious sea it perplexed his dazed disturbed mind to think that if such an antagonistic element could exist within a dozen miles of the mission and he not know it could not such an atmosphere have been around him even in his monastic isolation and he remain blind to it had he really lived in the world without knowing it had it been in his blood had it impelled him tohe shuddered and rode on  they were at the last slope of the zigzag descent to the shore when he saw the figures of a man and woman moving slowly through a field of wild oats not far from the trail it seemed to his distorted fancy that the man was cranch the woman his heart stopped beating ah could it be he had never seen her in her proper garb would she look like that would she be as tall he thought he bade jose and antonio go on slowly before with sanchicha and dismounted walking slowly between the high stalks of grain lest he should disturb them they evidently did not hear his approach but were talking earnestly it seemed to father pedro that they had taken each others hands and as he looked cranch slipped his arm round her waist with only a blind instinct of some dreadful sacrilege in this act father pedro would have rushed forward when the girls voice struck his ear he stopped breathless it was not francisco but juanita the little mestiza  but are you sure you are not pretending to love me now as you pretended to think i was the muchacha you had run away with and lost are you sure it is not pity for the deceit you practiced upon meupon don juanupon poor father pedro  it seemed as if cranch had tried to answer with a kiss for the girl drew suddenly away from him with a coquettish fling of the black braids and whipped her little brown hands behind her  well look here said cranch with the same easy goodnatured practical directness which the priest remembered and which would have passed for philosophy in a more thoughtful man put it squarely then in the first place it was don juan and the alcalde who first suggested you might be the child  but you have said you knew it was francisco all the time interrupted juanita  i did but when i found the priest would not assist me at first and admit that the acolyte was a girl i preferred to let him think i was deceived in giving a fortune to another and leave it to his own conscience to permit it or frustrate it i was right i reckon it was pretty hard on the old man at his time of life and wrapped up as he was in the girl but at the moment he came up to the scratch like a man  and to save him you have deceived me thank you senor said the girl with a mock curtsey  i reckon i preferred to have you for a wife than a daughter said cranch if thats what you mean when you know me better juanita he continued gravely youll know that i would never have let you believe i sought in you the one if i had not hoped to find in you the other  bueno and when did you have that pretty hope  when i first saw you  and that wastwo weeks ago  a year ago juanita when francisco visited you at the rancho i followed and saw you  juanita looked at him a moment and then suddenly darted at him caught him by the lapels of his coat and shook him like a terrier  are you sure that you did not love that francisco speak she shook him again swear that you did not follow her  buti did said cranch laughing and shaking between the clenching of the little hands  judas iscariot swear you do not love her all this while  but juanita  swear  cranch swore then to father pedros intense astonishment she drew the americans face towards her own by the ears and kissed him  but you might have loved her and married a fortune said juanita after a pause  where would have been my reparationmy duty returned cranch with a laugh  reparation enough for her to have had you said juanita with that rapid disloyalty of one loving woman to another in an emergency this provoked another kiss from cranch and then juanita said demurely  but we are far from the trail let us return or we shall miss father pedro are you sure he will come  a week ago he promised to be here to see the proofs today  the voices were growing fainter and fainter they were returning to the trail  father pedro remained motionless a week ago was it a week ago sincesince what and what had he been doing here listening he father pedro listening like an idle peon to the confidences of two lovers but they had talked of him of his crime and the man had pitied him why did he not speak why did he not call after them he tried to raise his voice it sank in his throat with a horrible choking sensation the nearest heads of oats began to nod to him he felt himself swaying backwards and forwards he fellheavily down down down from the summit of the mountain to the floor of the mission chapel and there he lay in the dark    he moves  blessed saint anthony preserve him  it was antonios voice it was joses arm it was the field of wild oats the sky above his headall unchanged  what has happened said the priest feebly  a giddiness seized your reverence just now as we were coming to seek you  and you met no one  no one your reverence  father pedro passed his hand across his forehead  but who are these he said pointing to two figures who now appeared upon the trail  antonio turned  it is the americano senor cranch and his adopted daughter the mestiza juanita seeking your reverence methinks  ah said father pedro  cranch came forward and greeted the priest cordially it was kind of you father pedro he said meaningly with a significant glance at jose and antonio to come so far to bid me and my adopted daughter farewell we depart when the tide serves but not before you partake of our hospitality in yonder cottage  father pedro gazed at cranch and then at juanita  i see he stammered but she goes not alone she will be strange at first she takes some friend perhapssome companion he continued tremulously  a very old and dear one father pedro who is waiting for us now  he led the way to a little white cottage so little and white and recent that it seemed a mere fleck of sea foam cast on the sands disposing of jose and antonio in the neighboring workshop and outbuildings he assisted the venerable sanchicha to dismount and together with father pedro and juanita entered a white palisaded enclosure beside the cottage and halted before what appeared to be a large folding trapdoor covering a slight sandy mound it was locked with a padlock beside it stood the american alcalde and don juan briones father pedro looked hastily around for another figure but it was not there  gentlemen began cranch in his practical business way i reckon you all know weve come here to identify a young lady whohe hesitatedwas lately under the care of father pedro with a foundling picked up on this shore fifteen years ago by an indian woman how this foundling came here and how i was concerned in it you all know ive told everybody here how i scrambled ashore leaving that baby in the dingy supposing it would be picked up by the boat pursuing me ive told some of you he looked at father pedro how i first discovered from one of the men three years ago that the child was not found by its father but i have never told any one before now i knew it was picked up here  i never could tell the exact locality where i came ashore for the fog was coming on as it is now but two years ago i came up with a party of gold hunters to work these sands one day digging near this creek i struck something embedded deep below the surface well gentlemen it wasnt gold but something worth more to me than gold or silver here it is  at a sign the alcalde unlocked the doors and threw them open they disclosed an irregular trench in which filled with sand lay the halfexcavated stern of a boat  it was the dingy of the trinidad gentlemen you can still read her name i found hidden away tucked under the stern sheets mouldy and waterworn some clothes that i recognized to be the babys i knew then that the child had been taken away alive for some purpose and the clothes were left so that she should carry no trace with her i recognized the hand of an indian i set to work quietly i found sanchicha here she confessed to finding a baby but what she had done with it she would not at first say but since then she has declared before the alcalde that she gave it to father pedro of san carmel and that here it standsfrancisco that was francisca that it is  he stepped aside to make way for a tall girl who had approached from the cottage  father pedro had neither noticed the concluding words nor the movement of cranch his eyes were fixed upon the imbecile sanchichasanchicha on whom to render his rebuke more complete the deity seemed to have worked a miracle and restored intelligence to eye and lip he passed his hand tremblingly across his forehead and turned away when his eye fell upon the last comer  it was she the moment he had longed for and dreaded had come she stood there animated handsome filled with a hurtful consciousness in her new charms her fresh finery and the pitiable trinkets that had supplanted her scapulary and which played under her foolish fingers the past had no place in her preoccupied mind her bright eyes were full of eager anticipation of a substantial future the incarnation of a frivolous world even as she extended one hand to him in halfcoquettish embarrassment she arranged the folds of her dress with the other at the touch of her fingers he felt himself growing old and cold even the penance of parting which he had looked forward to was denied him there was no longer sympathy enough for sorrow he thought of the empty choristers robe in the little cell but not now with regret he only trembled to think of the flesh that he had once caused to inhabit it  thats all gentlemen broke in the practical voice of cranch whether there are proofs enough to make francisca the heiress of her fathers wealth the lawyers must say i reckon its enough for me that they give me the chance of repairing a wrong by taking her fathers place after all it was a mere chance  it was the will of god said father pedro solemnly  they were the last words he addressed them for when the fog had begun to creep inshore hastening their departure he only answered their farewells by a silent pressure of the hand mute lips and faroff eyes  when the sound of their laboring oars grew fainter he told antonio to lead him and sanchicha again to the buried boat there he bade her kneel beside him we will do penance here thou and i daughter he said gravely when the fog had drawn its curtain gently around the strange pair and sea and shore were blotted out he whispered tell me it was even so was it not daughter on the night she came when the distant clatter of blocks and rattle of cordage came from the unseen vessel now standing out to sea he whispered again so this is what thou didst hear even then and so during the night he marked more or less audibly to the halfconscious woman at his side the low whisper of the waves the murmur of the faroff breakers the lightening and thickening of the fog the phantoms of moving shapes and the slow coming of the dawn and when the morning sun had rent the veil over land and sea antonio and jose found him haggard but erect beside the trembling old woman with a blessing on his lips pointing to the horizon where a single sail still glimmered  va usted con dios      a blue grass penelope     chapter i   she was barely twentythree years old it is probable that up to that age and the beginning of this episode her life had been uneventful born to the easy mediocrity of such compensating extremes as a small farmhouse and large lands a good position and no society in that vast grazing district of kentucky known as the blue grass region all the possibilities of a western american girls existence lay before her a piano in the barewalled house the latest patented mower in the limitless meadows and a silk dress sweeping the rough floor of the unpainted meetinghouse were already the promise of those possibilities beautiful she was but the power of that beauty was limited by being equally shared with her few neighbors there were small narrow arched feet besides her own that trod the uncarpeted floors of outlying logcabins with equal grace and dignity bright clearly opened eyes that were equally capable of looking unabashed upon princes and potentates as a few later did and the heiress of the county judge read her own beauty without envy in the frank glances and unlowered crest of the blacksmiths daughter eventually she had married the male of her species a young stranger who as schoolmaster in the nearest town had utilized to some local extent a scant capital of education in obedience to the unwritten law of the west after the marriage was celebrated the doors of the ancestral home cheerfully opened and bride and bridegroom issued forth without regret and without sentiment to seek the further possibilities of a life beyond these already too familiar voices with their departure for california as mr and mrs spencer tucker the parental nest in the blue grass meadows knew them no more  they submitted with equal cheerfulness to the privations and excesses of their new conditions within three years the schoolmaster developed into a lawyer and capitalist the blue grass bride supplying a grace and ease to these transitions that were all her own she softened the abruptness of sudden wealth mitigated the austerities of newly acquired power and made the most glaring incongruity picturesque only one thing seemed to limit their progress in the region of these possibilities they were childless it was as if they had exhausted the future in their own youth leaving little or nothing for another generation to do   a southwesterly storm was beating against the dressingroom windows of their new house in one of the hilly suburbs of san francisco and threatening the unseasonable frivolity of the stucco ornamentation of cornice and balcony mrs tucker had been called from the contemplation of the dreary prospect without by the arrival of a visitor on entering the drawingroom she found him engaged in a halfadmiring halfresentful examination of its new furniture and hangings mrs tucker at once recognized mr calhoun weaver a former blue grass neighbor with swift feminine intuition she also felt that his slight antagonism was likely to be transferred from her furniture to herself waiving it with the lazy amiability of southern indifference she welcomed him by the familiarity of a christian name  i reckoned that mebbee you opined old blue grass friends wouldnt naturally hitch on to them fancy doins he said glancing around the apartment to avoid her clear eyes as if resolutely setting himself against the old charm of her manner as he had against the more recent glory of her surroundings but i thought id just drop in for the sake of old times  why shouldnt you cal said mrs tucker with a frank smile  especially as im going up to sacramento tonight with some influential friends he continued with an ostentation calculated to resist the assumption of her charms and her furniture senator dyce of kentucky and his cousin judge briggs perhaps you know em or may be spenceri mean mr tuckerdoes  i reckon said mrs tucker smiling but tell me something about the boys and girls at vineville and about yourself youre looking well and right smart too she paused to give due emphasis to this latter recognition of a huge gold chain with which her visitor was somewhat ostentatiously trifling  i didnt know as you cared to hear anything about blue grass he returned a little abashed ive been away from there some time myself he added his uneasy vanity taking fresh alarm at the faint suspicion of patronage on the part of his hostess theyre doin well though perhaps as well as some others  and youre not married yet continued mrs tucker oblivious of the innuendo ah cal she added archly i am afraid you are as fickle as ever what poor girl in vineville have you left pining  the simple face of the man before her flushed with foolish gratification at this oldfashioned ambiguous flattery now look yer belle he said chuckling if youre talking of old times and you think i bear malice agin spencer why  but mrs tucker interrupted what might have been an inopportune sentimental retrospect with a finger of arch but languid warning that will do im dying to know all about it and you must stay to dinner and tell me its right mean you cant see spencer too but he isnt back from sacramento yet  grateful as a teteatete with his old neighbor in her more prosperous surroundings would have been if only for the sake of later gossiping about it he felt it would be inconsistent with his pride and his assumption of present business more than that he was uneasily conscious that in mrs tuckers simple and unaffected manner there was a greater superiority than he had ever noticed during their previous acquaintance he would have felt kinder to her had she shown any airs and graces which he could have commented upon and forgiven he stammered some vague excuse of preoccupation yet lingered in the hope of saying something which if not aggressively unpleasant might at least transfer to her indolent serenity some of his own irritation i reckon he said as he moved hesitatingly towards the door that spencer has made himself easy and secure in them business risks hes taking that ere alameda ditch affair theyre talking so much about is a mighty big thing rather too big if it ever got to falling back on him but i suppose hes accustomed to take risks  of course he is said mrs tucker gayly he married me  the visitor smiled feebly but was not equal to the opportunity offered for gallant repudiation but suppose you aint accustomed to risks  why not i married him said mrs tucker  mr calhoun weaver was human and succumbed to this last charming audacity he broke into a noisy but genuine laugh shook mrs tuckers hand with effusion said now thats regular blue grass and no mistake and retreated under cover of his hilarity in the hall he made a rallying stand to repeat confidentially to the servant who had overheard them blue grass all over you bet your life and opening the door was apparently swallowed up in the tempest  mrs tuckers smile kept her lips until she had returned to her room and even then languidly shone in her eyes for some minutes after as she gazed abstractedly from her window on the stormtossed bay in the distance perhaps some girlish vision of the peaceful blue glass plain momentarily usurped the prospect but it is to be doubted if there was much romance in that retrospect or that it was more interesting to her than the positive and sharply cut outlines of the practical life she now held howbeit she soon forgot this fancy in lazily watching a boat that in the teeth of the gale was beating round alcatraz island although at times a mere blank speck on the gray waste of foam a closer scrutiny showed it to be one of those lateenrigged italian fishing boats that so often flecked the distant bay lost in the sudden darkening of rain or reappearing beneath the lifted curtain of the squall she watched it weather the island and then turn its laboring but persistent course towards the open channel a rent in the indianinky sky that showed the narrowing portals of the golden gate beyond revealed as unexpectedly the destination of the little craft a tall ship that hitherto lay hidden in the mist of the saucelito shore as the distance lessened between boat and ship they were again lost in the downward swoop of another squall when it lifted the ship was creeping under the headland towards the open sea but the boat was gone mrs tucker in vain rubbed the pane with her handkerchief it had vanished meanwhile the ship as she neared the gate drew out from the protecting headland stood outlined for a moment with spars and canvas hearsed in black against the lurid rent in the horizon and then seemed to sink slowly into the heaving obscurity beyond a sudden onset of rain against the windows obliterated the remaining prospect the entrance of a servant completed the diversion  captain poindexter maam  mrs tucker lifted her pretty eyebrows interrogatively captain poindexter was a legal friend of her husband and had dined there frequently nevertheless she asked did you tell him mr tucker was not at home  yes m  did he ask for me  yes m  tell him ill be down directly  mrs tuckers quiet face did not betray the fact that this second visitor was even less interesting than the first in her heart she did not like captain poindexter with a clever womans instinct she had early detected the fact that he had a superior stronger nature than her husband as a loyal wife she secretly resented the occasional unconscious exhibition of this fact on the part of his intimate friend in their familiar intercourse added to this slight jealousy there was a certain moral antagonism between herself and the captain which none but themselves knew they were both philosophers but mrs tuckers serene and languid optimism would not tolerate the compassionate and kindhearted pessimisms of the lawyer knowing what jack poindexter does of human nature her husband had once said its mighty fine in him to be so kind and forgiving you ought to like him better belle and qualify myself to be forgiven said the lady pertly i dont see what youre driving at belle i give it up had responded the puzzled husband mrs tucker kissed his high but foolish forehead tenderly and said im glad you dont dear  meanwhile her second visitor had like the first employed the interval in a critical survey of the glories of the new furniture but with apparently more compassion than resentment in his manner once only had his expression changed over the fireplace hung a large photograph of mr spencer tucker it was retouched refined and idealized in the highest style of that polite and diplomatic art as captain poindexter looked upon the fringed hazel eyes the drooping raven moustache the clustering ringlets and the byronic full throat and turneddown collar of his friend a smile of exhausted humorous tolerance and affectionate impatience curved his lips well you are a fool arent you he apostrophized it halfaudibly  he was standing before the picture as she entered even in the trying contiguity of that peerless work he would have been called a finelooking man as he advanced to greet her it was evident that his military title was not one of the mere fanciful sobriquets of the locality in his erect figure and the disciplined composure of limb and attitude there were still traces of the refined academic rigors of west point the pliant adaptability of western civilization which enabled him three years before to leave the army and transfer his executive ability to the more profitable profession of the law had loosed sash and shoulderstrap but had not entirely removed the restraint of the one or the bearing of the other  spencer is in sacramento began mrs tucker in languid explanation after the first greetings were over  i knew he was not here replied captain poindexter gently as he drew the proffered chair towards her but this is business that concerns you both he stopped and glanced upwards at the picture i suppose you know nothing of his business of course not he added reassuringly nothing absolutely nothing certainly he said this so kindly and yet so positively as if to promptly dispose of that question before going further that she assented mechanically well then hes taken some big risks in the way of business andwell things have gone bad with him you know very bad really they couldnt be worse of course it was dreadfully rash and all that he went on as if commenting upon the amusing waywardness of a child but the result is the usual smashup of everything money credit and all he laughed and added yes hes got cut offmules and baggage regularly routed and dispersed im in earnest he raised his eyebrows and frowned slightly as if to deprecate any corresponding hilarity on the part of mrs tucker or any attempt to make too light of the subject and then rising placed his hands behind his back beamed halfhumorously upon her from beneath her husbands picture and repeated thats so  mrs tucker instinctively knew that he spoke the truth and that it was impossible for him to convey it in any other than his natural manner but between the shock and the singular influence of that manner she could at first only say you dont mean it fully conscious of the utter inanity of the remark and that it seemed scarcely less coldblooded than his own  poindexter still smiling nodded  she arose with an effort she had recovered from the first shock and pride lent her a determined calmness that more than equaled poindexters easy philosophy  where is he she asked  at sea and i hope by this time where he can not be found or followed  was her momentary glimpse of the outgoing ship a coincidence or only a vision she was confused and giddy but mastering her weakness she managed to continue in a lower voice  you have no message for me from him he told you nothing to tell me  nothing absolutely nothing replied poindexter it was as much as he could do i reckon to get fairly away before the crash came  then you did not see him go  well no said poindexter id hardly have managed things in this way he checked himself and added with a forgiving smile but he was the best judge of what he needed of course  i suppose i will hear from him she said quietly as soon as he is safe he must have had enough else to think about poor fellow  she said this so naturally and quietly that poindexter was deceived he had no idea that the collected woman before him was thinking only of solitude and darkness of her own room and madly longing to be there he said yes i dare say in quite another voice and glanced at the picture but as she remained standing he continued more earnestly i didnt come here to tell you what you might read in the newspapers tomorrow morning and what everybody might tell you before that time i want you to do something to save a fragment of your property from the ruin do you understand i want you to make a rally and bring off something in good order  for him said mrs tucker with brightening eyes  well yes of courseif you likebut as if for yourself do you know the rancho de los cuervos  i do  its almost the only bit of real property your husband hasnt sold mortgaged or pledged why it was exempt or whether only forgotten i cant say  ill tell you why said mrs tucker with a slight return of color it was the first land we ever bought and spencer always said it should be mine and he would build a new house on it  captain poindexter smiled and nodded at the picture oh he did say that did he well thats evidence but you see he never gave you the deed and by sunrise tomorrow his creditors will attach itunless  unless repeated mrs tucker with kindling eyes  unless continued captain poindexter they happen to find you in possession  ill go said mrs tucker  of course you will returned poindexter pleasantly only as its a big contract to take suppose we see how you can fill it its forty miles to los cuervos and you cant trust yourself to steamboat or stagecoach the steamboat left an hour ago  if i had only known this then ejaculated mrs tucker  i knew it but you had company then said poindexter with ironical gallantry and i wouldnt disturb you without saying how he knew it he continued in the stagecoach you might be recognized you must go in a private conveyance and alone even i can not go with you for i must go on before and meet you there can you drive forty miles  mrs tucker lifted up her abstracted pretty lids i once drove fiftyat home she returned simply  good and i dare say you did it then for fun do it now for something real and personal as we lawyers say you will have relays and a plan of the road its rough weather for a pasear but all the better for that youll have less company on the road  how soon can i go she asked  the sooner the better ive arranged everything for you already he continued with a laugh come now thats a compliment to you isnt it he smiled a moment in her steadfast earnest face and then said more gravely youll do now listen  he then carefully detailed his plan there was so little of excitement or mystery in their manner that the servant who returned to light the gas never knew that the ruin and bankruptcy of the house was being told before her or that its mistress was planning her secret flight  good afternoon i will see you tomorrow then said poindexter raising his eyes to hers as the servant opened the door for him  good afternoon repeated mrs tucker quietly answering his look you need not light the gas in my room mary she continued in the same tone of voice as the door closed upon him i shall lie down for a few moments and then i may run over to the robinsons for the evening  she regained her room composedly the longing desire to bury her head in her pillow and think out her position had gone she did not apostrophize her fate she did not weep few real women do in the access of calamity or when there is anything else to be done she felt that she knew it all she believed she had sounded the profoundest depths of the disaster and seemed already so old in her experience that she almost fancied she had been prepared for it perhaps she did not fully appreciate it to a life like hers it was only an incident the mere turning of a page of the illimitable book of youth the breaking up of what she now felt had become a monotony in fact she was not quite sure she had ever been satisfied with their present success had it brought her all she expected she wanted to say this to her husband not only to comfort him poor fellow but that they might come to a better understanding of life in the future she was not perhaps different from other loving women who believing in this unattainable goal of matrimony have sought it in the various episodes of fortune or reverses in the bearing of children or the loss of friends in her childless experience there was no other life that had taken root in her circumstances and might suffer transplantation only she and her husband could lose or profit by the change the perfect understanding would come under other conditions than these  she would have gone superstitiously to the window to gaze in the direction of the vanished ship but another instinct restrained her she would put aside all yearning for him until she had done something to help him and earned the confidence he seemed to have withheld perhaps it was prideperhaps she never really believed his exodus was distant or complete  with a full knowledge that tomorrow the various ornaments and pretty trifles around her would be in the hands of the law she gathered only a few necessaries for her flight and some familiar personal trinkets i am constrained to say that this selfabnegation was more fastidious than moral she had no more idea of the ethics of bankruptcy than any other charming woman she simply did not like to take with her any contagious memory of the chapter of the life just closing she glanced around the home she was leaving without a lingering regret there was no sentiment of tradition or custom that might be destroyed her roots lay too near the surface to suffer from dislocation the happiness of her childless union had depended upon no domestic centre nor was its flame sacred to any local hearthstone it was without a sigh that when night had fully fallen she slipped unnoticed down the staircase at the door of the drawingroom she paused and then entered with the first guilty feeling of shame she had known that evening looking stealthily around she mounted a chair before her husbands picture kissed the irreproachable moustache hurriedly said you foolish darling you and slipped out again with this touching indorsement of the views of a rival philosopher she closed the door softly and left her home forever     chapter ii   the wind and rain had cleared the unfrequented suburb of any observant lounger and the darkness lit only by farspaced gusty lamps hid her hastening figure she had barely crossed the second street when she heard the quick clatter of hoofs behind her a buggy drove up to the curbstone and poindexter leaped out she entered quickly but for a moment he still held the reins of the impatient horse hes rather fresh he said eying her keenly are you sure you can manage him  give me the reins she said simply  he placed them in the two firm wellshaped hands that reached from the depths of the vehicle and was satisfied yet he lingered  its rough work for a lone woman he said almost curtly i cant go with you but speak frankly is there any man you know whom you can trust well enough to take its not too late yet think a moment  he paused over the buttoning of the leather apron of the vehicle  no there is none answered the voice from the interior and its better so is all ready  one moment more he had recovered his halfbantering manner you have a friend and countryman already with you do you know your horse is blue grass good night  with these words ringing in her ears she began her journey the horse as if eager to maintain the reputation which his native district had given his race as well as the race of the pretty woman behind him leaped impatiently forward but pulled together by the fine and firm fingers that seemed to guide rather than check his exuberance he presently struck into the long swinging pace of his kind and kept it throughout without break or acceleration over the paved streets the light buggy rattled and the slender shafts danced around his smooth barrel but when they touched the level highroad horse and vehicle slipped forward through the night a swift and noiseless phantom mrs tucker could see his graceful back dimly rising and falling before her with tireless rhythm and could feel the intelligent pressure of his mouth until it seemed the responsive grasp of a powerful but kindly hand the faint glow of conquest came to her cold cheek the slight stirrings of pride moved her preoccupied heart a soft light filled her hazel eyes a desolate woman bereft of husband and home and flying through storm and night she knew not where she still leaned forward towards her horse was he blue grass then dear old boy she gently cooed at him in the darkness he evidently was and responded by blowing her an ostentatious equine kiss and he would be good to his own forsaken belle she murmured caressingly and wouldnt let any one harm her but here overcome by the lazy witchery of her voice he shook his head so violently that mrs tucker after the fashion of her sex had the double satisfaction of demurely restraining the passion she had evoked  to avoid the more traveled thoroughfare while the evening was still early it had been arranged that she should at first take a less direct but less frequented road this was a famous pleasuredrive from san francisco a graveled and sanded stretch of eight miles to the sea and an ultimate cocktail in a stately pleasuredome decreed among the surf and rocks of the pacific shore it was deserted now and left to the unobstructed sweep of the wind and rain mrs tucker would not have chosen this road with the instinctive jealousy of a bucolic inland race born by great rivers she did not like the sea and again the dim and dreary waste tended to recall the vision connected with her husbands flight upon which she had resolutely shut her eyes but when she had reached it the road suddenly turned following the trend of the beach and she was exposed to the full power of its dread fascinations the combined roar of sea and shore was in her ears as the direct force of the gale had compelled her to furl the protecting hood of the buggy to keep the light vehicle from oversetting or drifting to leeward she could no longer shut out the heaving chaos on the right from which the pallid ghosts of dead and dying breakers dimly rose and sank as if in awful salutation at times through the darkness a white sheet appeared spread before the path and beneath the wheels of the buggy which when withdrawn with a reluctant hiss seemed striving to drag the exhausted beach seaward with it but the blind terror of her horse who swerved at every sweep of the surge shamed her own halfsuperstitious fears and with the effort to control his alarm she regained her own selfpossession albeit with eyelashes wet not altogether with the salt spray from the sea this was followed by a reaction perhaps stimulated by her victory over the beaten animal when for a time she knew not how long she felt only a mad sense of freedom and power oblivious of even her sorrows her lost home and husband and with intense feminine consciousness she longed to be a man she was scarcely aware that the track turned again inland until the beat of the horses hoofs on the firm ground and an acceleration of speed showed her she had left the beach and the mysterious sea behind her and she remembered that she was near the end of the first stage of her journey half an hour later the twinkling lights of the roadside inn where she was to change horses rose out of the darkness  happily for her the ostler considered the horse who had a local reputation of more importance than the unknown muffled figure in the shadow of the unfurled hood and confined his attention to the animal after a careful examination of his feet and a few comments addressed solely to the superior creation he led him away mrs tucker would have liked to part more affectionately from her fourfooted compatriot and felt a sudden sense of loneliness at the loss of her new friend but a recollection of certain cautions of captain poindexters kept her mute nevertheless the ostlers ostentatious adjuration of now then arent you going to bring out that mustang for the senora puzzled her it was not until the fresh horse was put to and she had flung a piece of gold into the attendants hand that the gracias of his unmistakable saxon speech revealed to her the reason of the lawyers caution poindexter had evidently represented her to these people as a native californian who did not speak english in her inconsistency her blood took fire at this first suggestion of deceit and burned in her face why should he try to pass her off as anybody else why should she not use her own her husbands name she stopped and bit her lip  it was but the beginning of an uneasy train of thought she suddenly found herself thinking of her visitor calhoun weaver and not pleasantly he would hear of their ruin tomorrow perhaps of her own flight he would remember his visit and what would he think of her deceitful frivolity would he believe that she was then ignorant of the failure it was her first sense of any accountability to others than herself but even then it was rather owing to an uneasy consciousness of what her husband must feel if he were subjected to the criticisms of men like calhoun she wondered if others knew that he had kept her in ignorance of his flight did poindexter know it or had he only entrapped her into the admission why had she not been clever enough to make him think that she knew it already for the moment she hated poindexter for sharing that secret yet this was again followed by a new impatience of her husbands want of insight into her ability to help him of course the poor fellow could not bear to worry her could not bear to face such men as calhoun or even poindexter she added exultingly to herself but he might have sent her a line as he fled only to prepare her to meet and combat the shame alone it did not occur to her unsophisticated singleness of nature that she was accepting as an error of feeling what the world would call cowardly selfishness  at midnight the storm lulled and a few stars trembled through the rent clouds her eyes had become accustomed to the darkness and her country instincts a little overlaid by the urban experiences of the last few years came again to the surface she felt the fresh cool radiation from outlying upturned fields the faint sad odors from dim stretches of pricking grain and quickening leaf and wondered if at los cuervos it might be possible to reproduce the peculiar verdure of her native district she beguiled her fancy by an ambitious plan of retrieving their fortunes by farming her comfortable tastes had lately rebelled against the homeless mechanical cultivation of these desolate but teeming californian acres and for a moment indulged in a vision of a vineclad cottage home that in any other woman would have been sentimental her cramped limbs aching she took advantage of the security of the darkness and the familiar contiguity of the fields to get down from the vehicle gather her skirts together and run at the head of the mustang until her chill blood was thawed night drawing a modest veil over this charming revelation of the nymph and woman but the sudden shadow of a coyote checked the scouring feet of this swift camilla and sent her back precipitately to the buggy nevertheless she was refreshed and able to pursue her journey until the cold gray of early morning found her at the end of her second stage  her route was changed again from the main highway rendered dangerous by the approach of day and the contiguity of the neighboring rancheros the road was rough and hilly her new horse and vehicle in keeping with the rudeness of the routeby far the most difficult of her whole journey the rare wagon tracks that indicated her road were often scarcely discernible at times they led her through openings in the halfcleared woods skirted suspicious morasses painfully climbed the smooth domelike hills or wound along perilous slopes at a dangerous angle twice she had to alight and cling to the sliding wheels on one of those treacherous inclines or drag them from impending ruts or immovable mire in the growing light she could distinguish the distant lowlying marshes eaten by encroaching sloughs and insidious channels and beyond them the faint gray waste of the lower bay a darker peninsula in the marsh she knew to be the extreme boundary of her future home the rancho de los cuervos in another hour she began to descend to the plain and once more to approach the main road which now ran nearly parallel with her track she scanned it cautiously for any early traveler it stretched north and south in apparent unending solitude she struck into it boldly and urged her horse to the top of his speed until she reached the cross road that led to the rancho but here she paused and allowed the reins to drop idly on the mustangs back a singular and unaccountable irresolution seized her the difficulties of her journey were over the rancho lay scarcely two miles away she had achieved the most important part of her task in the appointed time but she hesitated what had she come for she tried to recall poindexters words even her own enthusiasm but in vain she was going to take possession of her husbands property she knew that was all but the means she had taken seemed now so exaggerated and mysterious for that simple end that she began to dread an impending something or some vague danger she had not considered that she was rushing blindly to meet full of this strange feeling she almost mechanically stopped her horse as she entered the cross road  from this momentary hesitation a singular sound aroused her it seemed at first like the swift hurrying by of some viewless courier of the air the vague alarm of some invisible flying herald or like the inarticulate cry that precedes a storm it seemed to rise and fall around her as if with some changing urgency of purpose raising her eyes she suddenly recognized the two farstretching lines of telegraph wire above her head and knew the aeolian cry of the morning wind along its vibrating chords but it brought another and more practical fear to her active brain perhaps even now the telegraph might be anticipating her had poindexter thought of that she hesitated no longer but laying the whip on the back of her jaded mustang again hurried forward  as the level horizon grew more distinct her attention was attracted by the white sail of a small boat lazily threading the sinuous channel of the slough it might be poindexter arriving by the more direct route from the steamboat that occasionally lay off the ancient embarcadero of the los cuervos rancho but even while watching it her quick ear caught the sound of galloping hoofs behind her she turned quickly and saw she was followed by a horseman but her momentary alarm was succeeded by a feeling of relief as she recognized the erect figure and square shoulders of poindexter yet she could not help thinking that he looked more like a militant scout and less like a cautious legal adviser than ever  with unaffected womanliness she rearranged her slightly disordered hair as he drew up beside her i thought you were in yonder boat she said  not i he laughed i distanced you by the high road two hours and have been reconnoitring until i saw you hesitate at the cross roads  but who is in the boat asked mrs tucker partly to hide her embarrassment  only some early chinese market gardener i dare say but you are safe now you are on your own land you passed the boundary monument of the rancho five minutes ago look all you see before you is yours from the embarcadero to yonder coast range  the tone of halfraillery did not however cheer mrs tucker she shuddered slightly and cast her eyes over the monotonous sea of tule and meadow  it doesnt look pretty perhaps continued poindexter but its the richest land in the state and the embarcadero will some day be a town i suppose youll call it blue grassville but you seem tired he said suddenly dropping his voice to a tone of halfhumorous sympathy  mrs tucker managed to get rid of an impending tear under the pretense of clearing her eyes are we nearly there she asked  nearly you know he added with the same halfmischievous halfsympathizing gayety its not exactly a palace youre coming to hardly its the old casa that has been deserted for years but i thought it better you should go into possession there than take up your abode at the shanty where your husbands farmhands are no one will know when you take possession of the casa while the very hour of your arrival at the shanty would be known and if they should make any trouble  if they should make any trouble repeated mrs tucker lifting her frank inquiring eyes to poindexter  his horse suddenly rearing from an apparently accidental prick of the spur it was a minute or two before he was able to explain i mean if this ever comes up as a matter of evidence you know but here we are  what had seemed to be an overgrown mound rising like an island out of the dead level of the grassy sea now resolved itself into a collection of adobe walls eaten and incrusted with shrubs and vines that bore some resemblance to the usual uninhabitedlooking exterior of a spanishamerican dwelling apertures that might have been lanceshaped windows or only cracks and fissures in the walls were choked up with weeds and grass and gave no passing glimpse of the interior entering a ruinous corral they came to a second entrance which proved to be the patio or courtyard the deserted wooden corridor with beams rafters and floors whitened by the eternal sun and wind contained a few withered leaves dryly rotting skins and thongs of leather as if undisturbed by human care but among these scattered debris of former life and habitation there was no noisome or unclean suggestion of decay a faint spiced odor of desiccation filled the bare walls there was no slime on stone or sundried brick in place of fungus or discolored moisture the dust of efflorescence whitened in the obscured corners the elements had picked clean the bones of the crumbling tenement ere they should finally absorb it  a withered old peon woman who in dress complexion and fibrous hair might have been an animated fragment of the debris rustled out of a low vaulted passage and welcomed them with a feeble crepitation following her into the dim interior mrs tucker was surprised to find some slight attempt at comfort and even adornment in the two or three habitable apartments they were scrupulously clean and dry two qualities which in her feminine eyes atoned for poverty of material  i could not send anything from san bruno the nearest village without attracting attention explained poindexter but if you can manage to picnic here for a day longer ill get one of our chinese friends here he pointed to the slough to bring over for his return cargo from across the bay any necessaries you may want there is no danger of his betraying you he added with an ironical smile chinamen and indians are by an ingenious provision of the statute of california incapable of giving evidence against a white person you can trust your handmaiden perfectlyeven if she cant trust you that is your sacred privilege under the constitution and now as i expect to catch the up boat ten miles from hence i must say goodby until tomorrow night i hope to bring you then some more definite plans for the future the worst is over he held her hand for a moment and with a graver voice continued you have done it very welldo you knowvery well  in the slight embarrassment produced by his sudden change of manner she felt that her thanks seemed awkward and restrained dont thank me he laughed with a prompt return of his former levity thats my trade i only advised you have saved yourself like a plucky womanshall i say like blue grass goodby he mounted his horse but as if struck by an afterthought wheeled and drew up by her side again if i were you i wouldnt see many strangers for a day or two and listen to as little news as a woman possibly can he laughed again waved her a halfgallant halfmilitary salute and was gone the question she had been trying to frame regarding the probability of communication with her husband remained unasked at least she had saved her pride before him  addressing herself to the care of her narrow household she mechanically put away the few things she had brought with her and began to readjust the scant furniture she was a little discomposed at first at the absence of bolts locks and even windowfastenings until assured by conchas evident inability to comprehend her concern that they were quite unknown at los cuervos her slight knowledge of spanish was barely sufficient to make her wants known so that the relief of conversation with her only companion was debarred her and she was obliged to content herself with the sapless crackling smiles and withered genuflexions that the old woman dropped like dead leaves in her path it was staring noon when the house singing like an empty shell in the monotonous wind she felt she could stand the solitude no longer and crossing the glaring patio and whistling corridor made her way to the open gateway  but the view without seemed to intensify her desolation the broad expanse of the shadowless plain reached apparently to the coast range trackless and unbroken save by one or two clusters of dwarfed oaks which at that distance were but mossy excrescences on the surface barely raised above the dead level on the other side the marsh took up the monotony and carried it scarcely interrupted by undefined watercourses to the faintly marked out horizon line of the remote bay scattered and apparently motionless black spots on the meadows that gave a dreary significance to the title of the crows which the rancho bore and sudden gray clouds of sandpipers on the marshes that rose and vanished down the wind were the only signs of life even the white sail of the early morning was gone  she stood there until the aching of her straining eyes and the stiffening of her limbs in the cold wind compelled her to seek the sheltered warmth of the courtyard here she endeavored to make friends with a brighteyed lizard who was sunning himself in the corridor a graceful little creature in blue and gold from whom she felt at other times she might have fled but whose beauty and harmlessness solitude had made known to her with misplaced kindness she tempted it with breadcrumbs with no other effect than to stiffen it into stony astonishment she wondered if she should become like the prisoners she had read of in books who poured out their solitary affections on noisome creatures and she regretted even the mustang which with the buggy had disappeared under the charge of some unknown retainer on her arrival was she not a prisoner the shutterless windows yawning doors and open gate refuted her suggestion but the encompassing solitude and trackless waste still held her captive poindexter had told her it was four miles to the shanty she might walk there why had she given her word that she would remain at the rancho until he returned  the long day crept monotonously away and she welcomed the night which shut out the dreary prospect but it brought no cessation of the harassing wind without nor surcease of the nervous irritation its perpetual and even activity wrought upon her it haunted her pillow even in her exhausted sleep and seemed to impatiently beckon her to rise and follow it it brought her feverish dreams of her husband footsore and weary staggering forward under its pitiless lash and clamorous outcry she would have gone to his assistance but when she reached his side and held out her arms to him it hurried her past with merciless power and bearing her away left him hopelessly behind it was broad day when she awoke the usual night showers of the waning rainy season had left no trace in sky or meadow the fervid morning sun had already dried the patio only the restless harrying wind remained  mrs tucker arose with a resolve she had learned from concha on the previous evening that a part of the shanty was used as a tienda or shop for the laborers and rancheros under the necessity of purchasing some articles she would go there and for a moment mingle with those people who would not recognize her even if they did her instinct told her it would be less to be feared than the hopeless uncertainty of another day as she left the house the wind seemed to seize her as in her dream and hurry her along with it until in a few moments the walls of the low casa sank into the earth again and she was alone but for the breeze on the solitary plain the level distance glittered in the sharp light a few crows with slant wings dipped and ran down the wind before her and a passing gleam on the marsh was explained by the faroff cry of a curlew  she had walked for an hour upheld by the stimulus of light and morning air when the cluster of scrub oaks which was her destination opened enough to show two rambling sheds before one of which was a wooden platform containing a few barrels and bones as she approached nearer she could see that one or two horses were tethered under the trees that their riders were lounging by a horsetrough and that over an open door the word tienda was rudely painted on a board and as rudely illustrated by the wares displayed at door and window accustomed as she was to the poverty of frontier architecture even the crumbling walls of the old hacienda she had just left seemed picturesque to the rigid angles of the thin blank unpainted shell before her one of the loungers who was reading a newspaper aloud as she advanced put it aside and stared at her there was an evident commotion in the shop as she stepped upon the platform and when she entered with breathless lips and beating heart she found herself the object of a dozen curious eyes her quick pride resented the scrutiny and recalled her courage and it was with a slight coldness in her usual lazy indifference that she leaned over the counter and asked for the articles she wanted  the request was followed by a dead silence mrs tucker repeated it with some hauteur  i reckon you dont seem to know this store is in the hands of the sheriff said one of the loungers  mrs tucker was not aware of it  well i dont know any one whos a better right to know than spence tuckers wife said another with a coarse laugh the laugh was echoed by the others mrs tucker saw the pit into which she had deliberately walked but did not flinch  is there any one to serve here she asked turning her clear eyes full upon the bystanders  youd better ask the sheriff he was the last one to sarve here he sarved an attachment replied the inevitable humorist of all californian assemblages  is he here asked mrs tucker disregarding the renewed laughter which followed this subtle witticism  the loungers at the door made way for one of their party who was half dragged half pushed into the shop here he is said half a dozen eager voices in the fond belief that his presence might impart additional humor to the situation he cast a deprecating glance at mrs tucker and said its so madam this yer place is attached but if theres anything youre wanting why i reckon boyshe turned half appealingly to the crowdwe could oblige a lady there was a vague sound of angry opposition and remonstrance from the back door of the shop but the majority partly overcome by mrs tuckers beauty assented only continued the officer explanatorily ez these yer goods are in the hands of the creditors they ought to be represented by an equivalent in money if youre expecting they should be charged  but i wish to pay for them interrupted mrs tucker with a slight flush of indignation i have the money  oh i bet you have screamed a voice as overturning all opposition the malcontent at the back door in the shape of an infuriated woman forced her way into the shop ill bet you have the money look at her boys look at the wife of the thief with the stolen money in diamonds in her ears and rings on her fingers shes got money if weve none she can pay for what she fancies if we havent a cent to redeem the bed thats stolen from under us oh yes buy it all mrs spencer tucker buy the whole shop mrs spencer tucker do you hear and if you aint satisfied then buy my clothes my wedding ring the only things your husband hasnt stolen  i dont understand you said mrs tucker coldly turning towards the door but with a flying leap across the counter her relentless adversary stood between her and retreat  you dont understand perhaps you dont understand that your husband not only stole the hard labor of these men but even the little money they brought here and trusted to his thieving hands perhaps you dont know that he stole my husbands hard earnings mortgaged these very goods you want to buy and that he is today a convicted thief a forger and a runaway coward perhaps if you cant understand me you can read the newspaper look she exultingly opened the paper the sheriff had been reading aloud and pointed to the displayed headlines look there are the very words forgery swindling embezzlement do you see and perhaps you cant understand this look shameful flight abandons his wife runs off with a notorious  easy old gal easy now dn it will you dry up i say stop  it was too late  the sheriff had dashed the paper from the womans hand but not until mrs tucker had read a single line a line such as she had sometimes turned from with weary scorn in her careless perusal of the daily shameful chronicle of domestic infelicity then she had coldly wondered if there could be any such men and women and now the crowd fell back before her even the virago was silenced as she looked at her face the humorists face was as white but not as immobile as he gasped christ if i dont believe she knew nothin of it  for a moment the full force of such a supposition with all its poignancy its dramatic intensity and its pathos possessed the crowd in the momentary clairvoyance of enthusiasm they caught a glimpse of the truth and by one of the strange reactions of human passion they only waited for a word of appeal or explanation from her lips to throw themselves at her feet had she simply told her story they would have believed her had she cried fainted or gone into hysterics they would have pitied her she did neither perhaps she thought of neither or indeed of anything that was then before her eyes she walked erect to the door and turned upon the threshold i mean what i say she said calmly i dont understand you but whatever just claims you have upon my husband will be paid by me or by his lawyer captain poindexter  she had lost the sympathy but not the respect of her hearers they made way for her with sullen deference as she passed out on the platform but her adversary profiting by the last opportunity burst into an ironical laugh  captain poindexter is it well perhaps hes safe to pay your bill but as for your husbands  thats another matter interrupted a familiar voice with the greatest cheerfulness thats what you were going to say wasnt it ha ha well mrs patterson continued poindexter stepping from his buggy you never spoke a truer word in your life one moment mrs tucker let me send you back in the buggy dont mind me i can get a fresh horse of the sheriff im quite at home here i say patterson step a few paces this way will you a little further from your wife please thatll do youve got a claim of five thousand dollars against the property havent you  yes  well that woman just driving away is your one solitary chance of getting a cent of it if your wife insults her again that chance is gone and if you do  well  as sure as there is a god in israel and a supreme court of the state of california ill kill you in your tracks    stay  patterson turned the irrepressible look of humorous tolerance of all human frailty had suffused poindexters black eyes with mischievous moisture if you think it quite safe to confide to your wife this prospect of her improvement by widowhood you may     chapter iii   mr patterson did not inform his wife of the lawyers personal threat to himself but he managed after poindexter had left to make her conscious that mrs tucker might be a power to be placated and feared youve shot off your mouth at her he said argumentatively and whether youve hit the mark or not youve had your say ef you think its worth a possible five thousand dollars and interest to keep on heave ahead ef you rather have the chance of getting the rest in cash youll let up on her you dont suppose returned mrs patterson contemptuously that shes got anything but what that man of herspoindexterlets her have the sheriff says retorted patterson surlily that shes notified him that she claims the rancho as a gift from her husband three years ago and shes in possession now and was so when the execution was out it dont make no matter he added with gloomy philosophy whos got a full hand as long as we aint got the cards to chip in i wouldnt a minded it he continued meditatively ef spence tucker had dropped a hint to me afore he put out and i suppose said mrs patterson angrily youd have put out too i reckon said patterson simply  twice or thrice during the evening he referred more or less directly to this lack of confidence shown by his late debtor and employer and seemed to feel it more keenly than the loss of property he confided his sentiments quite openly to the sheriff in possession over the whiskey and euchre with which these gentlemen avoided the difficulties of their delicate relations he brooded over it as he handed the keys of the shop to the sheriff when they parted for the night and was still thinking of it when the house was closed everybody gone to bed and he was fetching a fresh jug of water from the well the moon was at times obscured by flying clouds the avantcouriers of the regular evening shower he was stooping over the well when he sprang suddenly to his feet again whos there he demanded sharply  hush said a voice so low and faint it might have been a whisper of the wind in the palisades of the corral but indistinct as it was it was the voice of the man he was thinking of as far away and it sent a thrill of alternate awe and pleasure through his pulses  he glanced quickly around the moon was hidden by a passing cloud and only the faint outlines of the house he had just quitted were visible is that you spence he said tremulously  yes replied the voice and a figure dimly emerged from the corner of the corral  lay low lay low for gods sake said patterson hurriedly throwing himself upon the apparition the sheriff and his posse are in there  but i must speak to you a moment said the figure  wait said patterson glancing towards the building its blank shutterless windows revealed no inner light a profound silence encompassed it come quick he whispered letting his grasp slip down to the unresisting hand of the stranger he halfdragged halfled him brushing against the wall into the open door of the deserted barroom he had just quitted locked the inner door poured a glass of whiskey from a decanter gave it to him and then watched him drain it at a single draught the moon came out and falling through the bare windows full upon the strangers face revealed the artistic but slightly disheveled curls and moustache of the fugitive spencer tucker  whatever may have been the real influence of this unfortunate man upon his fellows it seemed to find expression in a singular unanimity of criticism patterson looked at him with a halfdismal halfwelcoming smile well you are a hll of a fellow aint you  spencer tucker passed his hand through his hair and lifted it from his forehead with a gesture at once emotional and theatrical i am a man with a price on me he said bitterly give me up to the sheriff and youll get five thousand dollars help me and youll get nothing thats my dd luck and yours too i suppose  i reckon youre right there said patterson gloomily but i thought you got clean away went off in a ship  went off in a boat to a ship interrupted tucker savagely went off to a ship that had all my things on boardeverything the cursed boat capsized in a squall just off the heads the ship dn her sailed away the men thinking i was drowned likely and that theyd make a good thing off my goods i reckon  but the girl inez who was with you didnt she make a row  quien sabe returned tucker with a reckless laugh well i hung on like grim death to that boats keel until one of those chinese fishermen in a dugout hauled me in opposite saucelito i chartered him and his dugout to bring me down here  why here asked patterson with a certain ostentatious caution that illconcealed his pensive satisfaction  you may well ask returned tucker with an equal ostentation of bitterness as he slightly waved his companion away but i reckoned i could trust a white man that id been kind to and who wouldnt go back on me no no let me go hand me over to the sheriff  patterson had suddenly grasped both the hands of the picturesque scamp before him with an affection that for an instant almost shamed the man who had ruined him but tuckers egotism whispered that this affection was only a recognition of his own superiority and felt flattered he was beginning to believe that he was really the injured party  what i have and what i have had is yours spence returned patterson with a sad and simple directness that made any further discussion a gratuitous insult i only wanted to know what you reckoned to do here  i want to get over across the coast range to monterey said tucker once there one of those coasting schooners will bring me down to acapulco where the ship will put in  patterson remained silent for a moment theres a mustang in the corral you can takeleastways i shant know that its goneuntil tomorrow afternoon in an hour from now he added looking from the window these clouds will settle down to business it will rain there will be light enough for you to find your way by the regular trail over the mountain but not enough for any one to know you if you cant push through tonight you can lie over at the posada on the summit them greasers that keep it wont know you and if they did they wont go back on you and if they did go back on you nobody would believe them its mighty curious he added with gloomy philosophy but i reckon its the reason why providence allows this kind of cattle to live among white men and others made in his image take a piece of pie wont you he continued abandoning this abstract reflection and producing half a flat pumpkin pie from the bar spencer tucker grasped the pie with one hand and his friends fingers with the other and for a few moments was silent from the hurried deglutition of viand and sentiment youre a white man patterson anyway he resumed ill take your horse and put it down in our account at your own figure as soon as this cursed thing is blown over ill be back here and see you through you bet i dont desert my friends however rough things go with me  i see you dont returned patterson with an unconscious and serious simplicity that had the effect of the most exquisite irony i was only just saying to the sheriff that if there was anything i could have done for you you wouldnt have cut away without letting me know tucker glanced uneasily at patterson who continued ye aint wanting anything else then observing that his former friend and patron was roughly but newly clothed and betrayed no trace of his last escapade he added i see youve got a fresh harness  that dd chinaman bought me these at the landing theyre not much in style or fit he continued trying to get a moonlight view of himself in the mirror behind the bar but that dont matter here he filled another glass of spirits jauntily settled himself back in his chair and added i dont suppose there are any girls around anyway  cept your wife she was down here this afternoon said patterson meditatively  mr tucker paused with the pie in his hand ah yes he essayed a reckless laugh but that evident simulation failed before pattersons melancholy with an assumption of falling in with his friends manner rather than from any personal anxiety he continued well  that man poindexter was down here with her put her in the hacienda to hold possession afore the news came out  impossible said tucker rising hastily it dont belongthat is he hesitated  yer thinking the creditors ll get it mebbe returned patterson gazing at the floor not as long as shes in it no sir whether its really hers or shes only keeping house for poindexter shes a fixture you bet theyre a team when they pull together they are  the smile slowly faded from tuckers face that now looked quite rigid in the moonlight he put down his glass and walked to the window as patterson gloomily continued but thats nothing to you youve got ahead of em both and had your revenge by going off with the gal thats what i said all along when folksespecially women folkswondered how you could leave a woman like your wife and go off with a scallawag like that gal i allers said theyd find out there was a reason and when your wife came flaunting down here with poindexter before shed quite got quit of you i reckon they began to see the whole little game no sir i knew it wasnt on account of the gal why when you came here tonight and told me quite natrallike and easy how she went off in the ship and then calmly ate your pie and drank your whiskey after it i knew you didnt care for her theres my hand spence youre a trump even if you are a little looney eh why whats up  shallow and selfish as tucker was pattersons words seemed like a revelation that shocked him as profoundly as it might have shocked a nobler nature the simple vanity and selfishness that made him unable to conceive any higher reason for his wifes loyalty than his own personal popularity and success now that he no longer possessed that eclat made him equally capable of the lowest suspicions he was a dishonored fugitive broken in fortune and reputationwhy should she not desert him he had been unfaithful to her from wildness from caprice from the effect of those fascinating qualities it seemed to him natural that she should be disloyal from more deliberate motives and he hugged himself with that belief yet there was enough doubt enough of haunting suspicion that he had lost or alienated a powerful affection to make him thoroughly miserable he returned his friends grasp convulsively and buried his face upon his shoulder but he was not above feeling a certain exultation in the effect of his misery upon the doglike unreasoning affection of patterson nor could he entirely refrain from slightly posing his affliction before that sympathetic but melancholy man suddenly he raised his head drew back and thrust his hand into his bosom with a theatrical gesture  whats to keep me from killing poindexter in his tracks he said wildly  nothin but his shooting first returned patterson with dismal practicality hes mighty quick like all them army men its about even i reckon that he dont get me first he added in an ominous voice  no returned tucker grasping his hand again this is not your affair patterson leave him to me when i come back  if he ever gets the drop on me i reckon he wont wait continued patterson lugubriously he seems to object to my passin criticism on your wife as if she was a queen or an angel  the blood came to spencers cheek and he turned uneasily to the window its dark enough now for a start he said hurriedly and if i could get across the mountain without lying over at the summit it would be a day gained  patterson arose without a word filled a flask of spirit handed it to his friend and silently led the way through the slowly falling rain and the now settled darkness the mustang was quickly secured and saddled a heavy poncho afforded tucker a disguise as well as a protection from the rain with a few hurried disconnected words and an abstracted air he once more shook his friends hand and issued cautiously from the corral when out of earshot from the house he put spurs to the mustang and dashed into a gallop  to intersect the mountain road he was obliged to traverse part of the highway his wife had walked that afternoon and to pass within a mile of the casa where she was long before he reached that point his eyes were straining the darkness in that direction for some indication of the house which was to him familiar becoming now accustomed to the even obscurity less trying to the vision than the alternate light and shadow of cloud or the full glare of the moonlight he fancied he could distinguish its low walls over the monotonous level one of those impulses which had so often taken the place of resolution in his character suddenly possessed him to diverge from his course and approach the house why he could not have explained it was not from any feeling of jealous suspicion or contemplated revengethat had passed with the presence of patterson it was not from any vague lingering sentiment for the woman he had wrongedhe would have shrunk from meeting her at that moment but it was full of these and more possibilities by which he might or might not be guided and was at least a movement towards some vague end and a distraction from certain thoughts he dared not entertain and could not entirely dismiss inconceivable and inexplicable to human reason it might have been acceptable to the divine omniscience for its predestined result  he left the road at a point where the marsh encroached upon the meadow familiar to him already as near the spot where he had embarked from the chinamans boat the day before he remembered that the walls of the hacienda were distinctly visible from the tules where he had hidden all day and he now knew that the figures he had observed near the building which had deterred his first attempts at landing must have been his wife and his friend he knew that a long tongue of the slough filled by the rising tide followed the marsh and lay between him and the hacienda the sinking of his horses hoofs in the spongy soil determined its proximity and he made a detour to the right to avoid it in doing so a light suddenly rose above the distant horizon ahead of him trembled faintly and then burned with a steady lustre it was a light at the hacienda guiding his horse half abstractedly in this direction his progress was presently checked by the splashing of the animals hoofs in the water but the turf below was firm and a salt drop that had spattered to his lips told him that it was only the encroaching of the tide in the meadow with his eyes on the light he again urged his horse forward the rain lulled the clouds began to break the landscape alternately lightened and grew dark the outlines of the crumbling hacienda walls that enshrined the light grew more visible a strange and dreamy resemblance to the long bluegrass plain before his wifes paternal house as seen by him during his evening rides to courtship pressed itself upon him he remembered too that she used to put a light in the window to indicate her presence following this retrospect the moon came boldly out sparkled upon the overflow of silver at his feet seemed to show the dark opaque meadow beyond for a moment and then disappeared it was dark now but the lesser earthly star still shone before him as a guide and pushing towards it he passed in the allembracing shadow     chapter iv   as mrs tucker erect white and rigid drove away from the tienda it seemed to her to sink again into the monotonous plain with all its horrible realities except that there was now a new and heartbreaking significance to the solitude and loneliness of the landscape all that had passed might have been a dream but as the blood came back to her cheek and little by little her tingling consciousness returned it seemed as if her life had been the dream and this last scene the awakening reality with eyes smarting with the moisture of shame the scarlet blood at times dyeing her very neck and temples she muffled her lowered crest in her shawl and bent over the reins bit by bit she recalled in poindexters mysterious caution and strange allusions the corroboration of her husbands shame and her own disgrace this was why she was brought hitherthe deserted wife and abandoned confederate the mocking glitter of the concave vault above her scoured by the incessant wind the cold stare of the shining pools beyond the hard outlines of the coast range and the jarring accompaniment of her horses hoofs and rattling buggy wheels alternately goaded and distracted her she found herself repeating no no no with the dogged reiteration of fever she scarcely knew when or how she reached the hacienda she was only conscious that as she entered the patio the dusty solitude that had before filled her with unrest now came to her like balm a benumbing peace seemed to fall from the crumbling walls the peace of utter seclusion isolation oblivion death nevertheless an hour later when the jingle of spurs and bridle were again heard in the road she started to her feet with bent brows and a kindling eye and confronted captain poindexter in the corridor  i would not have intruded upon you so soon again he said gravely but i thought i might perhaps spare you a repetition of the scene of this morning hear me out please he added with a gentle halfdeprecating gesture as she lifted the beautiful scorn of her eyes to his i have just heard that your neighbor don jose santierra of los gatos is on his way to this house he once claimed this land and hated your husband who bought of the rival claimant whose grant was confirmed i tell you this he added slightly flushing as mrs tucker turned impatiently away only to show you that legally he has no rights and you need not see him unless you choose i could not stop his coming without perhaps doing you more harm than good but when he does come my presence under this roof as your legal counsel will enable you to refer him to me he stopped she was pacing the corridor with short impatient steps her arms dropped and her hands clasped rigidly before her have i your permission to stay  she suddenly stopped in her walk approached him rapidly and fixing her eyes on his said  do i know all noweverything  he could only reply that she had not yet told him what she had heard  well she said scornfully that my husband has been cruelly imposed uponimposed upon by some wretched woman who has made him sacrifice his property his friends his honoreverything but me  everything but whom gasped poindexter  but me  poindexter gazed at the sky the air the deserted corridor the stones of the patio itself and then at the inexplicable woman before him then he said gravely i think you know everything  then if my husband has left me all he couldthis property she went on rapidly twisting her handkerchief between her fingers i can do with it what i like cant i  you certainly can  then sell it she said with passionate vehemence sell itall everything and sell these she darted into her bedroom and returned with the diamond rings she had torn from her fingers and ears when she entered the house sell them for anything theyll bring only sell them at once  but for what asked poindexter with demure lips but twinkling eyes  to pay the debts that thisthiswoman has led him into to return the money she has stolen she went on rapidly to keep him from sharing her infamy cant you understand  but my dear madam began poindexter even if this could be done  dont tell me if it couldit must be done do you think i could sleep under this roof propped up by the timbers of that ruined tienda do you think i could wear those diamonds again while that termagant shopwoman can say that her money bought them no if you are my husbands friend you will do thisforfor his sake she stopped locked and interlocked her cold fingers before her and said hesitating and mechanically you meant well captain poindexter in bringing me here i know you must not think that i blame you for it or for the miserable result of it that you have just witnessed but if i have gained anything by it for gods sake let me reap it quickly that i may give it to these people and go i have a friend who can aid me to get to my husband or to my home in kentucky where spencer will yet find me i know i want nothing more she stopped again with another woman the pause would have been one of tears but she kept her head above the flood that filled her heart and the clear eyes fixed upon poindexter albeit pained were undimmed  but this would require time said poindexter with a smile of compassionate explanation you could not sell now nobody would buy you are safe to hold this property while you are in actual possession but you are not strong enough to guarantee it to another there may still be litigation your husband has other creditors than these people you have talked with but while nobody could oust youthe wife who would have the sympathies of judge and juryit might be a different case with any one who derived title from you any purchaser would know that you could not sell or if you did it would be at a ridiculous sacrifice  she listened to him abstractedly walked to the end of the corridor returned and without looking up said  i suppose you know her  i beg your pardon  this woman you have seen her  never to my knowledge  and you are his friend thats strange she raised her eyes to his well she continued impatiently who is she and what is she you know that surely  i know no more of her than what i have said said poindexter she is a notorious woman  the swift color came to mrs tuckers face as if the epithet had been applied to herself i suppose she said in a dry voice as if she were asking a business question but with an eye that showed her rising angeri suppose there is some law by which creatures of this kind can be followed and brought to justicesome law that would keep innocent people from suffering for their crimes  i am afraid said poindexter that arresting her would hardly help these people over in the tienda  i am not speaking of them responded mrs tucker with a sudden sublime contempt for the people whose cause she had espoused i am talking of my husband  poindexter bit his lip youd hardly think of bringing back the strongest witness against him he said bluntly  mrs tucker dropped her eyes and was silent a sudden shame suffused poindexters cheek he felt as if he had struck that woman a blow i beg your pardon he said hastily i am talking like a lawyer to a lawyer he would have taken any other woman by the hand in the honest fullness of his apology but something restrained him here he only looked down gently on her lowered lashes and repeated his question if he should remain during the coming interview with don jose i must beg you to determine quickly he added for i already hear him entering the gate  stay said mrs tucker as the ringing of spurs and clatter of hoofs came from the corral one moment she looked up suddenly and said how long had he known her but before he could reply there was a step in the doorway and the figure of don jose santierra emerged from the archway  he was a man slightly past middle age fair and well shaven wearing a black broadcloth serape the deeply embroidered opening of which formed a collar of silver rays around his neck while a row of silver buttons down the side seams of his riding trousers and silver spurs completed his singular equipment mrs tuckers swift feminine glance took in these details as well as the deep salutation more formal than the exuberant frontier politeness she was accustomed to with which he greeted her it was enough to arrest her first impulse to retreat she hesitated and stopped as poindexter stepped forward partly interposing between them acknowledging don joses distant recognition of himself with an ironical accession of his usual humorous tolerance the spaniard did not seem to notice it but remained gravely silent before mrs tucker gazing at her with an expression of intent and unconscious absorption  you are quite right don jose said poindexter with ironical concern it is mrs tucker your eyes do not deceive you she will be glad to do the honors of her house he continued with a simulation of appealing to her unless you visit her on business when i need not say i shall be only too happy to attend you as before  don jose with a slight lifting of the eyebrows allowed himself to become conscious of the lawyers meaning it is not of business that i come to kiss the senoras hand today he replied with a melancholy softness it is as her neighbor to put myself at her disposition ah the what have we here for a lady he continued raising his eyes in deprecation of the surroundings a house of nothing a place of winds and dry bones without refreshments or satisfaction or delicacy the senora will not refuse to make us proud this day to send her of that which we have in our poor home at los gatos to make her more complete of what shall it be let her make choice or if she would commemorate this day by accepting of our hospitality at los gatos until she shall arrange herself the more to receive us here we shall have too much honor  the senora would only find it the more difficult to return to this humble roof again after once leaving it for don joses hospitality said poindexter with a demure glance at mrs tucker but the innuendo seemed to lapse equally unheeded by his fair client and the stranger raising her eyes with a certain timid dignity which don joses presence seemed to have called out she addressed herself to him  you are very kind and considerate mister santierra and i thank you i know that my husbandshe let the clear beauty of her translucent eyes rest full on both menwould thank you too but i shall not be here long enough to accept your kindness in this house or in your own i have but one desire and object now it is to dispose of this property and indeed all i possess to pay the debt of my husband it is in your power perhaps to help me i am told that you wish to possess los cuervos she went on equally oblivious of the consciousness that appeared in don joses face and a humorous perplexity on the brow of poindexter if you can arrange it with mr poindexter you will find me a liberal vendor that much you can do and i know you will believe i shall be grateful you can do no more unless it be to say to your friends that mrs belle tucker remains here only for that purpose and to carry out what she knows to be the wishes of her husband she paused bent her pretty crest dropped a quaint curtsey to the superior age the silver braid and the gentlemanly bearing of don jose and with the passing sunshine of a smile disappeared from the corridor  the two men remained silent for a moment don jose gazing abstractedly on the door through which she had vanished until poindexter with a return of his tolerant smile said you have heard the views of mrs tucker you know the situation as well as she does  ah yes possibly better  poindexter darted a quick glance at the grave sallow face of don jose but detecting no unusual significance in his manner continued as you see she leaves this matter in my hands let us talk like business men have you any idea of purchasing this property  of purchasing ah no  poindexter bent his brows but quickly relaxed them with a smile of humorous forgiveness if you have any other idea don jose i ought to warn you as mrs tuckers lawyer that she is in legal possession here and that nothing but her own act can change that position  ah so  irritated at the shrug which accompanied this poindexter continued haughtily if i am to understand you have nothing to say  to say ah yes possibly buthe glanced toward the door of mrs tuckers roomnot here he stopped appeared to recall himself and with an apologetic smile and a studied but graceful gesture of invitation he motioned to the gateway and said will you ride  what can the fellow be up to muttered poindexter as with an assenting nod he proceeded to remount his horse if he wasnt an old hidalgo id mistrust him no matter here goes  the don also remounted his halfbroken mustang they proceeded in solemn silence through the corral and side by side emerged on the open plain poindexter glanced around no other being was in sight it was not until the lonely hacienda had also sunk behind them that don jose broke the silence  you say just now we shall speak as business men i say no don marco i will not i shall speak we shall speak as gentlemen  go on said poindexter who was beginning to be amused  i say just now i will not purchase the rancho from the senora and why look you don marco he reined in his horse thrust his hand under his serape and drew out a folded document this is why  with a smile poindexter took the paper from his hand and opened it but the smile faded from his lips as he read with blazing eyes he spurred his horse beside the spaniard almost unseating him and said sternly what does this mean  what does it mean repeated don jose with equally flashing eyes ill tell you it means that your client this man spencer tucker is a judas a traitor it means that he gave los cuervos to his mistress a year ago and that she sold it to meto me you hearme jose santierra the day before she left it means that the coyote of a spencer the thief who bought these lands of a thief and gave them to a thief has tricked you all look he said rising in his saddle holding the paper like a baton and defining with a sweep of his arm the whole level plain all these lands were once mine they are mine again today do i want to purchase los cuervos you ask for you will speak of the business well listen i have purchased los cuervos and here is the deed  but it has never been recorded said poindexter with a carelessness he was far from feeling  of a verity no do you wish that i should record it asked don jose with a return of his simple gravity  poindexter bit his lip you said we were to talk like gentlemen he returned do you think you have come into possession of this alleged deed like a gentleman  don jose shrugged his shoulders i found it tossed in the lap of a harlot i bought it for a song eh what would you  would you sell it again for a song asked poindexter  ah what is this said don jose lifting his irongray brows but a moment ago we would sell everything for any money now we would buy is it so  one moment don jose said poindexter with a baleful light in his dark eyes do i understand that you are the ally of spencer tucker and his mistress that you intend to turn this doubly betrayed wife from the only roof she has to cover her  ah i comprehend not you heard her say she wished to go perhaps it may please me to distribute largess to these cattle yonder i do not say no more she does not ask but you don marco of whom are you advocate you abandon your clients mistress for the wife is it so  what i may do you will learn hereafter said poindexter who had regained his composure suddenly reining up his horse as our paths seem likely to diverge they had better begin now good morning  patience my friend patience ah blessed st anthony what these americans are listen for what you shall do i do not inquire the question is to me what ihe emphasized the pronoun by tapping himself on the breasti jose santierra will do well i shall tell you today nothing tomorrow nothing for a week for a month nothing after we shall see  poindexter paused thoughtfully will you give your word don jose that you will not press the claim for a month  truly on one condition observe i do not ask you for an equal promise that you will not take this time to defend yourself he shrugged his shoulders no it is only this you shall promise that during that time the senora tucker shall remain ignorant of this document  poindexter hesitated a moment i promise he said at last  good adios don marco  adios don jose  the spaniard put spurs to his mustang and galloped off in the direction of los gatos the lawyer remained for a moment gazing on his retreating but victorious figure for the first time the old look of humorous toleration with which mr poindexter was in the habit of regarding all human infirmity gave way to something like bitterness i might have guessed it he said with a slight rise of color hes an old fool and shewell perhaps its all the better for her he glanced backwards almost tenderly in the direction of los cuervos and then turned his head towards the embarcadero  as the afternoon wore on a creaking antiquated oxcart arrived at los cuervos bearing several articles of furniture and some tasteful ornaments from los gatos at the same time that a young mexican girl mysteriously appeared in the kitchen as a temporary assistant to the decrepit concha these were both clearly attributable to don jose whose visit was not so remote but that these delicate attentions might have been already projected before mrs tucker had declined them and she could not without marked discourtesy return them now she did not wish to seem discourteous she would like to have been more civil to this old gentleman who still retained the evidences of a picturesque and decorous past and a repose so different from the life that was perplexing her reflecting that if he bought the estate these things would be ready to his hand and with a womans instinct recognizing their value in setting off the house to other purchasers eyes she took a pleasure in tastefully arranging them and even found herself speculating how she might have enjoyed them herself had she been able to keep possession of the property after all it would not have been so lonely if refined and gentle neighbors like this old man would have sympathized with her she had an instinctive feeling that in their own hopeless decay and hereditary unfitness for this new civilization they would have been more tolerant of her husbands failure than his own kind she could not believe that don jose really hated her husband for buying of the successful claimant as there was no other legal title allowing herself to become interested in the guileless gossip of the new handmaiden proud of her broken english she was drawn into a sympathy with the grave simplicity of don joses character a relic of that true nobility which placed this descendant of the castilians and the daughter of a free people on the same level  in this way the second day of her occupancy of los cuervos closed with dumb clouds along the gray horizon and the paroxysms of hysterical wind growing fainter and fainter outside the walls with the moon rising after nightfall and losing itself in silent and mysterious confidences with drifting scud she went to bed early but woke past midnight hearing as she thought her own name called the impression was so strong upon her that she rose and hastily enwrapping herself went to the dark embrasures of the ovenshaped windows and looked out the dwarfed oak beside the window was still dropping from a past shower but the level waste of marsh and meadow beyond seemed to advance and recede with the coming and going of the moon again she heard her name called and this time in accents so strangely familiar that with a slight cry she ran into the corridor crossed the patio and reached the open gate the darkness that had even in this brief interval again fallen upon the prospect she tried in vain to pierce with eye and voice a blank silence followed then the veil was suddenly withdrawn the vast plain stretching from the mountain to the sea shone as clearly as in the light of day the moving current of the channel glittered like black pearls the stagnant pools like molten lead but not a sign of life nor motion broke the monotony of the broad expanse she must have surely dreamed it a chill wind drove her back to the house again she entered her bedroom and in half an hour she was in a peaceful sleep     chapter v   the two men kept their secret mr poindexter convinced mrs tucker that the sale of los cuervos could not be effected until the notoriety of her husbands flight had been fairly forgotten and she was forced to accept her fate the sale of her diamonds which seemed to her to have realized a singularly extravagant sum enabled her to quietly reinstate the pattersons in the tienda and to discharge in full her husbands liabilities to the rancheros and his humbler retainers  meanwhile the winter rains had ceased it seemed to her as if the clouds had suddenly one night struck their white tents and stolen away leaving the unvanquished sun to mount the vacant sky the next morning alone and possess it thenceforward unchallenged one afternoon she thought the long sad waste before her window had caught some tint of gayer color from the sunset a week later she found it a blazing landscape of poppies broken here and there by blue lagoons of lupine by pools of daisies by banks of dogroses by broad outlying shores of dandelions that scattered their lavish gold to the foot of the hills where the green billows of wild oats carried it on and upwards to the darker crest of pines for two months she was dazzled and bewildered with color she had never before been face to face with this spendthrift californian flora in her virgin wastefulness her more than goddesslike prodigality the teeming earth seemed to quicken and throb beneath her feet the few circuits of a plough around the outlying corral were enough to call out a jungle growth of giant grain that almost hid the low walls of the hacienda in this glorious fecundity of the earth in this joyous renewal of life and color in this opulent youth and freshness of soil and sky it alone remained the dead and sterile past left in the midst of buoyant rejuvenescence and resurrection like an empty churchyard skull upturned on the springing turf its bronzed adobe walls mocked the green vine that embraced them the crumbling dust of its courtyard remained ungerminating and unfruitful to the thousand stirring voices without its dry lips alone remained mute unresponsive and unchanged  during this time don jose had become a frequent visitor at los cuervos bringing with him at first his niece and sister in a stately precision of politeness that was not lost on the proud blue grass stranger she returned their visit at los gatos and there made the formal acquaintance of don joses grandmother a lady who still regarded the decrepit concha as a giddy muchacha and who herself glittered as with the phosphorescence of refined decay through this circumstance she learned that don jose was not yet fifty and that his gravity of manner and sedateness was more the result of fastidious isolation and temperament than years she could not tell why the information gave her a feeling of annoyance but it caused her to regret the absence of poindexter and to wonder also somewhat nervously why he had lately avoided her presence the thought that he might be doing so from a recollection of the innuendoes of mrs patterson caused a little tremor of indignation in her pulses as if but she did not finish the sentence even to herself and her eyes filled with bitter tears  yet she had thought of the husband who had so cruelly wronged her less feverishly less impatiently than before for she thought she loved him now the more deeply because although she was not reconciled to his absence it seemed to keep alive the memory of what he had been before his one wild act separated them she had never seen the reflection of another womans eyes in his the past contained no haunting recollection of waning or alienated affection she could meet him again and clasping her arms around him awaken as if from a troubled dream without reproach or explanation her strong belief in this made her patient she no longer sought to know the particulars of his flight and never dreamed that her passive submission to his absence was partly due to a fear that something in his actual presence at that moment would have destroyed that belief forever  for this reason the delicate reticence of the people at los gatos and their seclusion from the world which knew of her husbands fault had made her encourage the visits of don jose until from the instinct already alluded to she one day summoned poindexter to los cuervos on the day that don jose usually called but to her surprise the two men met more or less awkwardly and coldly and her tact as hostess was tried to the utmost to keep their evident antagonism from being too apparent the effort to reconcile their mutual discontent and some other feeling she did not quite understand produced a nervous excitement which called the blood to her cheek and gave a dangerous brilliancy to her eyes two circumstances not unnoticed nor unappreciated by her two guests but instead of reuniting them the prettier mrs tucker became the more distant and reserved grew the men until don jose rose before the usual hour and with more than usual ceremoniousness departed  then my business does not seem to be with him said poindexter with quiet coolness as mrs tucker turned her somewhat mystified face towards him or have you anything to say to me about him in private  i am sure i dont know what you both mean she returned with a slight tremor of voice i had no idea you were not on good terms i thought you were its very awkward without coquetry and unconsciously she raised her blue eyes under her lids until the clear pupils coyly and softly hid themselves in the corners of the brown lashes and added you have both been so kind to me  perhaps that is the reason said poindexter gravely but mrs tucker refused to accept the suggestion with equal gravity and began to laugh the laugh which was at first frank spontaneous and almost childlike was becoming hysterical and nervous as she went on until it was suddenly checked by poindexter  i have had no difficulties with don jose santierra he said somewhat coldly ignoring her hilarity but perhaps he is not inclined to be as polite to the friend of the husband as he is to the wife  mr poindexter said mrs tucker quickly her face becoming pale again  i beg your pardon said poindexter flushing but  you want to say she interrupted coolly that you are not friends i see is that the reason why you have avoided this house she continued gently  i thought i could be of more service to you elsewhere he replied evasively i have been lately following up a certain clue rather closely i think i am on the track of a confidante ofofthat woman  a quick shadow passed over mrs tuckers face indeed she said coldly then i am to believe that you prefer to spend your leisure moments in looking after that creature to calling here  poindexter was stupefied was this the woman who only four months ago was almost vindictively eager to pursue her husbands paramour there could be but one answer to itdon jose four months ago he would have smiled compassionately at it from his cynical preeminence now he managed with difficulty to stifle the bitterness of his reply  if you do not wish the inquiry carried on he began of course  i what does it matter to me she said coolly do as you please  nevertheless half an hour later as he was leaving she said with a certain hesitating timidity do not leave me so much alone here and let that woman go  this was not the only unlookedfor sequel to her innocent desire to propitiate her best friends don jose did not call again upon his usual day but in his place came dona clara his younger sister when mrs tucker had politely asked after the absent don jose dona clara wound her swarthy arms around the fair americans waist and replied but why did you send for the abogado poindexter when my brother called  but captain poindexter calls as one of my friends said the amazed mrs tucker he is a gentleman and has been a soldier and an officer she added with some warmth  ah yes a soldier of the law what you call an oficial de policia a chief of gendarmes my sister but not a gentlemana camarero to protect a lady  mrs tucker would have uttered a hasty reply but the perfect and goodnatured simplicity of dona clara withheld her nevertheless she treated don jose with a certain reserve at their next meeting until it brought the simpleminded castilian so dangerously near the point of demanding an explanation which implied too much that she was obliged to restore him temporarily to his old footing meantime she had a brilliant idea she would write to calhoun weaver whom she had avoided since that memorable day she would say she wished to consult him he would come to los cuervos he might suggest something to lighten this weary waiting at least she would show them all that she had still old friends yet she did not dream of returning to her blue grass home her parents had died since she left she shrank from the thought of dragging her ruined life before the hopeful youth of her girlhoods companions  mr calhoun weaver arrived promptly ostentatiously oracularly and cordially but a little coarsely he haddid she rememberexpected this from the first spencer had lost his head through vanity and had attempted too much it required foresight and firmness as he himselfwho had lately made successful combinations which she might perhaps have heard ofwell knew but spencer had got the big head as to that womana devilish handsome woman toowell everybody knew that spencer always had a weakness that way and he would saybut if she didnt care to hear any more about herwell perhaps she was right that was the best way to take it sitting before her prosperous weak egotistical incompetent unavailable and yet filled with a vague kindliness of intent mrs tucker loathed him a sickening perception of her own weakness in sending for him a new and aching sense of her utter isolation and helplessness seemed to paralyze her  natrally you feel bad he continued with the large air of a profound student of human nature natrally natrally youre kept in an uncomfortable state not knowing jist how you stand there aint but one thing to do jist rise up quiet like and get a divorce agin spencer hold on there aint a judge or jury in california that wouldnt give it to you right off the nail without asking questions why you ld get it by default if you wanted to you ld just have to walk over the course and then belle he drew his chair still nearer her when youve settled down againwelli dont mind renewing that offer i once made ye before spencer ever came round yei dont mind belle i swear i dont honest injin im in earnest theres my hand  mrs tuckers reply has not been recorded enough that half an hour later mr weaver appeared in the courtyard with traces of tears on his foolish face a broken falsetto voice and other evidence of mental and moral disturbance his cordiality and oracular predisposition remained sufficiently to enable him to suggest the magical words blue grass mysteriously to concha with an indication of his hand to the erect figure of her pale mistress in the doorway who waved to him a silent but halfcompassionate farewell  at about this time a slight change in her manner was noticed by the few who saw her more frequently her apparently invincible girlishness of spirit had given way to a certain matronly seriousness she applied herself to her household cares and the improvement of the hacienda with a new sense of duty and a settled earnestness until by degrees she wrought into it not only her instinctive delicacy and taste but part of her own individuality even the rude rancheros and tradesmen who were permitted to enter the walls in the exercise of their calling began to speak mysteriously of the beauty of this garden of the almarjal she went out but seldom and then accompanied by the one or the other of her female servants in long drives on unfrequented roads on sundays she sometimes drove to the halfruined mission church of santa inez and hid herself during mass in the dim monastic shadows of the choir gradually the poorer people whom she met in these journeys began to show an almost devotional reverence for her stopping in the roads with uncovered heads for her to pass or making way for her in the tienda or plaza of the wretched town with dumb courtesy she began to feel a strange sense of widowhood that while it at times brought tears to her eyes was not without a certain tender solace in the sympathy and simpleness of this impulse she went as far as to revive the mourning she had worn for her parents but with such a fatal accenting of her beauty and dangerous misinterpreting of her condition to eligible bachelors strange to the country that she was obliged to put it off again her reserve and dignified manner caused others to mistake her nationality for that of the santierras and in dona bella the simple mrs tucker was for a while forgotten at times she even forgot it herself accustomed now almost entirely to the accents of another language and the features of another race she would sit for hours in the corridor whose massive bronzed inclosure even her tasteful care could only make an embowered mausoleum of the past or gaze abstractedly from the dark embrasures of her windows across the stretching almarjal to the shining lagoon beyond that terminated the estuary she had a strange fondness for this tranquil mirror which under sun or stars always retained the passive reflex of the sky above and seemed to rest her weary eyes she had objected to one of the plans projected by poindexter to redeem the land and deepen the water at the embarcadero as it would have drained the lagoon and the lawyer had postponed the improvement to gratify her fancy so she kept it through the long summer unchanged save by the shadows of passing wings or the lazy files of sleeping seafowl  on one of these afternoons she noticed a slowly moving carriage leave the high road and cross the almarjal skirting the edge of the lagoon if it contained visitors for los cuervos they had evidently taken a shorter cut without waiting to go on to the regular road which intersected the highway at right angles a mile farther on it was with some sense of annoyance and irritation that she watched the trespass and finally saw the vehicle approach the house a few moments later the servant informed her that mr patterson would like to see her alone when she entered the corridor which in the dry season served as a reception hall she was surprised to see that patterson was not alone near him stood a welldressed handsome woman gazing about her with goodhumored admiration of mrs tuckers taste and ingenuity  it dont look much like it did two years ago said the stranger cheerfully youve improved it wonderfully  stiffening slightly mrs tucker turned inquiringly to mr patterson but that gentlemans usual profound melancholy appeared to be intensified by the hilarity of his companion he only sighed deeply and rubbed his leg with the brim of his hat in gloomy abstraction  well go on then said the woman laughing and nudging him go onintroduce mecant you dont stand there like a tombstone you wont well ill introduce myself she laughed again and then with an excellent imitation of pattersons lugubrious accents said mr spencer tuckers wife that is allow me to introduce you to mr spencer tuckers sweetheart that was hold on i said that was for true as i stand here maamand i reckon i wouldnt stand here if it wasnt truei havent set eyes on him since the day he left you  its the gospel truth every word said patterson stirred into a sudden activity by mrs tuckers white and rigid face its the frozen truth and i kin prove it for i kin swear that when that there young woman was sailin outer the golden gate spencer tucker was in my bar room i kin swear that i fed him lickered him give him a hoss and set him in his road to monterey that very night  then where is he now said mrs tucker suddenly facing them  they looked at each other and then looked at mrs tucker then both together replied slowly and in perfect unison thatswhatwewanttoknow they seemed so satisfied with this effect that they as deliberately repeated yesthatswhatwewanttoknow  between the shock of meeting the partner of her husbands guilt and the unexpected revelation to her inexperience that in suggestion and appearance there was nothing beyond the recollection of that guilt that was really shocking in the womanbetween the extravagant extremes of hope and fear suggested by their words there was something so grotesquely absurd in the melodramatic chorus that she with difficulty suppressed a hysterical laugh  thats the way to take it said the woman putting her own goodhumored interpretation upon mrs tuckers expression now look here ill tell you all about it she carefully selected the most comfortable chair and sitting down lightly crossed her hands in her lap well i left here on the 13th of last january on the ship argo calculating that your husband would join the ship just inside the heads that was our arrangement but if anything happened to prevent him he was to join me in acapulco well he didnt come aboard and we sailed without him but it appears now he did attempt to join the ship but his boat was capsized there now dont be alarmed he wasnt drowned as patterson can swear tono catch him not a hair of him was hurt but ii was bundled off to the end of the earth in mexico alone without a cent to bless me for true as you live that hound of a captain when he found as he thought that spencer was nabbed he just confiscated all his trunks and valuables and left me in the lurch if i hadnt met a man down there that offered to marry me and brought me here i might have died there i reckon but i did and here i am i went down there as your husbands sweetheart ive come back as the wife of an honest man and i reckon its about square  there was something so startlingly frank so hopelessly selfsatisfied so contagiously goodhumored in the womans perfect moral unconsciousness that even if mrs tucker had been less preoccupied her resentment would have abated but her eyes were fixed on the gloomy face of patterson who was beginning to unlock the sepulchres of his memory and disinter his deeply buried thoughts  you kin bet your whole pile on what this mrs capting baxterez used to be french inez of new orleanshez told ye ye kin take everything shes unloaded and its only doin the square thing to her to say she haint done it out o no cussedness but just to satisfy herself now shes a married woman and past such foolishness but that aint neither here nor there the gist of the whole matter is that spencer tucker was at the tienda the day after she sailed and after his boat capsized he then gave a detailed account of the interview with the unnecessary but truthful minutiae of his class adding to the particulars already known that the following week he visited the summit house and was surprised to find that spencer had never been there nor had he ever sailed from monterey  but why was this not told to me before said mrs tucker suddenly why not at the time why she demanded almost fiercely turning from the one to the other has this been kept from me  ill tell ye why said patterson sinking with crushed submission into a chair when i found he wasnt where he ought to be i got to lookin elsewhere i knew the track of the hoss i lent him by a loose shoe i examined and found he had turned off the high road somewhere beyond the lagoon jist as if he was makin a bee line here  well said mrs tucker breathlessly  well said patterson with the resigned tone of an accustomed martyr mebbe im a godforsaken idiot but i reckon he did come yer and mebbe im that much of a habitooal lunatic but thinking so i calkilated yould know it without tellin  with their eyes fixed upon her mrs tucker felt the quick blood rush to her cheeks although she knew not why but they were apparently satisfied with her ignorance for patterson resumed yet more gloomily  then if he wasnt hidin here beknownst to you he must have changed his mind agin and got away by the embarcadero the only thing wantin to prove that idea is to know how he got a boat and what he did with the hoss and thars one more idea and ez that cant be proved continued patterson sinking his voice still lower mebbe its accordin to gods laws  unsympathetic to her as the speaker had always been and still was mrs tucker felt a vague chill creep over her that seemed to be the result of his manner more than his words and that idea is     she suggested with pale lips  its this fust i dont say it means much to anybody but me ive heard of these warnings afore now ez comin only to folks ez hear them for themselves alone and i reckon i kin stand it if its the will o god the idea is thenthatspencer tuckerwas drownded in that boat the idea ishis voice was almost lost in a hoarse whisperthat it was no living man that kem to me that night but a spirit that kem out of the darkness and went back into it no eye saw him but mineno ears heard him but mine i reckon it werent intended it should he paused and passed the flap of his hat across his eyes the pie youll say is agin it he continued in the same tone of voicethe whiskey is agin ita few cuss words that dropped from him accidental like may have been agin it all the same they mout have been only the little signs and tokens that it was him  but mrs baxters ready laugh somewhat rudely dispelled the infection of pattersons gloom i reckon the only spirit was that which you and spencer consumed she said cheerfully i dont wonder youre a little mixed like as not youve misunderstood his plans patterson shook his head hell turn up yet alive and kicking like as not then poindexter knows where he is all the time  impossible he would have told me said mrs tucker quickly  mrs baxter looked at patterson without speaking patterson replied by a long lugubrious whistle  i dont understand you said mrs tucker drawing back with cold dignity  you dont returned mrs baxter bless your innocent heart why was he so keen to hunt me up at first shadowing my friends and all that and why has he dropped it now he knows im here if he didnt know where spencer was  i can explain that interrupted mrs tucker hastily with a blush of confusion that isi  then mebbe you kin explain too broke in patterson with gloomy significance why he has bought up most of spencers debts himself and perhaps youre satisfied it isnt to hold the whip hand of him and keep him from coming back openly praps you know why hes movin heaven and earth to make don jose santierra sell the ranch and why the don dont see it all  don jose sell los cuervos buy it you mean said mrs tucker i offered to sell it to him  patterson arose from the chair looked despairingly around him passed his hand sadly across his forehead and said its come i knew it would its the warning its suthing betwixt jimjams and doddering idjiocy here id hev been willin to swear that mrs baxter here told me she had sold this yer ranch nearly two years ago to don jose and now you  stop said mrs tucker in a voice that chilled them  she was standing upright and rigid as if stricken to stone i command you to tell me what this means she said turning only her blazing eyes upon the woman  even the ready smile faded from mrs baxters lips as she replied hesitatingly and submissively i thought you knew already that spencer had given this ranch to me i sold it to don jose to get the money for us to go away with it was spencers idea  you lie said mrs tucker  there was a dead silence the wrathful blood that had quickly mounted to mrs baxters cheek to pattersons additional bewilderment faded as quickly she did not lift her eyes again to mrs tuckers but slowly raising herself from her seat said i wish to god i did lie but its true and its true that i never touched a cent of the money but gave it all to him she laid her hand on pattersons arm and said come let us go and led him a few steps towards the gateway but here patterson paused and again passed his hand over his melancholy brow the necessity of coherently and logically closing the conversation impressed itself upon his darkening mind then you dont happen to have heard anything of spencer he said sadly and vanished with mrs baxter through the gate  left alone to herself mrs tucker raised her hands above her head with a little cry interlocked her rigid fingers and slowly brought her palms down upon her upturned face and eyes pressing hard as if to crush out all light and sense of life before her she stood thus for a moment motionless and silent with the rising wind whispering without and flecking her white morning dress with gusty shadows from the arbor then with closed eyes dropping her hands to her breast still pressing hard she slowly passed them down the shapely contours of her figure to the waist and with another cry cast them off as if she were stripping herself of some loathsome garment then she walked quickly to the gateway looked out returned to the corridor unloosening and taking off her weddingring from her finger as she walked here she paused then slowly and deliberately rearranged the chairs and adjusted the gaycolored rugs that draped them and quietly reentered her chamber   two days afterwards the sweating steed of captain poindexter was turned loose in the corral and a moment later the captain entered the corridor handing a letter to the decrepit concha who seemed to be utterly disorganized by its contents and the few curt words with which it was delivered he gazed silently upon the vacant bower still fresh and redolent with the delicacy and perfume of its graceful occupant until his dark eyes filled with unaccustomed moisture but his reverie was interrupted by the sound of jingling spurs without and the old humor struggled back in his eyes as don jose impetuously entered the spaniard started back but instantly recovered himself  so i find you here ah it is well he said passionately producing a letter from his bosom look do you call this honor look how you keep your compact  poindexter coolly took the letter it contained a few words of gentle dignity from mrs tucker informing don jose that she had only that instant learned of his just claims upon los cuervos tendering him her gratitude for his delicate intentions but pointing out with respectful firmness that he must know that a moments further acceptance of his courtesy was impossible  she has gained this knowledge from no word of mine said poindexter calmly right or wrong i have kept my promise to you i have as much reason to accuse you of betraying my secret in this he added coldly as he took another letter from his pocket and handed it to don jose  it seemed briefer and colder but was neither it reminded poindexter that as he had again deceived her she must take the government of her affairs in her own hands henceforth she abandoned all the furniture and improvements she had put in los cuervos to him to whom she now knew she was indebted for them she could not thank him for what his habitual generosity impelled him to do for any woman but she could forgive him for misunderstanding her like any other woman perhaps she should say like a child when he received this she would be already on her way to her old home in kentucky where she still hoped to be able by her own efforts to amass enough to discharge her obligations to him  she does not speak of her husband this woman said don jose scanning poindexters face it is possible she rejoins him eh  perhaps in one way she has never left him don jose said poindexter with grave significance  don joses face flushed but he returned carelessly and the rancho naturally you will not buy it now  on the contrary i shall abide by my offer said poindexter quietly  don jose eyed him narrowly and then said ah we shall consider of it  he did consider it and accepted the offer with the full control of the land captain poindexters improvements so indefinitely postponed were actively pushed forward the thick walls of the hacienda were the first to melt away before them the low lines of corral were effaced and the early breath of the summer trade winds swept uninterruptedly across the now leveled plain to the embarcadero where a newer structure arose a more vivid green alone marked the spot where the crumbling adobe walls of the casa had returned to the parent soil that gave it the channel was deepened the lagoon was drained until one evening the magic mirror that had so long reflected the weary waiting of the blue grass penelope lay dull dead lustreless an opaque quagmire of noisome corruption and decay to be put away from the sight of man forever on this spot the crows the titular tenants of los cuervos assembled in tumultuous congress coming and going in mysterious clouds or laboring in thick and writhing masses as if they were continuing the work of improvement begun by human agency so well had they done the work that by the end of a week only a few scattered white objects remained glittering on the surface of the quickly drying soil but they were the bones of the missing outcast spencer tucker    the same spring a breath of war swept over a foul decaying quagmire of the whole land before which such passing deeds as these were blown as vapor it called men of all rank and condition to battle for a nations life and among the first to respond were those into whose boyish hands had been placed the nations honor it returned the epaulets to poindexters shoulder with the addition of a double star carried him triumphantly to the front and left him at the end of a summers day and a hardwon fight sorely wounded at the door of a blue grass farmhouse and the woman who sought him out and ministered to his wants said timidly as she left her hand in his i told you i should live to repay you      left out on lone star mountain     chapter i   there was little doubt that the lone star claim was played out not dug out worked out washed out but played out for two years its five sanguine proprietors had gone through the various stages of mining enthusiasm had prospected and planned dug and doubted they had borrowed money with hearty but unredeeming frankness established a credit with unselfish abnegation of all responsibility and had borne the disappointment of their creditors with a cheerful resignation which only the consciousness of some deep compensating future could give giving little else however a singular dissatisfaction obtained with the traders and being accompanied with a reluctance to make further advances at last touched the gentle stoicism of the proprietors themselves the youthful enthusiasm which had at first lifted the most ineffectual trial the most useless essay to the plane of actual achievement died out leaving them only the dull prosaic record of halffinished ditches purposeless shafts untenable pits abandoned engines and meaningless disruptions of the soil upon the lone star claim and empty flour sacks and pork barrels in the lone star cabin  they had borne their poverty if that term could be applied to a light renunciation of all superfluities in food dress or ornament ameliorated by the gentle depredations already alluded to with unassuming levity more than that having segregated themselves from their fellowminers of red gulch and entered upon the possession of the little manzanitathicketed valley five miles away the failure of their enterprise had assumed in their eyes only the vague significance of the decline and fall of a general community and to that extent relieved them of individual responsibility it was easier for them to admit that the lone star claim was played out than confess to a personal bankruptcy moreover they still retained the sacred right of criticism of government and rose superior in their private opinions to their own collective wisdom each one experienced a grateful sense of the entire responsibility of the other four in the fate of their enterprise  on december 24 1863 a gentle rain was still falling over the length and breadth of the lone star claim it had been falling for several days had already called a faint spring color to the wan landscape repairing with tender touches the ravages wrought by the proprietors or charitably covering their faults the ragged seams in gulch and canyon lost their harsh outlines a thin green mantle faintly clothed the torn and abraded hillside a few weeks more and a veil of forgetfulness would be drawn over the feeble failures of the lone star claim the charming derelicts themselves listening to the raindrops on the roof of their little cabin gazed philosophically from the open door and accepted the prospect as a moral discharge from their obligations four of the five partners were present the right and left bowers union mills and the judge  it is scarcely necessary to say that not one of these titles was the genuine name of its possessor the right and left bowers were two brothers their sobriquets a cheerful adaptation from the favorite game of euchre expressing their relative value in the camp the mere fact that union mills had at one time patched his trousers with an old flour sack legibly bearing that brand of its fabrication was a tempting baptismal suggestion that the other partners could not forego the judge a singularly inequitable missourian with no knowledge whatever of the law was an inspiration of gratuitous irony  union mills who had been for some time sitting placidly on the threshold with one leg exposed to the rain from a sheer indolent inability to change his position finally withdrew that weatherbeaten member and stood up the movement more or less deranged the attitudes of the other partners and was received with cynical disfavor it was somewhat remarkable that although generally giving the appearance of healthy youth and perfect physical condition they one and all simulated the decrepitude of age and invalidism and after limping about for a few moments settled back again upon their bunks and stools in their former positions the left bower lazily replaced a bandage that he had worn around his ankle for weeks without any apparent necessity and the judge scrutinized with tender solicitude the faded cicatrix of a scratch upon his arm a passive hypochondria born of their isolation was the last ludicrously pathetic touch to their situation  the immediate cause of this commotion felt the necessity of an explanation  it would have been just as easy for you to have stayed outside with your business leg instead of dragging it into private life in that obtrusive way retorted the right bower but that exhaustive effort isnt going to fill the pork barrel the grocery man at dalton sayswhats that he said he appealed lazily to the judge  said he reckoned the lone star was about played out and he didnt want any more in histhank you repeated the judge with a mechanical effort of memory utterly devoid of personal or present interest  i always suspected that man after grimshaw begun to deal with him said the left bower theyre just mean enough to join hands against us it was a fixed belief of the lone star partners that they were pursued by personal enmities  more than likely those new strangers over in the fork have been paying cash and filled him up with conceit said union mills trying to dry his leg by alternately beating it or rubbing it against the cabin wall once begin wrong with that kind of snipe and you drag everybody down with you  this vague conclusion was received with dead silence everybody had become interested in the speakers peculiar method of drying his leg to the exclusion of the previous topic a few offered criticism no one assistance  who did the grocery man say that to asked the right bower finally returning to the question  the old man answered the judge  of course ejaculated the right bower sarcastically  of course echoed the other partners together thats like him the old man all over  it did not appear exactly what was like the old man or why it was like him but generally that he alone was responsible for the grocery mans defection it was put more concisely by union mills  that comes of letting him go there its just a fair provocation to any man to have the old man sent to him they cant sorter restrain themselves at him hes enough to spoil the credit of the rothschilds  thats so chimed in the judge and look at his prospecting why he was out two nights last week all night prospecting in the moonlight for blind leads just out of sheer foolishness  it was quite enough for me broke in the left bower when the other day you remember when he proposed to us white men to settle down to plain ground sluicing making grub wages just like any chinaman it just showed his idea of the lone star claim  well i never said it afore added union mills but when that one of the mattison boys came over here to examine the claim with an eye to purchasin it was the old man that took the conceit out of him he just as good as admitted that a lot of work had got to be done afore any pay ore could be realized never even asked him over to the shanty here to jine us in a friendly game just kept him so to speak to himself and naturally the mattisons didnt see it  a silence followed broken only by the rain monotonously falling on the roof and occasionally through the broad adobe chimney where it provoked a retaliating hiss and splutter from the dying embers of the hearth the right bower with a sudden access of energy drew the empty barrel before him and taking a pack of wellworn cards from his pocket began to make a solitaire upon the lid the others gazed at him with languid interest  makin it for anythin asked mills  the right bower nodded  the judge and left bower who were partly lying in their respective bunks sat up to get a better view of the game union mills slowly disengaged himself from the wall and leaned over the solitaire player the right bower turned the last card in a pause of almost thrilling suspense and clapped it down on the lid with fateful emphasis  it went said the judge in a voice of hushed respect what did you make it for he almost whispered  to know if wed make the break we talked about and vamose the ranch its the fifth time today continued the right bower in a voice of gloomy significance and it went agin bad cards too  i aint superstitious said the judge with awe and fatuity beaming from every line of his credulous face but its flyin in the face of providence to go agin such signs as that  make it again to see if the old man must go suggested the left bower  the suggestion was received with favor the three men gathering breathlessly around the player again the fateful cards were shuffled deliberately placed in their mysterious combination with the same ominous result yet everybody seemed to breathe more freely as if relieved from some responsibility the judge accepting this manifest expression of providence with resigned selfrighteousness  yes gentlemen resumed the left bower serenely as if a calm legal decision had just been recorded we must not let any foolishness or sentiment get mixed up with this thing but look at it like business men the only sensible move is to get up and get out of the camp  and the old man queried the judge  the old manhush hes coming  the doorway was darkened by a slight lissome shadow it was the absent partner otherwise known as the old man need it be added that he was a boy of nineteen with a slight down just clothing his upper lip  the creek is up over the ford and i had to shin up a willow on the bank and swing myself across he said with a quick frank laugh but all the same boys its going to clear up in about an hour you bet its breaking away over bald mountain and theres a sun flash on a bit of snow on lone peak look you can see it from here its for all the world like noahs dove just landed on mount ararat its a good omen  from sheer force of habit the men had momentarily brightened up at the old mans entrance but the unblushing exhibition of degrading superstition shown in the last sentence recalled their just severity they exchanged meaning glances union mills uttered hopelessly to himself hells full of such omens  too occupied with his subject to notice this ominous reception the old man continued i reckon i struck a fresh lead in the new grocery man at the crossing he says hell let the judge have a pair of boots on credit but he cant send them over here and considering that the judge has got to try them anyway it dont seem to be asking too much for the judge to go over there he says hell give us a barrel of pork and a bag of flour if well give him the right of using our tailrace and clean out the lower end of it  its the work of a chinaman and a four days job broke in the left bower  it took one white man only two hours to clean out a third of it retorted the old man triumphantly for i pitched in at once with a pick he let me have on credit and did that amount of work this morning and told him the rest of you boys would finish it this afternoon  a slight gesture from the right bower checked an angry exclamation from the left the old man did not notice either but knitting his smooth young brow in a paternally reflective fashion went on youll have to get a new pair of trousers mills but as he doesnt keep clothing well have to get some canvas and cut you out a pair i traded off the beans he let me have for some tobacco for the right bower at the other shop and got them to throw in a new pack of cards these are about played out well be wanting some brushwood for the fire theres a heap in the hollow whos going to bring it in its the judges turn isnt it why whats the matter with you all  the restraint and evident uneasiness of his companions had at last touched him he turned his frank young eyes upon them they glanced helplessly at each other yet his first concern was for them his first instinct paternal and protecting he ran his eyes quickly over them they were all there and apparently in their usual condition anything wrong with the claim he suggested  without looking at him the right bower rose leaned against the open door with his hands behind him and his face towards the landscape and said apparently to the distant prospect the claims played out the partnerships played out and the sooner we skedaddle out of this the better if he added turning to the old man if you want to stay if you want to do chinamans work at chinamans wages if you want to hang on to the charity of the traders at the crossing you can do it and enjoy the prospects and the noahs doves alone but were calculatin to step out of it  but i havent said i wanted to do it alone protested the old man with a gesture of bewilderment  if these are your general ideas of the partnership continued the right bower clinging to the established hypothesis of the other partners for support it aint ours and the only way we can prove it is to stop the foolishness right here we calculated to dissolve the partnership and strike out for ourselves elsewhere youre no longer responsible for us nor we for you and we reckon its the square thing to leave you the claim and the cabin and all it contains to prevent any trouble with the traders weve drawn up a paper here  with a bonus of fifty thousand dollars each down and the rest to be settled on my children interrupted the old man with a halfuneasy laugh of course but he stopped suddenly the blood dropped from his fresh cheek and he again glanced quickly round the group i dont thinkii quite sabe boys he added with a slight tremor of voice and lip if its a conundrum ask me an easier one  any lingering doubt he might have had of their meaning was dispelled by the judge its about the softest thing you kin drop into old man he said confidentially if i hadnt promised the other boys to go with them and if i didnt need the best medical advice in sacramento for my lungs id just enjoy staying with you  it gives a sorter freedom to a young fellow like you old man like goin into the world on your own capital that every californian boy hasnt got said union mills patronizingly  of course its rather hard papers on us you know givin up everything so to speak but its for your good and we aint goin back on you said the left bower are we boys  the color had returned to the old mans face a little more quickly and freely than usual he picked up the hat he had cast down put it on carefully over his brown curls drew the flap down on the side towards his companions and put his hands in his pockets all right he said in a slightly altered voice when do you go  today answered the left bower we calculate to take a moonlight pasear over to the cross roads and meet the down stage at about twelve tonight theres plenty of time yet he added with a slight laugh its only three oclock now  there was a dead silence even the rain withheld its continuous patter a dumb gray film covered the ashes of the hushed hearth for the first time the right bower exhibited some slight embarrassment  i reckon its held up for a spell he said ostentatiously examining the weather and we might as well take a run round the claim to see if weve forgotten nothing of course well be back again he added hastily without looking at the old man before we go you know  the others began to look for their hats but so awkwardly and with such evident preoccupation of mind that it was not at first discovered that the judge had his already on this raised a laugh as did also a clumsy stumble of union mills against the pork barrel although that gentleman took refuge from his confusion and secured a decent retreat by a gross exaggeration of his lameness as he limped after the right bower the judge whistled feebly the left bower in a more ambitious effort to impart a certain gayety to his exit stopped on the threshold and said as if in arch confidence to his companions darned if the old man dont look two inches higher since he became a proprietor laughed patronizingly and vanished  if the newlymade proprietor had increased in stature he had not otherwise changed his demeanor he remained in the same attitude until the last figure disappeared behind the fringe of buckeye that hid the distant highway then he walked slowly to the fireplace and leaning against the chimney kicked the dying embers together with his foot something dropped and spattered in the film of hot ashes surely the rain had not yet ceased  his high color had already fled except for a spot on either cheekbone that lent a brightness to his eyes he glanced around the cabin it looked familiar and yet strange rather it looked strange because still familiar and therefore incongruous with the new atmosphere that surrounded itdiscordant with the echo of their last meeting and painfully accenting the change there were the four bunks or sleeping berths of his companions each still bearing some traces of the individuality of its late occupant with a dumb loyalty that seemed to make their lighthearted defection monstrous in the dead ashes of the judges pipe scattered on his shelf still lived his old fire in the whittled and carved edges of the left bowers bunk still were the memories of bygone days of delicious indolence in the bulletholes clustered round a knot of one of the beams there was still the record of the right bowers oldtime skill and practice in the few engravings of female loveliness stuck upon each headboard there were the proofs of their old extravagant devotionall a mute protest to the change  he remembered how a fatherless truant schoolboy he had drifted into their adventurous nomadic life itself a life of grownup truancy like his own and became one of that gypsy family how they had taken the place of relations and household in his boyish fancy filling it with the unsubstantial pageantry of a childs play at grownup existence he knew only too well but how from being a pet and protege he had gradually and unconsciously asserted his own individuality and taken upon his younger shoulders not only a poets keen appreciation of that life but its actual responsibilities and halfchildish burdens he never suspected he had fondly believed that he was a neophyte in their ways a novice in their charming faith and indolent creed and they had encouraged it now their renunciation of that faith could only be an excuse for a renunciation of him the poetry that had for two years invested the material and sometimes even mean details of their existence was too much a part of himself to be lightly dispelled the lesson of those ingenuous moralists failed as such lessons are apt to fail their discipline provoked but did not subdue a rising indignation stirred by a sense of injury mounted to his cheek and eyes it was slow to come but was none the less violent that it had been preceded by the benumbing shock of shame and pride  i hope i shall not prejudice the readers sympathies if my duty as a simple chronicler compels me to state therefore that the sober second thought of this gentle poet was to burn down the cabin on the spot with all its contents this yielded to a milder counselwaiting for the return of the party challenging the right bower a duel to the death perhaps himself the victim with a crushing explanation in extremis it seems we are one too many no matter it is settled now farewell dimly remembering however that there was something of this in the last wellworn novel they had read together and that his antagonist might recognize it or even worse anticipate it himself the idea was quickly rejected besides the opportunity for an apotheosis of selfsacrifice was past nothing remained now but to refuse the proffered bribe of claim and cabin by letter for he must not wait their return he tore a leaf from a blotted diary begun and abandoned long since and essayed to write scrawl after scrawl was torn up until his fury had cooled down to a frigid third personality mr john ford regrets to inform his late partners that their tender of house of furniture however seemed too inconsistent with the porkbarrel table he was writing on a more eloquent renunciation of their offer became frivolous and idiotic from a caricature of union mills label and all that appeared suddenly on the other side of the leaf and when he at last indited a satisfactory and impassioned exposition of his feelings the legible addendum of oh aint you glad youre out of the wildernessthe forgotten first line of a popular song which no scratching would eraseseemed too like an ironical postscript to be thought of for a moment he threw aside his pen and cast the discordant record of past foolish pastime into the dead ashes of the hearth  how quiet it was with the cessation of the rain the wind too had gone down and scarcely a breath of air came through the open door he walked to the threshold and gazed on the hushed prospect in this listless attitude he was faintly conscious of a distant reverberation a mere phantom of soundperhaps the explosion of a distant blast in the hillsthat left the silence more marked and oppressive as he turned again into the cabin a change seemed to have come over it it already looked old and decayed the loneliness of years of desertion seemed to have taken possession of it the atmosphere of dry rot was in the beams and rafters to his excited fancy the few disordered blankets and articles of clothing seemed dropping to pieces in one of the bunks there was a hideous resemblance in the longitudinal heap of clothing to a withered and mummied corpse so it might look in after years when some passing strangerbut he stopped a dread of the place was beginning to creep over him a dread of the days to come when the monotonous sunshine should lay bare the loneliness of these walls the long long days of endless blue and cloudless overhanging solitude summer days when the wearying incessant trade winds should sing around that empty shell and voice its desolation he gathered together hastily a few articles that were especially his ownrather that the free communion of the camp from indifference or accident had left wholly to him he hesitated for a moment over his rifle but scrupulous in his wounded pride turned away and left the familiar weapon that in the dark days had so often provided the dinner or breakfast of the little household candor compels me to state that his equipment was not large nor eminently practical his scant pack was a light weight for even his young shoulders but i fear he thought more of getting away from the past than providing for the future  with this vague but sole purpose he left the cabin and almost mechanically turned his steps towards the creek he had crossed that morning he knew that by this route he would avoid meeting his companions its difficulties and circuitousness would exercise his feverish limbs and give him time for reflection he had determined to leave the claim but whence he had not yet considered he reached the bank of the creek where he had stood two hours before it seemed to him two years he looked curiously at his reflection in one of the broad pools of overflow and fancied he looked older he watched the rush and outset of the turbid current hurrying to meet the south fork and to eventually lose itself in the yellow sacramento even in his preoccupation he was impressed with a likeness to himself and his companions in this flood that had burst its peaceful boundaries in the drifting fragments of one of their forgotten flumes washed from the bank he fancied he saw an omen of the disintegration and decay of the lone star claim  the strange hush in the air that he had noticed beforea calm so inconsistent with that hour and the season as to seem portentousbecame more marked in contrast to the feverish rush of the turbulent watercourse a few clouds lazily huddled in the west apparently had gone to rest with the sun on beds of somnolent poppies there was a gleam as of golden water everywhere along the horizon washing out the cold snowpeaks and drowning even the rising moon the creek caught it here and there until in grim irony it seemed to bear their broken sluiceboxes and useless engines on the very pactolian stream they had been hopefully created to direct and carry but by some peculiar trick of the atmosphere the perfect plenitude of that golden sunset glory was lavished on the rugged sides and tangled crest of the lone star mountain that isolated peak the landmark of their claim the gaunt monument of their folly transfigured in the evening splendor kept its radiance unquenched long after the glow had fallen from the encompassing skies and when at last the rising moon step by step put out the fires along the winding valley and plains and crept up the bosky sides of the canyon the vanishing sunset was lost only to reappear as a golden crown  the eyes of the young man were fixed upon it with more than a momentary picturesque interest it had been the favorite ground of his prospecting exploits its lowest flank had been scarred in the old enthusiastic days with hydraulic engines or pierced with shafts but its central position in the claim and its superior height had always given it a commanding view of the extent of their valley and its approaches and it was this practical preeminence that alone attracted him at that moment he knew that from its crest he would be able to distinguish the figures of his companions as they crossed the valley near the cabin in the growing moonlight thus he could avoid encountering them on his way to the high road and yet see them perhaps for the last time even in his sense of injury there was a strange satisfaction in the thought  the ascent was toilsome but familiar all along the dim trail he was accompanied by gentler memories of the past that seemed like the faint odor of spiced leaves and fragrant grasses wet with the rain and crushed beneath his ascending tread to exhale the sweeter perfume in his effort to subdue or rise above them there was the thicket of manzanita where they had broken noonday bread together here was the rock beside their maiden shaft where they had poured a wild libation in boyish enthusiasm of success and here the ledge where their first flag a red shirt heroically sacrificed was displayed from a longhandled shovel to the gaze of admirers below when he at last reached the summit the mysterious hush was still in the air as if in breathless sympathy with his expedition in the west the plain was faintly illuminated but disclosed no moving figures he turned towards the rising moon and moved slowly to the eastern edge suddenly he stopped another step would have been his last he stood upon the crumbling edge of a precipice a landslip had taken place on the eastern flank leaving the gaunt ribs and fleshless bones of lone star mountain bare in the moonlight he understood now the strange rumble and reverberation he had heard he understood now the strange hush of bird and beast in brake and thicket  although a single rapid glance convinced him that the slide had taken place in an unfrequented part of the mountain above an inaccessible canyon and reflection assured him his companions could not have reached that distance when it took place a feverish impulse led him to descend a few rods in the track of the avalanche the frequent recurrence of outcrop and angle made this comparatively easy here he called aloud the feeble echo of his own voice seemed only a dull impertinence to the significant silence he turned to reascend the furrowed flank of the mountain before him lay full in the moonlight to his excited fancy a dozen luminous starlike points in the rocky crevices started into life as he faced them throwing his arm over the ledge above him he supported himself for a moment by what appeared to be a projection of the solid rock it trembled slightly as he raised himself to its level his heart stopped beating it was simply a fragment detached from the outcrop lying loosely on the ledge but upholding him by its own weight only he examined it with trembling fingers the encumbering soil fell from its sides and left its smoothed and worn protuberances glistening in the moonlight it was virgin gold  looking back upon that moment afterwards he remembered that he was not dazed dazzled or startled it did not come to him as a discovery or an accident a stroke of chance or a caprice of fortune he saw it all in that supreme moment nature had worked out their poor deduction what their feeble engines had essayed spasmodically and helplessly against the curtain of soil that hid the treasure the elements had achieved with mightier but more patient forces the slow sapping of the winter rains had loosened the soil from the auriferous rock even while the swollen stream was carrying their impotent and shattered engines to the sea  what mattered that his single arm could not lift the treasure he had found what mattered that to unfix those glittering stars would still tax both skill and patience the work was done the goal was reached even his boyish impatience was content with that he rose slowly to his feet unstrapped his longhandled shovel from his back secured it in the crevice and quietly regained the summit  it was all his own his own by right of discovery under the law of the land and without accepting a favor from them he recalled even the fact that it was his prospecting on the mountain that first suggested the existence of gold in the outcrop and the use of the hydraulic he had never abandoned that belief whatever the others had done he dwelt somewhat indignantly to himself on this circumstance and half unconsciously faced defiantly towards the plain below but it was sleeping peacefully in the full sight of the moon without life or motion he looked at the stars it was still far from midnight his companions had no doubt long since returned to the cabin to prepare for their midnight journey they were discussing him perhaps laughing at him or worse pitying him and his bargain yet here was his bargain a slight laugh he gave vent to here startled him a little it sounded so hard and so unmirthful and so unlike as he oddly fancied what he really thought but what did he think  nothing mean or revengeful no they never would say that when he had taken out all the surface gold and put the mine in working order he would send them each a draft for a thousand dollars of course if they were ever ill or poor he would do more one of the first the very first things he should do would be to send them each a handsome gun and tell them that he only asked in return the oldfashioned rifle that once was his looking back at the moment in after years he wondered that with this exception he made no plans for his own future or the way he should dispose of his newly acquired wealth this was the more singular as it had been the custom of the five partners to lie awake at night audibly comparing with each other what they would do in case they made a strike he remembered how alnascharlike they nearly separated once over a difference in the disposal of a hundred thousand dollars that they never had nor expected to have he remembered how union mills always began his career as a millionnaire by a square meal at delmonicos how the right bowers initial step was always a trip home to see his mother how the left bower would immediately placate the parents of his beloved with priceless gifts it may be parenthetically remarked that the parents and the beloved one were as hypothetical as the fortune and how the judge would make his first start as a capitalist by breaking a certain faro bank in sacramento he himself had been equally eloquent in extravagant fancy in those penniless days he who now was quite cold and impassive beside the more extravagant reality  how different it might have been if they had only waited a day longer if they had only broken their resolves to him kindly and parted in good will how he would long ere this have rushed to greet them with the joyful news how they would have danced around it sung themselves hoarse laughed down their enemies and run up the flag triumphantly on the summit of the lone star mountain how they would have crowned him the old man the hero of the camp how he would have told them the whole story how some strange instinct had impelled him to ascend the summit and how another step on that summit would have precipitated him into the canyon and howbut what if somebody else union mills or the judge had been the first discoverer might they not have meanly kept the secret from him have selfishly helped themselves and done  what you are doing now  the hot blood rushed to his cheek as if a strange voice were at his ear for a moment he could not believe that it came from his own pale lips until he found himself speaking he rose to his feet tingling with shame and began hurriedly to descend the mountain  he would go to them tell them of his discovery let them give him his share and leave them forever it was the only thing to be done strange that he had not thought of it at once yet it was hard very hard and cruel to be forced to meet them again what had he done to suffer this mortification for a moment he actually hated this vulgar treasure that had forever buried under its gross ponderability the light and careless past and utterly crushed out the poetry of their old indolent happy existence  he was sure to find them waiting at the cross roads where the coach came past it was three miles away yet he could get there in time if he hastened it was a wise and practical conclusion of his evenings work a lame and impotent conclusion to his evenings indignation no matter they would perhaps at first think he had come to weakly follow them perhaps they would at first doubt his story no matter he bit his lips to keep down the foolish rising tears but still went blindly forward  he saw not the beautiful night cradled in the dark hills swathed in luminous mists and hushed in the awe of its own loveliness here and there the moon had laid her calm face on lake and overflow and gone to sleep embracing them until the whole plain seemed to be lifted into infinite quiet walking on as in a dream the black impenetrable barriers of skirting thickets opened and gave way to vague distances that it appeared impossible to reach dim vistas that seemed unapproachable gradually he seemed himself to become a part of the mysterious night he was becoming as pulseless as calm as passionless  what was that a shot in the direction of the cabin yet so faint so echoless so ineffective in the vast silence that he would have thought it his fancy but for the strange instinctive jar upon his sensitive nerves was it an accident or was it an intentional signal to him he stopped it was not repeated the silence reasserted itself but this time with an ominous deathlike suggestion a sudden and terrible thought crossed his mind he cast aside his pack and all encumbering weight took a deep breath lowered his head and darted like a deer in the direction of the challenge     chapter ii   the exodus of the seceding partners of the lone star claim had been scarcely an imposing one for the first five minutes after quitting the cabin the procession was straggling and vagabond unwonted exertion had exaggerated the lameness of some and feebleness of moral purpose had predisposed the others to obtrusive musical exhibition union mills limped and whistled with affected abstraction the judge whistled and limped with affected earnestness the right bower led the way with some show of definite design the left bower followed with his hands in his pockets the two feebler natures drawn together in unconscious sympathy looked vaguely at each other for support  you see said the judge suddenly as if triumphantly concluding an argument there aint anything better for a young fellow than independence nature so to speak points the way look at the animals  theres a skunk hereabouts said union mills who was supposed to be gifted with aristocratically sensitive nostrils within ten miles of this place like as not crossing the ridge its always my luck to happen out just at such times i dont see the necessity anyhow of trapesing round the claim now if we calculate to leave it tonight  both men waited to observe if the suggestion was taken up by the right and left bower moodily plodding ahead no response following the judge shamelessly abandoned his companion  you wouldnt stand snoopin round instead of lettin the old man get used to the idea alone no i could see all along that he was takin it in takin it in kindly but slowly and i reckoned the best thing for us to do was to git up and git until hed got round it the judges voice was slightly raised for the benefit of the two before him  didnt he say remarked the right bower stopping suddenly and facing the others didnt he say that that new trader was goin to let him have some provisions anyway  union mills turned appealingly to the judge that gentleman was forced to reply yes i remember distinctly he said it it was one of the things i was particular about on his account responded the judge with the air of having arranged it all himself with the new trader i remember i was easier in my mind about it  but didnt he say queried the left bower also stopping short suthin about its being contingent on our doing some work on the race  the judge turned for support to union mills who however under the hollow pretense of preparing for a long conference had luxuriously seated himself on a stump the judge sat down also and replied hesitatingly well yes us or him  us or him repeated the right bower with gloomy irony and you aint quite clear in your mind are you if you havent done the work already youre just killing yourself with this spontaneous promiscuous and premature overwork thats whats the matter with you  i reckon i heard somebody say suthin about its being a chinamans threeday job interpolated the left bower with equal irony but i aint quite clear in my mind about that  itll be a sorter distraction for the old man said union mills feeblykinder take his mind off his loneliness  nobody taking the least notice of the remark union mills stretched out his legs more comfortably and took out his pipe he had scarcely done so when the right bower wheeling suddenly set off in the direction of the creek the left bower after a slight pause followed without a word the judge wisely conceiving it better to join the stronger party ran feebly after him and left union mills to bring up a weak and vacillating rear  their course diverging from lone star mountain led them now directly to the bend of the creek the base of their old ineffectual operations here was the beginning of the famous tailrace that skirted the new traders claim and then lost its way in a swampy hollow it was choked with debris a thin yellow stream that once ran through it seemed to have stopped work when they did and gone into greenish liquidation  they had scarcely spoken during this brief journey and had received no other explanation from the right bower who led them than that afforded by his mute example when he reached the race leaping into it without a word he at once began to clear away the broken timbers and driftwood fired by the spectacle of what appeared to be a new and utterly frivolous game the men gayly leaped after him and were soon engaged in a fascinating struggle with the impeded race the judge forgot his lameness in springing over a broken sluicebox union mills forgot his whistle in a happy imitation of a chinese coolies song nevertheless after ten minutes of this mild dissipation the pastime flagged union mills was beginning to rub his leg when a distant rumble shook the earth the men looked at each other the diversion was complete a languid discussion of the probabilities of its being an earthquake or a blast followed in the midst of which the right bower who was working a little in advance of the others uttered a warning cry and leaped from the race his companions had barely time to follow before a sudden and inexplicable rise in the waters of the creek sent a swift irruption of the flood through the race in an instant its choked and impeded channel was cleared the race was free and the scattered debris of logs and timber floated upon its easy current quick to take advantage of this laborsaving phenomenon the lone star partners sprang into the water and by disentangling and directing the eddying fragments completed their work  the old man oughter been here to see this said the left bower its just one o them climaxes of poetic justice hes always huntin up its easy to see whats happened one o them hightoned shrimps over in the excelsior claim has put a blast in too near the creek hes tumbled the bank into the creek and sent the back water down here just to wash out our race thats what i call poetical retribution  and who was it advised us to dam the creek below the race and make it do the thing asked the right bower moodily  that was one of the old mans ideas i reckon said the left bower dubiously  and you remember broke in the judge with animation i allus said go slow go slow you just hold on and suthin will happen and he added triumphantly you see suthin has happened i dont want to take credit to myself but i reckoned on them excelsior boys bein fools and took the chances  and what if i happen to know that the excelsior boys aint blastin today said the right bower sarcastically  as the judge had evidently based his hypothesis on the alleged fact of a blast he deftly evaded the point i aint saying the old mans head aint level on some things he wants a little more sabe of the world hes improved a good deal in euchre lately and in pokerwell hes got that sorter dreamy listenintotheangels kind o way that you cant exactly tell whether hes bluffin or has got a full hand hasnt he he asked appealing to union mills  but that gentleman who had been watching the dark face of the right bower preferred to take what he believed to be his cue from him that aint the question he said virtuously we aint takin this step to make a card sharp out of him were not doin chinamens work in this race today for that no sir were teachin him to paddle his own canoe not finding the sympathetic response he looked for in the right bowers face he turned to the left  i reckon we were teachin him our canoe was too full was the left bowers unexpected reply thats about the size of it  the right bower shot a rapid glance under his brows at his brother the latter with his hands in his pockets stared unconsciously at the rushing waters and then quietly turned away the right bower followed him are you goin back on us he asked  are you responded the other  no  no then it is returned the left bower quietly the elder brother hesitated in halfangry embarrassment  then what did you mean by saying we reckoned our canoe was too full  wasnt that our idea returned the left bower indifferently confounded by this practical expression of his own unformulated good intentions the right bower was staggered  speakin of the old man broke in the judge with characteristic infelicity i reckon hell sort o miss us times like these we were allers runnin him and bedevilin him after work just to get him excited and amusin and hell kinder miss that sort o stimulatin i reckon well miss it too somewhat dont you remember boys the night we put up that little sell on him and made him believe wed struck it rich in the bank of the creek and got him so conceited he wanted to go off and settle all our debts at once  and how i came bustin into the cabin with a pan full of iron pyrites and black sand chuckled union mills continuing the reminiscences and how them big gray eyes of his nearly bulged out of his head well its some satisfaction to know we did our duty by the young fellow even in those little things he turned for confirmation of their general disinterestedness to the right bower but he was already striding away uneasily conscious of the lazy following of the left bower like a laggard conscience at his back this movement again threw union mills and the judge into feeble complicity in the rear as the procession slowly straggled homeward from the creek  night had fallen their way lay through the shadow of lone star mountain deepened here and there by the slight bosky ridges that starting from its base crept across the plain like vast roots of its swelling trunk the shadows were growing blacker as the moon began to assert itself over the rest of the valley when the right bower halted suddenly on one of these ridges the left bower lounged up to him and stopped also while the two others came up and completed the group  theres no light in the shanty said the right bower in a low voice half to himself and half in answer to their inquiring attitude the men followed the direction of his finger in the distance the black outline of the lone star cabin stood out distinctly in the illumined space there was the blank sightless external glitter of moonlight on its two windows that seemed to reflect its dim vacancy empty alike of light and warmth and motion  thats singlar said the judge in an awed whisper  the left bower by simply altering the position of his hands in his trousers pockets managed to suggest that he knew perfectly the meaning of it had always known it but that being now so to speak in the hands of fate he was callous to it this much at least the elder brother read in his attitude but anxiety at that moment was the controlling impulse of the right bower as a certain superstitious remorse was the instinct of the two others and without heeding the cynic the three started at a rapid pace for the cabin  they reached it silently as the moon now riding high in the heavens seemed to touch it with the tender grace and hushed repose of a tomb it was with something of this feeling that the right bower softly pushed open the door it was with something of this dread that the two others lingered on the threshold until the right bower after vainly trying to stir the dead embers on the hearth into life with his foot struck a match and lit their solitary candle its flickering light revealed the familiar interior unchanged in aught but one thing the bunk that the old man had occupied was stripped of its blankets the few cheap ornaments and photographs were gone the rude poverty of the bare boards and scant pallet looked up at them unrelieved by the bright face and gracious youth that had once made them tolerable in the grim irony of that exposure their own penury was doubly conscious the little knapsack the teacup and coffeepot that had hung near his bed were gone also the most indignant protest the most pathetic of the letters he had composed and rejected whose torn fragments still littered the floor could never have spoken with the eloquence of this empty space the men exchanged no words the solitude of the cabin instead of drawing them together seemed to isolate each one in selfish distrust of the others even the unthinking garrulity of union mills and the judge was checked a moment later when the left bower entered the cabin his presence was scarcely noticed  the silence was broken by a joyous exclamation from the judge he had discovered the old mans rifle in the corner where it had been at first overlooked he aint gone yet gentlemenfor yers his rifle he broke in with a feverish return of volubility and a high excited falsetto he wouldnt have left this behind no i knowed it from the first hes just outside a bit foraging for wood and water no sir coming along here i said to union millsdidnt ibet your life the old mans not far off even if he aint in the cabin why the moment i stepped foot  and i said coming along interrupted union mills with equally reviving mendacity like as not hes hangin round yer and lyin low just to give us a surprise he ho  hes gone for good and he left that rifle here on purpose said the left bower in a low voice taking the weapon almost tenderly in his hands  drop it then said the right bower the voice was that of his brother but suddenly changed with passion the two other partners instinctively drew back in alarm  ill not leave it here for the first comer said the left bower calmly because weve been fools and he too its too good a weapon for that  drop it i say said the right bower with a savage stride towards him  the younger brother brought the rifle to a half charge with a white face but a steady eye  stop where you are he said collectedly dont row with me because you havent either the grit to stick to your ideas or the heart to confess them wrong weve followed your lead andhere we are the camps broken upthe old mans goneand were going and as for the dd rifle  drop it do you hear shouted the right bower clinging to that one idea with the blind pertinacity of rage and a losing cause drop it  the left bower drew back but his brother had seized the barrel with both hands there was a momentary struggle a flash through the halflighted cabin and a shattering report the two men fell back from each other the rifle dropped on the floor between them  the whole thing was over so quickly that the other two partners had not had time to obey their common impulse to separate them and consequently even now could scarcely understand what had passed it was over so quickly that the two actors themselves walked back to their places scarcely realizing their own act  a dead silence followed the judge and union mills looked at each other in dazed astonishment and then nervously set about their former habits apparently in that fatuous belief common to such natures that they were ignoring a painful situation the judge drew the barrel towards him picked up the cards and began mechanically to make a patience on which union mills gazed with ostentatious interest but with eyes furtively conscious of the rigid figure of the right bower by the chimney and the abstracted face of the left bower at the door ten minutes had passed in this occupation the judge and union mills conversing in the furtive whispers of children unavoidably but fascinatedly present at a family quarrel when a light step was heard upon the crackling brushwood outside and the bright panting face of the old man appeared upon the threshold there was a shout of joy in another moment he was halfburied in the bosom of the right bowers shirt halfdragged into the lap of the judge upsetting the barrel and completely encompassed by the left bower and union mills with the enthusiastic utterance of his name the spell was broken  happily unconscious of the previous excitement that had provoked this spontaneous unanimity of greeting the old man equally relieved at once broke into a feverish announcement of his discovery he painted the details with i fear a slight exaggeration of coloring due partly to his own excitement and partly to justify their own but he was strangely conscious that these bankrupt men appeared less elated with their personal interest in their stroke of fortune than with his own success i told you hed do it said the judge with a reckless unscrupulousness of statement that carried everybody with it look at him the game little pup oh no he aint the right breed is he echoed union mills with arch irony while the right and left bower grasping either hand pressed a proud but silent greeting that was half new to him but wholly delicious it was not without difficulty that he could at last prevail upon them to return with him to the scene of his discovery or even then restrain them from attempting to carry him thither on their shoulders on the plea of his previous prolonged exertions once only there was a momentary embarrassment then you fired that shot to bring me back said the old man gratefully in the awkward silence that followed the hands of the two brothers sought and grasped each other penitently yes interposed the judge with delicate tact ye see the right and left bower almost quarreled to see which should be the first to fire for ye i disremember which didi never touched the trigger said the left bower hastily with a hurried backward kick the judge resumed it went off sorter spontaneous  the difference in the sentiment of the procession that once more issued from the lone star cabin did not fail to show itself in each individual partner according to his temperament the subtle tact of union mills however in expressing an awakened respect for their fortunate partner by addressing him as if unconsciously as mr ford was at first discomposing but even this was forgotten in their breathless excitement as they neared the base of the mountain when they had crossed the creek the right bower stopped reflectively  you say you heard the slide come down before you left the cabin he said turning to the old man  yes but i did not know then what it was it was about an hour and a half after you left was the reply  then look here boys continued the right bower with superstitious exultation it was the slide that tumbled into the creek overflowed it and helped us clear out the race  it seemed so clear that providence had taken the partners of the lone star directly in hand that they faced the toilsome ascent of the mountain with the assurance of conquerors they paused only on the summit to allow the old man to lead the way to the slope that held their treasure he advanced cautiously to the edge of the crumbling cliff stopped looked bewildered advanced again and then remained white and immovable in an instant the right bower was at his side  is anything the matter dontdont look so old man for gods sake  the old man pointed to the dull smooth black side of the mountain without a crag break or protuberance and said with ashen lips  its gone    and it was gone a second slide had taken place stripping the flank of the mountain and burying the treasure and the weak implement that had marked its side deep under a chaos of rock and debris at its base  thank god the blank faces of his companions turned quickly to the right bower thank god he repeated with his arm round the neck of the old man had he stayed behind he would have been buried too he paused and pointing solemnly to the depths below said and thank god for showing us where we may yet labor for it in hope and patience like honest men  the men silently bowed their heads and slowly descended the mountain but when they had reached the plain one of them called out to the others to watch a star that seemed to be rising and moving towards them over the hushed and sleeping valley  its only the stage coach boys said the left bower smiling the coach that was to take us away  in the security of their newfound fraternity they resolved to wait and see it pass as it swept by with flash of light beat of hoofs and jingle of harness the only real presence in the dreamy landscape the driver shouted a hoarse greeting to the phantom partners audible only to the judge who was nearest the vehicle  did you heardid you hear what he said boys he gasped turning to his companions no shake hands all round boys god bless you all boys to think we didnt know it all this while  know what  merry christmas
