48869305	extract from captain stormfields visit to heaven     chapter i    well when i had been dead about thirty years i begun to get a little anxious  mind you had been whizzing through space all that time like a comet  like a comet  why peters i laid over the lot of them  of course there warnt any of them going my way as a steady thing you know because they travel in a long circle like the loop of a lasso whereas i was pointed as straight as a dart for the hereafter but i happened on one every now and then that was going my way for an hour or so and then we had a bit of a brush together  but it was generally pretty onesided because i sailed by them the same as if they were standing still  an ordinary comet dont make more than about 200000 miles a minute of course when i came across one of that sortlike enckes and halleys comets for instanceit warnt anything but just a flash and a vanish you see  you couldnt rightly call it a race  it was as if the comet was a graveltrain and i was a telegraph despatch  but after i got outside of our astronomical system i used to flush a comet occasionally that was something like  we havent got any such cometsours dont begin  one night i was swinging along at a good round gait everything taut and trim and the wind in my favori judged i was going about a million miles a minuteit might have been more it couldnt have been lesswhen i flushed a most uncommonly big one about three points off my starboard bow  by his stern lights i judged he was bearing about northeastandbynorthhalfeast  well it was so near my course that i wouldnt throw away the chance so i fell off a point steadied my helm and went for him  you should have heard me whiz and seen the electric fur fly  in about a minute and a half i was fringed out with an electrical nimbus that flamed around for miles and miles and lit up all space like broad day  the comet was burning blue in the distance like a sickly torch when i first sighted him but he begun to grow bigger and bigger as i crept up on him  i slipped up on him so fast that when i had gone about 150000000 miles i was close enough to be swallowed up in the phosphorescent glory of his wake and i couldnt see anything for the glare  thinks i it wont do to run into him so i shunted to one side and tore along  by and by i closed up abreast of his tail  do you know what it was like  it was like a gnat closing up on the continent of america  i forged along  by and by i had sailed along his coast for a little upwards of a hundred and fifty million miles and then i could see by the shape of him that i hadnt even got up to his waistband yet  why peters we dont know anything about comets down here  if you want to see comets that are comets youve got to go outside of our solar system where theres room for them you understand  my friend ive seen comets out there that couldnt even lay down inside the orbits of our noblest comets without their tails hanging over  well i boomed along another hundred and fifty million miles and got up abreast his shoulder as you may say  i was feeling pretty fine i tell you but just then i noticed the officer of the deck come to the side and hoist his glass in my direction  straight off i heard him sing outbelow there ahoy  shake her up shake her up  heave on a hundred million billion tons of brimstone  ayay sir  pipe the stabboard watch  all hands on deck  ayay sir  send two hundred thousand million men aloft to shake out royals and skyscrapers  ayay sir  hand the stunsls  hang out every rag youve got  clothe her from stem to rudderpost  ayay sir  in about a second i begun to see id woke up a pretty ugly customer peters  in less than ten seconds that comet was just a blazing cloud of redhot canvas  it was piled up into the heavens clean out of sightthe old thing seemed to swell out and occupy all space the sulphur smoke from the furnacesoh well nobody can describe the way it rolled and tumbled up into the skies and nobody can half describe the way it smelt  neither can anybody begin to describe the way that monstrous craft begun to crash along  and such another powwowthousands of bosns whistles screaming at once and a crew like the populations of a hundred thousand worlds like ours all swearing at once  well i never heard the like of it before  we roared and thundered along side by side both doing our level best because id never struck a comet before that could lay over me and so i was bound to beat this one or break something  i judged i had some reputation in space and i calculated to keep it i noticed i wasnt gaining as fast now as i was before but still i was gaining  there was a power of excitement on board the comet upwards of a hundred billion passengers swarmed up from below and rushed to the side and begun to bet on the race  of course this careened her and damaged her speed  my but wasnt the mate mad he jumped at that crowd with his trumpet in his hand and sung out  amidships amidships you 1 or ill brain the last idiot of you  well sir i gained and gained little by little till at last i went skimming sweetly by the magnificent old conflagrations nose by this time the captain of the comet had been rousted out and he stood there in the red glare forard by the mate in his shirt sleeves and slippers his hair all rats nests and one suspender hanging and how sick those two men did look  i just simply couldnt help putting my thumb to my nose as i glided away and singing out  tata tata  any word to send to your family  peters it was a mistake  yes sir ive often regretted thatit was a mistake  you see the captain had given up the race but that remark was too tedious for himhe couldnt stand it  he turned to the mate and says he  have we got brimstone enough of our own to make the trip  yes sir  sure  yes sirmore than enough  how much have we got in cargo for satan  eighteen hundred thousand billion quintillions of kazarks  very well then let his boarders freeze till the next comet comes  lighten ship  lively now lively men  heave the whole cargo overboard  peters look me in the eye and be calm  i found out over there that a kazark is exactly the bulk of a hundred and sixtynine worlds like ours  they hove all that load overboard  when it fell it wiped out a considerable raft of stars just as clean as if theyd been candles and somebody blowed them out  as for the race that was at an end  the minute she was lightened the comet swung along by me the same as if i was anchored  the captain stood on the stern by the afterdavits and put his thumb to his nose and sung out  tata tata  maybe youve got some message to send your friends in the everlasting tropics  then he hove up his other suspender and started forard and inside of threequarters of an hour his craft was only a pale torch again in the distance  yes it was a mistake petersthat remark of mine  i dont reckon ill ever get over being sorry about it  id a beat the bully of the firmament if id kept my mouth shut   but ive wandered a little off the track of my tale ill get back on my course again  now you see what kind of speed i was making so as i said when i had been tearing along this way about thirty years i begun to get uneasy  oh it was pleasant enough with a good deal to find out but then it was kind of lonesome you know besides i wanted to get somewhere  i hadnt shipped with the idea of cruising forever  first off i liked the delay because i judged i was going to fetch up in pretty warm quarters when i got through but towards the last i begun to feel that id rather go towell most any place so as to finish up the uncertainty  well one nightit was always night except when i was rushing by some star that was occupying the whole universe with its fire and its glarelight enough then of course but i necessarily left it behind in a minute or two and plunged into a solid week of darkness again  the stars aint so close together as they look to be where was i  oh yes one night i was sailing along when i discovered a tremendous long row of blinking lights away on the horizon ahead  as i approached they begun to tower and swell and look like mighty furnaces  says i to myself  by george ive arrived at lastand at the wrong place just as i expected  then i fainted  i dont know how long i was insensible but it must have been a good while for when i came to the darkness was all gone and there was the loveliest sunshine and the balmiest fragrantest air in its place  and there was such a marvellous world spread out before mesuch a glowing beautiful bewitching country  the things i took for furnaces were gates miles high made all of flashing jewels and they pierced a wall of solid gold that you couldnt see the top of nor yet the end of in either direction  i was pointed straight for one of these gates and a coming like a house afire  now i noticed that the skies were black with millions of people pointed for those gates  what a roar they made rushing through the air  the ground was as thick as ants with people toobillions of them i judge  i lit  i drifted up to a gate with a swarm of people and when it was my turn the head clerk says in a businesslike way  well quick  where are you from  san francisco says i  san franwhat says he  san francisco  he scratched his head and looked puzzled then he says  is it a planet  by george peters think of it  planet says i its a city and moreover its one of the biggest and finest and  there there says he no time here for conversation  we dont deal in cities here  where are you from in a general way  oh i says i beg your pardon  put me down for california  i had him again peters  he puzzled a second then he says sharp and irritable  i dont know any such planetis it a constellation  oh my goodness says i  constellation says you  noits a state  man we dont deal in states here  will you tell me where you are from in generalat large dont you understand  oh now i get your idea i says  im from americathe united states of america  peters do you know i had him again  if i hadnt im a clam  his face was as blank as a target after a militia shootingmatch  he turned to an under clerk and says  where is america  what is america  the under clerk answered up prompt and says  there aint any such orb  orb says i  why what are you talking about young man  it aint an orb its a country its a continent  columbus discovered it i reckon likely youve heard of him anyway americawhy sir america  silence says the head clerk  once for all whereareyou from  well says i i dont know anything more to sayunless i lump things and just say im from the world  ah says he brightening up now thats something like  what world  peters he had me that time  i looked at him puzzled he looked at me worried  then he burst out  come come what world  says i why the world of course  the world he says  hm theres billions of them    next  that meant for me to stand aside  i done so and a skyblue man with seven heads and only one leg hopped into my place  i took a walk  it just occurred to me then that all the myriads i had seen swarming to that gate up to this time were just like that creature  i tried to run across somebody i was acquainted with but they were out of acquaintances of mine just then  so i thought the thing all over and finally sidled back there pretty meek and feeling rather stumped as you may say  well said the head clerk  well sir i says pretty humble i dont seem to make out which world it is im from  but you may know it from thisits the one the saviour saved  he bent his head at the name  then he says gently  the worlds he has saved are like to the gates of heaven in number none can count them  what astronomical system is your world in perhaps that may assist  its the one that has the sun in itand the moonand marshe shook his head at each namehadnt ever heard of them you see and neptuneand uranusand jupiter  hold on says hehold on a minute  jupiter    jupiter    seems to me we had a man from there eight or nine hundred years agobut people from that system very seldom enter by this gate all of a sudden he begun to look me so straight in the eye that i thought he was going to bore through me  then he says very deliberate did you come straight here from your system  yes sir i saysbut i blushed the least little bit in the world when i said it  he looked at me very stern and says  that is not true and this is not the place for prevarication you wandered from your course  how did that happen  says i blushing again  im sorry and i take back what i said and confess  i raced a little with a comet one dayonly just the least little bitonly the tiniest lit  soso says heand without any sugar in his voice to speak of  i went on and says  but i only fell off just a bare point and i went right back on my course again the minute the race was over  no matterthat divergence has made all this trouble  it has brought you to a gate that is billions of leagues from the right one  if you had gone to your own gate they would have known all about your world at once and there would have been no delay  but we will try to accommodate you  he turned to an under clerk and says  what system is jupiter in  i dont remember sir but i think there is such a planet in one of the little new systems away out in one of the thinly worlded corners of the universe  i will see  he got a balloon and sailed up and up and up in front of a map that was as big as rhode island  he went on up till he was out of sight and by and by he came down and got something to eat and went up again  to cut a long story short he kept on doing this for a day or two and finally he came down and said he thought he had found that solar system but it might be flyspecks  so he got a microscope and went back  it turned out better than he feared  he had rousted out our system sure enough  he got me to describe our planet and its distance from the sun and then he says to his chief  oh i know the one he means now sir  it is on the map  it is called the wart  says i to myself young man it wouldnt be wholesome for you to go down there and call it the wart  well they let me in then and told me i was safe forever and wouldnt have any more trouble  then they turned from me and went on with their work the same as if they considered my case all complete and shipshape  i was a good deal surprised at this but i was diffident about speaking up and reminding them  i did so hate to do it you know it seemed a pity to bother them they had so much on their hands  twice i thought i would give up and let the thing go so twice i started to leave but immediately i thought what a figure i should cut stepping out amongst the redeemed in such a rig and that made me hang back and come to anchor again  people got to eying me clerks you knowwondering why i didnt get under way  i couldnt stand this longit was too uncomfortable  so at last i plucked up courage and tipped the head clerk a signal  he says  what you here yet  whats wanting  says i in a low voice and very confidential making a trumpet with my hands at his ear  i beg pardon and you mustnt mind my reminding you and seeming to meddle but haint you forgot something  he studied a second and says  forgot something    no not that i know of  think says i  he thought  then he says  no i cant seem to have forgot anything  what is it  look at me says i look me all over  he done it  well says he  well says i you dont notice anything  if i branched out amongst the elect looking like this wouldnt i attract considerable attentionwouldnt i be a little conspicuous  well he says i dont see anything the matter  what do you lack  lack  why i lack my harp and my wreath and my halo and my hymnbook and my palm branchi lack everything that a body naturally requires up here my friend  puzzled  peters he was the worst puzzled man you ever saw finally he says  well you seem to be a curiosity every way a body takes you  i never heard of these things before  i looked at the man awhile in solid astonishment then i says  now i hope you dont take it as an offence for i dont mean any but really for a man that has been in the kingdom as long as i reckon you have you do seem to know powerful little about its customs  its customs says he  heaven is a large place good friend large empires have many and diverse customs  even small dominions have as you doubtless know by what you have seen of the matter on a small scale in the wart  how can you imagine i could ever learn the varied customs of the countless kingdoms of heaven  it makes my head ache to think of it  i know the customs that prevail in those portions inhabited by peoples that are appointed to enter by my own gateand hark ye that is quite enough knowledge for one individual to try to pack into his head in the thirtyseven millions of years i have devoted night and day to that study  but the idea of learning the customs of the whole appalling expanse of heaveno man how insanely you talk  now i dont doubt that this odd costume you talk about is the fashion in that district of heaven you belong to but you wont be conspicuous in this section without it  i felt all right if that was the case so i bade him goodday and left  all day i walked towards the far end of a prodigious hall of the office hoping to come out into heaven any moment but it was a mistake  that hall was built on the general heavenly planit naturally couldnt be small  at last i got so tired i couldnt go any farther so i sat down to rest and begun to tackle the queerest sort of strangers and ask for information but i didnt get any they couldnt understand my language and i could not understand theirs  i got dreadfully lonesome  i was so down hearted and homesick i wished a hundred times i never had died  i turned back of course  about noon next day i got back at last and was on hand at the bookingoffice once more  says i to the head clerk  i begin to see that a mans got to be in his own heaven to be happy  perfectly correct says he  did you imagine the same heaven would suit all sorts of men  well i had that ideabut i see the foolishness of it  which way am i to go to get to my district  he called the under clerk that had examined the map and he gave me general directions  i thanked him and started but he says  wait a minute it is millions of leagues from here  go outside and stand on that red wishingcarpet shut your eyes hold your breath and wish yourself there  im much obliged says i why didnt you dart me through when i first arrived  we have a good deal to think of here it was your place to think of it and ask for it  goodby we probably shant see you in this region for a thousand centuries or so  in that case o revoor says i  i hopped onto the carpet and held my breath and shut my eyes and wished i was in the bookingoffice of my own section  the very next instant a voice i knew sung out in a business kind of a way  a harp and a hymnbook pair of wings and a halo size 13 for capn eli stormfield of san franciscomake him out a clean bill of health and let him in  i opened my eyes  sure enough it was a pi ute injun i used to know in tulare county mighty good fellowi remembered being at his funeral which consisted of him being burnt and the other injuns gauming their faces with his ashes and howling like wildcats  he was powerful glad to see me and you may make up your mind i was just as glad to see him and feel that i was in the right kind of a heaven at last  just as far as your eye could reach there was swarms of clerks running and bustling around tricking out thousands of yanks and mexicans and english and arabs and all sorts of people in their new outfits and when they gave me my kit and i put on my halo and took a look in the glass i could have jumped over a house for joy i was so happy  now this is something like says i  now says i im all rightshow me a cloud  inside of fifteen minutes i was a mile on my way towards the cloud banks and about a million people along with me  most of us tried to fly but some got crippled and nobody made a success of it  so we concluded to walk for the present till we had had some wing practice  we begun to meet swarms of folks who were coming back  some had harps and nothing else some had hymnbooks and nothing else some had nothing at all all of them looked meek and uncomfortable one young fellow hadnt anything left but his halo and he was carrying that in his hand all of a sudden he offered it to me and says  will you hold it for me a minute  then he disappeared in the crowd  i went on  a woman asked me to hold her palm branch and then she disappeared  a girl got me to hold her harp for her and by george she disappeared and so on and so on till i was about loaded down to the guards  then comes a smiling old gentleman and asked me to hold his things  i swabbed off the perspiration and says pretty tart  ill have to get you to excuse me my friendi aint no hat rack  about this time i begun to run across piles of those traps lying in the road  i just quietly dumped my extra cargo along with them i looked around and peters that whole nation that was following me were loaded down the same as id been  the return crowd had got them to hold their things a minute you see  they all dumped their loads too and we went on  when i found myself perched on a cloud with a million other people i never felt so good in my life  says i now this is according to the promises ive been having my doubts but now i am in heaven sure enough  i gave my palm branch a wave or two for luck and then i tautened up my harpstrings and struck in  well peters you cant imagine anything like the row we made  it was grand to listen to and made a body thrill all over but there was considerable many tunes going on at once and that was a drawback to the harmony you understand and then there was a lot of injun tribes and they kept up such another warwhooping that they kind of took the tuck out of the music  by and by i quit performing and judged id take a rest  there was quite a nice mild old gentleman sitting next me and i noticed he didnt take a hand i encouraged him but he said he was naturally bashful and was afraid to try before so many people  by and by the old gentleman said he never could seem to enjoy music somehow  the fact was i was beginning to feel the same way but i didnt say anything  him and i had a considerable long silence then but of course it warnt noticeable in that place  after about sixteen or seventeen hours during which i played and sung a little now and then always the same tune because i didnt know any otheri laid down my harp and begun to fan myself with my palm branch  then we both got to sighing pretty regular  finally says he  dont you know any tune but the one youve been pegging at all day  not another blessed one says i  dont you reckon you could learn another one says he  never says i ive tried to but i couldnt manage it  its a long time to hang to the oneeternity you know  dont break my heart says i im getting lowspirited enough already  after another long silence says he  are you glad to be here  says i old man ill be frank with you  this aint just as near my idea of bliss as i thought it was going to be when i used to go to church  says he what do you say to knocking off and calling it half a day  thats me says i  i never wanted to get off watch so bad in my life  so we started  millions were coming to the cloudbank all the time happy and hosannahing millions were leaving it all the time looking mighty quiet i tell you  we laid for the newcomers and pretty soon id got them to hold all my things a minute and then i was a free man again and most outrageously happy  just then i ran across old sam bartlett who had been dead a long time and stopped to have a talk with him  says i  now tell meis this to go on forever  aint there anything else for a change  says he  ill set you right on that point very quick  people take the figurative language of the bible and the allegories for literal and the first thing they ask for when they get here is a halo and a harp and so on  nothing thats harmless and reasonable is refused a body here if he asks it in the right spirit  so they are outfitted with these things without a word  they go and sing and play just about one day and thats the last youll ever see them in the choir  they dont need anybody to tell them that that sort of thing wouldnt make a heavenat least not a heaven that a sane man could stand a week and remain sane  that cloudbank is placed where the noise cant disturb the old inhabitants and so there aint any harm in letting everybody get up there and cure himself as soon as he comes  now you just remember thisheaven is as blissful and lovely as it can be but its just the busiest place you ever heard of  there aint any idle people here after the first day  singing hymns and waving palm branches through all eternity is pretty when you hear about it in the pulpit but its as poor a way to put in valuable time as a body could contrive  it would just make a heaven of warbling ignoramuses dont you see  eternal rest sounds comforting in the pulpit too  well you try it once and see how heavy time will hang on your hands  why stormfield a man like you that had been active and stirring all his life would go mad in six months in a heaven where he hadnt anything to do  heaven is the very last place to come to rest inand dont you be afraid to bet on that  says i  sam im as glad to hear it as i thought id be sorry  im glad i come now  says he  capn aint you pretty physically tired  says i  sam it aint any name for it  im dogtired  just sojust so  youve earned a good sleep and youll get it youve earned a good appetite and youll enjoy your dinner  its the same here as it is on earthyouve got to earn a thing square and honest before you enjoy it  you cant enjoy first and earn afterwards  but theres this difference here  you can choose your own occupation and all the powers of heaven will be put forth to help you make a success of it if you do your level best  the shoemaker on earth that had the soul of a poet in him wont have to make shoes here  now thats all reasonable and right says i  plenty of work and the kind you hanker after no more pain no more suffering  oh hold on theres plenty of pain herebut it dont kill theres plenty of suffering here but it dont last  you see happiness aint a thing in itselfits only a contrast with something that aint pleasant  thats all it is  there aint a thing you can mention that is happiness in its own selfits only so by contrast with the other thing  and so as soon as the novelty is over and the force of the contrast dulled it aint happiness any longer and you have to get something fresh  well theres plenty of pain and suffering in heavenconsequently theres plenty of contrasts and just no end of happiness  says i its the sensiblest heaven ive heard of yet sam though its about as different from the one i was brought up on as a live princess is different from her own wax figger   along in the first months i knocked around about the kingdom making friends and looking at the country and finally settled down in a pretty likely region to have a rest before taking another start  i went on making acquaintances and gathering up information  i had a good deal of talk with an old baldheaded angel by the name of sandy mcwilliams  he was from somewhere in new jersey  i went about with him considerable  we used to lay around warm afternoons in the shade of a rock on some meadow ground that was pretty high and out of the marshy slush of his cranberryfarm and there we used to talk about all kinds of things and smoke pipes  one day says i  about how old might you be sandy  seventytwo  i judged so  how long you been in heaven  twentyseven years come christmas  how old was you when you come up  why seventytwo of course  you cant mean it  why cant i mean it  because if you was seventytwo then you are naturally ninety nine now  no but i aint  i stay the same age i was when i come  well says i come to think theres something just here that i want to ask about  down below i always had an idea that in heaven we would all be young and bright and spry  well you can be young if you want to  youve only got to wish  well then why didnt you wish  i did  they all do  youll try it some day like enough but youll get tired of the change pretty soon  why  well ill tell you  now youve always been a sailor did you ever try some other business  yes i tried keeping grocery once up in the mines but i couldnt stand it it was too dullno stir no storm no life about it it was like being part dead and part alive both at the same time  i wanted to be one thing or tother  i shut up shop pretty quick and went to sea  thats it  grocery people like it but you couldnt  you see you wasnt used to it  well i wasnt used to being young and i couldnt seem to take any interest in it  i was strong and handsome and had curly hairyes and wings toogay wings like a butterfly  i went to picnics and dances and parties with the fellows and tried to carry on and talk nonsense with the girls but it wasnt any use i couldnt take to itfact is it was an awful bore  what i wanted was early to bed and early to rise and something to do and when my work was done i wanted to sit quiet and smoke and thinknot tear around with a parcel of giddy young kids  you cant think what i suffered whilst i was young  how long was you young  only two weeks  that was plenty for me  laws i was so lonesome you see i was full of the knowledge and experience of seventytwo years the deepest subject those young folks could strike was only abc to me  and to hear them argueoh my it would have been funny if it hadnt been so pitiful  well i was so hungry for the ways and the sober talk i was used to that i tried to ring in with the old people but they wouldnt have it  they considered me a conceited young upstart and gave me the cold shoulder  two weeks was aplenty for me  i was glad to get back my bald head again and my pipe and my old drowsy reflections in the shade of a rock or a tree  well says i do you mean to say youre going to stand still at seventytwo forever  i dont know and i aint particular  but i aint going to drop back to twentyfive any morei know that mighty well  i know a sight more than i did twentyseven years ago and i enjoy learning all the time but i dont seem to get any older  that is bodily my mind gets older and stronger and better seasoned and more satisfactory  says i if a man comes here at ninety dont he ever set himself back  of course he does  he sets himself back to fourteen tries it a couple of hours and feels like a fool sets himself forward to twenty it aint much improvement tries thirty fifty eighty and finally ninetyfinds he is more at home and comfortable at the same old figure he is used to than any other way  or if his mind begun to fail him on earth at eighty thats where he finally sticks up here  he sticks at the place where his mind was last at its best for theres where his enjoyment is best and his ways most set and established  does a chap of twentyfive stay always twentyfive and look it  if he is a fool yes  but if he is bright and ambitious and industrious the knowledge he gains and the experiences he has change his ways and thoughts and likings and make him find his best pleasure in the company of people above that age so he allows his body to take on that look of as many added years as he needs to make him comfortable and proper in that sort of society he lets his body go on taking the look of age according as he progresses and by and by he will be bald and wrinkled outside and wise and deep within  babies the same  babies the same  laws what asses we used to be on earth about these things  we said wed be always young in heaven  we didnt say how youngwe didnt think of that perhapsthat is we didnt all think alike anyway  when i was a boy of seven i suppose i thought wed all be twelve in heaven when i was twelve i suppose i thought wed all be eighteen or twenty in heaven when i was forty i begun to go back i remember i hoped wed all be about thirty years old in heaven  neither a man nor a boy ever thinks the age he has is exactly the best onehe puts the right age a few years older or a few years younger than he is  then he makes that ideal age the general age of the heavenly people  and he expects everybody to stick at that agestand stockstilland expects them to enjoy itnow just think of the idea of standing still in heaven  think of a heaven made up entirely of hooprolling marbleplaying cubs of seven yearsor of awkward diffident sentimental immaturities of nineteenor of vigorous people of thirty healthyminded brimming with ambition but chained hand and foot to that one age and its limitations like so many helpless galleyslaves  think of the dull sameness of a society made up of people all of one age and one set of looks habits tastes and feelings  think how superior to it earth would be with its variety of types and faces and ages and the enlivening attrition of the myriad interests that come into pleasant collision in such a variegated society  look here says i do you know what youre doing  well what am i doing  you are making heaven pretty comfortable in one way but you are playing the mischief with it in another  how dyou mean  well i says take a young mother thats lost her child and  sh he says  look  it was a woman  middleaged and had grizzled hair  she was walking slow and her head was bent down and her wings hanging limp and droopy and she looked ever so tired and was crying poor thing  she passed along by with her head down that way and the tears running down her face and didnt see us  then sandy said low and gentle and full of pity  shes hunting for her child  no found it i reckon  lord how shes changed  but i recognized her in a minute though its twentyseven years since i saw her  a young mother she was about twenty two or four or along there and blooming and lovely and sweet oh just a flower  and all her heart and all her soul was wrapped up in her child her little girl two years old  and it died and she went wild with grief just wild  well the only comfort she had was that shed see her child again in heaven never more to part she said and kept on saying it over and over never more to part  and the words made her happy yes they did they made her joyful and when i was dying twentyseven years ago she told me to find her child the first thing and say she was comingsoon soon very soon she hoped and believed  why its pitiful sandy  he didnt say anything for a while but sat looking at the ground thinking  then he says kind of mournful  and now shes come  well  go on  stormfield maybe she hasnt found the child but i think she has  looks so to me  ive seen cases before  you see shes kept that child in her head just the same as it was when she jounced it in her arms a little chubby thing  but here it didnt elect to stay a child  no it elected to grow up which it did  and in these twentyseven years it has learned all the deep scientific learning there is to learn and is studying and studying and learning and learning more and more all the time and dont give a damn for anything but learning just learning and discussing gigantic problems with people like herself  well  stormfield dont you see  her mother knows cranberries and how to tend them and pick them and put them up and market them and not another blamed thing  her and her daughter cant be any more company for each other now than mud turtle and bird o paradise poor thing she was looking for a baby to jounce i think shes struck a disappintment  sandy what will they dostay unhappy forever in heaven  no theyll come together and get adjusted by and by  but not this year and not next  by and by    chapter ii    i had been having considerable trouble with my wings  the day after i helped the choir i made a dash or two with them but was not lucky  first off i flew thirty yards and then fouled an irishman and brought him downbrought us both down in fact next i had a collision with a bishopand bowled him down of course  we had some sharp words and i felt pretty cheap to come banging into a grave old person like that with a million strangers looking on and smiling to themselves  i saw i hadnt got the hang of the steering and so couldnt rightly tell where i was going to bring up when i started  i went afoot the rest of the day and let my wings hang  early next morning i went to a private place to have some practice  i got up on a pretty high rock and got a good start and went swooping down aiming for a bush a little over three hundred yards off but i couldnt seem to calculate for the wind which was about two points abaft my beam  i could see i was going considerable to looard of the bush so i worked my starboard wing slow and went ahead strong on the port one but it wouldnt answer i could see i was going to broach to so i slowed down on both and lit  i went back to the rock and took another chance at it  i aimed two or three points to starboard of the bushyes more than thatenough so as to make it nearly a headwind  i done well enough but made pretty poor time  i could see plain enough that on a headwind wings was a mistake  i could see that a body could sail pretty close to the wind but he couldnt go in the winds eye  i could see that if i wanted to go avisiting any distance from home and the wind was ahead i might have to wait days maybe for a change and i could see too that these things could not be any use at all in a gale if you tried to run before the wind you would make a mess of it for there isnt anyway to shorten saillike reefing you knowyou have to take it all inshut your feathers down flat to your sides  that would land you of course  you could lay to with your head to the windthat is the best you could do and right hard work youd find it too  if you tried any other game you would founder sure  i judge it was about a couple of weeks or so after this that i dropped old sandy mcwilliams a note one dayit was a tuesdayand asked him to come over and take his manna and quails with me next day and the first thing he did when he stepped in was to twinkle his eye in a sly way and say  well cap what you done with your wings  i saw in a minute that there was some sarcasm done up in that rag somewheres but i never let on  i only says  gone to the wash  yes he says in a dry sort of way they mostly go to the wash about this timeive often noticed it  fresh angels are powerful neat  when do you look for em back  day after tomorrow says i  he winked at me and smiled  says i  sandy out with it  comeno secrets among friends  i notice you dont ever wear wingsand plenty others dont  ive been making an ass of myselfis that it  that is about the size of it  but it is no harm  we all do it at first  its perfectly natural  you see on earth we jump to such foolish conclusions as to things up here  in the pictures we always saw the angels with wings onand that was all right but we jumped to the conclusion that that was their way of getting around and that was all wrong  the wings aint anything but a uniform thats all  when they are in the fieldso to speakthey always wear them you never see an angel going with a message anywhere without his wings any more than you would see a military officer presiding at a courtmartial without his uniform or a postman delivering letters or a policeman walking his beat in plain clothes  but they aint to fly with  the wings are for show not for use  old experienced angels are like officers of the regular armythey dress plain when they are off duty  new angels are like the militianever shed the uniformalways fluttering and floundering around in their wings butting people down flapping here and there and everywhere always imagining they are attracting the admiring eyewell they just think they are the very most important people in heaven  and when you see one of them come sailing around with one wing tipped up and tother down you make up your mind he is saying to himself  i wish mary ann in arkansaw could see me now  i reckon shed wish she hadnt shook me  no theyre just for show thats allonly just for show  i judge youve got it about right sandy says i  why look at it yourself says he  you aint built for wings no man is  you know what a grist of years it took you to come here from the earthand yet you were booming along faster than any cannonball could go  suppose you had to fly that distance with your wingswouldnt eternity have been over before you got here certainly  well angels have to go to the earth every day millions of themto appear in visions to dying children and good people you knowits the heft of their business  they appear with their wings of course because they are on official service and because the dying persons wouldnt know they were angels if they hadnt wingsbut do you reckon they fly with them  it stands to reason they dont  the wings would wear out before they got halfway even the pinfeathers would be gone the wing frames would be as bare as kite sticks before the paper is pasted on  the distances in heaven are billions of times greater angels have to go all over heaven every day could they do it with their wings alone  no indeed they wear the wings for style but they travel any distance in an instant by wishing  the wishingcarpet of the arabian nights was a sensible ideabut our earthly idea of angels flying these awful distances with their clumsy wings was foolish  our young saints of both sexes wear wings all the timeblazing red ones and blue and green and gold and variegated and rainbowed and ringstreakedandstriped onesand nobody finds fault  it is suitable to their time of life  the things are beautiful and they set the young people off  they are the most striking and lovely part of their outfita halo dont begin  well says i ive tucked mine away in the cupboard and i allow to let them lay there till theres mud  yesor a reception  whats that  well you can see one tonight if you want to  theres a barkeeper from jersey city going to be received  go ontell me about it  this barkeeper got converted at a moody and sankey meeting in new york and started home on the ferryboat and there was a collision and he got drowned  he is of a class that think all heaven goes wild with joy when a particularly hard lot like him is saved they think all heaven turns out hosannahing to welcome them they think there isnt anything talked about in the realms of the blest but their case for that day  this barkeeper thinks there hasnt been such another stir here in years as his coming is going to raise and ive always noticed this peculiarity about a dead barkeeperhe not only expects all hands to turn out when he arrives but he expects to be received with a torchlight procession  i reckon he is disappointed then  no he isnt  no man is allowed to be disappointed here whatever he wants when he comesthat is any reasonable and unsacrilegious thinghe can have  theres always a few millions or billions of young folks around who dont want any better entertainment than to fill up their lungs and swarm out with their torches and have a high time over a barkeeper  it tickles the barkeeper till he cant rest it makes a charming lark for the young folks it dont do anybody any harm it dont cost a rap and it keeps up the places reputation for making all comers happy and content  very good  ill be on hand and see them land the barkeeper  it is manners to go in full dress  you want to wear your wings you know and your other things  which ones  halo and harp and palm branch and all that  well says i i reckon i ought to be ashamed of myself but the fact is i left them laying around that day i resigned from the choir  i havent got a rag to wear but this robe and the wings  thats all right  youll find theyve been raked up and saved for you  send for them  ill do it sandy  but what was it you was saying about unsacrilegious things which people expect to get and will be disappointed about  oh there are a lot of such things that people expect and dont get  for instance theres a brooklyn preacher by the name of talmage who is laying up a considerable disappointment for himself  he says every now and then in his sermons that the first thing he does when he gets to heaven will be to fling his arms around abraham isaac and jacob and kiss them and weep on them  theres millions of people down there on earth that are promising themselves the same thing  as many as sixty thousand people arrive here every single day that want to run straight to abraham isaac and jacob and hug them and weep on them  now mind you sixty thousand a day is a pretty heavy contract for those old people  if they were a mind to allow it they wouldnt ever have anything to do year in and year out but stand up and be hugged and wept on thirtytwo hours in the twentyfour  they would be tired out and as wet as muskrats all the time  what would heaven be to them  it would be a mighty good place to get out ofyou know that yourself  those are kind and gentle old jews but they aint any fonder of kissing the emotional highlights of brooklyn than you be  you mark my words mr ts endearments are going to be declined with thanks  there are limits to the privileges of the elect even in heaven  why if adam was to show himself to every new comer that wants to call and gaze at him and strike him for his autograph he would never have time to do anything else but just that  talmage has said he is going to give adam some of his attentions as well as a i and j  but he will have to change his mind about that  do you think talmage will really come here  why certainly he will but dont you be alarmed he will run with his own kind and theres plenty of them  that is the main charm of heaventheres all kinds herewhich wouldnt be the case if you let the preachers tell it  anybody can find the sort he prefers here and he just lets the others alone and they let him alone  when the deity builds a heaven it is built right and on a liberal plan  sandy sent home for his things and i sent for mine and about nine in the evening we begun to dress  sandy says  this is going to be a grand time for you stormy  like as not some of the patriarchs will turn out  no but will they  like as not  of course they are pretty exclusive  they hardly ever show themselves to the common public  i believe they never turn out except for an eleventhhour convert  they wouldnt do it then only earthly tradition makes a grand show pretty necessary on that kind of an occasion  do they an turn out sandy  whoall the patriarchs  oh nohardly ever more than a couple you will be here fifty thousand yearsmaybe morebefore you get a glimpse of all the patriarchs and prophets  since i have been here job has been to the front once and once ham and jeremiah both at the same time  but the finest thing that has happened in my day was a year or so ago that was charles peaces reception him they called the bannercross murdereran englishman  there were four patriarchs and two prophets on the grand stand that time there hasnt been anything like it since captain kidd came abel was therethe first time in twelve hundred years  a report got around that adam was coming well of course abel was enough to bring a crowd all by himself but there is nobody that can draw like adam  it was a false report but it got around anyway as i say and it will be a long day before i see the like of it again the reception was in the english department of course which is eight hundred and eleven million miles from the new jersey line  i went along with a good many of my neighbors and it was a sight to see i can tell you  flocks came from all the departments  i saw esquimaux there and tartars negroes chinamenpeople from everywhere  you see a mixture like that in the grand choir the first day you land here but you hardly ever see it again  there were billions of people when they were singing or hosannahing the noise was wonderful and even when their tongues were still the drumming of the wings was nearly enough to burst your head for all the sky was as thick as if it was snowing angels  although adam was not there it was a great time anyway because we had three archangels on the grand standit is a seldom thing that even one comes out  what did they look like sandy  well they had shining faces and shining robes and wonderful rainbow wings and they stood eighteen feet high and wore swords and held their heads up in a noble way and looked like soldiers  did they have halos  noanyway not the hoop kind  the archangels and the upperclass patriarchs wear a finer thing than that  it is a round solid splendid glory of gold that is blinding to look at  you have often seen a patriarch in a picture on earth with that thing on you remember ithe looks as if he had his head in a brass platter  that dont give you the right idea of it at allit is much more shining and beautiful  did you talk with those archangels and patriarchs sandy  whoi  why what can you be thinking about stormy  i aint worthy to speak to such as they  is talmage  of course not  you have got the same mixedup idea about these things that everybody has down there  i had it once but i got over it  down there they talk of the heavenly kingand that is rightbut then they go right on speaking as if this was a republic and everybody was on a dead level with everybody else and privileged to fling his arms around anybody he comes across and be hailfellowwellmet with all the elect from the highest down how tangled up and absurd that is  how are you going to have a republic under a king  how are you going to have a republic at all where the head of the government is absolute holds his place forever and has no parliament no council to meddle or make in his affairs nobody voted for nobody elected nobody in the whole universe with a voice in the government nobody asked to take a hand in its matters and nobody allowed to do it  fine republic aint it  well yesit is a little different from the idea i hadbut i thought i might go around and get acquainted with the grandees anywaynot exactly splice the mainbrace with them you know but shake hands and pass the time of day  could tom dick and harry call on the cabinet of russia and do thaton prince gortschakoff for instance  i reckon not sandy  well this is russiaonly more so  theres not the shadow of a republic about it anywhere  there are ranks here  there are viceroys princes governors subgovernors subsubgovernors and a hundred orders of nobility grading along down from grandducal archangels stage by stage till the general level is struck where there aint any titles  do you know what a prince of the blood is on earth  no  well a prince of the blood dont belong to the royal family exactly and he dont belong to the mere nobility of the kingdom he is lower than the one and higher than tother  thats about the position of the patriarchs and prophets here  theres some mighty high nobility herepeople that you and i aint worthy to polish sandals forand they aint worthy to polish sandals for the patriarchs and prophets  that gives you a kind of an idea of their rank dont it  you begin to see how high up they are dont you just to get a twominute glimpse of one of them is a thing for a body to remember and tell about for a thousand years  why captain just think of this  if abraham was to set his foot down here by this door there would be a railing set up around that foottrack right away and a shelter put over it and people would flock here from all over heaven for hundreds and hundreds of years to look at it  abraham is one of the parties that mr talmage of brooklyn is going to embrace and kiss and weep on when he comes  he wants to lay in a good stock of tears you know or five to one he will go dry before he gets a chance to do it  sandy says i i had an idea that i was going to be equals with everybody here too but i will let that drop  it dont matter and i am plenty happy enough anyway  captain you are happier than you would be the other way  these old patriarchs and prophets have got ages the start of you they know more in two minutes than you know in a year  did you ever try to have a sociable improvingtime discussing winds and currents and variations of compass with an undertaker  i get your idea sandy  he couldnt interest me  he would be an ignoramus in such thingshe would bore me and i would bore him  you have got it  you would bore the patriarchs when you talked and when they talked they would shoot over your head  by and by you would say good morning your eminence i will call again but you wouldnt  did you ever ask the slushboy to come up in the cabin and take dinner with you  i get your drift again sandy  i wouldnt be used to such grand people as the patriarchs and prophets and i would be sheepish and tonguetied in their company and mighty glad to get out of it sandy which is the highest rank patriarch or prophet  oh the prophets hold over the patriarchs  the newest prophet even is of a sight more consequence than the oldest patriarch yes sir adam himself has to walk behind shakespeare  was shakespeare a prophet  of course he was and so was homer and heaps more  but shakespeare and the rest have to walk behind a common tailor from tennessee by the name of billings and behind a horsedoctor named sakka from afghanistan  jeremiah and billings and buddha walk together side by side right behind a crowd from planets not in our astronomy next come a dozen or two from jupiter and other worlds next come daniel and sakka and confucius next a lot from systems outside of ours next come ezekiel and mahomet zoroaster and a knifegrinder from ancient egypt then there is a long string and after them away down toward the bottom come shakespeare and homer and a shoemaker named marais from the back settlements of france  have they really rung in mahomet and all those other heathens  yesthey all had their message and they all get their reward the man who dont get his reward on earth neednt botherhe will get it here sure  but why did they throw off on shakespeare that way and put him away down there below those shoemakers and horsedoctors and knifegrindersa lot of people nobody ever heard of  that is the heavenly justice of itthey warnt rewarded according to their deserts on earth but here they get their rightful rank that tailor billings from tennessee wrote poetry that homer and shakespeare couldnt begin to come up to but nobody would print it nobody read it but his neighbors an ignorant lot and they laughed at it  whenever the village had a drunken frolic and a dance they would drag him in and crown him with cabbage leaves and pretend to bow down to him and one night when he was sick and nearly starved to death they had him out and crowned him and then they rode him on a rail about the village and everybody followed along beating tin pans and yelling  well he died before morning he wasnt ever expecting to go to heaven much less that there was going to be any fuss made over him so i reckon he was a good deal surprised when the reception broke on him  was you there sandy  bless you no  why  didnt you know it was going to come off  well i judge i did  it was the talk of these realmsnot for a day like this barkeeper business but for twenty years before the man died  why the mischief didnt you go then  now how you talk  the like of me go meddling around at the reception of a prophet  a mudsill like me trying to push in and help receive an awful grandee like edward j billings  why i should have been laughed at for a billion miles around  i shouldnt ever heard the last of it  well who did go then  mighty few people that you and i will ever get a chance to see captain  not a solitary commoner ever has the luck to see a reception of a prophet i can tell you  all the nobility and all the patriarchs and prophetsevery last one of themand all the archangels and all the princes and governors and viceroys were thereand no small frynot a single one  and mind you im not talking about only the grandees from our world but the princes and patriarchs and so on from all the worlds that shine in our sky and from billions more that belong in systems upon systems away outside of the one our sun is in  there were some prophets and patriarchs there that ours aint a circumstance to for rank and illustriousness and all that  some were from jupiter and other worlds in our own system but the most celebrated were three poets saa bo and soof from great planets in three different and very remote systems  these three names are common and familiar in every nook and corner of heaven clear from one end of it to the other fully as well known as the eighty supreme archangels in fact where as our moses and adam and the rest have not been heard of outside of our worlds little corner of heaven except by a few very learned men scattered here and thereand they always spell their names wrong and get the performances of one mixed up with the doings of another and they almost always locate them simply in our solar system and think that is enough without going into little details such as naming the particular world they are from it is like a learned hindoo showing off how much he knows by saying longfellow lives in the united statesas if he lived all over the united states and as if the country was so small you couldnt throw a brick there without hitting him  between you and me it does gravel me the cool way people from those monster worlds outside our system snub our little world and even our system  of course we think a good deal of jupiter because our world is only a potato to it for size but then there are worlds in other systems that jupiter isnt even a mustardseed tolike the planet goobra for instance which you couldnt squeeze inside the orbit of halleys comet without straining the rivets  tourists from goobra i mean parties that lived and died therenatives come here now and then and inquire about our world and when they find out it is so little that a streak of lightning can flash clear around it in the eighth of a second they have to lean up against something to laugh  then they screw a glass into their eye and go to examining us as if we were a curious kind of foreign bug or something of that sort  one of them asked me how long our day was and when i told him it was twelve hours long as a general thing he asked me if people where i was from considered it worth while to get up and wash for such a day as that  that is the way with those goobra peoplethey cant seem to let a chance go by to throw it in your face that their day is three hundred and twentytwo of our years long  this young snob was just of agehe was six or seven thousand of his days oldsay two million of our yearsand he had all the puppy airs that belong to that time of lifethat turning point when a person has got over being a boy and yet aint quite a man exactly  if it had been anywhere else but in heaven i would have given him a piece of my mind  well anyway billings had the grandest reception that has been seen in thousands of centuries and i think it will have a good effect  his name will be carried pretty far and it will make our system talked about and maybe our world too and raise us in the respect of the general public of heaven  why look hereshakespeare walked backwards before that tailor from tennessee and scattered flowers for him to walk on and homer stood behind his chair and waited on him at the banquet of course that didnt go for much there amongst all those big foreigners from other systems as they hadnt heard of shakespeare or homer either but it would amount to considerable down there on our little earth if they could know about it  i wish there was something in that miserable spiritualism so we could send them word  that tennessee village would set up a monument to billings then and his autograph would outsell satans  well they had grand times at that receptiona smallfry noble from hoboken told me all about itsir richard duffer baronet  what sandy a nobleman from hoboken  how is that  easy enough  duffer kept a sausageshop and never saved a cent in his life because he used to give all his spare meat to the poor in a quiet way  not trampsno the other sortthe sort that will starve before they will beghonest square people out of work dick used to watch hungrylooking men and women and children and track them home and find out all about them from the neighbors and then feed them and find them work  as nobody ever saw him give anything to anybody he had the reputation of being mean he died with it too and everybody said it was a good riddance but the minute he landed here they made him a baronet and the very first words dick the sausagemaker of hoboken heard when he stepped upon the heavenly shore were welcome sir richard duffer  it surprised him some because he thought he had reasons to believe he was pointed for a warmer climate than this one   all of a sudden the whole region fairly rocked under the crash of eleven hundred and one thunder blasts all let off at once and sandy says  there thats for the barkeep  i jumped up and says  then lets be moving along sandy we dont want to miss any of this thing you know  keep your seat he says he is only just telegraphed that is all  how  that blast only means that he has been sighted from the signal station  he is off sandy hook  the committees will go down to meet him now and escort him in  there will be ceremonies and delays they wont he coming up the bay for a considerable time yet  it is several billion miles away anyway  i could have been a barkeeper and a hard lot just as well as not says i remembering the lonesome way i arrived and how there wasnt any committee nor anything  i notice some regret in your voice says sandy and it is natural enough but let bygones be bygones you went according to your lights and it is too late now to mend the thing  no let it slide sandy i dont mind  but youve got a sandy hook here too have you  weve got everything here just as it is below  all the states and territories of the union and all the kingdoms of the earth and the islands of the sea are laid out here just as they are on the globeall the same shape they are down there and all graded to the relative size only each state and realm and island is a good many billion times bigger here than it is below  there goes another blast  what is that one for  that is only another fort answering the first one  they each fire eleven hundred and one thunder blasts at a single dashit is the usual salute for an eleventhhour guest a hundred for each hour and an extra one for the guests sex if it was a woman we would know it by their leaving off the extra gun  how do we know theres eleven hundred and one sandy when they all go off at onceand yet we certainly do know  our intellects are a good deal sharpened up here in some ways and that is one of them  numbers and sizes and distances are so great here that we have to be made so we can feel themour old ways of counting and measuring and ciphering wouldnt ever give us an idea of them but would only confuse us and oppress us and make our heads ache  after some more talk about this i says  sandy i notice that i hardly ever see a white angel where i run across one white angel i strike as many as a hundred million coppercolored onespeople that cant speak english  how is that  well you will find it the same in any state or territory of the american corner of heaven you choose to go to  i have shot along a whole week on a stretch and gone millions and millions of miles through perfect swarms of angels without ever seeing a single white one or hearing a word i could understand  you see america was occupied a billion years and more by injuns and aztecs and that sort of folks before a white man ever set his foot in it during the first three hundred years after columbuss discovery there wasnt ever more than one good lecture audience of white people all put together in americai mean the whole thing british possessions and all in the beginning of our century there were only 6000000 or 7000000say seven 12000000 or 14000000 in 1825 say 23000000 in 1850 40000000 in 1875 our deathrate has always been 20 in 1000 per annum  well 140000 died the first year of the century 280000 the twentyfifth year 500000 the fiftieth year about a million the seventyfifth year now i am going to be liberal about this thing and consider that fifty million whites have died in america from the beginning up to todaymake it sixty if you want to make it a hundred million its no difference about a few millions one way or tother  well now you can see yourself that when you come to spread a little dab of people like that over these hundreds of billions of miles of american territory here in heaven it is like scattering a tencent box of homoeopathic pills over the great sahara and expecting to find them again  you cant expect us to amount to anything in heaven and we dontnow that is the simple fact and we have got to do the best we can with it  the learned men from other planets and other systems come here and hang around a while when they are touring around the kingdom and then go back to their own section of heaven and write a book of travels and they give america about five lines in it  and what do they say about us  they say this wilderness is populated with a scattering few hundred thousand billions of red angels with now and then a curiously complected diseased one  you see they think we whites and the occasional nigger are injuns that have been bleached out or blackened by some leprous disease or otherfor some peculiarly rascally sin mind you  it is a mighty sour pill for us all my friendeven the modestest of us let alone the other kind that think they are going to be received like a longlost government bond and hug abraham into the bargain  i havent asked you any of the particulars captain but i judge it goes without sayingif my experience is worth anythingthat there wasnt much of a hooraw made over you when you arrivednow was there  dont mention it sandy says i coloring up a little i wouldnt have had the family see it for any amount you are a mind to name  change the subject sandy change the subject  well do you think of settling in the california department of bliss  i dont know  i wasnt calculating on doing anything really definite in that direction till the family come  i thought i would just look around meantime in a quiet way and make up my mind besides i know a good many dead people and i was calculating to hunt them up and swap a little gossip with them about friends and old times and one thing or another and ask them how they like it here as far as they have got  i reckon my wife will want to camp in the california range though because most all her departed will be there and she likes to be with folks she knows  dont you let her  you see what the jersey district of heaven is for whites well the californian district is a thousand times worse  it swarms with a mean kind of leatherheaded mudcolored angelsand your nearest white neighbor is likely to be a million miles away  what a man mostly misses in heaven is company company of his own sort and color and language  i have come near settling in the european part of heaven once or twice on that account  well why didnt you sandy  oh various reasons  for one thing although you see plenty of whites there you cant understand any of them hardly and so you go about as hungry for talk as you do here  i like to look at a russian or a german or an italiani even like to look at a frenchman if i ever have the luck to catch him engaged in anything that aint indelicatebut looking dont cure the hungerwhat you want is talk  well theres england sandythe english district of heaven  yes but it is not so very much better than this end of the heavenly domain  as long as you run across englishmen born this side of three hundred years ago you are all right but the minute you get back of elizabeths time the language begins to fog up and the further back you go the foggier it gets  i had some talk with one langland and a man by the name of chauceroldtime poetsbut it was no use i couldnt quite understand them and they couldnt quite understand me  i have had letters from them since but it is such broken english i cant make it out  back of those mens time the english are just simply foreigners nothing more nothing less they talk danish german norman french and sometimes a mixture of all three back of them they talk latin and ancient british irish and gaelic and then back of these come billions and billions of pure savages that talk a gibberish that satan himself couldnt understand  the fact is where you strike one man in the english settlements that you can understand you wade through awful swarms that talk something you cant make head nor tail of  you see every country on earth has been overlaid so often in the course of a billion years with different kinds of people and different sorts of languages that this sort of mongrel business was bound to be the result in heaven  sandy says i did you see a good many of the great people history tells about  yesplenty  i saw kings and all sorts of distinguished people  do the kings rank just as they did below  no a body cant bring his rank up here with him  divine right is a goodenough earthly romance but it dont go here  kings drop down to the general level as soon as they reach the realms of grace  i knew charles the second very wellone of the most popular comedians in the english sectiondraws first rate  there are better of coursepeople that were never heard of on earth but charles is making a very good reputation indeed and is considered a rising man  richard the lionhearted is in the prize ring and coming into considerable favor  henry the eighth is a tragedian and the scenes where he kills people are done to the very life  henry the sixth keeps a religiousbook stand  did you ever see napoleon sandy  oftensometimes in the corsican range sometimes in the french he always hunts up a conspicuous place and goes frowning around with his arms folded and his fieldglass under his arm looking as grand gloomy and peculiar as his reputation calls for and very much bothered because he dont stand as high here for a soldier as he expected to  why who stands higher  oh a lot of people we never heard of beforethe shoemaker and horsedoctor and knifegrinder kind you knowclodhoppers from goodness knows where that never handled a sword or fired a shot in their livesbut the soldiership was in them though they never had a chance to show it  but here they take their right place and caesar and napoleon and alexander have to take a back seat  the greatest military genius our world ever produced was a bricklayer from somewhere back of bostondied during the revolutionby the name of absalom jones  wherever he goes crowds flock to see him you see everybody knows that if he had had a chance he would have shown the world some generalship that would have made all generalship before look like childs play and prentice work  but he never got a chance he tried heaps of times to enlist as a private but he had lost both thumbs and a couple of front teeth and the recruiting sergeant wouldnt pass him  however as i say everybody knows now what he would have beenand so they flock by the million to get a glimpse of him whenever they hear he is going to be anywhere  caesar and hannibal and alexander and napoleon are all on his staff and ever so many more great generals but the public hardly care to look at them when he is around  boom  there goes another salute  the barkeepers off quarantine now   sandy and i put on our things  then we made a wish and in a second we were at the receptionplace  we stood on the edge of the ocean of space and looked out over the dimness but couldnt make out anything  close by us was the grand standtier on tier of dim thrones rising up toward the zenith  from each side of it spread away the tiers of seats for the general public  they spread away for leagues and leaguesyou couldnt see the ends  they were empty and still and hadnt a cheerful look but looked dreary like a theatre before anybody comesgas turned down  sandy says   well sit down here and wait  well see the head of the procession come in sight away off yonder pretty soon now  says i  its pretty lonesome sandy i reckon theres a hitch somewheres nobody but just you and meit aint much of a display for the barkeeper  dont you fret its all right  therell be one more gunfire then youll see  in a little while we noticed a sort of a lightish flush away off on the horizon  head of the torchlight procession says sandy  it spread and got lighter and brighter  soon it had a strong glare like a locomotive headlight it kept on getting brighter and brighter till it was like the sun peeping above the horizonline at seathe big red rays shot high up into the sky  keep your eyes on the grand stand and the miles of seatssharp says sandy and listen for the gunfire  just then it burst out boomboomboom like a million thunderstorms in one and made the whole heavens rock  then there was a sudden and awful glare of light all about us and in that very instant every one of the millions of seats was occupied and as far as you could see in both directions was just a solid pack of people and the place was all splendidly lit up  it was enough to take a bodys breath away  sandy says  that is the way we do it here  no time fooled away nobody straggling in after the curtains up  wishing is quicker work than travelling  a quarter of a second ago these folks were millions of miles from here  when they heard the last signal all they had to do was to wish and here they are  the prodigious choir struck up   we long to hear thy voice to see thee face to face   it was noble music but the uneducated chipped in and spoilt it just as the congregations used to do on earth  the head of the procession began to pass now and it was a wonderful sight  it swept along thick and solid five hundred thousand angels abreast and every angel carrying a torch and singingthe whirring thunder of the wings made a bodys head ache you could follow the line of the procession back and slanting upward into the sky far away in a glittering snaky rope till it was only a faint streak in the distance  the rush went on and on for a long time and at last sure enough along comes the barkeeper and then everybody rose and a cheer went up that made the heavens shake i tell you  he was all smiles and had his halo tilted over one ear in a cocky way and was the most satisfied looking saint i ever saw  while he marched up the steps of the grand stand the choir struck up   the whole wide heaven groans and waits to hear that voice   there were four gorgeous tents standing side by side in the place of honor on a broad railed platform in the centre of the grand stand with a shining guard of honor round about them  the tents had been shut up all this time  as the barkeeper climbed along up bowing and smiling to everybody and at last got to the platform these tents were jerked up aloft all of a sudden and we saw four noble thrones of gold all caked with jewels and in the two middle ones sat old whitewhiskered men and in the two others a couple of the most glorious and gaudy giants with platter halos and beautiful armor  all the millions went down on their knees and stared and looked glad and burst out into a joyful kind of murmurs  they said  two archangelsthat is splendid  who can the others be  the archangels gave the barkeeper a stiff little military bow the two old men rose one of them said moses and esau welcome thee and then all the four vanished and the thrones were empty  the barkeeper looked a little disappointed for he was calculating to hug those old people i judge but it was the gladdest and proudest multitude you ever sawbecause they had seen moses and esau  everybody was saying did you see themi didesaus side face was to me but i saw moses full in the face just as plain as i see you this minute  the procession took up the barkeeper and moved on with him again and the crowd broke up and scattered  as we went along home sandy said it was a great success and the barkeeper would have a right to be proud of it forever  and he said we were in luck too said we might attend receptions for forty thousand years to come and not have a chance to see a brace of such grand moguls as moses and esau  we found afterwards that we had come near seeing another patriarch and likewise a genuine prophet besides but at the last moment they sent regrets  sandy said there would be a monument put up there where moses and esau had stood with the date and circumstances and all about the whole business and travellers would come for thousands of years and gawk at it and climb over it and scribble their names on it    footnotes  1  the captain could not remember what this word was  he said it was in a foreign tongue
