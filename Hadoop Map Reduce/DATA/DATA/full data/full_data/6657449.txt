muttered rising to his feet if only i can do it  let me present to you monsieur bourgan of the french detective service      book one     chapter i   sympathy and selfishness   the girl who was dying lay in an invalid chair piled up with cushions in a sheltered corner of the lawn the woman who had come to visit her had deliberately turned away her head with a murmured word about the sunshine and the field of buttercups behind them was the little sanitarium a gray stone villa built in the style of a château overgrown with creepers and with terraced lawns stretching down to the sunny corner to which the girl had been carried earlier in the day there were flowers everywherebeds of hyacinths and borders of purple and yellow crocuses a lilac tree was bursting into blossom the breeze was soft and full of life below beyond the yellowstarred field of which the woman had spoken flowed the seine and in the distance one could see the outskirts of paris  the doctor says i am better the girl whispered plaintively this morning he was quite cheerful i suppose he knows but it is strange that i should feel so weakweaker even day by day and my coughit tears me to pieces all the time  the woman who was bending over her gulped something down in her throat and turned her head although older than the invalid whom she had come to visit she was young and very beautiful her cheeks were a trifle pale but even without the tears her eyes were almost the color of violets  the doctor must know dear lucie she declared our own feelings so often mean nothing at all  the girl moved a little uneasily in her chair she also had once been pretty her hair was still an exquisite shade of redgold but her cheeks were thin and pinched her complexion had gone her clothes fell about her she seemed somehow shapeless  yes she agreed the doctor knowshe must know i see it in his manner every time he comes to visit me in his heart she added dropping her voice he must know that i am going to die  her eyes seemed to have stiffened in their sockets to have become dilated her lips trembled but her eyes remained steadfast  oh madame she sobbed is it not cruel that one should die like this i am so young i have seen so little of life it is not just madameit is not just  the woman who sat by her side was shaking her heart was torn with pity everywhere in the soft sunlit air wherever she looked she seemed to read in letters of fire the history of this girl the history of so many others  we will not talk of death dear she said doctors are so wonderful nowadays there are so few diseases which they cannot cure they seem to snatch one back even from the grave besides you are so young one does not die at nineteen tell me about this maneugène you called him he has never once been to see younot even when you were in the hospital  the girl began to tremble  not once she murmured  you are sure that he had your letters he knows that you are out here and alone  yes he knows  there was a short silence the woman found it hard to know what to say somewhere down along the white dusty road a man was grinding the music of a threadbare waltz from an ancient barrelorgan the girl closed her eyes  we used to hear that sometimes she whispered at the cafés at one where we went often they used to know that i liked it and they always played it when we came it is queer to hear it againlike this oh when i close my eyes she muttered i am afraid it is like shutting out life for always  the woman by her side got up lucie caught at her skirt  madame you are not going yet she pleaded am i selfish yet you have not stayed with me so long as yesterday and i am so lonely  the womans face had hardened a little  i am going to find that man she replied i have his address i want to bring him to you  the girls hold upon her skirt tightened  sit down she begged do not leave me indeed it is useless he knows he does not choose to come men are like that oh madame i have learned my lesson i know now that love is a vain thing men do not often really feel it they come to us when we please them but afterwards that does not count i suppose we were meant to be sacrificed i have given up thinking of eugène he is afraid perhaps of the infection i think that i would sooner go out of life as i lie here cold and unloved than have him come to me unwillingly  the woman could not hide her tears any longer there was something so exquisitely fragile so strangely pathetic in that prostrate figure by her side  but my dear she faltered  madame the girl interrupted hold my hand for a moment that is the doctor coming i hear his footstep i think that i must sleep  madame christophorshe had another name but there were few occasions on which she cared to use itwas driven back to paris in accordance with her murmured word of instruction at a pace which took little heed of police regulations or even of safety through the peaceful lanes across the hills into the suburbs and into the city itself she passed at a speed which was scarcely slackened even when she turned into the boulevard which was her destination glancing at the slip of paper which she held in her hand she pulled the checkstring before a tall block of buildings she hurried inside ascended two flights of stairs and rang the bell of a door immediately opposite her a very germanlooking manservant opened it after the briefest of delaysa man with fair moustache fat stolid face and inquisitive eyes  is your master in she demanded monsieur estermen  the man stared at her then bowed the appearance of madame christophor was without doubt impressive  i will inquire madame he replied  i am in a hurry she said curtly be so good as to let your master know that  a moment later she was ushered into a sittingrooma mans apartment untidy reeking of cigarette smoke and stale air there were photographs and souvenirs of women everywhere the windows were fastclosed and the curtains halfdrawn the man who stood upon the hearthrug was of medium height dark with closecropped hair and a black drooping moustache his first glance at his visitor as the door opened was one of impertinent curiosity  madame he inquired  you are monsieur estermen  he bowed he was very much impressed and he endeavored to assume a manner  that is my name pray be seated  she waved away the chair he offered  my automobile is in the street below she said i wish you to come with me at once to see a poor girl who is dying  he looked at her in amazement  are you serious madame  i am very serious indeed she replied the girls name is lucie rénault  for the moment he seemed perplexed then his eyebrows were slowly raised  lucie rénault he repeated what do you know about her  only that she is a poor child who has suffered at your hands and who is dying in a private hospital madame christophor answered she has been taken there out of charity she has no friends she is dying alone come with me i will take you to her you shall save her at least from that terror  it was the aim of the man with whom she spoke to be considered modern a perfect and invincible selfishness had enabled him to reach the topmost heights of callousness and to remain there without affectation  if the little girl is dying he said i am sorry for she was pretty and companionable although i have lost sight of her lately but as to my going out to see her why that is absurd i hate illness of all sorts  the woman looked at him steadfastly looked at him as though she had come into contact with some strange creature  do you understand what it is that i am saying she demanded this girl was once your little friend is it not so it was for your sake that she gave up the simple life she was living when you first knew her and went upon the stage the life was too strenuous for her she broke down took no care of herself developed a cough and alas tuberculosis  the man sighed he had adopted an expression of abstract sympathy  a terrible disease he murmured  a terrible disease indeed madame christophor repeated do you not understand what i mean when i tell you that she is dying of it very likely she will not live a weekperhaps not a day she lies there alone in the garden of the hospital and she is afraid there are none who knew her whom she cares for to take her into their arms and to bid her have no fear is it not your place to do this you have held her in your arms in life dont you see that it is your duty to cheer her a little way on this last dark journey  the man threw away his cigarette and moved to the mantelpiece where he helped himself to a fresh one from the box  madame he said i perceive that you are a sentimentalist  she did not speakshe could not she only looked at him  death he continued lighting his cigarette is an ugly thing if it came to me i should probably be quite as much afraidperhaps morethan any one else but it has not come to me just yet it has come you tell me to little lucie well i am sorry but there is nothing i can do about it i have no intention whatever of making myself miserable i do not wish to see her i do not wish to look upon death i simply wish to forget it if it were not madame he added with a bow and a meaning glance from his dark eyes that you bring with you something of your own so well worth looking upon i could almost find myself regretting your visit  she still regarded him fixedly there was in her face something of that shrinking curiosity with which one looks upon an unclean and horrible thing  that is your answer she murmured  the man had little understanding and he replied boldly  it is my answer without a doubt lucie if what you tell me is true as i do not for a moment doubt is dying from a disease the ravages of which are hideous to watch and which many people believe too to be infectious let me advise you madame to learn also a little wisdom let me beg of you not to be led away by these efforts of sentiment however picturesque and delightful they may seem the only life that is worth considering is our own the only death that we need fear is our own we ought to live like that  the woman stood quite still she was tall and she was slim her figure was exquisite she was famous throughout the city for her beauty the mans eyes dwelt upon her and the eternal expression crept slowly into his face he seemed to understand nothing of the shivering horror with which she was regarding him  if it were upon any other errand madame he continued leaning towards her believe i pray you that no one would leave this room to become your escort more willingly than i  she turned away  you will not leave me already he begged  monsieur she declared as she threw open the door before he could reach it if i thought that there were many men like you in the world if i thought  she never finished her sentence the emotions which had seized her were entirely inexpressible he shrugged his shoulders  my dear lady he said let me assure you that there is not a man of the world in this city who if he spoke honestly would not feel exactly as i do allow me at least to see you to your automobile  if you dare to move she muttered if you dare  she swept past him and down the stairs into the street she threw herself into the corner of the automobile the chauffeur looked around  where to madame he inquired  she hesitated for a moment she had affairs of her own but the thought of the childs eyes came up before her  back to the hospital she ordered drive quickly  they rushed from paris once more into the country with its spring perfumes its soft breezes its restful green but fast though they drove another messenger had outstripped them from the little chapel as the car rolled up the avenue came the slow tolling of a bell madame christophor stood on the corner of the lawn alone the invalid chair was empty the blinds of the villa were being slowly lowered she turned around and looked toward the city it seemed to her that she could see into the rooms of the man whom she had left a few minutes ago a lark was singing over her head she lifted her eyes and looked past him up to the blue sky her lips moved but never a sound escaped her yet the man who sat in his rooms at that moment yawning and wondering where to spend the evening and which companion he should summon by telephone to amuse him felt a sudden shiver in his veins     chapter ii   an indiscreet letter   the library of the house in grosvenor square was spacious handsome and ornate mr algernon h carraby mp who sat dictating letters to a secretary in an attitude which his favorite photographer had rendered exceedingly familiar at any rate among his constituents was also in his way handsome and ornate mrs carraby who had just entered the room fulfilled in an even greater degree these same characteristics it was acknowledged to be a very satisfactory household  i should like to speak to you for a moment algernon his wife announced  mr carraby noticed for the first time that she was carrying a letter in her hand he turned at once to his secretary  haskwell he said kindly return in ten minutes  the young man quitted the room mrs carraby advanced a few steps further towards her husband she was tall beautifully dressed in the latest extreme of fashion her movements were quiet her skin a little pale and her eyebrows a little light nevertheless she was quite a famous beauty men all admired her without any reservations the best sort of women rather mistrusted her  is that the letter mabel her husband asked with an eagerness which he seemed to be making some effort to conceal  she nodded slowly he held out his hand but she did not at once part with it  algernon she said quietly you know that i am not very scrupulous we both of us want successa certain sort of successand we have both of us been content to pay the price you have spent a good deal of money and you have succeeded very well indeed somehow or other i feel today as though i were spending more than money  he laughed a little uncomfortably  my dear mabel he protested you are not going to back out are you  no she replied i do not think that i shall back out there is nothing in the whole world i want so much as to have you a cabinet minister if there had been any other way  but there is no other way her husband interrupted so long as julien portel lives i should never get my chance he holds the post i want every one knows that he is clever he has the ear of the prime minister and he hates me my only chance is his retirement  mrs carraby looked at the letter  well she said i have played your game for you i have gone even to the extent of being talked about with julien portel  her husband moved uneasily in his chair  that will all blow over directly he declared besides ifif things go our way we shant see much more of portel give me the letter  still she hesitated it was curious that throughout the slow evolution of this scheme to break a mans life for which she was mainly responsible she had never hesitated until this moment always it had been fixed in her mind that algernon was to be a cabinet minister she was to be the wife of a cabinet minister that there were any other things greater in life than the gratification of so reasonable an ambition had never seemed possible now she hesitated she looked at her husband and she saw him with new eyes he seemed suddenly a mean little person she thought of the other man and there was a strange quiver in her hearta very unexpected sensation indeed there was a difference in the breed it came home to her at that moment she found herself even wondering as she swung the letter idly between her thumb and forefinger whether she would have been a different woman if she had had a different manner of husband  the letter he repeated  she laid it calmly on the desk before him  of course she said coldly if you find the contents affectionate you must remember that i am in no way responsible this was your scheme i have done my best  the mans fingers trembled slightly as he broke the seal  naturally he agreed pausing for an instant and looking up at her i knew that i could trust you or i would never have put such an idea into your head  she laughed a characteristic laugh it was quite cold quite mirthless apparently quite meaningless carraby turned back to the letter tore open the envelope and spread it out before them he read it out aloud in a singsong voice  downing street tuesday  my dearest mabel  i had your sweet little note an hour ago of course i was disappointed about luncheon as i always am when i cannot see you your promise to repay me however almost reconciles me  the man looked up at his wife  promise he repeated hoarsely what does he mean  go on she said with unchanged expression see if what you want is there  the man continued to read  i am going to ask you a very great favor mabel when we are alone together i talk to you with absolute freedom to write you on matters connected with my office is different i know very well how deep and sincere your interest in politics really is and it has always been one of my greatest pleasures when with you to talk things over and hear your point of view without flattery dear i have really more than once found your advice useful it is your understanding which makes our companionship always a pleasure to me and i rely upon that when i beg you not to ask me to write you again on matters to which i have really no right to allude you do not mind this dear and having read you my little lecture i will answer your question yes the cabinet council was held exactly as you surmise with great difficulty i persuaded b to adopt my view of the situation they are all much too terrified of this war bogey for once i had my own way our answer to this latest demand from berlin was a prompt and decisive negative nothing of this is to be known for at least a week  i am sorry your husband is such a bear perhaps on monday we may meet at cardington house  please destroy this letter at once  ever affectionately yours  julien  the mans eyes as he read grew brighter  it is enough the woman asked  it is more than enough  slowly he replaced it in its envelope and thrust it into the breastpocket of his coat  what are you going to do with it she inquired  i have made my plans he answered i know exactly how to make the best and most dignified use of it  he rose to his feet something in his wifes expression seemed to disturb him he walked a few steps toward the door and came back again  mabel he said are you glad  naturally i am glad she replied  you have no regrets  again she laughed  regrets she echoed what are they one doesnt think about such things nowadays  they stood quite still in the centre of that very handsome apartment they were almost alien figures in the world in which they moved carraby the rankest of newcomers carried into political life by his wifes ambitions his own selfamassed fortune and a sort of subtle cunninga very common substitute for brains mrs carraby on whom had been plastered an expensive and ultrafashionable education although she was able perhaps more effectually to conceal her origin the daughter of a rich yorkshire manufacturer who had secured a paid entrance into society they were purely artificial figures for the very reason that they never admitted any one of these facts to themselves but talked always the jargon of the world to which they aspired as though they were indeed denizens therein by right at that moment though a single natural feeling shook the man shook his faith in himself in life in his destiny there was jewish blood in his veins and it made itself felt  mabel he began this man portelyouve flirted with him you say  i have most certainly flirted with him she admitted quietly  he hasnt dared  a flash of scorn lit her cold eyes  i think she said that you had better ask me no questions of that sort  carraby went slowly out already the moment was passing of course he could trust his wife besides in his letter was the death warrant of the man who stood between him and his ambitions mrs carraby listened to his footsteps in the hall heard his suave reply to his secretary heard his orders to the footman who let him out from where she stood she watched him cross the square already he had recovered his alert bearing his shoes and his hat were glossy his coat was of an excellent fit the woman watched him without movement or any change of expression     chapter iii   a ruined career   sir julien portel stood in the middle of his bedroom dressed in shirt and trousers only the sofa and chairs around him were littered with portions of the brilliant uniform which he had torn from his person a few minutes before with almost feverish haste his perplexed servant who had only just arrived was doing his best to restore the room to some appearance of order  you neednt mind those wretched things for the present richards his master ordered sharply bring the rest of the tweed traveling suit like the trousers i have on and then see about packing some clothes  the man ceased his task he looked around a little bewildered  do i understand that you are going out of town tonight sir julien he asked  i am going on to the continent by the nine oclock train was the curt reply  richards was a perfectly trained servant but the situation was too much for him  you will excuse me sir julien he said but there is lord cardingtons dinner tonight and the reception afterwards at the foreign office i have your court clothes ready  his master laughed shortly  i am not attending the dinner or the reception richards you can put those things back again and get me the traveling clothes  the man seemed a little dazed but turned automatically towards the wardrobe  shall you require me to accompany you sir he inquired  not at present sir julien replied you will have to come on with the rest of my luggage when i have decided what to do  richards was not more than ordinarily inquisitive but the circumstances were certainly unusual  do you mean sir that you will not be returning to london at present he ventured to ask  i shall not be returning to london for some time sir julien answered sharply get on with the packing as quickly as you can put the whiskey and soda on the table in the sittingroom and the cigarettes remember if any one comes i am not at home  too late my dear fellow a voice called out from the adjoining room you see i have found my way up unannounceda bad habit but my profession excuses everything  the man stood on the threshold of the room opening out from the bedroomtall florid untidily dressed with cleanshaven humorous face ungloved hands and a terribly shabby hat he looked around the room and shrugged his shoulders  what an infernal mess he exclaimed come along out into the sittingroom julien i want to talk to you  i should like to know how the devil you got in here sir julien muttered i told the fellow downstairs that no one was to be allowed up  he did try to make himself disagreeable the newcomer replied however here i amthats enough  sir julien turned to his servant  get on with your packing richards he directed and let me know when you have finished  sir julien followed his visitor into the sittingroom closing the door behind him his manner was not in the least cordial  look here kendricks old fellow he said i dont want to be rude but i am not in the humor to talk to any one i have had a rotten week of it and just about as much as i can stand help yourself to a whiskey and soda say what you have to say and then go  the newcomer nodded he helped himself to the whiskey and soda but he seemed in no hurry to speak on the contrary he settled himself down in an easychair with the appearance of a man who had come to stay  julien he remarked presently you are up against itup against it rather hard dont trouble to interrupt me i know pretty well all about it i said from the first youd have to resign there wasnt any other way out of it  quite right julien agreed there wasnt ive finished up everything todayresigned my office applied for the chiltern hundreds and i am going to clear out of the country tonight  and all because you wrote a foolish letter to a woman kendricks murmured half to himself by the bye theres no doubt about the letter i suppose  none in the world julien replied  theres nothing that the press can do to set you right  great heavens no julien declared no one can help me ive no one to blame but myself i wrote the letterthere the matter ends  and she passed it on to that shocking little bounder of a husband of hers what a creature did it ever occur to you that it was a plot  julien shrugged his shoulders  it makes so little difference  you were in carrabys way kendricks continued producing a pipe from his pocket and leisurely filling it there was no getting past you and you were a young man its a dirty business  if you dont mind julien said coldly we wont discuss it any further so far as i am concerned the whole matter is at an end i was compelled to take part in todays mummery i hated itthat they all knew i suppose its foolish to mind such things david he went on bitterly taking up a cigarette and throwing himself into a chair but a year agoit was just after i came back from berlin and you may remember it was the fancy of the people to believe that i had saved the country from warthey cheered me all the way from whitehall to the mansion house today there was only a dull murmur of voicesa sort of doubting groan i felt it kendricks it was like hell that ride  kendricks nodded sympathetically  i suppose you know that a version of the letter is in the evening papers he asked   my resignation will be in the later issues julien told him it was pretty well known yesterday afternoon i leave for the continent tonight  there was a short silence between the two men in a sense they had been friends all their lives sir julien portel had been a successful politician the youngest cabinet minister for some years kendricks had never aspired to be more than a clever journalist of the vigorous type nevertheless they had been more than ordinarily intimate  have you made any plans kendricks inquired presently of course you would have to resign office but dont you think there might be a chance of living it down  not a chance on earth julien replied as to what i am going to do dont ask me for the immediate present i am going to lose myself in normandy or somewhere afterwards i think i shall move on to my old quarters in paris theres always a little excitement to be got out of life there  kendricks looked at his friend through the cloud of tobacco smoke  its excitement of rather a dangerous order he remarked slowly  i shall never be likely to forget that i am an englishman julien said perhaps i may be able to do something to set matters right again one cant tell by the bye kendricks he went on do you remember when we were at college how you hated women how you used to try and trace half the things that went wrong in life to their influence  the journalist nodded he knocked the ashes from his pipe deliberately  i was a boy in those days he declared i am a man now getting on toward middle age and on that one subject i am as rabid as ever i hate their meddling in mens affairs shoving themselves into politics always whispering in a mans ear under pretence of helping him with their sympathy theyre in evidence wherever you gowomen women women the place reeks with them you cant go about your work hour by hour or day by day without having them on every side of you its like a poison this trail of them over every piece of serious work we attempt over every place we find our way into they bang the typewriters in our offices they elbow us in the streets they smile at us from the next table at our workaday luncheon they crowd the tubes and the cars and the cabs in the streets why the deuce julien cant we treat them like those sage orientals and dump them all in one place where they belong till weve finished our work  julien lifted his tumbler of whiskey and soda to his lips and set it down empty  in a way youre right kendricks he agreed you go too far of course but i do believe that women hold too big a place in our lives i am one of the poor fools who goes to the wall to gratify the vanity of one of them  the journalist muttered a word under his breath which he would have been very sorry to have seen in the pages of his paper julien had moved to the open window there had been a little break in his voice no one knew better than kendricks that a very brilliant career was broken  i think youre wise to go away for a time julien he decided look here its six oclock now i have a taxicab waiting downstairs come round to my rotten little restaurant in soho and dine with me your fellow can meet us at charingcross with your things you wont see a soul you know where im going to take you  julien turned slowly away from the window he was looking for the last time from those rooms at the london which he had loved the setting sun had caught the dome of st pauls was flashing from the dark placid water of the thames the roar of the great city was passing from eastwards to westwards  youre a good chap kendricks he declared ill come along with pleasure i shall have enough solitude later on but listen before we golisten david to a speech after your own heart  julien stood quite still for a moment his pale face seemed suddenly whiter his eyes were full of fire  david he said if ever the time comes in the future when i find that a woman is beginning to claim a minute of my thoughts a single one of my emotions to govern the slightest throb of my pulses ill take her by the throat and ill throw her out of whats left of my life as i would a rat that had crept into my room ive done with them curse all women  there was a silence kendricks leaned over to the fireplace and knocked his pipe against the hearth then he suddenly paused  whats that he asked abruptly  there was a soft knocking at the outside door     chapter iv   a bunch of violets   kendricks rose slowly to his feet julien was looking toward the door with a frown upon his face while they stood there the knocking was repeated still soft but a little more insistent julien hesitated no longer  i think kendricks said dryly that you had better see who is there  the door was already opened julien seemed suddenly transformed into a graven image he said nothing merely gazing at the woman who walked calmly past him into the room kendricks who also recognized her withdrew his pipe from his mouth this was a situation indeed the woman with her hands inside her muff looked from one to the other of the two men  am i interrupting a very important interview she asked calmly if not perhaps you could spare me five minutes of your time sir julien  kendricks recovered himself at once  ill wait for you downstairs julien he declared  he caught up his hat and departed closing the door after him julien was still motionless  well she began  he drew a little breath he was beginning to regain his selfpossession  my dear mrs carraby he said with your wonderful knowledge of the world and its ways will you permit me to point out that your presence here is a little embarrassing to me and might under certain circumstances be a good deal more embarrassing to you  mrs carraby smiled she stood where the sunlight touched her brown hair and her quiet pale face she was one of those women who are never afraid of the light her face was of that strange selfcontained nature colorless apparently yet capable of strange and rapid changes just now the last glow of sunlight seemed to have found a skein of gold in her hair a queer gleam of light in her eyes she stood there looking at the man whom she had come to visit  julien she said i wanted a few words with you  it was impossible for him to remain altogether unmoved whatever else might be the truth she had risked most of the things that were dear to her in life by this visit  mrs carraby he declared i am entirely at your service if you think that any useful purpose can be served by words between you and me i would only point out for your own sake that your visit is to say the least of it unwise these are bachelor chambers  you know very well she replied calmly that it was my only chance of speaking with you if i had sent for you you would not have come if i had spoken to you in the street you would have passed me byquite rightly this was my only chance that is why i have come to you  if you think it worth the risk he remarked gravely pray continue  she shrugged her shoulders very slightly  who can tell what is worth the risk  you have at least excited my curiosity he admitted leaning a little towards her i cannot conceive what it is that you want to say to me  she lifted her eyes to his and though there was nothing unusual about themthere were few people indeed who could tell you what color they weremen seldom forgot it when mrs carraby looked at them steadily  i do not know myself she said i do not know why i have come  julien laughed unnaturally  pray be seated he begged would you like to examine my curios or my photographs i must apologize for the condition of my room you see you happen to be the first woman who has ever crossed its threshold  that she remarked rather interests me still it is only what i should have expected no i do not think that i will sit down i am trying to ask myself exactly why i have come   if you can answer that question julien said grimly you will appease a very natural curiosity on my part it is not like you  quite true she assented it is not like me i have run a great risk in coming here and it is not my métier to run risks and now that i am here i do not know why i have come this has been an impulse and this is an hour outside my life i am trying to understand it come here julien he came unwillingly to her side she held out her hand but he shook his head  mabel he said you and i do not need to mince words tonight i am celebrating the ruin of my career i am leaving england within a few hours i have you to thank for what has happened yet you come to me you hold out your hand you must forgive mei am afraid i am dull  no she replied you are not dull your feelings towards me are obvious and very natural mine towards you i am not so sure of it is not because i did not understand you that i came here tonight it is because i did not understand myself may i go on  why not he answered i am at your service  from the days of my boardingschool she continued i have known only one mabel in her girlhood she had all that she could get out of life and turned everything she could to her own ends a marriage was arranged for heryou see i was half a jewess and my husband was half a jew and things are done like that with us the marriage opened the door to a fresh set of ambitions for the last few years i have trodden a wellworn path it was i who advised my husband to refuse a baronetcy it was i who won his first election i see that my photographs are in all the illustrated papers that his speeches are properly recorded that my visiting list moves within the correct limits these things have spelt life to the fulfillment of my husbands ambitions there was one obstacle that obstacle was you in life one schemes it was my husbands wish that i should make myself agreeable to you even to the extent of a flirtation  she raised her eyes  your obedience to your husband is most touching he said  it is true i suppose she went on that we have flirted i looked upon it as the means to an end the end came i played my cards quite ruthlessly i gathered in the reward i got your letter i handed it to my husband your career was finished my husbands begun  this is most interesting julien muttered  is it she answered i suppose it should have been an hour of triumph with me it simply isnt i have come to a place in my life which i dont understand when i told myself that it was over that i had flirted with you that i had won your friendship and your confidence betrayed you ruined you for a peerage and that my husband should take office i should surely have been satisfied it was for that i had worked i gave my husband the letter and i watched him walk off in triumph since then i have not been myself i have come to you julien to ask if there is no other end possible to this  once more she raised her eyes julien came a step nearer to her they were standing now face to face  all of a sudden she murmured i looked back and i saw the way i have lived and the way i am living and the life that spreads itself out before me i saw myself a peeress i saw myself receiving my husbands guests i saw the gratification of all those ambitions which have seemed to me so wonderful and i locked the door and i shrieked and it seemed to me that there was a new thing and a new thought in my life i have done you a hideous wrong julien there is only one way i can set it right there is only one moment in which it can be done and that moment is now tomorrow i shall be back again for this one hour i see the truth i am a very rich woman julien my husbands future indeed is largely bound up with my wealth remember that in all i have done i have been his agent he hates you has hated you from the first because you were a gentleman and he never was this is my one moment of madness in a perfectly wellordered life  one of her hands stole from her muff stole out halfhesitatingly towards him julien took it in his and raised it to his lips then he looked her in the eyes  dear mabel he said you are forgiven i understand perfectly the reasons for your coming go back to your husband wear your coronet and receive his guests with a free conscience i forgive you  her hand slipped back into her muff she began to tremble a little  as for me he went on i played the fool and i pay willingly i was engaged to marry a very charming girl who believed in me and whom i cared for as much as it was possible for me to care for anything outside my career i flirted with you because it was a piquant thing to do you were a woman whom other men found difficult you were the wife of a man whom i despised and who was trying all the time to undermine my position i sacrificed my selfrespect every time i crossed your threshold today i pay i am willing as for you mabel your visit here shall square things between us i wish you the best of luck you must let me ring for my servant he will find you a taxicab  he moved toward the bell mrs carraby with her hands inside her muff stood exactly as though she were part of the furniture of the room with his finger upon the ivory disc he hesitated she was not looking towards him and her eyes were half closed   perhaps he suggested you would rather find your way out alone i will not offer my escort for obvious reasons  she turned slowly round  do not ring she ordered sharply come here  he came at once towards her she took both his hands in hers she leaned towards him she was a tall woman and they were very nearly the same height  julien she whispered is this all that you have to say to me  it is more julien replied frankly than i expected ever to have to say to you again in this world what do you expect you dont think that i am the kind of man tobut that is absurd come well part friends if you like heres my hand  we must part then she said  he shrugged his shoulders  unless a walking tour in normandy for a month appeals to you you see i am going to take a holiday and i have a fancy that our ideas on the subject of holidays might not exactly agree  a holiday she repeated i am not suredo you know julien i sometimes believe that i have never had a holiday in my life  he looked at her doubtingly  after all she continued cant you see that i have come here to ask you one question you are different from the people i have known intimately and the people with whom i have been brought up different from my husband you know what my life has been i have told you just now that the great doubt has come to me within the last few days wont you tell me what i want to know is there anything better anything greater anything more wonderful in life than these things which i have known these ambitions this social struggle tell me julien is there anything else can you tell me how and where to find it  once more her fingers had crept out of her muff  her hands were upon his shoulders she seemed to be drawing him to her julien kissed her lightly on the forehead  for you my dear mabel he decided i should say that there was nothing better a leopard cannot change its spots the life into which you have been brought and for which you have qualified so admirably is the only life which would suit you if you fancy sometimes in your dreams or in your waking hours that you hear cries and calls from another country dont listen to them you would never be happy outside the world you know of you see one who has made such a failure of life himself is yet well able to advise forgive me  the telephone on his writing table was ringing he turned aside to answer it it was a question regarding the whereabouts of some papers at the office and it took him a few minutes to explain when he set the receiver back and turned around he was alone there was nothing to remind him of her visit but a bunch of violets which seemed to have fallen from her muff and the faint perfume from them he took them up smelt them for a moment and flung them lightly into the hearth then he touched his bell  my hat stick and gloves richards he ordered bring my things to charingcross at halfpast eight have them registered only to boulogne you understand  perfectly sir the man replied  julien glanced once more around his sittingroom the little bunch of violets was smouldering upon the hearth in a sense they seemed to him symbolical  kendricks is right he muttered it is the women who play the devil with our lives     chapter v   a sentimental episode   kendricks was waiting below in the taxicab leaning back in the corner with his feet upon the opposite seat and smoking his very disreputable pipe with an air of serene content  sorry to have turned you out into the street like this julien remarked  thank you kendricks replied under the circumstances i preferred the street  julien hesitated for a moment and glanced at his watch  there is one more call that i must pay david he said you wont mind will you weve plenty of time  mind of course not kendricks answered stretching himself out in the cab do what you please with me only leave an hour or an hour and a half for dinner i am the besttempered person in the world so long as no one interferes with my regular meal hours  its just a little farewell call julien explained that i want to pay ive told the man where to go  kendricks nodded silently he knew all about that little call but if he felt any sympathy he was careful not to show it they drew up in a few minutes before a large and solemnlooking house at the corner of hamilton place  dont hurry kendricks advised stretching himself out once more in the cab ill smoke another pipe and thank heaven we are not in new york you wait an hour there and take your choice of paying the fare or buying the taxicab  julien ascended the steps and rang the bell at the door of the house it was immediately opened by a manservant who recognized him with a bow and a smile for which somehow or other he felt thankful  is lady anne in robert he inquired  the man stood on one side  please to walk in sir julien he invited lady anne is with some young people in the drawingroom will you go in there to them or would you prefer that i announce you  is there any one in the waitingroom julien asked  no one at present sir  let me go in there then i want to speak to lady anne alone for a moment you might let her know that i am here  certainly sir  julien walked restlessly up and down the small uncomfortable apartment the room which he had always hated there were illustrated papers arranged in a row upon a leathertopped table two stiff horsehair easychairs and various views of clonarty the country seat of the duke of clonarty around the walls presently he heard the laughter in the drawingroom cease there was a short silence then the sound of footsteps across the hall and the abrupt opening of the door of the room in which he was waiting julien looked up quickly it was after all what he had expected a somewhat vivaciouslooking little lady in a muslin gown and elaborate hat held out both her hands to him in the darkened light of the room she might very well have passed for a younger and less serious edition of her own daughter  my dear julien she exclaimed in a tone which was manifestly sympathetic this is terrible news we are hearing about you but what an odd time you have chosen to come and tell us all about it  i have not come to tell you all about it duchess julien assured her the newspapers will tell you everything that is worth knowing they are so much better informed  the newspapers sometimes exaggerate she objected  in my case he replied i do not think that exaggeration is possible everything has happened to me that could possibly happen to any one in my unfortunate position  you mean that these stories are all true then  every one of them i really dont suppose that i ought to show my face here at all i have simply come to say goodbye there is just a single word that i want to say to anne  tell me julien she demanded you really did write that letter to mrs carraby  i did  and she gave it to her husband  yes  for once the duchess was perfectly and delightfully natural  that woman she declared is a detestable cat mind julien she added i dont mean by that that you were not hideously and entirely to blame i cant feel that you deserve a single grain of sympathy all the same a woman who can do a thing like that should not be tolerated  julien smiled grimly he was perfectly well aware that at that moment mrs carraby was passing from the list of the duchesss acquaintances it was all so inconsequent  can i have that one word with anne he begged  the duchess looked doubtful  why  i am going abroad tonight i should like to say goodbye to her  isnt it a little foolish she asked i dont mean your going abroadthat i suppose is almost necessarybut why do you want to see anne i can give her all the proper messages  julien laughed bitterly  there are some things he said which can scarcely be altogether ignored it may have escaped your memory that anne was to have been my wife  not at all the duchess replied the only thing i do not understand is why as any such arrangement is of course now ridiculous you should want to see her again what can you possibly have to say to her an affair of sentiment he explained i have a fancy to say goodbye  the duchess shook her head  those sort of things dont belong to us she declared you ought to know better my dear julien i can see no possible object in it i will give her any message you like and so far as she is concerned i can assure you that she has not the slightest illfeeling she is really quite angelic about it  duchess julien said steadily i came here expecting that these would be your views you are annes mother and of course you are in authority but when two people of our age are engaged to marry one another they pass just a little beyond the sphere of their parents influence anne and i have been in that position dont think for a moment that i wish to dispute your authority when i say that i intend to see her before i leave  she shrugged her shoulders  ah my dear julien she murmured if you had only been as firm with that foolish woman still if you have really made up your mind i am sure i dont want to be disagreeable perhaps it would be just as well to get the thing over  she touched the bell  ask lady anne to step this way she told the servant  the man withdrew and the door was closed again the duchess showed no signs of being about to take her leave  this matter has already i presume been fully discussed between you and anne julien remarked it will not be necessary for you even to give her a parting word of advice  you amusing person she laughed there are no words of advice of mine needed in a case like this to tell you the truth julien although i always liked you as you know i hated your engagement to anne you were a very charming young man to have about the house and i was always pleased to see my girls flirt with you but as a soninlaw i ranked you from the first amongst the undesirables your income so far as i know is a little less than nothing at all and politics as you are discovering today are a precarious form of livelihood anne hasnt a copper and never will have she ought to marry a rich man and i intend now that she shall here she is now do get this stupid affair over quickly  the door was opened and lady anne came in she was taller than her mother of more serious aspect and her hair was a shade darker there was something of the same expression about the eyes she came straight over to julien and gave him both her hands  my dear julien she exclaimed this is shocking run away if you please mother i must see julien for a moment alone  the duchess left the room they both waited until the door was closed then she turned and faced him  i suppose its all true she asked  every word of it anne he answered please dont misunderstand the reason of my coming i am absolutely a ruined man and i absolutely deserve everything that has come to me but there was one thing i wanted to say to you before i went  there was also one thing she remarked looking at him intently which i intended to ask you provided you gave me the opportunity  it is about mrs carraby he said firmly  so was my question she murmured  the friendship between mrs carraby and myself julien continued has been patent to every one for a great many years i knew her long before i did you it began in fact when we were little more than children it finishedtoday there is only one thing i want to say to you about it and that is this our friendship was of that sort which is fairly well recognized and even approved of by the world in which we live it contained of course certain elements of flirtationi am not denying that there was never at any time however anything in that friendship which made it an error even of taste on my part to ask you to become my wife  she took his face between her hands and deliberately kissed him  thats just what i wanted to know julien she declared now shake hands be off and do the best you can for yourself i wish you the best of luck the very best thats all we can say to one another isnt it  quite all he admitted  you are a dear good fellow she went on and i have been quite fond of you although i think that i bored you now and then i should have made you an excellent wife perhaps a better one than i shall the next man who comes along dont stay any longer theres a dear because although i never pretended to have much heart this sort of thing does upset one you know and i want to look my best tonight write me sometimes if you will id love to hear that youd found some interest in life to help you gather up the threads and herethis is for luck  she took a little turquoise pin from her waistband and stuck it in his black tie then before he could stop her she touched the bell with one hand and gave him the other  please kiss my fingers julien and tell me ive behaved nicely   he looked steadily into her eyes and then away out of the window across the square it was such a natural ending this it was foolish that his heart should shake even for a second and yet there had been one occasionat clonartywhen she had lain very close to him in his arms and the moonlight had been falling through the pine trees in little dappled places around them and the wind had been making faint music among the swinging boughsfor these few moments at any rate the other things had shone in her face were they illusions really those moments of agitation he wonderedsimply one long sensuous period passing like breath from a lookingglass and leaving nothing behind he looked into her face there was no sign there then he dropped the fingers which he had been holding women were wonderful  do write she begged as she walked into the hall with him dear me what a strangelooking person you have with you in the taxicab  he is a friend julien said quietly a journalist i might say the same of the young man who is watching us from the drawingroom anne who is he  she made a little face at him and whispered in his ear  semitic as you see and positively appalling he is entirely mothers choice he arrived ten minutes after the evening papers were out but somehow or other i dont fancy that we shall make anything of him its young harbord you know  julien made his effort he touched her fingers once more in conventional fashion he leaned towards her earnestly  my dear anne he said that young man has an income of at least a hundred thousand a year have you ever considered what a wonderful thing it is to possess an income like that you could surround yourself with it like a halo you could eat it wear it and breathe it every second of your life you could even use it as a means of escaping as often as possible from the somewhat inevitable but highly objectionable adjunct who seems now to be peering at us through the door be a wise girl anne an income like that doesnt depend upon discretions or indiscretions besides as a matter of fact i really do not think that that young man knows what it is to be indiscreet remember i am quite serious a hundred thousand a year should lift any man beyond the pale of criticism  yes the girl replied looking at him as he walked down the steps i shall remember goodbye  we are getting on julien declared lightly as he took his place in the taxicab really it is astonishing how much a man can get through in a day if he sets his mind to it is there any place where we could get a drink do you think kendricks i have just passed through a trying and affecting interview i have said farewell to the lady who was to have been my wife that sort of thing upsets one  you are behaving my dear julien kendricks admitted like a man of sense in a moment or two we shall pass vérys on our way to the restaurant where i am going to entertain you at dinner it will probably be such a dinner as you have never eaten before in your life you will not need an apéritif i am not sure indeed that it is not tempting providence and inviting indigestion to offer you a mixed vermouth here however come along one experience more or less in such a day will not disturb you  they entered the café and sat down at a small marbletopped table julien lit a cigarette and kendricks affected not to notice that the hand which held the match was shaking a crowd of people mostly foreigners were sitting about the place julien as he sipped his vermouth noticed a familiar face nearly opposite hima young somewhat sandycomplexioned man quietly dressed insignificant and yet with some sort of personality  i wonder who that fellow is he remarked i seem to know his face  kendricks looked incuriously across the room  one knows every one by sight in london he said the fellow is probably a clerk in some office where you have been or a salesman behind the counter at one of the shops you patronize its odd sometimes how a face will pursue you like that thats a pretty little girl with whom hes shaking hands  julien watched the two idly for a moment the man had risen to greet his newlyarrived companion who was chattering to him in fluent french all the time julien was aware that now and then the formers eyes strayed over towards him it was odd that notwithstanding his somewhat disturbed state of mind he was conscious of a distinct curiosity as to this young mans identity  come along kendricks suggested we shant get a table at all at the place where i am going to take you to dine unless we are punctual  they finished their vermouth and left the café kendricks knocked out the ashes from his pipe and leaned a little forward in the taxicab  we go now he continued into a foreign landforeign at least to you my young exquisitethe land of journalists of foreigners of hairdressers and anarchists and cutthroats of every description nevertheless we shall dine well and if you will only drink enough of the chianti which i shall order i can promise you a nap on your way to dover you look as though you could do with it  julien suddenly remembered that his eyes were hot and almost simultaneously he felt the weight that was dragging down his heart he laughed desperately  ill eat your dinner david he promised and ill do justice to your chianti from what you tell me about our expedition i should imagine that we are going into the land to which i shall soon belong  its a wonderful country kendricks muttered looking out of the window it may not be flowing exactly with milk and honey but its sinews are supple and its blood is red for absolute vitality id back the café lathénée against the carlton any day here we are     chapter vi   at the cafÉ lathÉnÉe   the café lathénée was in a narrow back street and consisted of a ground floor apartment of moderate size and a number of small rooms most of which were already crowded with diners there were no smoothfaced maîtres dhôtel to conduct new arrivals to a table no lift to the upper rooms no palmlined stairways or any of the modern appurtenances of restaurant life kendricks taking the lead as an habitué pushed his way up to the first floor pushed his way past the hurrying and perspiring waiters who did not even stop to answer questions and finally pounced upon a table which was just being vacated by three other people the two men sat down before the débris and waited patiently for its removal  dont turn your nose up yet kendricks begged wait till youve tasted the spaghetti and dont look at the tablecloth as though it would bite you theyll put a clean napkin over it directly and youll forget all about those stains this is where one takes off the kid gloves and deals with the realities of eating and drinking i am inclined to think sometimes julien as a humble admirer from a long way off that youve worn those kid gloves a little too long  julien looked across at his friend kendricks was still smoking his pipe and he was evidently in earnest it was obvious too that he had more to say  you know he continued loudly summoning a waiter and pointing to the table before them you know julien i have always had this feeling about you i think that life has been made a trifle too easy for you you have slipped with so little effort into the polished places you never had to take your coat and waistcoat off and try a roughandtumble struggle with life no man is the worse for it prosperity and smoothtraveling along the easy ways even though they come to one as the reward of brainwork lead to a certain flabbiness in life lead to many moments when you have to stop and ask whether things are worth while lead sometimes i think to that curious neuroticism from which clever successful people suffer as well as the butterflies of fashion you are up against it now julien real and hard you dont feel that youve got a day to live that you care a snap of the fingers about you look at what you think are the pieces of your life and you imagine yourself a gaunt spectator of what has been gazing down at them and youve quite made up your mind that it isnt a bit of good trying to collect the fragments such dd nonsense julien you may have made a jolly hash of things as a cabinet minister but that isnt any reason why you shouldnt make a success of life as a man look here carlo he added addressing the waiter the table dhôte dinnereverything and serve it hot bring us fresh butter with our spaghetti and a flask of chianti  si signor the man replied gazing for a moment in wonder at this shockheaded individual who spoke his own language so perfectly  kendricks laid down the menu and glanced across the table at juliens face with its slightly weary smile  of course i know how youre feeling now he went onrottenso would any one try and forget it try and forget yourself look about you what do these people do for a living do you think they werent born with a title theres no one in this room who went to eton and oxford played cricket for their university and lolled their way into life as you did look at them all the thin chap in the corner is a barber got a small shop of his own now i go there sometimes for a shave he lived on thirteen shillings a week for six years while he saved the money to start for himself it was touch and go with him afterwards in three months hed nearly lost the lot hed married a little wife who stood behind the counter and had worked almost as hard as he but somehow or other the customers wouldnt come then she had a baby was laid up for a time he had to engage some one to take her place and at that time he had about fifteen shillings left in the world i used to be shaved there every day then i knew all about it i used to hear him when he thought no one was listening go and call a cheerful word up the stairsshop full of customers sold another bottle of hair restorer or something of that sort then some one lent him a fiver and by jove he turned the corner hes doing well now thats his wifethe plump little woman whos straightening his tie they come here every wednesday night and they can afford it yet he was up against it badly once julien thats right look at him be interested hes a commonlooking little beast isnt hebut hes got a stout heart  i think julien said that i could guess the name of the man who lent him the fiver  youd be a mug if you couldnt kendricks retorted its doing that sort of thing that helps you to smile sometimes when the knocks come i tell you julien some of the peoplethese small shopkeepers especiallydo have the devil of a fight to get their ounce of pleasure out of life nothings made easy for them they dont know anything about that big westend world with pleasures tuned up to the latest pitch where you do even your work with every luxury at hand to make it easy theres a little chap therean italian see him hes sitting by the side of the old man with the gray beard that mans his father they both landed over here with scarcely a copper the young fellow worked like a slavesixteen shillings a week i think he was getting and he kept the old man on it then he lost his job couldnt get another the old man had to go to the workhouse the young man slept on the embankment ate free soup picked up scraps lived on the garbage heap of life he pulled himself together though got another job improved it saved a few shillings drove up in a cab and took the old man out look at them now hes got a little tailors shop not a hundred yards from here and somehow or other one or two people on the stagetheyre a goodhearted lothave taken him up he gets lots of work and brings the old man here now and then for a treat how are you pietro he called across the room when are you going to send me that coat along  the young man grinned  too many orders to make you that coat sir he declared  kendricks smiled  no one can deny that i need a new coat he said i told pietro when things were slack that he could make me one but he gets lots of orders now see the little girl in the corner shes going outno shes going to stay here theyve found her room at that table i suppose youd turn your nose up at her because she has a lot too much powder on her cheeks and you dont like that lace collar around her neck it isnt clean i know and the makeup on her face is clumsy must be uncomfortable too but shes done her best shes been dancing at the hippodrome this afternoon probably rehearsing afterwards shes got an hour now before she goes back to the evening performance shes taking the eighteenpenny dinner you see shell get a glass of chianti free with it i am in luck tonight i can tell you about nearly all these people her name is bessie hazellsarah ann jinks very likely but thats what she calls herself anyway she married an acrobat two years ago and they started doing quite well then he got a cough had to give up work the doctors all shook their heads at him wanted to tell him it was consumption bless you she wouldnt listen to it she got him down to bournemouth somehow and they patched him up he came back and started again caught cold and had another bad spell still she wouldnt have it that there was anything serious the matter with him hed be all right she said if it werent for the climate and every night she danced minddanced twice a day shes quite clever they saymight have done well if shed only herself to think of and could spare a little of her money for lessons not she she sent him to davos paid for it somehow hes back again now he cant go on the stage but hes got a light job somewhere i dont know that hes earning anything particular theyve got a baby to keep but they do it all right between them she isnt pleasant to look at is she whats that matter shes a bit of real life anyhow  why didnt you bring me here before kendricks julien asked  the man leaned back and laughed  ask yourself that question not me he replied yousir julien portel caricatured as the bestdressed man in the house of commons member of the most fashionable clubs brilliant debater successful politician future prime minister and all that sort of twaddle you were living too far up in the clouds my friend to come down here you see i am not offering you much sympathy julien i dont think you need it you were soaring up to the skies just because of your gifts and your position and your opportunities you are down now well youre thundering sorry for yourself i dont know that im sorry for you ill tell you in ten years time by jove heres your sandyheaded little friend  the man with the girl upon his arm had entered the room and had taken seats at a table in the corner for which apparently they had been waiting julien looked at them curiously  why he exclaimed suddenly leaning across the table i remember him now hes at the shopi mean hes an intelligence man  kendricks nodded  just the sort of inconspicuouslooking person who could go anywhere without being noticed  i recollect him quite well julien continued its not in my department of course but i remember being told he was a very useful little beggar  i should say without a doubt kendricks declared that he was at present working hard for the safety and welfare of the british empire if youve suddenly recognized the man ill tell you who the girl is shes a manicurist at the milan  julien looked round and watched them for a moment curiously again he noticed that his interest in the young man was at least reciprocated  the fellow has recognized me of course he said you know kendricks i remember two or three years ago a most amazing item of news was brought to usone that made a real difference toothrough a manicurist  shouldnt be a bit surprised kendricks replied  things drop out in the most unexpected places as youd find out if youd been a journalist  she was sent for into the room of some princessat claridges i think it was or one of the westend hotelsand while she was there a man came from one of the inner rooms and said a few words in russian the girl had been in st petersburg and understood it made quite a difference i remember the story  might have been the same man and the same manicurist kendricks remarked  julien shook his head  there was trouble about the manicurist he said and she had to leave the country shes in south africa now  i cant say that i like the appearance of the fellow kendricks declared dont funk the soup julienits better than it looks hes a slimylooking sort of chap i have a theory that the modern sort of secret service agent ought to be a person like myselfbreezy and obvious julien if that girl doesnt stop gazing at you sideways youll be in trouble with your late employee  julien looked across at the opposite table the girl as he had noticed before was stealing frequent glances at him for some reason or other she seemed anxious to attract his attention  quite a conquest kendricks murmured drink some more of that chianti man and bring some color to your cheeks theres a charming little manicurist wants to flirt with you what teeth and what a smile  considering that she has been listening to my history for the last quarter of an hour i imagine that her interest is of a less sentimental nature julien said i have probably been pointed out to her as the biggest fool in christendom  not you kendricks declared i assure you that i am a critic in such matters she looks when the young man who is with her is engaged upon his dinner or speaking to the waiter i am not positive even that she wants to flirt julien i think she wants to say something to you  julien laughed  what shall i do present myself bah he added almost fiercely i wish the girl would keep her black eyes to herself i want to tell you this kendricks youve talked some splendid common sense to me without going out of your way to do it i am not going to whine now or at any other time but as long as i live i never want anything more to do with a woman that sounds about the most futile and emptyheaded thing a man can sayi know that but there it is i tell you the very thought of them makes me shudder theyre like pampered highlygroomed animals with their mouths open for the titbits of life they have to be fed with whatever food it may be they crave for and thats the end of it  kendricks motioned with his head across the room to where the little woman with the blackened eyebrows was eating her dinner  what about that he asked  i dont know anything about that sort julien admitted what you told me sounded like one of the things you read of in newspapers and never believe i dont believe it mind you i dont say its false but i dont believe it because i have never spoken to the woman whom i could imagine capable of such unselfishness if i patch up the pieces again kendricks he added and his face was suddenly very dark and very setthe face of an older man whatever cement i use it wont be the cement of love or any sentiment whatsoever connected with women  kendricks nodded  its my belief he began then he stopped short julien he continued kindly youre nothing but a big baby you think youve moved in the big places so you have in a way but there was a hideous mistake about your life youve never had to build no one can climb who doesnt build first these readymade ladders dont count now he added dropping his voice and glancing quickly across the room you will have an opportunity to put into force your new and magnificent principles of misogyny our little sandyheaded friend has been summoned from the room i saw the commissionaire come up and whisper in his ear mademoiselle is writing a note a hundred to one it is to you  julien frowned he too turned his head and he met the girls eyes she was looking at him curiously it was not the look of the woman who invites so much as the look of the woman who appeals for an understanding who has something to say she smiled ever so faintly and touched with her finger the scrap of paper which she thrust into the waiters hand then she bent once more over her plate the man came across to julien  for you monsieur he announced and laid it by the side of juliens plate  read it kendricks whispered across the table for he had been quick to see his companions first impulse  why should i julien said coldly i have no desire to have anything to do with that young person what can she have to say to me  nevertheless read it kendricks repeated  julien unrolled the scrap of paper with reluctant fingers there were only a few words written there in hasty pencil  monsieur there is a friend of mine whom you must see call at number 17 avenue de st paul and ask for madame christophor do not attempt to speak to me this is for your good  juliens fingers were upon the note to destroy it but again kendricks stopped him  julien he insisted dont be an idiot the little girl knows who you are she cant imagine that you are in the humor just now for flirtations put the note in your pocket and call one cant tell your life has been so artificial that youve probably left off believing in any adventures outside storybooks my life leads me into different places and i never neglect an opportunity like that  a sister manicurist i expect julien replied scornfully a palmist or some creature of that sort  kendricks hammered upon the table for the waiter  one takes ones chances he agreed but i do not think that the little girl over there would send you upon a fools errand there are other things in life you know julien you carry in your head political secrets which would be worth a great deal there may be danger in that call  julien looked at him with faintly curling lip  tell me exactly what you mean he asked  kendricks shrugged his shoulders the waiter had arrived and he gave him a vociferous order  listen he said i could hand you out a hundred surmises and each one of them ought to be sufficient to induce you to keep that appointment you leave hereshall we say under a cloudpresumably disgusted with life with the government which gives you no second chance with your country which discards you and you have been undersecretary of state for foreign affairs cant you conceive that this woman on whom you are to call might make suggestions to you which would at least be amusing dont look so incredulous julien remember youve lived in the stilted places i havent i believe in the underground world you must know for yourself that a great deal of the truth leaks up through the gratings  that is true enough julien admitted but somehow or other  let it go at that kendricks interrupted promise me that you will call at that address  julien laughed  yes ill call he promised  then look across at the little girl and nod kendricks suggested shes watching you all the time anxiously the man hasnt come back yet  julien turned his head half unwillingly the girl was leaning across the table her eyes fixed steadfastly upon his her lips were parted her eyebrows were slightly raised as though in question she had been holding a menu before her face to shield her from the casual observer but the moment julien turned his head she lowered it he inclined his head slowly a curious expression of relief took the place of that appearance of strained anxiety her face became natural once more she laid down the menu and took a sip of wine from her glass kendricks looked across at julien and raised his glass to his lips  we will drink my dear julien he said to your visit to madame christophor and what may come of it     chapter vii   coffee for three   admit kendricks insisted that you have dined well  i have dined amply julien replied  kendricks frowned  i am not satisfied he declared  the entrecôte was wonderful also the omelette julien admitted i will supplement amply with well if you wish but the insistent note about this dinner is certainly its amplitude i have not eaten so much for ages  kendricks was filling his pipe  cigars or cigarettes you must order for yourself he said i know nothing of them the coffee is before you i will be frank with youit is not good the brandy however is harmless  julien lit a cigarette and leaned back in his chair just then the sandy young man reentered the room he hastened to his place but instead of resuming it stood by the side of the girl talking he seemed to be suggesting some course of which she disapproved pointing to her unfinished dinner kendricks nodded his head slowly  the young man has to leave he remarked he wishes mademoiselle to accompany him she declines he is annoyed behold a lovers tiff he has placed the money for the dinner upon the table he shakes her hand very politely behold he goes mademoiselle shrugs her shoulders she orders from the menu she remains alone my dear julien if you will you can prosecute your conquest the young man has departed  julien glanced across the room he met the girls eyes and once again he saw in them that curious almost impersonal invitation  she wants something kendricks declared i am going over to see what it can be carlo  he summoned the waiter and asked him a question quickly in italian  the man says that her companion is not returning he remarked rising i am going to interview the young lady  julien shrugged his shoulders  as you will  kendricks crossed the room his pipe still in his hand the girl watched him come for a moment and then looked down upon the tablecloth she was at the end of a table laid for four or five people but only two men were left at the extreme end  mademoiselle kendricks said my friend thanks you for your message his curiosity however is piqued is there not an opportunity now for explaining further  she regarded her questioner a little doubtfully  who are you she asked  kendricks sighed  my dear young lady he answered i flattered myself that i possessed a personality which no one could mistake furthermore i am a constant patron here  i have never been here in my life before the girl told him  then your ignorance shall be pardoned kendricks declared my name is david kendricks i am a journalist i ought to be an editor but the fact remains that i am a mere collector of news a bringer together of those trifles which go to make such prints as these he added touching her evening paper interesting  a journalist she repeated glancing up at him yes i might have guessed that are you a friend of sir julien portel  i think i may call myself a friend kendricks admitted we were at college together  she rose composedly to her feet  then i will take my coffee at your table she decided you may present me i am mademoiselle senn  kendricks hesitated  you may not find my friend in the most amiable of moods he began   the girl waved her hand  it is to be explained she declared to tell you the truth i was surprised to see him even in so out of the way a restaurant as this  he leaves tonight for the continent kendricks told her  so i heard the girl replied come  sir julien watched their approach and the frown upon his aristocratic forehead though thin was distinct kendricks however took no notice of it and the girl pretended that she had not seen  julien the former announced holding a chair for mademoiselle i am permitted the pleasure of presenting you to mademoiselle senn who already knows your name mademoiselle sent you a message a few minutes ago if she is goodnatured she may choose to explain it if not what does it matter mademoiselle will take her coffee with us  julien rose to his feet and bowed very slightly  we have only a moment or two to spare he said as i am leaving london tonight  she looked at him and smiled oddly she was a very typical young frenchwoman of her classroundfaced with trim little figure black eyes and smart but simple hat not really goodlooking except for the depth of her clear eyes and yet with a command of her person and movements which was not without its charm  monsieur is not too gallant she murmured but one is inclined to forgive him if i may take my coffee i will go monsieur has promised me that he will call and see madame  your friend in paris julien remarked a little doubtfully  ah i dare not call her that the girl continued madame is different but i know that it is her wish that you call and i know that it would be for your welfare  is it necessary julien asked coldly that you should be so mysterious after all you know the thing on the face of it is impossible madame probably does not know of my existence and why should you take it for granted that i am going abroad  oh la la the girl interrupted but you amuse one madame knows everything which she desires to know as to your going to france monsieur over there she added moving her head backwards told me so some minutes ago  and how the dickens did he know and what right had he to talk about my affairs julien demanded with all an englishmans indignation at his movements having been discussed by strangers  i suppose that it is his business to know those things she replied sipping her coffee he is a very mysterious young man he takes a room sometimes at the milan hotel and he sends for me to manicure his hands then he asks me very clever questions and i look down and i give himvery clever answers then he thinks perhaps that his methods are not quite the best and he sends me a great box of chocolates some stalls for the theatre some flowerswhy not then he comes again to be manicured and he asks more questions but i know so little then sometimes not very often he brings me out to dine imagine for yourself monsieur she went on with a wave of the hand the excitement the wonder of all this to a poor french girl and again he asks questions but again i know so little and then in the midst of our dinner his employer has sent for him he has to go on a journey it is sad is it not he would like me to go with him to the station to see him off but i she shrugged her shoulders why should i leave before i have finished my dinner in truth he wearies me that young man i do not think sir julien portel that englishmen are very clever  as a race julien declared grimly i agree with you i think that most men are unutterable fools but this young admirer of yourswhat are these questions which he asks you so often and what business is he in that he should be compelled to leave you to hurry away  ah monsieur she answered it is you now who ask questions why should i tell you indeed more than i tell him  julien smiled  perhaps because it was a matter of moment to him whether you replied or not whereas frankly i only ask you these questions out of the idlest curiosity  also a little she remarked to make conversation is it not so very well then sir julien portel let me tell you this if you do not know who that young man is i do not wonder that you find it necessary to catch the nine oclock train to the continent tonight and to give up that delightful work of yours where you try to keep the peace between all these wicked nations and to get the lions share of everything for your great greedy country if you do not know who that young man is you have not the head for detail the memory which goes to the making of politicians  julien leaned back in his chair and laughed softly but genuinely even kendricks seemed a little taken aback  upon my word the latter exclaimed this is an interesting young person mademoiselle i congratulate you you have the gifts  interesting indeed julien agreed sitting up in his place mademoiselle to save my reputation with you i must confess i do know who the young man is he is in the intelligence branch of the secret service of the british foreign officenumber 3 department  the girl nodded several times  what you call it i do not know she said he is just one of those ordinary people who go about to collect little items of information for your government that is why i have received from him four pounds of chocolate at least a sovereigns worth of roses four stalls for the theatrewhich i do believe that he had given to him because they were for plays that no one goes to see and tonight a dinnersuch a dinner messieurs with chianti that burned my tongue  this kendricks declared is quite a bright young lady mademoiselle i trust that we shall become better acquainted  and in the meantime julien inquired what are these wonderful items of information which you carry with you and which this unfortunate young man fails so utterly to elicit  ah well she sighed i am by profession a manicurist but some freak of nature gave me the power of keeping my mouth closed of looking as though i knew a good deal but of saying so little now messieurs what could a poor girl know in the way of secrets for which that young man would get credit if he had succeeded in eliciting them what could i know indeed i sit on my little stool and sometimes there are great people who give me their hands and they are thoughtful and sometimes i ask questions and they answer me absently because after all what does it mattera manicurist from the shop downstairs earning her thirty shillings a week and anxious to be agreeable for the sake of her tip and then sometimes while i am there they dictate letters or a caller comes or the telephone rings one does not think of the manicure girl at such a time fortunately there are some like me who know so well how to keep silent to say nothing to be dumb  the methods of that young man kendricks asserted were crude now young lady consider my position i represent a power greater than the power of governments i represent a press which is greedy for personal news have you trimmed lately the nails of a duchess if so tell me what she wore her favorite oath any trifling expression likely to be of interest to the british public and instead of roses i will send you carnations instead of deadhead tickets i will take you myself to the gaiety instead of a dinner at the café lathénée i will take you to supper at the milan  your friend mademoiselle declared smiling at julien is quite an intelligent person i like him very much but i wish he would not smoke that pipe and i should like to buy him a necktie  julien kendricks sighed the bohemian has no chance against such a model as you  i do not think she remarked looking julien in the eyes that sir julien portel cares very much for womenjust now at any rate  julien frowned he absolutely declined to answer the challenge in her dark eyes  mademoiselle he said when i present myself to this madame christophor do i deliver any message from you do i explain my visit  the girl shook her head slowly  it will not be necessary she told him madame christophor will know all about you she will be expecting you  he smiled scornfully  it would be a pity to disappoint a lady with such a remarkable knack of foretelling things supposing however i change my mind and visit st petersburg instead  she raised her handsan expressive gesture  there is no madame christophor in st petersburg i think that you will be very illadvised if you go there many of the elements which go to the making of life wait for you in paris in st petersburg you would be a stranger the life is not there  she rose to her feet briskly  good night monsieur le bohemian she said remember that you have only to accept my little gift of a necktie to let me take you to a coiffeur whom i know of and i will dine with you when you choose good night sir julien i think i envy you  julien laughed the idea seemed odd to him  i fancy you would be in a minority mademoiselle he declared  at least she reminded him you are going to see madame christophor  she nodded and left them a little abruptly kendricks paid their bill and they descended into the street a few minutes later the commissionaire called a taxi for them and they drove toward charingcross  my friend kendricks said if i had you here for another week cut off from your old life id show you some things that would astonish you its good fortune and these wellordered ways that keep a man a prig even after hes finished with oxford the man who lives in the clouds of mayfair knows nothing of the real life of this city  some day ill come back and be your pupil julien promised youre a good fellow david youve given me something to think about at any rate something to think about besides my own misfortunes  thats just what i set out to do kendricks declared there are plenty of bigger tragedies than yours loose in the world watch the people julienthe people whom such men as you glance over or through as of no account the common people the units of life strip them bare and they arent so very different you know try and feel for a moment what they feel look at the little dressmaker there going over to paris to buy models hanging on to her husbands arm shes probably got a shop in the suburbs and this trip is a daring experiment see how earnestly they are talking about it i dont think that they have too easy a time to make ends meet do you see that old lady there clinging to her daughter how she hates to part with her she is going to a situation without a doubt and paris isnt too easy a place for a girl with hair and eyes like hers in her heart i think that the old lady is remembering that then look at that little old man with the tired eyes carrying his two valises himself to save the hire of a porter cant you tell by the air of him that he has had an unsuccessful business journey poor fellow its a hard struggle for life julien if you get in the wrong row youve no one dependent upon you you dont know the worst agony that can wring a mans heart got your ticket and everything eh and that looks like your servant are you taking him with you  julien shook his head  i shall have to do without a manservant i never had much money you know david  so much the better kendricks declared heartily it gives you a final chance the gutters of the world are full of good fellows who have been ruined through stepping into a sufficient income  they found a carriage and arranged juliens few belongings presently mademoiselles companion came hurrying up the platform followed by a porter carrying his dressingcase a short distance behind mademoiselle too was walking humming to herself  company to boulogne for you julien kendricks pointed out your little man from number 3 branch is on your track  julien smiled the young man never glanced towards their carriage as he passed but mademoiselle who was still a few steps behind made a wry face at kendricks  i believe she knew that he was going across the latter declared  i wonder if he too julien murmured has to call on madame christophor  the whistle sounded kendricks put out his great hands  good luck to you julien old fellow he said stand up to life like a man and look it in the face i tell you i havent been gassing tonight id hate to pose as a moralist but i do believe that misfortunes are often blessings in disguise and i tell you ive a sort of faith in that little french girl she gives one to think as she herself remarked look up madame christophor dont be surprised to see me at any moment i generally turn up in paris every few weeks or so good luck to you  julien leaned out of the window and waved his hand to kendricks as the train moved slowly around the curve the last face he saw upon the platform however was the face of mademoiselle     chapter viii   in paris   for exactly a month julien disappeared at the end of that time looking very brown a shade thinner and possessed of a knowledge of the older towns of normandy which would not have disgraced a guidebook he arrived one cold gray morning at the gare du nord during all this time he had scarcely seen one familiar face it was an unpleasant shock for him as he waited for his baggage in the customs house to realize that he was being watched from behind a pile of trunks by the little man who had shown so much interest in him at the café lathénée on the night he had left england the sight somehow annoyed him he crossed the room and accosted his late subordinate  what is your name he asked coldly you are in the intelligence department i believe  my name is foster sir julien the young man replied after a moments hesitation  what are you doing over here  the young man hesitated  you will excuse me sir julien he said slowly but i am responsible only to the permanent officials in control of my office besides  you can tell me at least how long you have been in paris julien interrupted  since the night sir julien when you came as far as boulogne  may i ask julien demanded whether i am going to be subject to your espionage  the young man whose name was foster looked blandly at a pile of luggage which was just arriving  i am not at liberty sir julien he said to explain my instructions  julien shrugged his shoulders  do as you like of course at the same time let me tell you that you irritate me keep out of my sight as much as possible it will be better for you  julien turned and left him there declared his luggage and was driven to a quiet hotel in the rue de rivoli there he had a bath changed his clothes and strolled up the champs Élysées towards the bois the sun had come out and the avenue was crowded with automobiles and carriages he walked steadily on until he reached the first of the cafés in the bois he took a chair and watched the crowd a peculiar sensation of loneliness oppressed him a loneliness of which he had been scarcely conscious during this last months wanderings among the quiet places paris had seemed so different to him on his last visit he was surrounded by friends and people who were anxious to become his friends he was in charge of a difficult mission which he was conscious of conducting with skill everywhere he was meeting english people of his own order all delighted to see him all pleased with his notice his few days in paris were merely a change in the kaleidoscope from london the lifeeverything elsewas the same this time he was like a man cast upon a desert island he sat at his little table sipping a glass of vermouth and conscious that no man in paris had fewer friends the clubs were closed to him there were no official visits to pay no calls to make no familiar faces to look for he was a man who had had his day a man disgraced a man in whom the people had lost faith who was dead politically and socially he thought his position over carefully from every point of view it was ruin utter and complete he had disclosed a valuable political secret to a woman who had not hesitated to make use of it nothing could be more ignoble he tried to fancy for himself some new life under altered conditions but everywhere he seemed to run up against some possibility some combination of circumstances which included a share in things which were absolutely finished his brain refused to fashion for him the thought of any life which could leave outside everything which had been of account to him up till now even in london among the working classes it might have been easier he remembered those few vivid speeches of kendricks what a gift the man had always he seemed to see big things in life smouldering underneath the lives of these ordinary peoplebig things unsuspected invisible there was nothing of the sort to be found here the only paris julien had ever known was closed to him paris the vicious repelled him instinctively he was here he had even looked forward to coming but now that he had arrived there was nothing for him to do after all he had better have found some far distant corner in switzerland or italy there was no club for him to go to no interest in perusing the newspapers no visits from ambassadors to think about the puzzles of his daily life were ended there was nothing for him to do where he was but to eat and to drink and to sleep  he lunched at a restaurant of which he had never heard before and there to his anger almost at the next table he found foster with a trace of his former imperiousness of manner he summoned him the young man rose after a moments hesitation and obeyed the mandate  what are you doing here julien demanded  lunching sir the young man replied the place has been recommended to me i do not know paris well  you lie julien declared unless you knew paris well you wouldnt be here for number 3 branch tell me are you still watching me  that is a question sir julien which as i said before i am not at liberty to answer  julien drew a little breath between his teeth  look here he continued i want to warn you that i am a badtempered man you can write home if you like and tell them that you met me coming out of the german embassy and the russian embassy and the italian embassy with a list of prices in my hands for different pieces of information is that what youre afraid of eh  sir julien the young man answered i have to make reports only it is not my business to question the necessity for them  julien laughed after all the little man was right  well perhaps i do need looking after is there any particular place where you would like me to dine i dont want to bring you out into the byways if i can help it  the young man excused himself politely julien finished his luncheon and then took a carriage back to his hotel he found halfadozen visiting cards in his box and glanced at them eagerly every one of them was from the representative of a newspaper he tore them into pieces left a curt message for their bearers and went up to his room a telegram was lying upon his bureau he tore it open and read  call on madame christophor this afternoon  he frowned and threw the unsigned telegram into a wastepaperbasket  that decides it he muttered to himself i will not call upon madame christophor  nevertheless he changed into calling attire and presently strolled out once more into the sunshine from habit he turned into the champs Élysées the sight of a group of acquaintances drove him into a side street he walked for a short distance and then paused to see his whereabouts he was in the avenue de st paul he studied the numbers exactly opposite was number 17 he stood there gazing at the house and at that moment a large automobile glided up to the front door the footman sprang down and a lady descended passing within a few feet of him she was tall very elegant and her eyes gaining perhaps a little color from the pallor of her cheeks were the most beautiful shade of violetblue which he had ever seen she was a woman whom it was impossible not to notice julien stood quite still watching her the footman who had stepped down in advance had rung the bell and the postern door already stood open the lady did not at once enter she was looking at julien this then was madame christophor he was aware at that moment of two distinct impressionsone was that she knew perfectly well who he was the other that at any cost however gauche it might seem it was better for him to ignore the faint gleam of recognition which already lent the dawn of a gracious smile to her lips  the woman was certainly expecting him to speak every second her hesitation seemed more purposeful julien however with an effort which was almost savage set his teeth and walked on she looked after him for a moment and began to laugh softly to herself julien walked steadily on till he had reached the corner of the street then he turned away abruptly and without glancing around he was angry with himself angry at the sound of that faint musical laugh he had quite made up his mind not to call upon madame christophor it would in fact now be impossible he would never be able to explain his avoidance of her  he was in a part of paris of which he knew nothing but he walked on aimlessly anxious only to escape the vicinity of the clubs and of the fashionable thoroughfares suddenly he was conscious that an automobile had drawn up close to the curbstone by his side the footman sprang lightly down and accosted him  monsieur he announced madame christophor has sent her automobile she would be happy to receive you at once  julien glanced inside the automobile it was daintily upholstered in white a pile of cushions lay on the seat there was a glove upon the floor the faint fragrance of roses seemed to steal out almost he fancied that the womans face was there leaning a little towards him with the curious smile about the lips the wonderful eyes glowing into his then he set his teeth  you had better inform your mistress he said that there is some mistake i have not the honor of the acquaintance of madame christophor you have followed the wrong person  the man hesitated he seemed perplexed  but monsieur he persisted madame pointed you out herself it was only because of a block in the roadway that we were not able to catch you up before we have indeed never lost sight of you  julien shook his head pray assure madame he said of my most respectful regrets i have not the honor of her acquaintance  he walked on the two men sat for a moment on the box of the car watching him then they turned around and the car disappeared julien jumped into a little carriage and drove back to his hotel as he passed through into the office the clerk leaned forward  monsieur is desired upon the telephone he announced  julien frowned  who is it  the man shrugged his shoulders and pointed to the booth julien hesitated then he stepped inside and held the receiver to his ear  who is this he asked  a very slow musical voice answered him he never for a moment had a doubt as to whose it might be  is this sir julien portel  this is julien portel he answered who is it speaking  i am henriette christophor the voice replied i had word from england sir julien portel that you were coming to see me  i shall do myself that honor julien assured her before i leave paris  you were not polite the voice continued that you did not come this afternoon  madame julien said i am not here to make acquaintances it is true that i promised to call upon you i do not know why i do not know whom i promised i do not know for what reason i was asked to come since i have promised however and you are kind enough to desire it i will come  and why not now the voice persisted you are alone in paris are you not i have something to say to you something which is best said quickly  julien hesitated  you will come the voice begged my automobile will be at your hotel in ten minutes you shall come and if you dislike after all to make that call you shall drive with me if you prefer it monsieur if you please  i will be ready julien answered  he hung up the receiver and walked out into the hall he was angry with himself because only an hour ago he had told himself that he would not make that call he was angry too because the fact of his making it or not making it had assumed a ridiculous importance in his eyes  he walked to the bar and filled his case with cigarettes then he took up a monthly magazine and read his own official resignation was dealt with in a political article of some significance it interested him curiously one sentence in particular he read several times  it is not our desire to play the alarmist but we would point out to great britain that she may at any time within the next few weeks be called upon to face a situation of great gravity and we cannot help expressing our regret that when that time comes the country should be deprived of the advice sound judgment and experience of a man who notwithstanding his youth has already made his mark in european politics  julien flung the paper down what that situation might be he knew perhaps better than any man  the porter hurried up to him  there is a lady outside who inquires for monsieur he announced     chapter ix   madame christophor   she held out an ungloved hand to him as he stepped up to the automobile having gained her ends she was disposed to be merciful  this is very kind of you sir julien she murmured i really was most anxious to have you visit me will you step in please and drive with me a little way one converses so easily and it would perhaps amuse you more than to sit in my rooms  you are very thoughtful julien replied i will come with pleasure if i may  he seated himself by her side  you must put your stick and gloves in the rack there she continued and make yourself quite comfortable we drive a short distance into the country if you do not mind  i am entirely at your service he answered  he was firmly determined to remain wholly unimpressed by whatever she said or did yet even in those first few moments the sweetness of her voice and the delicate correctness of her english sounded like music to him there was a suspicion of accent too which puzzled him  we are not altogether strangers you know she went on i have seen you before several times i think the last time that you were in paris you sat in a box at auteuil with some friends of mine  somehow or other he was conscious of a certain embarrassment he was not at his best with this woman and he found it hard almost impossible to escape from commonplaces  it was my misfortune that i did not see you he remarked my visit was rather a momentous one i dare say i paid less attention than usual to my surroundings  tell me she asked it was my little friend emilie was it not who persuaded you to come and see me  it was a little girl with whose name even i was unacquainted julien replied i must admit that i scarcely took her request seriously i could not conceive anything which you might have to say which could justify the intrusion of a perfect stranger  but you she reminded him are not a perfect stranger you have been a public man you see i am not afraid of hurting you because i think that you will soon get over that little sensitiveness i know all about youeverything you trusted a woman ah monsieur it is dangerous that  madame he said looking into her wonderful eyes one makes that mistake once perhaps in a lifetimenever again  the woman who deceives she sighed makes it so difficult for all those who come after i suppose already in your mind i figure as a sort of adventuress is it not so  certainly madame he answered calmly it never occurred to me to doubt but that you were something of the sort  she half closed her eyes and laughed softly to herself moving her head like a child as though from sheer pleasure  it is delicious this frankness she exclaimed ah what a pity that you did not come before that other woman had destroyed all your faith we might perhaps have been friends who can tell  it is possible he assented  so you believe that i am an adventuress she continued you think that i sent for you probably to try and steal one by one all those wonderful secrets which i suppose you have stored up at the back of your head one cannot be undersecretary of state for foreign affairs without knowing things keep them to yourself sir julien i ask you no questions  then why he demanded did you insist upon this visit from me and why did the little manicurist who is a perfect stranger to me insist also that i should come to you  she smiled and looked down at her hands for a moment  now if i answer all your questions sir julien she said you will have no more curiosity left and when your curiosity is gone perhaps some measure of your interest may go too can you not bring yourself to believe that i may have had personal reasons for desiring your acquaintance  madame he answered no i cannot bring myself to believe that  again she laughed  i think she declared that it is your candor which makes you englishmen so attractive do you believe that i am a dangerous person sir julien  he looked at her coldly and dispassionately  i think he decided that you might be very dangerous indeed to a susceptible person  but not to you  certainly not to me he admitted as you have already told me it is within your knowledge that i am paying the price for having trusted a woman  she nodded  it is a fine sort of ruin after all not to trust is generally proof of a mean and doubting disposition  you are probably right madame he agreed is it permitted to remind you that we have been together for some time and you have not yet enlightened me as to your reasons for seeking my acquaintance  cant you believe that it was a whim she asked  no  remember that i saw you when you were here before she persisted  i have no recollection of having met you  yet i can tell you nearly all that you did on that last visit of yours you dined one night at the embassy one night at the travelers club with a party of four one night with the ministercourcelles you were two hours with him on the afternoon of the day you dined with him you managed to snatch an hour at the races and to lunch at the pré catelan on your way you lunched i believe with monsieur le duc de st simon and his friends  your knowledge of my movements he declared is very flattering it suggests an interest in me i admit but i have yet to be convinced that that interest is in any way personal  she looked at him from under the lids of her eyes  what is it sir julien that you possess then which you fear that i might steal  he returned her gaze boldly i am a discarded minister he said i might reasonably be supposed to be suffering from a sense of wrong why should it not occur to a clever woman like you that it might be a favorable moment to obtain a little information concerning one or two political problems of some importance are you interested in such matters madame  she leaned back in her seat and laughed he sat and watched her distinctly she was in certain ways the most beautiful woman he had ever seen it was true that she was pale and that her neck was a trifle thin but her face was so aristocratic and yet so piquant the color of her eyes so delightful her mouth so soft and yet so humorous she laid her hand upon his arm  oh my dear dear englishman she exclaimed heaven indeed has sent you to me that i should not die of ennui you do not know who i ami madame christophor  i have no idea who you are he assured her i have never seen you before i know of no other name than the one by which i was told to ask for you  she leaned a little closer to him  come she said you see me for what i am i shall not rob you i shall not drug you i shall not try to tear secrets out of your throat by any medieval methods we are neither of us of the order of those who seek adventures in vulgar fashion and expect always a vulgar termination cant we be friends for a timecompanions paris is an empty city for me just now and for youyou must avoid those whom you know it follows that you must be lonely let me show you my paris  julien looked steadfastly out at the country at the flying hedges the tall avenues of poplar trees in the distance the clumsy farm wagon coming across the hayfield the bluepetticoated women who marched by its sideanywhere to escape for a moment or two from her eyes it was absurd that he should feel even this faint interest in her proposition it was only a month since the blow had fallen only a month since the girl to whom he had been engaged had sent him away with a sigh and a little handshake it was only a month since life lay in splinters around him it was much too soon to feel the slightest interest in the things which she was proposing  madame christophor he said you are very kind but i tell you frankly that i should accept your proposition with more pleasure if you had been of my own sex  you have become a womanhater  i cannot trust a woman he answered coldly all the time i have the feeling of insecurity i fear that it must sound ungallant if i tell you what is the sober truththat your sex for the present has lost all charm for me  she closed her eyes perhaps from behind the mask of her still face she was laughing at him  do you think i dont understand that a little she murmured never mind for tonight at least i will be sexless you can believe that i am a man i think you will find that i can talk to you about most of the things that men know of politics we will leave alone you would mistrust me at once arti can tell you of our modern french painters i can tell you about these two wonderful russians who are painting in their studio here i can tell you what to look for at the new exhibitions what studios to visiti can take you to them if you will or old parisdoes that interest you have you ever seen it properly i know my old paris very well indeed or would you rather talk of books there have been many years when i have done little else but read tell me that we may be companions for a time you have nothing to lose indeed and i have so much to gain  madame julien replied i do not trust you you are doubtless an agreeable companion and as such i am willing to spend a short time with you this is an ungracious acceptance of your suggestion but it is the best i am capable of  she clapped her hands  it is something after all she declared and let me tell you this my friend she added leaning over you have been frank with me you have told me that you hated my sex that you distrusted us all very well i will share your frankness i will tell you this neither am i any friend of your sex i too have my grievance i too have something in my heart of which i cannot speak which when i think of it makes me hate every male creature that walks the earth perhaps with that in my heart and what you have in yours we may meet and pass and meet again and pass and do one another no harm is that finished  by all means he agreed  her expression changed  come she said now you shall see that i have begun my plots i have brought you away from paris into the country places for what i wonder are you terrified  not in the least he assured her   brave fellow perhaps when you know the truth your heart will shake with fear you are going to dine in a country restaurant  that does not terrify me in the least he replied smiling i think that it will be charming  it is a tiny place she told him not very well known as yet soon i fear likely to become fashionable one sits at little tables on a lawn of the darkest green if the sun shines an umbrella of pink and white holland shades us quite close is the river and a field of buttercups there are flowers in the garden and so many shrubs that one can be almost alone and behind an old inn they cook simply but the trout comes from the river and it is cool  it sounds delightful julien admitted but madame indeed it is i who must be host  she shook her head  on the contrary it is by subtlety that i have brought you here and that i claim to be the giver of the feast you see you dine with me tonight you must ask me back again it is the custom of your country is it not  he smiled the automobile had turned in now up a short drive and stopped before a long low building down in the gardens they could see fairylights swinging in the faint breeze a short man with closecropped hair and a fierce black moustache and imperial came hastening out to greet them when he recognized madame christophor he bowed low  monsieur léon she said i bring an englishman to try your river trout you must give me a table near that great tree of lilac that smells so sweetly i order nothingyou understand but you must remember that monsieur is english he will want his champagne dry and his brandy very old is it not so my friend now i will give you into charge of monsieur le propriétaire here he shall show you where you can drink a little apéritif if you will he shall show you too where to find me presently  a trim maid came hurrying up and took possession of madame christophor julien followed his guide into a small reception room all pink and white  if monsieur desires to wash the proprietor explained he passes beyond there and for an apéritif  i will take anything you send me julien declared what is the name of this place monsieur  they call it the maison léon dor monsieur the man replied it is my own ideaa country house i purchased once for myself but found it too far alas from paris in the fine weather we could if we chose have half paris here when the cold days come there is nobody monsieur permits  he departed and julien strolled to the window in the portion of the gardens over which he looked were smaller tables set out simply for those who desired to take their coffee and liqueurs or apéritif out of doors julien glanced out idly enough at the little group of people dotted about here and there then his face suddenly darkened at a table within a few yards of where he stood were seated foster and a man whose back was turned towards him  juliens first impulse was to retire out of sight for the window was open and he himself imperfectly concealed by the muslin blind then as he was on the point of retiring he distinctly heard the sound of his own name the two men were speaking in a low tone but a slight breeze was blowing into the room julien stood still and listened the man who was a stranger to him was speaking to foster  the woman is first it is true he muttered she will pump him dry no doubt but what matter she may even put him on his guard but i say again what matter there is a price for everything a price or  the mans voice died away and julien heard nothing for some time then he saw foster shake his head  our service foster declared does not protect us in such a position it does not allow us to go to extremes i am supposed to be here to watch him but i am really powerless he might become your man or hers or any one elses i could do nothing but report  his companion leaned across the table  what you call your secret service julien heard him say is a farce you have no authority no scope you are too proud to ferret about as the others do you sit in dignified ease and wait for information to be brought to you my good foster you must learn to be a man we must teach you  again their voices became inaudible julien drew back into the room his heart was beating faster his brain was full of new thoughts from a place where he was absolutely secure he sat and gazed at foster and his companion presently the waiter entered with the apéritif julien gave him five francs  listen he said you see those two gentlemen sitting there  parfaitement monsieur the man replied  have you ever seen the elder one beforethe dark one with the glasses  the waiter hesitated  monsieur he said looking at the five francs in his hand monsieur le propriétaire here has strange notions he objects that we mention ever the name of any of his clients  why is that julien asked  how should one know monsieur the waiter answered only it seems that this place is a little distance from paris it is retired one finds seclusion here people meet i think in these gardens who do not care to be seen in paris there are some come here who whisper at the door to monsieur le propriétaire that their names must never be mentioned  one can understand that perhaps julien agreed but these are surely affairs of gallantry it is when the gentlemen bring ladies perhaps  the man shook his head and gesticulated an emphatic negative  monsieur he declared there are other things there are other things indeed this place is wellknown because there meet here often men who are interested in discussing serious matters i can tell monsieur alas the name of no one among the guests here if i attempted it it would mean my dismissal and there is no place in paris monsieur where the salaries are so good as here julien hesitated then he drew a louis from his pocket  listen he said you may rely upon my word no mention of it shall go outside this room take this louis for just the name of that gentleman with his back to you  the waiter took the louis  his name monsieur i cannot tell you but i will tell you what perhaps will do for monsieur as well the german ambassador comes sometimes here with a party of friends somewhere in the distance you will find the gentleman about whom you ask the german ambassador rides through the streets when paris is troubled somewhere close at hand you will find monsieur there the german ambassador he attends the races feeling perhaps is running a little high somewhere amongst the crowd who watch the races and very close to monsieur lambassadeur you will find monsieur there with the shoulders  julien drank his apéritif thoughtfully  thank you he said to the waiter you have earned your money you need have no fear  there was a knock at the door monsieur le propriétaire presented himself  monsieur he announced it is my honor to conduct you to the table reserved for madame and yourself madame awaits you     chapter x   better acquaintance   the gardens of the maison léon dor were in their way unique there was no extent of open space but the walks threaded everywhere a large shrubbery and in all sorts of corners and quiet places little dining tables had been placed scarcely any one was in sight of any other person although they were so close together that all the time there was a hum of voices in the distance down by the river a large gondola was passing slowly backwards and forwards on which an orchestra played soft music julien and madame christophor crossed the narrow strip of lawn together and followed monsieur léon into the graveled path bordered with fairy lamps  i have arranged for madame and monsieur he announced looking backwards a table near the lilac tree of which madame is so fond the perfume indeed is exquisite if madame pleases  they turned from the path on to another strip of lawn which they gained by rounding a large lilac bush here a small table was laid with the whitest of cloths and the most dazzling of silver an attentive waiter was already arranging an icepail in a convenient spot from here the gardens sloped gently to the river which was barely forty yards distant although it was scarcely twilight the men on the gondola were lighting the lamps  madame and monsieur will find this table removed from all chance visitors the proprietor declared if the dinner is not perfect permit that i wait upon you again a word to the waiter and i arrive madame monsieur  he retreated with a bow to each julien with a little laugh took his place at the table  madame he said your entertainment is charming  the entertainment is nothing madame replied but here at least is one advantagewe are really alone i do not know how you feel but the greatest rest in life to me is sometimes the solitude there is no one overlooking us there is no one likely to pass whom we know we are virtually cut off from all those who know us or whom we know my friend i would like you to remember this our first evening talk if you will or be silent for me it is equal i too have thoughts which i can summon at any time to bear me company and there is the river do you hear the soft flow of it and the rustle of the breeze in the shrubs the perfumes andlistenthe music ah sir julien i think that we give you over here some things which you do not easily find in your own country  you are right he agreed slowly you give us a better climate more sympathetic companionship a tenderer chicken a more artistic salad  at heart you are a materialist i perceive she declared  we all are he admitted everything depends upon our power of concealment  the service of dinner commenced almost at once there was something excessively peaceful in the scene the tables were so arranged that one heard nothing of the clatter of crockery the murmur of voices came like a pleasant undernote they talked lightly for some time of the english theatres of the stage generally some recent memoirsanything that came into their heads then julien was silent for several minutes he leaned slightly across the table their own lamp was lit now and through the velvety dusk her eyes seemed to glow with a new beauty  tell me he begged you spoke of yourself a little time ago as though you might have a personality at which i ought to have guessed are you a woman of society or an artist or merely an idler  i have known something of society she replied i believe i may say that i am something of an artist it is very certain that i am not an idler why ask me these questions let us forget to be serious tonight let us remember only that we are companions and that the hours as they pass are pleasant  it is a philosophy he murmured which brings its own retribution  she shrugged her shoulders  all happiness is lost she declared the moment you begin to try and define it it is a sensation not a state of being let us drift the waters are not dangerous for you or for me  her words chilled him with a sudden memory then in the act of helping himself to wine he paused some one had taken the table nearest to them dimly visible through the laurel bushes he heard the voice of the man who had been with foster giving the orders  listen  there was no need for him to have spoken curiously enough madame   christophor seemed also to have recognized the voice her hand fell upon juliens he looked at her in surprise her cheeks were blanched her eyes blazing  you hear that voice she whispered  julien nodded  it is the voice of the only person in the world she continued whom i absolutely hate  you know whose it is then  of course she replied  so do i he muttered i have never seen the mans face but i know a little about him  she shivered  come she said let us have our coffee later we have finished dinner and the moon is coming up if we walk to the bottom there we shall see it from the bend of the river and we shall escape from those men  he rose hastily to his feet she led the way down the path here and there they caught a glimpse of other tables as they passedlittle parties of two or four all very gay madame breathed more freely as they progressed presently they passed through an iron gate into a field already halfmown the perfume of the freshcut grass came to them with an almost overpowering sweetness her hand fell upon his arm  forgive me she begged i am not really a weak woman i do not think that there is any other sound in life which i hate so much as the sound of that voice  they walked in silence along the narrow path soon they reached the edge of the river a few steps further on was a seat of which they took possession in the distance the gondola on fire now with lamps was playing a waltz a bat flew for a moment about their heads somewhere in the woods a long way down the river a nightingale was singing  i am not often so foolish she murmured oncelet me tell you thisonce i had a dear little friend she was very sweet but a little too trusting too simple for the life here she found a lover she thought she had found the happiness of her life poor child for a month perhaps she was happy then he forced her to give up her little home and her savings and go upon the stage he preferred a mistress from the theatres she worked hard but sweetly pretty though she was she was not very successful then she caught cold she began to lose her healthand she lost her lover  brute  the child got worse madame went on presently they told her that it was consumption she went to a hospital and she wrote a pathetic little note to the man he tore it up there had been an article in the papers a few weeks before proving that consumption was among the diseases which were more or less infectious he sent her a few brutal lines and a trifle of money with a warning that there was to be no more he never went to see her the child grew worse i used to sit with her sometimes i saw her look down upon the river almost as we are looking now and her eyes would grow soft and wet with tears and she would tell me in whispers of the evenings she had spent with him when the love had first come and how sweet and tender he was there must be something wrong she was sure he did not understand he could not know how ill she really was she prayed for the sight of him i put her off with one excuse after another but one day the fear of death was in her eyes the terror came to her she was afraid she was afraid of dying alone of going into a strange country no one to hold her i went to the man i begged him to come and see her he scoffed at me if she had consumption she was better dead he would have flirted with me if i had let him i can hear his voice nowbrutal jeering hideous it was the voice sir julien which we heard ten minutes ago at the next table do you wonder that i hate it  and the little girl he asked  when i returned without him she answered the little girl was dead  they were both silent listening to the splash of the water and to the distant music  life is like that she went on we pass through it lightly enough but heaven only knows the number of little tragedies against which our skirts must brush sometimes they leave impressions sometimes we grow callous but the horror of that mans voice will stay with me always shall we go back now you would like your coffee  sit here for five minutes more he begged tell me did you know that the man was a spy  she looked at him curiously  how is it that you know so much about him  he is sitting there with an englishman who comes from our intelligence department julien explained they were speaking together of some onei believe it was myselfspeaking in none too friendly terms there was a woman too whose name they coupled with mine but i could not hear that i made some inquiries about the man i was told that he was in the suite of the german ambassador  she nodded  whoever or whatever he is she said he is something to be abhorred hush there is some one coming down the footpath  they sat quite silent some instinct seemed to tell them who it was suddenly they heard the voicerasping unpleasant  you have bungled the affair foster it is not wellmanaged it is not clever you were to have brought him to me to have let me know the instant he reached paris i would have seen him just as he was i should have succeeded now it may be that this woman has warned him already she is very clever if she has him he will not escape  fosters voice was inaudible but whatever he said seemed to anger his companion  thunder and lightning they heard the man exclaim am i a fool that you talk to me like this yes i go to himi go to him tonight but i tell you that it is too late if it is too late there is but one thing to be done you are a coward foster  they came out into the open on the path which fringed the river and they were immediately silent they came strolling along and noticed for the first time the two figures upon the seat instantly they began to talk upon some local subject no escape was possible in a few minutes they were opposite the bench foster started a little the other mans face darkened he ventured upon a bow madame christophor looked at him as one might look upon some strange animal foster hesitated for a moment but his companion pushed him along  i think she whispered that that man would like to do me an injury  julien was watching their retreating forms  i dont understand what foster is doing there or what the dickens they were talking about he said thoughtfully i think if you dont mind he added we will return  why are you so suddenly uneasy she asked  he shrugged his shoulders  apparently he answered you know who i am and everything about me i on the other hand am ignorant almost of your very name there are certain circumstances connected with my late career which make it inadvisable  oh i know all that you are going to say she interrupted but ask yourself have i made any attempt whatever to ask you a single unbecoming question  you certainly have not he confessed  your little friend returns she whispered see  foster came back to them slowly with reluctant footsteps he had the appearance of a man bent upon a mission which he dislikes  sir julien he said as he drew near would you grant me a moments interview  julien looked at him  you probably know my address he replied coldly you can call there and see me at present i am engaged  sir julien the matter is of some importance foster persisted i have a friend who is anxious to meet you it would be an affair of a few words only and perhaps an appointment afterwards  is the friend to whom you refer the person with whom you were walking just now julien inquired  yes foster admitted if you can spare me a moment i can explain  you need explain nothing julien interrupted understand please that i decline absolutely to make that persons acquaintance  foster looked away from sir julien to the woman who stood by his side  am i to take this as final he asked  julien turned on his heel  absolutely he said the little i know of the person with whom you seem to be spending the evening makes me feel more inclined to pitch him into the river than to make his acquaintance as a matter of fact foster i dont know of course under what instructions you are acting over here but i should not have considered him exactly a companion for you   foster started a new fear had suddenly broken in upon him  i am doing my best to carry out instructions sir he declared i do not understand why you should take so prejudiced a view of my friend  it is perhaps julien replied because i know more about him than you seem to good night  they walked slowly back to the gardens the woman was thoughtful  i am sorry she said that those people came along to spoil our first evening together i am glad though that you refused to meet the german all that he would have done would have been to try and fill your mind with suspicions of me havent you found me harmless  i am not sure he answered  she laughed softly  ah me she exclaimed i gave you an opening didnt i and one must remember that of late years the men of your nation have established a reputation over here for gallantry harmless at least so far as regards tearing political secrets from your bosom  as a matter of fact julien remarked there are not so many secrets between france and england are there  thanks in some measure to you she reminded him you take it for granted i notice that i am a frenchwoman  he looked at her in great surprise  why indeed yes is there any doubt about it  my mother was an american she told him  tell me your real name he asked suddenly  on the contrary i am going to beg you not to try and discover it let us remain as we are for a little time you are lonely here and you need companionship and i am very much in the same position you are a hater of women and i have sworn eternal enmity against all men we are so safe and solitude is bad for us  he smiled  you are very kind he said but as for me i am only starting my wanderings i want to go on through algiers to morocco to egypt and later to the east i never meant to stay long in paris  i do not blame you she declared sooner or later you must find your way where the battle is paris is not a city for men one loiters here for a time but one passes on always never mind while you stay here i shall claim you  they drove back to paris through the perfumed stillness of the long spring night madame had instructed her chauffeur to drive slowly and more than one automobile rushed past them with flaring lights and sounding horn in one they caught a glimpse of foster and his companion whispering together as they raced by madame half closed her eyes with a little shiver  those men again she exclaimed they say that estermen never abandons a chase you may still find him waiting for you in your hotel     chapter xi   the toymaker from leipzig   in the front row of balcony tables at the café des ambassadeurs was one which had been transformed into a veritable bower of pink roses the florists had been at work upon it since early in the afternoon and their labors were only just concluded as the guests of the restaurant were beginning to arrive henri the chief maître dhôtel had personally superintended its construction he stood looking at the result of their labors now with a wellsatisfied aspect  but it is perfect he declared the orders of monsieur freudenberg have indeed been delightfully carried out you will present the account as usual mademoiselle he directed the florist who in her black frock a little hot and flushed with her labors was standing by his side remember monsieur is well able to pay  it is perhaps a prince who dines in such state the girl inquired  the maître dhôtel smiled  it is on the contrary he told her a maker of toys from germany  she made a little grimace  and to think that my back aches that i have pricked myself so she exclaimed showing the scarred tips of her fingers for the sake of a toymaker from germany but it is not like you henri to disturb yourself so for anything less than a prince  henri who was a sleek and handsome man with black moustache and imperial shook his head sadly  ah mademoiselle he said when you have lived as long as i you will know that the times indeed have changed it is no longer the princes of the world to whom one gives ones best service it is those who carry the heaviest money bags who command it  well well she replied that is perhaps true yet in our little shop in the rue de la paix we do not always find that it is those with the heaviest money bags who pay us most generously for our flowers i would sooner serve a bankrupt aristocrat than a wealthy shopkeeper if they pay at all these aristocrats they pay well  henri stretched out his hands  mademoiselle there are shopkeepers who are also princes my client of this evening is one of those behold he comes pardon  the man for whom these great preparations had been made stood in the entrance of the restaurant waiting for the woman who was giving her cloak to the vestiaire he was tall and thin dressed rather severely with a black tie and short coat a monocle which hung from his neck with a black ribbon his face was unusually long his eyes deepset his mouth set firm on a somewhat protuberant jaw with lines at the corners which somehow suggested humor when he saw henri he nodded  once more henri he remarked with a little smile once more in my beloved paris  monsieur is always welcome henri declared bowing to the ground paris is the gayer for his coming  you are indeed a nation of courtiers herr carl freudenberg exclaimed what german oberkellner would have thought of a speech like that to a frenchman finding himself in berlin ah henri you try all of you to spoil me here is it not so mademoiselle he added turning with a bow and a smile to the girl who stood now by his side henri here speaks honied words to me always the wonder to me is that i am ever able to tear myself away from this city of fascination  if we could keep monsieur the girl murmured smiling at henri i think that we should all be very well content  herr freudenberg made a little grimace  but my toys he cried who is there in germany could make such toys as i and my factory people the world would be sad indeedthe world of children i meanif my factory were to close down or my designers should lose their cunning  is it the greatest ambition of monsieur the girl asked to amuse and make happy the world of children have not the world of grown people some claims  monsieur will i trust and madame henri declared as they moved slowly forward find much to admire in the table which has been prepared for them this evening it is by the orders of monsieur so enclosed that here one may talk without fear of observation and the perfume of these roses every one of which has been selected is a wonderful thing it is indeed a work of art  herr freudenberg turned deliberately on one side where the little flower girl was still lingering  mademoiselle he said something tells me that it is you whom we have to thank for this adorable creation it is indeed a work of supreme art if mademoiselle would permit  he slipped a crumpled note into her fingers so quietly and unostentatiously that it was there and in her pocket before any one had time to notice it she went out murmuring to herself  he is a prince this monsieura veritable prince  for your dinner henri announced as they seated themselves in their places i have no word to tell you i spare you as you see the barbarity of a menu what will come to you monsieur and madame is at least of our best i can promise that and the wine is such as i myself have selected knowing well the taste of monsieur  and of madame also i trust herr freudenberg remarked  ah monsieur henri continued when monsieur is not in paris madame is invisible not once since i last had this pleasure of waiting upon you have i had the joy of seeing her  herr freudenberg looked across the table at his companion with twinkling eyes  this is a city of conspirators he declared you make a man vain and happy and joyous at the same time let your dinner be served then henri since i was in paris last i have eaten many times but i have not dined  the maître dhôtel departed but for the next hour or so his eyes were seldom far away from the table where sat his most esteemed client once or twice others of the diners sent for him  henri one asked and then another tell us who is it that dines like a prince under the canopy of pink roses  henri smiled  monsieur he replied it is herr carl freudenberg of leipzig  herr carl freudenberg of leipzigbut who is he  he is a great manufacturer of toys monsieur  a german one muttered  it is they who are spoiling paris another grumbled  they have at least the money  one woman alone shook her head  it is not money only she murmured which buys these things here from henri  the companion of herr carl freudenberg was without doubt as charming as she appeared for herr freudenberg certainly enjoyed his dinner as a man should nor were those lines of humor engraven about his mouth for nothing to judge by the frequent peals of laughter from mademoiselle towards the close of dinner henri himself carried to them a superb violet ice with real flowers around the dish and an electric light burning in the middle  for two days madame he announced our chef has dreamed of this it is a creation  it is exquisite mademoiselle cried with a gesture of delight never in my life have i seen anything so wonderful  henri herr freudenberg said in an aside you will present my compliments to the chef you will shake him by the hand from me you will double the little affair which passes between us tell him that it comes from one who appreciates the work of a great artist even though his french thickens a little in his throat  henri bowed low  if monsieurs body is german he declared his soul at least belongs to the land of romance  they were alone again and the girl leaned across the table  monsieur she murmured it is cruel of you to come so seldom you see what you do you spoil the keepers of our restaurants you steal away the hearts of your poor little companions and thenone night or two perhaps and it is over monsieur freudenberg has gone the earth swallows him  back to my toys mademoiselle he whispered one has ones work  she looked at him long and tenderly  monsieur she said it is two months a week and three days since you were in paris since then i have sung and danced night by night but my heart has never been gay come oftener monsieur or may one not sometimes cross the frontier and learn a little of your barbarous country  for the first time the faintest shadow of gravity crossed his face  mademoiselle he replied alas the world is full of hard places behold me when i am here i am your devoted and admiring slave but believe me that when i leave paris and set my face eastwards i do not exist dear marguerite it hurts me to repeat thisi do not exist  she looked down into her plate  i understand she murmured you said it to me once before have i not always been discreet have i ever with the slightest word disobeyed you  nor will you ever dear marguerite he declared confidently for if you did it would be the end in the city where i make my toys life as we live it here is not known it is not recognized and there is ones work in the world  she looked up from her plate her expression had changed  it was foolish of me she whispered tonight is one of those nights in heaven for which i spend all my days longing i think no more of the future you are here tell me from herewhere  to the opera i have engaged the box that you prefer we arrive for the last act of samson et dalila and for the ballet  and afterwards  to the abbaye after that there is the rat mortalbert must not be disappointedand a new place they tell me one must see all these new places  and we leave here soon  you are impatient  only to be alone with you she answered even those few moments in the automobile are precious  he smiled at her across the table she was very pretty with her fair hair and dark eyes very parisian and yet with a shade of graceful seriousness about her eyes and mouth  dear marguerite he said i wait only for one of my agents who comes to speak to me on a matter of business he is due almost at this moment after he has been here then we go cannot you believe he whispered dropping his voice a little and leaning slightly across the table that i too will love to feel your dear fingers in mine your lips perhaps for a moment as we pass to the opera  it is a joy one must snatch she murmured  there is no joy in life he replied which is not the sweeter for being snatched and snatched quickly  and you a german she sighed  henri appeared once more and after him estermen herr freudenberg with a word of excuse to his companion turned to greet the newcomer  well  estermen stood quite close to the table he was distinctly ill at ease  herr freudenberg he said i have done my best it was impossible for me to obtain an introduction to this customer  impossible herr freudenberg repeated his face suddenly becoming stony  let me explain estermen continued hastily this customer arrived in paris last night or early this morning he was called upon at once by a lady who lives in the avenue de st paul she has told him a little story about mei am sure of it he has refused to make my acquaintance  and you were content  estermen spread out his pudgy hands  what can one do he muttered the man is quicktempered he dined tonight in the country at the maison léon dor with madame it was there that i sought an introduction with him it was impossible for me to force myself  you know where to find him i suppose  i know the hotel at which he is staying  make it your business to find him herr freudenberg ordered bring him with you if before one oclock to the abbaye thelème if afterwards to the rat mort  estermen looked stolidly puzzled  am i to mention the subject of the toys of herr freudenbergs manufacture  herr freudenberg tore a corner from the programme which lay on the table between them and wrote a single word upon it  study that at your leisure my friend he said pay attention to the task i impose upon you nothing is more important in my visit to paris than that i should make the acquaintance of this person much depends upon it i rely upon you estermen  estermen thrust the morsel of paper into his waistcoat pocket then he leaned a little closer to this man who seemed to be his master  herr freudenberg he began i spoke of a lady in the avenue de st paul the companion tonight of the person whose acquaintance you are anxious to make  what of her herr freudenberg asked calmly there are many ladies without a doubt who live in the avenue de st paul  the name of this one estermen continued slowly is madame christophor  herr freudenberg sat quite still in his place his eyes seemed fixed upon a cluster of the roses which hung down from the other side of the sweetsmelling barrier by which they were surrounded yet something had gone out of his face something fresh had arrived the half contemptuous curl of the lips was finished his mouth now was straight and hard his eyes set the deep lines upon his forehead and around his mouth were suddenly insistent he sat so motionless that his face for a moment seemed as though it were fashioned in wax then his lips moved he spoke in a whisper which was almost inaudible  henriette  from across the table his companion watched him at first she was puzzled when she heard the womans name which came so softly from his lips she turned pale herr freudenberg recovered from his fit of abstraction almost as quickly as he had lapsed into it  i thank you estermen he declared it is a coincidence this i am obliged for your forethought in mentioning it until later then  the man made a somewhat clumsy bow glanced admiringly at herr freudenbergs companion and departed herr freudenberg was shaking his head slowly  i fear he said softly to himself sometimes i fear that i am not so well served as might be in paris however we shall see for the moment let us banish these dull cares if you are ready marguerite i think i might suggest that the nearer way to the opera is by the champs Élysées  she rose to her feet and gave him her hand for a moment as she passed  if one could only find as easily the way to your heart dear maker of toys she murmured     chapter xii   at the rat mort   julien had been back in the hotel about half an hour and in his room barely ten minutes when he was disturbed by a knock at the door immediately afterwards to his amazement estermen entered  what the devil are you doing up here julien asked angrily how dare you follow me about  sir julien his visitor answered i beg that you will not make a commotion it was perfectly easy for me to gain admission here it will be perfectly easy for me if it becomes necessary to leave without trouble i ask you to be reasonable i am here listen to what i have to say you are prejudiced against me it is not fair you have spoken with a woman who is my enemy give me leave at least to address a few words to you you will not be the loser  julien was angry but underneath it all he was also curious  well go on then  you are reasonable said estermen laying his hat and stick upon the bed listen your story is known at berlin as well as in paris there is only one opinion concerning it and that is that you have been shamefully treated  i am not asking for sympathy sir julien answered coldly  nor am i offering it the other returned i am stating facts there are many who do not hesitate to say that you have been made the victim of a political plot conceived among the members of your own party that you are suffering at the present moment from your masterly efforts on behalf of peace  pray go on julien invited i consider all this grossly impertinent but i am willing to listen to what you have to say  the greatest man in germany estermen continued when he heard of your misfortune declared at once that the peace of europe was no longer assured i am here tonight sir julien without credentials it is true but i am the spokesman of a very great person indeed he is anxious to know your plans  i have no plans  your political future then  i have no political future julien interrupted that is finished for me  but the thing is absurd protested estermen there is no other man but you capable of dealing tactfully and diplomatically with my country your blundering predecessors brought us twice within an ace of war if the man takes your place to whom rumor has already given it i give europe six weeks peaceno more we are a sensitive nation as you know you learned how to humor us no one before you tried you kept your alliance with france but you were not afraid to show us the open hand there are those in berlin sir julien who consider you the greatest statesman england ever possessed  i listen julien said pray proceed  it cannot be estermen went on that you mean to accept the situation  i have no alternative julien answered  it is not then a question of money estermen ventured slowly the press tell us that you are poor  money in this case would scarcely help julien remarked  there is no man in the world who can afford to despise the power of money estermen said quietly  are you here to offer me any  i am not have you anything to give in exchange for it  julien laughed a little shortly  i imagined he declared that with your first remarks you had climbed to the dizziest heights of impertinence i perceive that i was mistaken i am a discarded ministerdryly i may be supposed to have in my possession secrets for which your country would pay is it not to those facts that i am indebted for the honor of this visit  not in the least answered estermen our own secret service keeps us supplied with such information as we desire my object in seeking you is this the prince von falkenberg is in paris for a few hours only he wants to meet you i have been ordered to arrange this meeting if possible  julien did not attempt to conceal his interest  why on earth didnt you say so at once he exclaimed what does he want of me  estermen shrugged his shoulders  who knows who knows what falkenberg ever wants he is here there and everywheretoday in paris tomorrow in berlin next week in moscow yet it is he as you know well who shapes the whole destinies of my country it is he alone in whom the emperor has blind and absolute confidence if he holds up his hand it is war if he holds it down it is peace  what does he do in paris julien inquired  estermen shook his head  he arrived this morning and disappeared tonight he sent me orders that i was to search for you  where is he now julien asked  at eight oclock tonight estermen said he declared himself to be herr carl freudenberg dealer in german toys he dressed dined at the ambassadeurs with mademoiselle ixe from the opera sent for me learned that i was at the maison léon dor telephoned there and all for this one thingthat i should bring you to him without a moments delay  but where is he now julien asked again  estermen glanced at the clock and at a piece of paper which he took from his pocket  it is one oclock within a few minutes he remarked herr freudenberg is either at the abbaye thelème or the rat mort  julien scarcely hesitated  when you first came in he admitted i felt like throwing you out how you got here i dont know i suppose it is no use complaining to the hotel people but there is no man on the face of this earth in whom i am more interested than falkenberg i shall change my clothes and in a quarter of an hour i am at your service wait for me downstairs  estermen drew a little sigh of relief i shall await you sir julien he declared  all paris seemed to be seeking distraction as they drove in the automobile along the boulevard des italiens julien sat with folded arms in the corner of the automobile he had no fancy for his companion he was anxious so far as possible to avoid speech with him estermen on the contrary seemed only too desirous of removing the impression of dislike of which he was acutely conscious he talked the whole of the time of the cafés and the women of everything he thought might be interesting to his companion julien listened in grim silence only once he interrupted  what brings herr freudenberg to paris he inquired once more  estermen was suddenly reticent  he has affairs here he said he is also like us othersa man who loves his pleasure you will find him tonight with a most charming companionmademoiselle ixe of the opera before the coming of herr freudenberg i remember her wellthe companion at times of many today she is changed triste when he is not here faithful in a most unparisianlike manner  they swung round to the left  herr freudenberg estermen continued is a great lover of the night life of paris he goes from one café to the other he is untired sleepless he seems to find inspiration where others find fatigue  julien raised his eyebrows but he said nothing these were not his impressions of the man whom they were seeking  they drew up presently at the doors of the abbaye thelème there were crowds of people trying to gain admission estermen elbowed his way through  herr freudenberg he asked of the man who stood at the door  the mans forbidding face changed like magic  herr freudenberg left but ten minutes ago for the rat mort those who inquired for him were to follow  estermen nodded and touched julien on the arm  we will walk he said it is at the corner there  they presented themselves at the doors of a smaller and dingier café estermen elbowed the way up the narrow stairs they emerged in a small room brilliantly lit and filled with people the usual little band was playing gay music a corpulent maître dhôtel bowed as they appeared  herr freudenberg estermen began  the waiters bow by this time was a different affair  monsieur will follow me he invited  at the corner table at the far end of the roomthe most desired of anysat herr freudenberg with mademoiselle ixe by his side they met the flower girl coming away with empty arms the table of herr freudenberg was smothered with roses there was a shade more color in the cheeks of mademoiselle ixe in her eyes a light as soft as any which the eyes of a woman who loved could know herr freudenberg unruffled had still the air of a man who finds life pleasant as the two men came up the room he rose and held out both his hands  ah he exclaimed it is indeed my friend of berlin welcome dear sir julien we meet on neutral ground is it not so we meet now in the city of pleasures let us sit for a little time and talk and forget that you and i once wrote a chapter together in the historyof toymaking but first he added turning to mademoiselle ixe mademoiselle permits me to introduce a very dear and cherished acquaintance to an equally dear and cherished friend this gentleman dear marguerite and i make toys in different countries and there was a time when it was necessary for us to consult together so he came to berlin and i have never forgotten his visit for the present join us dear julien you permit that i call you by your first name it is after midnight and after midnight in paris one permits everything now we drink together we three for estermen must leave us i know we drink together to the making of toys the building of toy palaces and the love of one another come monsieur albert see that your sommelier opens that bottle that you have chosen for us so carefully he continued turning to the manager who was hovering close at hand this is a meeting and we need the best wine that ever came from the vineyards of france a dear friend albert bow low to him indeed for he is worthy of it afterwards we will perhaps eat something send your waiter but above all monsieur see to it that mademoiselle with the fair curls dances once more my friend i think would like to see her and we must have music let the band never cease playing ah it is here dear albert that one learns to forget how strenuous life really is it is here that one may unbend the wine  while herr freudenberg talked the sommelier had gravely served the champagne in some tall and wonderful glasses brought from a private cabinet by monsieur albert himself to honor his most treasured visitors herr freudenberg raised his glass clinked it against the glass of mademoiselle clinked it against juliens glass  come he cried to our better acquaintance to our better understanding mademoiselle he added lowering his tone to the eternal continuance of those things which lie between you and me  estermen had departed and julien breathed the freer for it mademoiselle ixe chattered to him for a few moments and herr freudenberg whispered in the ears of albert who withdrew at once  one must eat herr freudenberg declared albert has some peaches wonderful peaches from the gardens where the sun always shines peaches and macaroonsafterwards coffee ah my friend you remember those somber banquets when we all hated one another because we all fancied that the other wanted what we had a right to ugh when i think of berlin in those days when no one smiled when ones sense of humor was there only to be kept down with an iron hand why it gives one to weep mademoiselle i have a prayer to make  it is granted she assured him softly  presently the orchestra shall play the music of faust you will sing to us tonight is one of my nights never really perfect unless some minutes of it move to the music of your voice  she laughed softly  yes monsieur i will sing she answered but not the jewel song tonight send the chef dorchestre to me  at the merest signal he was there with his violin under his arm mademoiselle whispered a word in his ear and he departed all smiles the selection which they were playing suddenly ceased monsieur le chef alone played some italian air which no one wholly recognized but every one found familiar slowly he walked around the tables playing still always with his eyes upon mademoiselle ixe and when at last he stood before her she threw her head back and sang  the clatter of crockery diminished the waiters paused in their tasks or crept on tiptoe about the place men and women stood up at their tables that they might see the singer better conversation ceased and all the time the chef dorchestre drew music from his violin and mademoiselle with halfclosed eyes her head thrown back filled the whole room with melody even she herself knew that she was singing as she never sang at the opera as she had never sung when a great impressario had come to try her voice as one sings only when the heart is shaking a little and as she finished the fingers of her left hand slowly crept across the table into the hand of herr freudenberg the toymaker and her last notes were sung almost in a whisper into his ears the room rose up to applaud the chef dorchestre went back to his place bowing right and left herr freudenberg raised the fingers that lay between his hand to his lips  ah mademoiselle he murmured i have no longer words  albert came back scarcely more than a look passed between him and herr freudenberg then the latter rose to his feet  come he said a little surprise for you you too dear julien i insist this way  they passed from the room as mademoiselle rose to her feet people began once more to applaud  mademoiselle will sing again presently perhaps herr freudenberg answered a man who leaned forward we do not depart  he led the way to the head of the staircase and they passed into the back regions of the placedim illlit mysterious albert who had preceded them threw open the door of a room there was a small supper table laid for three more flowers more wine  it is that one may talk for five minutes herr freudenberg explained mademoiselle  but mademoiselle had already flitted away the door somehow was closed the two men were alone     chapter xiii   politics and patriotism   herr freudenberg shrugged his shoulders and glanced at the softlyclosed door  mademoiselle is a paragon he declared always she understands sir julien will you not sit down for a moment let me confess that this little supperparty is a pretense for five minutes i wish to talk to you  julien seated himself without hesitation  my dear host he said i left berlin a year ago with only one hopeor rather two the first was that i might never have to visit berlin again the second was that i might have the pleasure of meeting you as speedily and as often as possible  herr freudenberg smileda quiet reminiscent smile  even now he remarked when i would speak to you for a moment on more serious subjects the strange humor of that roundtable conference comes home to me there were you and i and our big friend from austria and that awful dull man from here and the russian shall you ever forget that speechless russian who never opened his lips except to disagree sometimes i caught your eye across the table and sir julien you know i presume whose was the triumph of those days  julien smiled doubtfully  yours of course herr freudenberg continued the press even ventured to find fault with me england as usual they declared had gained all she desired and had given the very minimum however we will not waste time in reminiscences today the only pleasure i have in thinking of that conference is the fact that you and i came together when you left berlini saw you off you rememberi told those who stood around that there went the future prime minister of england i believed it and i am seldom mistaken tell me what piece of transcendental illfortune is this which brings you here an exile  i committed an act of transcendental folly julien replied i have no one to blame but myself i not only wrote an indiscreet letter but i put my name to it i was deceived too in the character of the woman to whom it was sent  it is so trifling an error herr freudenberg said thoughtfully made by many a man without evil results one learns experience as one passes on in life it is a hard price that you are paying for yours come that is finished now answer me what are you going to do  julien laughed a little bitterly  my friend he answered stretching out his hand and taking a cigarette from the open box upon the table you ask rather a hard question my resignation was accepted was even required of me politics and diplomacy are alike barred to me there is no return what is there left i may write a book so far as my means permit i may travel i may play games take a walk in the morning play bridge in the afternoon eat heavily and sleep early what is there left herr freudenbergtell me of your wisdomfor a man about whose ears has come crashing the scaffolding of his life  herr freudenberg looked across at his companion and in that dimlylit room his eyes were bright and his lips firm  to rebuild my friend he declared choose another foundation and rebuild  you recognize i presume julien said that i require a few more details if your advice is to be of value  the details are here in this room herr freudenberg replied firmly be my man i cannot offer you fame because fame comes only nowadays to the man who serves his own country you see i make no pretense at deceiving you but i offer you a life of action i offer you such wealth as your imagination can have conceived and i offer you revenge  revenge julien repeated a little vaguely  upon the political party by whose scheming that letter was first of all elicited from you and then made public herr freudenberg said slowly do you imagine that it was a thoughtless act of that womans do you know that her reward is to be a peerage for her husband  you too believe that it was a trap then julien remarked  of course dont you know yourself that you were a thorn in the flesh to your own party they hated you because you were not afraid to preach war when war might have saved your country from what is to come they hated you because you were a strong man in a strong place and because the people believed in you they hated you because the policy which would have been yours in the four or five years to come would have been the policy which would have brought the country around you which alone would have kept your party in power you were the only figure in politics which the imperialist party in england had to fear mrs carrabyi believe that was the ladys nameis illpaid enough with that peerage leave out the personal elementor leave it in if you will for when i speak of my country i know no friendshipsbut my dear friend let me tell you that i myself would have given more than a peeragei would have given a principalityto the person who threw you out of english politics  juliens eyes were bright somehow or other his old dreams his old faith in himself had returned for a moment and then the bitterness all swept in upon him  i think herr freudenberg he said that you are talking a little in the skies at any rate it makes no difference those things have passed  those things have passed herr freudenberg assented there is no future for you in england that is why i wish to rescue you from the ignominy of which you yourself have spoken i repeat my offer be my man you shall taste life and taste it in such gulps as you wish  julien shook his head slowly  my friend he said it is the cruel part of our profession that one mans life can be given to one country alone  wrong herr freudenberg declared briskly i am not going to decry patriotism the welfare of my country is the religion which guides my life but youyou have no country there is no england left for you she has thrown you out you are a wanderer a man without ties or home that is why i claim you as my man i want to show you the way to revenge  you puzzle me julien admitted you talk about revenge i know you far too well to believe that you would propose to me any scheme which would involve the raising even of my little finger against the country which has turned me out  naturally herr freudenberg agreed you do me no less than justice my dear sir julien what i do hope that you have firmly fixed in your mind is that i despite your halfpenny papers your novelists seeking for a new sensation and your weird middle class i carl freudenberg maker of toys am the honest and sincere friend of england the work which i ask you to do for me would be as much in the interests of your country as of my own only when i say your country i mean your country governed by the political party in which i have faith and confidence i tell you frankly that an england governed as she is at present is a country i loathe if i raise my hand against hernot in war mind but in diplomacyif i strive to humble her today it is because i would cover if i could the political party who are in power at this moment with disrepute and discredit why should you yourself shrink from aiding me in this task they are the party in whose rankshigh in whose ranks i might sayare those who stooped with baseness with deceit unmentionable to rid themselves of you therefore i say strike come with me and you shall help and when the time comes i think i can promise you that i can show you a way back a way which you have never guessed  julien looked across the table long and earnestly  herr freudenberg he said if i answer you in the negative it is because of your own words the love of your country you told me not long ago is your religion for her good you would make use even of those you call your friends now i am sincere with you i do not know whether to trust you or not for that reason i cannot attempt to discuss this matter with you i do not ask even that you explain yourself  you mean that at any rate you cannot trust me entirely herr freudenberg replied well if you had i should have been disappointed in you still i have said things that were in my heart to say to you we send now for mademoiselle ixe before very long we talk together again  herr freudenberg touched the bell a waiter appeared almost immediately  find mademoiselle he ordered tell her that we wait impatiently  mademoiselle was not far away herr freudenberg passed his arm through hers  we return i think he said this little room has served its purpose  julien on the landing tried to make his adieux but his host only laughed at him mademoiselle ixe held out her hand and led him into the room by her side  he wishes it she murmured softly he has so few nights here one must do as he desires  the little party returned to their table in the corner somehow or other their coming seemed to enliven the room there was more spirit in the music more animation in the conversation albert walked with a sprightlier step then julien in his passage down the room received a distinct shock he stopped short  kendricks by jove he exclaimed  kendricks sitting alone at a small table with a bottle of champagne in front of him and a huge cigar in his mouth waved his hand joyfully then he glanced at his friends companions frowned for a moment and gazed fixedly at herr freudenberg  julien by all thats lucky he called out and i havent been in paris four hours i called at your hotel and they told me you were out sit down  i am not alone julien began to explain  herr freudenberg turned round  you must present your friend he declared he must join us  julien hesitated for a moment  kendricks he said this is my friend herr freudenberg  the two men shook hands kendricks as yet had scarcely taken his eyes off herr freudenbergs face  i am glad to meet you sir he remarked it is odd but your face seems familiar to me  herr freudenberg leaned over the table  my friend mr kendricks he said you are i believe a newspaper man and you should know the world when you see a face that is familiar to you in paris and in this paris it goes well that you forget that familiarity eh  kendricks nodded  it is sound he agreed i will join you with pleasure  mademoiselle herr freudenberg continued permit me to introduce my new friend mr kendricks mr kendricksmademoiselle ixe we will now begin if it is your pleasure to spend the evening there is room in our corner mr kendricks come there and presently mademoiselle ixe will sing to us mademoiselle with the yellow hair there will dance the orchestra shall play their maddest music this is paris and we are young ah my friends it comes to us but seldom to live like this  they all sat down together herr freudenberg gave reckless orders for more wine the chef dorchestre was at his elbow albert hovered in the background kendricks leaned over and whispered in his friends ear  julien who is our friend  a manufacturer of toys from leipzig julien answered grimly  the toys that giants play with kendricks muttered i have never forgotten a face in my life  then forget this one for a moment julien advised him quickly this is not a night for memories i have lived with the ghosts of them long enough  their party became larger the little dancing girl came to drink wine with them and remained to listen to herr freudenberg a friend of mademoiselle ixea tall fair girl in a blue satin gowndetached herself from her friends and joined them herr freudenberg with his arm resting lightly around mademoiselle ixes waist talked joyously and incessantly it was not until some one lifted the blind and discovered that the sun was shining that they spoke of a move then as the vestiaire came hurrying up with their coats and wraps herr freudenberg lifted his glass  one last toast he cried dear marguerite my friends all of youto the sun which calls us to work to the moon which calls us to pleasure to the love that crowds our hearts  he raised his companions hand to his lips and drew her arm through his  come he cried to the streets we will take our coffee from the stall of madame huber     chapter xiv   the morning after   kendricks and julien drove down from the hill in a small open victoria the sun had risen but here and there were traces of a fading twilight a faint mauve glow hung over the sleeping streets the sunlight as yet was faint and the morning breeze chilly as they passed down the long hill tiredlooking waiters were closing up the night cafés bedraggled revelers crept along the pavements with weary footsteps  with every yard of their progression the meeting between the two extremes of life seemed to become more apparent the children of the nightthe weary unwholesome products of dissipation rubbed shoulders with the children of the morninggirls hatless in simple clothes walking with brisk footsteps to their work market women browncheeked and hearty setting out their wares upon the stalls the youth of paris blithe and strenuous walking lightfooted to the region of warehouses and factories julien and kendricks looked out upon the little scene with interest both had been sleepy when they had left the café but there was something stimulating in the sight of this thin but constant stream of people kendricks sat up and began to talk  julien he declared this paris never alters its a queer little world and a rotten one we are here just at the ebbing of the tide dont you feel the hatefulness of itthe thinblooded scream for pleasure which needs the lash of these painted women these gaudy cafés this yellow wine all the time my god and they call it pleasure look at these people going to their work julien theres where the red blood flows theyre the people with the taste of life between their teeth cant you see them at their pleasuressee them sitting in a beergarden with a girl and a band their weeks money in their pocket and the knowledge that theyve earned it perhaps sometimes they look up the hill and wonder at the craze for it all did you see the stream coming up tonightautomobiles victorias carriages of every sort palefaced men who had lunched too well dined too well flogging their tired systems in the craze for more excitement more pleasure eating at an unwholesome hour smoking sickly cigarettes kissing rouged lips listening to the false music of that hard laughter look at those girls arm in arm off to their little milliners shop hear them laugh you dont hear anything like that julien on the top of the hill  of course julien remarked stifling a yawn if youve come to paris to be moral  not i kendricks broke in roughly bless you im one of the worst a wild night in paris calls me even now from any part of the world but lord what fools we are and julien we get worse its the old people who keep these places going  the older we get julien replied the harder we have to struggle for our joys  kendricks wheeled suddenly in his place  tell me how long you have known herr freudenberg he insisted how many times have you been seen with him is it the truth that you met him tonight for the first time  julien laughed  my dear david he protested  to tell you the truth julien kendricks interrupted theres some hidden trouble some mysterious influence at work which seems to be upsetting the relations just now between france and england to be frank with you i know that carraby at a cabinet meeting yesterday suggested that you were at the bottom of it  juliens eyes suddenly flashed fire  dn that fellow he muttered does anybody believe it  kendricks shrugged his shoulders  scarcely and yet julien it pays to be careful you cant afford to be seen in public places with the enemies of your country  is carl freudenberg an enemy of my country  kendricks leaned back in his seat and laughed scornfully  julien he exclaimed there are times when you are very simple do you indeed mean that you would try to deceive even me you would pretend that i david kendricks of the post dont know that herr freudenberg and the prince von falkenberg ruler of germany are one and the same person maker of toys he calls himself maker of fools palaces if you like builder of prison houses if you will no man was ever born with less of a conscience more solely and wholly ambitious both for his country and for himself than the man with whom you talked tonight you knew him  naturally julien answered we met at berlin  the man is a great genius kendricks continued no one will deny him that they speak of his weaknesses they talk of his drinking bouts of his plunges into french dissipation the man hasnt a single dissipated thought in his mind he moves through this worldthis little paris worldwith one idea only he gets behind the scenes he comes here secretly drops hints here and there as a private person lets himself be considered a parisian of parisians all the time he listens and he drops his cunning words of poison and he works what are his ambitions do you know julien  do you julien asked  it seems to me that i have some idea kendricks answered this is your hotel isnt it  julien nodded  are you going to stay here  kendricks shook his head  i stay at a little hotel in the rue taitbout i stay there because it is full of the weirdest set of foreigners you ever knew this morning we breakfast together  come and see me when you will julien invited or i will come to you not to breakfast thoughi am engaged  to herr freudenberg kendricks asked quickly  to the lady whom your little friend the manicurist sent me to visit julien replied perhaps now you will tell me that she is an ambassadress in disguise  ill tell you nothing about her this morning kendricks said ill tell you nothing which you ought not to find out for yourself  do you think i may breakfast with her safely julien inquired  heaven knowsi dont kendricks replied no man is safe with such a woman as madame christophor but let it go we dine together tonight ill tell you some news then im going to unroll a plan of campaign theres work for you if you like itnothing formulated as yet but its comingperhaps hopewho knows  the sun rose higher in the heavens the mauve light faded from the sky morning had arrived in earnest and paris settled herself down to the commencement of another day julien for the first time since he had left england was asleep five minutes after his head had touched the pillow herr freudenberg on the contrary made no attempt at all to retire in the sittingroom of his apartments in the boulevard maupassant he sat in his dressinggown carefully studying some letters which had arrived by the night mail opposite to him was a secretary by his side estermen who appeared to be there for the purpose of making a report  not a document estermen was saying not a line of writing of any sort in his trunk his bureau or anywhere about his room  herr freudenberg nodded thoughtfully  but these englishmen are the devil to deal with he said the luncheon is ordered today in the private room at the armenonville  everything has been attended to estermen replied  herr freudenberg was thoughtful for several moments then with a wave of his hand he dismissed estermen  you too can go fritz he said to his secretary you have had a long nights work  you yourself excellency should sleep for a while his secretary advised  herr freudenberg shook his head  sleep he declared is a waste of time i need no sleep as you go you can tell my servant to prepare a warm bath i will rest then for an hour and walk in the champs elysées  the secretary withdrew and herr freudenberg was alone he picked up a crumpled rose that lay upon the table and twirled it for a moment or two in his fingers the action seemed to be wholly unconscious his eyes were set in a fixed stare his thoughts were busy weaving out his plans for the day it was not until he was summoned to his bath that he rose and glanced at the withered flower then he smiled  poor little marguerite he murmured what a pity  he touched the rose with his lips abandoned his first intention which seemed to have been to throw it into the fireplace and put it back carefully upon the table side by side with an odd white glove  queer little record of the froth of life he said softly to himself one soiled evening glove a faded rose a womans tearsthey pass what can one dowe poor others who have to drive the wheels of life  he sighed shrugged his high shoulders and passed out     chapter xv   behind closed doors   very soon after midday on the same morning herr carl freudenberg was the host at a small luncheon party given in a private room of the most famous restaurant in the bois his morning attire was a model of correctness his eyes were clear his manner blithe almost joyous there was no possible indication in his appearance of his misspent hours he was at once a genial and courteous host monsieur décheles sat at his right hand monsieur felix brant on his left monsieur pelleman opposite to him the three men had arrived in an automobile together and had entered the restaurant by the private way but that they were guests of some distinction was obvious from their reception by the manager himself  the luncheon was worthy of the great reputation of the place it was swiftly and well served with the coffee and liqueurs the waiters withdrew herr freudenberg with a smile rose up and tried the door then he returned to his place lit a cigarette and leaned back in his chair  my dear friends he announced now we can talk  monsieur pelleman smiled  yes he admitted we can talk in this excellent brandy monsieur carl freudenberg i drink your very good health long may these little visits of yours continue  herr freudenberg smiled his thanks  monsieur pelleman he said and you too my dear friends let me assure you that there is nothing in the world which i enjoy so much as these brief visits of mine to your delightful capital no more i think of the pressures and cares of office i let myself go and on these occasions as you know i speak to you not in the language of diplomacy but as good friends who meet together to enjoy an hour or two of one anothers company and who because there is no harm to be done by it but much good open their hearts and speak true words with one another  monsieur décheles smiled  it is a pleasure which we all share he declared it is more agreeable without a doubt to take lunch with monsieur carl freudenberg and to speak openly than to exchange longwinded interviews the true meaning of which is too much concealed by diplomatic verbiage with the excellent gentleman to whose good offices are intrusted the destinies of herr freudenbergs great nation  monsieur herr freudenberg said today shall be no exception today i speak to you perhaps more openly than ever before today i perhaps risk muchyet why not speak the things which are in my heart  monsieur felix brant took a cigarette from the box by his elbow but he felt for it only his eyes never left the face of his host of the three men he seemed the one least in sympathy with the state of affairs to which herr freudenberg had alluded so cheerfully he watched the man at the head of the table all the time as though every energy of which he was possessed was devoted to the task of reading underneath that suave but impenetrable face  gentlemen herr freudenberg continued there have been many misapprehensions between your country and mine ten years ago we seemed indeed on the highroad to friendship it was theni speak frankly mindthat your country made the one fatal mistake of recent years great britain isolated left behind in the race for power a weakened and decaying nation having searched the world over for allies held out the timorous hand of friendship to you what evil genius was with your statesmen that day when the history of these times comes to be written it is my firm belief that it will be then acknowledged that the genius of the man who reigned over great britain at that time was alone responsible for the commencement of what has become a veritable alliance  herr freudenberg paused  there is no doubt monsieur décheles asserted calmly that the influence of the late king was immense among the people of france he appealed somehow to their imaginations a great monarch who was also a bon viveur who had lived his days in paris as the others  herr freudenberg nodded thoughtfully  he is dead he said and history will write him down as a great king do you know that it is one of my theories that morals have nothing to do with government i doubt whether a more sagacious monarch has ever reigned over that unfortunate country than the one we speak of so sagacious was he that he even saw the beginning of the end he saw the things that must come when he looked across the north sea and notwithstanding his descent notwithstanding all the ties which should have allied him with germany he hated our people and he hated our country with a prophetic hatred but we gossip a little gentlemen let me proceed i want you to realize that the policy of germany for the last five years has been wholly directed towards securing the friendship of your country i want you to realize that but for the continual interference of great britain you would even now be in a far more favorable position with us than you are today germany wants nothing in morocco germanys first and greatest wish is for a rich and prosperous france on the other hand germany is loyal to her friendships and fervent in her hatreds the country whose humiliation is a solemn charge upon my people is great britain and not france  monsieur décheles leaned back in his chair monsieur felix brant never moved  i want herr freudenberg continued to have you think and consider and weigh this matter why do you a great and prosperous country link yourselves with a decaying power against whom before very long germany is pledged to strike these are the plainest words that have ever been spoken by a citizen of one country to three citizens of another herr freudenberg the maker of toys speaks to his three french friends as a thoughtful merchant of his country who has had unusual facilities for imbibing the spirit of her politicians gentlemen you do not misunderstand me  it is impossible herr freudenberg monsieur décheles said to misunderstand you for a single moment your hand is too clear and your methods too sagacious  then let me repeat herr freudenberg declared that before many years are passedperhaps indeed before many monthsit is the intention of my country either to inflict a scathing diplomatic humiliation upon great britain or to engage in this war the fear of which has kept her in a state of panic for the last ten years keep that in your minds my friends friendship is a great thing honor is a great thing generosity is a great thing but i would speak to you three citizens of france today as i would speak to her rulers had i access to them and i would say do you dare for the sake of an alliance out of which you have procured no single benefit do you dare to drag your country into unnecessary fruitless and bloody war you have nothing to gain by it you have everything to lose let germany deal with her traditional enemy in her own way and as for france let france believe what is without doubt the truththat she has nothing whatever to fear from germany i will not speak of the past but the greatest thinkers in germany today regret nothing so much in the history of her splendid rise as that unfortunate campaign of bismarcks it is the one blot upon her magnificent history let that golet that go and be buried i bring you timely warning i come to the city i love for her own sake for the sake of her people whom i also love i beg you to listen to these words of mine to adjust your policy so that little by little you weaken the joints which bind you to england so that when the time comes you yourself may not be dragged into a hopeless and pitiless struggle  there was a moments silence then monsieur décheles spoke  herr freudenberg he began what you have said we have been in some measure prepared for the more amicable tone of all the correspondence between our two countries has been marked of late yet there have been times and not long ago when your country has shown wonderful readiness to treat with a rough hand the claims of france in many quarters of the world the more powerful your country the greater she is to be feared supposing france stood on one side while great britain fell before your arms what then would be the relations between france and germany  monsieur brant spoke for the first time  herr freudenberg you remind me of the fable of the persian who had two men to fight both as strong as himself to the one he sent ambassadors with the key of his favorite gardens the other he fought it is a great policy to deal with your enemies one at a time  herr freudenberg stretched out his arms across the table  my friend he pronounced without faith there is no genius without genius there is no government i only ask you to believe this one thing germany is not and never has been the traditional enemy of france i ask you to study the whole question for but one single halfhour i ask you to read the commercial records of these days help yourself to all the statistics that throw light upon this question and i swear that you will find that whereas great britain and germany stand opposed to one another under every condition and in every quarter of the world there is no single bone of contention anywhere between france and germany their aims are different their destinies are written i ask you to apply only a reasonable measure of philosophy and common sense a reasonable measure of faith to the things i say  there was a cautious tap at the door a whispered message monsieur pelleman rose  it is my secretary he announced i fear gentlemen that we are due elsewhere  herr freudenberg your luncheon has been delightful monsieur décheles declared holding out his hand you have given us as usual something to think of these informal meetings between citizens of two great countries will do i am sure more than anything else in the world to ripen our budding friendship  your words herr freudenberg replied grasping the hand which had been offered to him are a happy augury when we meet again i shall be able to prove the coming of the things of which i have spoken  they left him on the threshold of the room the giver of the feast was alone very slowly he retraced his steps and stood for a moment with folded arms looking down on the table at which they had lunched his natural urbanity the smile half persuasive half humorous which had parted his lips had gone his face seemed to have resolved itself into lines of iron as he stood there one seemed suddenly to realize the presence of a great mana greater even than carl freudenberg maker of toys     chapter xvi   have you ever loved   nothing which he had heard or imagined of madame christophor had prepared julien for the subdued yet manifest magnificence of her dwelling he passed through that small postern gate beneath the watch of a butler who relieved him of his stick and gloves and handed him over to a sort of majordomo afterwards he was conducted across a beautiful round hall lit with quaint fragments of stainedglass window through a picture gallery which almost took juliens breath away and into a small room very daintily furnished entirely and characteristically french of the louis seize period a round table was laid for two in front of an open window which looked out upon a lawn smooth and velvety with here and there little flowerbeds and in the middle a gray stone fountain madame christophor came in almost at the same moment from the garden she was wearing a long lace coat over the thinnest of muslin skirts and a hat with some violets in it which seemed to match exactly the color of her eyes  so you have come my friend of a few hours she said smiling at him the fear has not seized you yet you are not afraid that over my simple luncheon table i shall ask you compromising questions  i am neither afraid of your asking questions madame he assured her nor of my being tempted to reply to them  that she murmured is ungallant meanwhile we lunch  such a meal as he might have expected from such surroundings was swiftly and daintily served there was cantaloup cut in halves with the faintest suspicion of liqueur and a great globule of ice an omelette even for paris a wonderful omelettea mousse of chicken some asparagus a bowl of peaches and coffee after the latter had been served madame with a little wave of her hand dismissed the servants from the room  sir julien she said i am not pleased with you  he sighed  i regret your displeasure the more he declared because i find myself indebted to you for a new gastronomic ideal  you are really beginning to wake up she laughed when you first arrived here less than twentyfour hours ago you thought yourself a brokenspirited and brokenhearted man you were very dull soon you will begin to realize that life is a matter of epochs that no blow is severe enough to kill life itself it is only the end of an epoch but i am displeased with you as i said because you have told me nothing this morning i have letters from london i learn that through a single indiscretion not only were you forced to relinquish a great political career but that you were forced also to give up the lady for whom you cared  you have ingenious correspondents he remarked  truthful ones are they not  i was engaged to marry lady anne clonarty he admitted it was if i may venture to say so an alliance  madame christophors eyes twinkled  once she declared i met the duke of clonarty i also met the duchess i also saw lady anne they were traveling in great state through italy it was in rome that i came across them the duchess was very affable to me i think you have rightly expressed your affair of the heart my friend it was to have been an alliance  julien was thoughtful madame christophor in a moment continued  you know my friend she said tapping the ash from her cigarette into her saucer your misfortune came just in time to save you from becoming what in english you call a great a colossal prig  his eyebrows went up suddenly he smiled  perhaps he admitted to be a successful politician one must of necessity be a prig  not in the least she reminded him swiftly there is the prince von falkenberg  the maker of toys he murmured  the maker alas of toys which the world were better without she replied but never mind that for the sake of your ambitions you were content were you not to marry a young woman with whom you had not the slightest sympathy in order that she might receive your guests might add the lustre of her name to the expansion of her husbands genius  madame he said we live a very short time we live only one life only certain things are possible to us the man who tries to crowd everything into that life fails he is a dilettante he may find pleasure but he reaches no end he strikes no long sustained note in the eyes of those who come after him he is a failure  this she murmured is interesting please go on  the man who means to succeed he continued to succeed in any one position must sacrifice everything elsetemperament if necessary characterfor that one thing when i left college the study of politics was almost chosen for me it became a part of my life as my interest developed it is true that my outlook upon life was narrowed i was content to forget perhaps that i was a man i strove fervently and desperately to develop into the perfect political machine from that point of view nobody in england would have made me a better wife than lady anne clonarty  she nodded  what a blessing that you wrote that letter  i dont know he replied i still think it was a great misfortune frankly i have no idea what to make of my life i dont know how to start again to deal with the pieces in any intelligent fashion now that i am outside the thing i see the narrowness of it all i see that i was giving up many things which are interesting and beautiful many friendships that might have been delightful but on the other hand there was always the pressing on the big vital side the great throb of life i miss it i feel to myself as a great factory sounds on sundays and holidays when the engine that drives all the machinery of the place is silent i wander among the empty quiet places and i am lonely  have you ever loved a woman she asked  her voice had suddenly dropped he looked across the table her lips were slightly parted her eyes fixed upon his there was something shining out of them which he did not wholly understand he only knew that the question seemed to have stirred him in some new way an intense sense of pleasurable content a feeling as though he were listening to music stole through his senses this was a new thing he was bewildered he leaned a little further across the table he found himself watching the faint blue veins of her delicate fingers noticing the curious perfume of roses that seemed to come to him from the flutter of the lace around her neck  you are a man sir julien you must be thirtyfiveperhaps older yet somehow you have the look to me of one who has never cared at all  it is true he admitted  life she declared is a strange place a few months ago your whole career was one of ambition misfortune came or what you counted a misfortune you reckoned yourself ruined it is simply a change of poise you turn now naturally to the other things in life do you know that you will find them greater  he shook his head  it is too early for me to believe that he said i will admit that now and then in my forced solitude i have sometimes realized that one may become too engrossed in a career of ambition one may shut out many things in life that are sweet and wholesome but it is too early yet for me to look back upon what has happened with equanimity and say that i am glad to be a wanderer on the face of the earth a homeless man a waif   she shrugged her shoulders  you know that people are talking about you in london she asked abruptly  he looked a little startled  i know nothing of the sort he replied i have scarcely looked at a newspaper for weeks kendricks is over here with some story  who is kendricks she interrupted  a journalist an old friend of mine what he told me though i looked upon as simply a little more malice from my friend carraby  tell me exactly his news  he told me julien continued that there is a good deal of unrest over in london concerning our relations with france the absolute candor and completely good understanding which existed a short time ago seems to have become clouded carraby is trying to suggest in english circles that i have been using my influence over here against the present government the absurd part of it is that although i have been in france for a month i arrived in paris only yesterday  i was not alluding to that at all she said it is in the country places at the byelections and twice in the house itself lately that things have been said which point to a certain impatience at your having been dropped so completely you know brentwood  a strong firm man julien replied but scarcely a friend of mine  well in your house of parliament the night before last she continued he said that your country needed men at the foreign office who however great might be their love of peace still were not afraid of war and your name was mentioned  julien smiled  they used to call me the firebrand i suppose i am in a great minority i have never been able to see that a wholesome war in defense of ones territory and ones honor is an unmixed curse it is the natural bloodletting of a strong country  no wonder you are unpopular in radical circles she remarked raising her eyebrows but anyhow what i really want to say to you is this dont do anything rash you have made the acquaintance of the most dangerous man in europe dont let him control your actions dont let him influence you i want you always whatever you do to leave the way open for your return  he shook his head  i do not think that my return is ever possible  have you talked with your friend kendricks she asked  not yet he replied  hear what he has to say she continued bring him to see me if you will  i will try he promised  they were silent for a moment listening to the splashing of the fountain outside and the distant hum of the city  do you know that you are very kind to me he said  you were very much afraid of me yesterday she reminded him  had i any cause  she smiled  i shall not tell you my secrets you must find them out i have dabbled in politics i have dabbled in diplomacy i have not as a rule very much sympathy with your sex as i think you know it has never interested me before even to give good advice to a man if i were you sir julien beyond a certain point i would not trust madame christophor for when the time comes i have always the feeling that if a mans career lay within my power i would sooner wreck it than help him  of course you are talking nonsense he declared  am i she replied well i dont know i can look back now to a halfhour of my life when i loathed every creature that could call itself a man  but it was a single person he reminded her who sinned  his crime was too great to be the crime of a single man she asserted with a quiver of passion in her tone it was the culmination of the whole abominable selfishness of his sex one mans life is too light a price to pay for the tragedy of that halfhour i have never spared one of your sex since i never shall  so far you have been kind to me he persisted  up to a certain point beyond that i warn you i should have no pity if you were a wise man i think even now that you would thank me for my luncheon and take my hand and bid me farewell  instead of which he answered smiling i am waiting only to know when you will do me the honor to come and dine with me  she shook her head  i will make no appointment she said send me your telephone number directly you move into your rooms if i am weary of myself i may call for you but i tell you frankly that you must not expect it if i see a way of making use of you that will be different  may i come and see you again he begged you are dismissing me rather abruptly  she shrugged her shoulders she was looking weary as though the heat of the day had tried her  i care very little after all she answered whether i ever see you again i wish i could care although if i did the result would be the same  you asked me a question a short time ago he remarked let me ask you the same have you never cared for any one  i cared once for my husband  you have been married  most certainly i lived with my husband for two years  and now he persisted  we are separated you really do not know my other name  i have never heard you called anything but madame christophor  well you will hear it in time she assured him you will probably think you have made a great discovery in the meantime farewell  she gave him her hands he held them in his perhaps a little longer than was necessary she raised her eyes questioningly he drew them a little closer very quietly she removed the right one and touched a bell by her side  if my automobile is of any service to you sir julien she said pray use it it waits outside and i shall not be ready to go out for an hour at least  thank you he replied your automobile empty has no attractions  the butler was already in the room  see that sir julien makes use of my automobile if he cares to she ordered this has been a very pleasant visit i hope we may soon meet again  she avoided his eyes he had an instinctive feeling that she was either displeased or disappointed with him he followed the butler out into the hall filled with a vague sense of selfdissatisfaction     chapter xvii   kendricks is host   you are going to spend kendricks declared a democratic evening you are going to mix with common folk tonight we shall drink no champagne at forty francs the bottle on the other hand we shall probably drink a great deal more beer than is good for us how do you find the atmosphere here  filthy  i was afraid you might notice it kendricks remarked never mind presently you will forget it you have never been here before i presume  i have not julien agreed i daresay i shall find it interesting you wouldnt describe it as quiet would you  one does not eat quietly here kendricks replied four hundred people mostly germans when they eat are never silent the service of four hundred dinners continues at the same time listen to them close your eyes and you will appreciate the true music of crockery  if that infernal little band would keep quiet julien grumbled one might hear oneself talk  let us have no more criticisms kendricks begged tonight you are of the working class you may perhaps be a small manufacturer the agent of a manufacturing firm in the country a clerk with a moderate salary or a mechanic in his best clothes remember that and do not complain of the music you do not hear it every day let us hear no more blasé speeches if you please good the dinner arrives we dine here my friend for two francs you will probably require another meal before the evening is concluded on the other hand you may feel that you never require another meal as long as you live that is a matter of luck in any case you had better squeeze a little further up madame and her two daughters are going to sit next to you and opposite there will be monsieur and i judge the fiancé of one of the young ladies it will be a family party if there is anything in that dish of hors doeuvres which you fancy particularly help yourself quickly in a moment or two there will be no opportunity  the two men were seated opposite one another at a long table in a huge popular restaurant in the heart of the city it was kendricks plankendricks in fact had insisted upon it  you know my dear julien he continued a certain education is necessary for you if only i had a little more time i should be invaluable you have taken all your life too narrow a view that wretched eton training you would have been better off at a boardschool we all should  you were at winchester yourself julien reminded him trying some of the bread and approving of it  for a short time only kendricks admitted and then you forget the years after which i spent in the byways oh i know my people i know the common people of america and england and france and germany i know them and love them i love the middle classes too the honestly vulgar honestly snobbish foolishly ambitious yet overcautious middle class the extreme types of every nation lose their racial individuality you find the true thing only among the bourgeoisie oh if i only knew whether these people he added understood english  you must not risk it julien warned him madame has already her eye upon you  as a possible suitor for that unmated daughter on her right i suspect kendricks declared the young lady has looked at me twice and down at her plate julien you must change places  i shall do nothing of the sort julien retorted  if i ingratiate myself with this family and trouble comes of it kendricks continued the fault will be yours madame he added standing up and bowing will you permit me  madame had been looking at the bread kendricks gallantly offered it madames bows and smiles were a thing delightful to behold mademoiselle too would take bread if monsieur was so kind when kendricks sat down again the way was paved for general conversation julien however practically buttonholed his friend  kendricks he said you have told me nothing about england  there is little to tell kendricks replied the little there is will filter from me during the evening we are spending a long evening together you know julien  heavens alive julien groaned i am not sure that i am strong enough  eat that soup kendricks advised him that at least is sustaining never mind stirring it up to see what vegetables are at the bottom take my word for it it is good and leave the pepperpot alone how the people crowd in you perceive the commercial traveler with a customer how they talk about that last order the fat man facing you puzzles me i wish i could know the occupation of our neighbors i am curious  i should ask them julien suggested dryly  an idea kendricks assented approvingly let us wait until they have drunk the free wine you understand my dear julien that you pay nothing for that flask which stands by your side it comes with the dinner it is free  julien helped himself and sipped it thoughtfully  at least he murmured as he set his glass down one is thankful that we do not pay for it  there are some kendricks remarked who prefer beer personally i like to preserve my local color vin ordinaire in paris beer in germany madame  kendricks had caught madames eye with the glass at his lips he rose at once and bowed madame acknowledged his graciousness with a huge smile which spread even to her double chin monsieur leaned forward and joined in the ceremony mademoiselle after a timid glance at her mother also responded kendricks character as an englishman of gallantry was thoroughly established  i am doing our national character good he declared to julien as he set down his glass empty as to my own constitutionbut let that pass we will drown this stuff in honest beer later on how are you getting on with the fish  it is excellentreally excellent julien proclaimed do you mean to say seriously that you are going to pay only two francs each for this repast  not a centime more kendricks assured him do you know why i brought you here  part of my education i suppose julien replied resignedly  quite true further than that i am here on business for my paper i am here to study the effect of the german invasion of paris this place is being spoken of as being the haunt of germans it still seems to me that i find plenty of the real french people  do we pursue your investigations elsewhere during the course of the evening julien inquired  the whole of our evening kendricks told him is devoted to that purpose and incidentally he added to your education we are going for redblooded pleasure tonight for the real thingfor the hearty laughs for the wholesome appetites no caviare sandwiches overdry champagne rouged lips and rue de la paix hats for us if we make love we make love honestly mademoiselle may permit a clasp of her handno more  so far julien remarked mademoiselle  that is for later kendricks interrupted briskly we shall go to a singinghalla german singinghall the mademoiselles whom we meet will probably have their own sweethearts somehow tonight i fancy that we shall be lookerson what does it matter we shall at least see life we shall catch the shadows of other peoples happinesses it is i believe the sincerest form the chicken dear julienwhat of the chicken  julien hesitated  there is little to be said against it he confessed the only trouble is that it fails to arrive  kendricks summoned a waiter a task of no inconsiderable difficulty for the service was automaticthe dishes were set upon the table and the waiter disappeared for the next lot anything intervening was almost impossible monsieur kendricks declared pointing indignantly across the table had not been served with chicken the waiter shook his head it was unheard of monsieur had probably had his chicken and forgotten it the chicken had been brought two portions there was no doubt about it but where then had the chicken been hidden kendricks became fluent he looked under the table he pointed to his friends empty plate the waiter only half convinced departed with a vague promise kendricks sipped his wine  it is a regrettable incident he declared but in the excitement of conversation julien i ate both portions of chicken  he had lapsed into french the language in which he had argued with the waiter madame was overcome with the humor of the affair mademoiselle tittered as she leaned across and told her fiancé the unattached mademoiselle looked her sympathy with julien monsieur saw the joke and laughed heartily they looked reproachfully at kendricks to them it was indeed a tragedy  madame kendricks explained it is not my custom to be so greedy the waiter set both portions before me meaning without doubt that i should pass one to my friend alas in the pleasure of conversation in these delightful surroundingshe bowed low to mademoisellesomething i dont know what it was carried me away and i ate and ate until both portions were vanished ah he exclaimed triumph the waiter returns he brings chicken too for my friend garçon you have done well you shall be rewarded it is excellent  the waiter still with a protesting air passed up the chicken the little party was convulsed with merriment they all watched julien eat his tardy course kendricks with an air of recklessness sipped more wine  i flatter myself he said that before very long i shall have taught you to forget that you were ever a cabinet minister that you were ever at eton that you were ever at oxford one does not live in those places you know julien one shrivels instead of expands my friend we have dined  is there nothing more julien asked  there is fruit kendricks admitted it was in my mind to spare you the fruit i see it to right and left of us being handed aroundnuts a banana apples whose exterior i trust is misleading never mind you have desired fruit and you shall have it waiter monsieur desires his fruit  the waiter disappeared and in a moment or two julien was served  coffee if you will  no coffee thanks julien decided if we are really going to spend the evening visiting places of entertainment of a similar class let us reserve our coffee a large cigar i think  kendricks sighed  i hate to go mademoiselle opposite is pleased with me i have made a good impression upon madame monsieur is ready to extend to me the right hand of fellowship one of those pleasing little romances one dreams about might here find a commencement in a weeks time i might be accepted as a soninlaw of the house i see all the signs of assent already beaming in madames eye perhaps we had better go julien  they took their leave not without the exchange of many smiles and bows with the little family party they left behind they walked slowly down the room arm in arm  we were fortunate you see in our neighbors kendricks declared there are germans everywhere here one is curious about these people one wonders how far they have imbibed the manners and customs of the people among whom they live are they still absolutely and entirely teutons do you suppose do they intermarry here make friends or do they remain an alien element  to judge by appearances julien remarked they remain an alien element it is astonishing how seldom you see mixed parties of french people and germans here  it is exactly to make observations upon that point that i am in paris kendricks asserted my people are curious they want me to watch and write about it do you know that there is a feeling in london julien that we are reaching the climax  julien nodded  i can quite believe it he replied falkenberg seems to show every desire to force our hand  may the lord deliver us from a germanized paris kendricks prayed they may have the ritz if they will and the elysées palace they may have all the halls of fashion and gilt and wealth they may swamp the pré catelan and the armenonville so long as they leave us the real paris come we take our coffee here this is a german café if you like never mind let us see if by chance any french people have wandered in  they drank coffee at a little table in a huge building hung with tobacco smoke with the inevitable band at one end and crowded with people kendricks smiled as the waiter brought them sugared cakes with their coffee  it is germany he declared look an odd frenchman or two perhaps no french women look at the hats the womens faces the hats looked well enough in the shopwindows here what an ignoble end for them from an aesthetic point of view julien nothing is more terrible than the domesticity of the german if only he could be persuaded to leave his wife at home think how much more attractive it would make these places he would have more money to spend upon himself upon his own beer and his own pretzels and in time no doubt a lonely feeling a feeling of sentiment would overpower him and the vacant chair would be filled by one of these vivacious little women who might teach him in time that blood was meant to flow not to ooze like mud  i shall begin to think julien remarked that you dont like germans  there you are wrong kendricks replied in their own country i like them they have all the good qualities germany for the germans i should say always and me for any other country we have drunk our coffee let us go  they passed on to a musichall where they listened to a mixed performance and drank beer out of long glasses served to them by a distinctly teutonic waiter greatly to kendricks annoyance however they were surrounded by english and americans and were too tightly packed in to change their seats on the way out however he suddenly beamed  behold he exclaimed  he swept his hat from his head it was their companions at the dinner table madame was pleased to remember him also mademoiselle  i shall invite them to supper kendricks declared  if you do julien retorted i shall go home  kendricks heaved a long sigh as he regretfully let them pass by  its just a touch of oxford left in you he complained for myself i know that madame would be excellent company and i am perfectly certain that mademoiselle would let me whisperdiscreetlyin her ear alas it is a lost opportunity and from here we goto who knows what  he was suddenly serious julien looked at him in surprise they were standing on the pavement outside kendricks consulted his watch  you have courage i know my friend he said that is one reason why i choose you for my companion tonight i have two tickets for a german socialist gathering here the tickets were obtained with extraordinary difficulty i know that your german is pure and i can trust to my own from this minute not a word in any other language if you please  i am really not sure julien objected that i want to go to a german socialist meeting in any case i am hungry  hungry kendricks exclaimed hungry what ingratitude but be calm my friend he added taking juliens arm there will be sausages and beer where we are going  in that case julien agreed i am with you which way  almost opposite us kendricks declared come along  they paused outside a brilliantly lit café with a german name julien looked at it doubtfully  surely they dont hold meetings in a place like this he muttered  kendricks lowered his voice  we go into the café first he said the meeting is in a private room come  they pushed open the swinging doors and entered the place     chapter xviii   a meeting of socialists   the brasserie into which the two men pushed their way was smaller and less ornate than the one which they had last visited many of the tables too were laid for supper the tone of the place was still entirely teutonic kendricks and his companion seated themselves at a table  you will eat sausage kendricks asked  i will eat anything julien replied  it is better kendricks remarked here from the first we may be watched we are certainly observed be sure that you do not let fall a single word of english it might be awkward afterwards  its a beastly language julien declared but the beer and sausages help how many of the people here will be at the meeting  not a hundredth part of them kendricks answered it was a terrible job to get these tickets and i wouldnt like to guarantee now that we have them that we get there remember if any questions are asked youre an american the editor or envoy of the coming age  the dickens i am julien exclaimed where am i published  in new york youre a new issue  julien ate sausages and bread and butter steadily for several minutes  to me he announced there is something more satisfying about a meal of this description than that twofranc dinner where you stole my chicken  you have teutonic instincts without a doubt kendricks declared but after all why not a light dinner and an appetite for supper better for the digestion better for the pocket better for passing the time what are you staring at  julien was looking across the room with fixed eyes  i was watching a man who has been sitting at a small table over there he remarked he has just gone out through that inner door for a moment i could have sworn that it was carl freudenberg  kendricks shook his head  mr carl freudenberg takes many risks but i do not think he would care to show himself here  it is no crime that he is in paris julien objected  in a sense it is kendricks said these incognito visits of his must soon cease if they were talked too much about then there is another thing this café is the headquarters of german socialism in paris and herr freudenberg is the sworn enemy of socialists he fights them with an iron hand wherever he comes into contact with them this is a lawabiding place without a doubt and the germans as a rule are a lawabiding people but i would not feel quite sure that he would leave unmolested if he were recognized here at this minute  you think he knows that julien asked  knows it kendricks replied scornfully there is nothing goes on in paris that he does not know he peers into every nook and corner of the city he knows the feelings of the aristocrats of the bourgeoisie of the official classes not only that he knows their feelings towards england towards the triple alliance towards russia he never seems to ask questions he never forgets an answer he is a wonderful man in short but i do not think that you will see him here tonight  the long hand of the clock pointed toward midnight kendricks called for the bill and paid it  we go this way he announced through the billiard rooms  they left the café by the swingdoor to which julien had pointed passed through a crowded billiard room every table of which was in use down a narrow corridor till they came face to face with a closed door on which was inscribed number 12 kendricks knocked softly and it was at once opened there was another door a few yards further on and between the two a very tall doorkeeper and a small man in spectacles  who are you the doorkeeper demanded gruffly  kendricks produced his tickets the tall man however did not move he scrutinized them word for word then he scrutinized the faces of the two men kendricks he seemed inclined to pass but he looked at julien for long and in a puzzled manner  of what nationality is your friend he asked kendricks  i am an american julien replied  and your profession  a newspaper editor i edit the coming age  this is not altogether in order the tall man declared the meeting which we are holding tonight is not one in which the press is interested we are here to discuss one man and one man only i do not think that you would hear anything you could print and as you do not belong to our direct association here i think it would be better if you did not enter  kendricks stood his ground however  i must appeal he said to your secretary  the little man in spectacles came forward kendricks stated his case with much indignation  here am i he announced editor of the only socialist paper in london worthy of the title i come over because i hear of this meeting i bring with me my american friend the editor of the coming age for no other reason have we visited paris than for this if you refuse us admission to this meeting the whole of the english branch will consider it an insult  and the american julien put in firmly  the two men whispered together the taller one still grumbling stood on one side  pass in he directed it is not strictly in order but our secretary permits  the two men passed on the room in which they found themselves was a small one and there were not more than fifty people present it was very dimly lit and they could barely make out the forms of the row of men who were sitting upon chairs upon the platform they contented themselves with seats quite close to the door no drinks were being served here although one or two men were smoking the general aspect seemed to be one of stern and serious intensity a man upon the platform was just finishing speaking as they entered and he apparently called upon some one else a large and heavy german stood up on the centre of the slightly raised stage he wore shapeless clothes and hornrimmed spectacles his face was benevolent he had a double chin and a soft voice  my brothers he said at these our meetings we have many things to discuss we have little time to waste why beat about the bush i am here to speak to you of the greatest enemy our cause has in the worldprince adolf rudolf von falkenberg  he paused there was an ugly little murmur through the room it was very easy indeed to understand that the man whose name had been mentioned was unpopular  the cause of socialism the speaker continued is the one cause we all have at heart in our fatherland it flourishes but it flourishes slowly the reason that we are denied our just and legitimate triumphs is simply owing to the vigorous opposition the brutal enmity of prince adolf rudolf von falkenberg my brothers this man has been warned his only answer has been a fresh and more diabolical measure he fights us everywhere with the fierceness of a man who hates his enemy it is our duty brethren that we do not see our cause retarded by the enmity of any one man therefore it is my business to say to you tonight that that man should be removed  there was a murmur of voices one clearer than the others  but how  the man on the platform adjusted his spectacles  my brother asks how i will tell him falkenberg loves war we others hate it we work always to infuse throughout the army our own principles and theories falkenberg falls upon them with all his might and main there are orders posted in every barracks in germany our literature is confiscated any man preaching our doctrines is drummed out upon the streets i say that these things cannot last i say that falkenberg must go a friend in the audience has asked how i will answer you there is a body of men whose beliefs are somewhat similar to ours but who go further it is possible they see the truth but for us at present it is not possible to accept their general principles this case is an exception the anarchists of berlin one of whom franz kuzman is here tonight will dispose of falkenberg for us if we provide sufficient funds to make an escape possible and an annuity for the executioner should he live or for his wife should he die  there was a slow ominous murmur of voices the fat man on the platform beamed at everybody  kuzman is here upon the platform he announced does any one wish to hear him  kuzman stood upan awkward rawboned darkfeatured man in a coat that was too short for him he stood rather like a puppet upon the platform  if you delegates of the socialist societies decide that it is just he said in a hoarse unpleasant tone i am willing to see that falkenberg meets his reward i can say no more i do not fail i move against no one save those who deserve death and against whom the death sentence has been pronounced but when i do move that man dies  he resumed his seat the fat man went on  is it your wish he asked that kuzman be authorized by you to arrange this affair  the murmur of voices was scarcely intelligible  into the hands of every one of you the fat man continued will be placed a strip of paper you will write upon it yes or no kuzman will be instructed according to your verdict  some one on the platform bustled around kendricks and julien were both supplied with the long strips in a few minutes these were collected the man upon the platform turned up the lights a little higher he drew a small table towards him and began sorting out the papers into two heaps one was obviously much larger than the other towards the end he came across a slip however at which he paused he read it with knitted brows half rose to his feet and stopped then he went on with his counting presently he got up  my brothers he said there are fortytwo papers here of these thirtyfive agree to the appointment of kuzman for the purpose we have spoken of six are against it one paper i will read to you the writer has not troubled to put yes or no this is what i find  falkenberg has served his emperor and his country to the whole extent of his will and his capacity he has given his life to make his country great if he has been stern upon the cause of socialism it is because he does not believe that socialism as it is at present preached is good for germany i vote therefore that falkenberg live  we desire to know the speaker continued who wrote those words they do not sound like the words of one of our delegates johann and hesler stand by the door turn up the lights let us see exactly who there is here tonight unknown to us  there was a little murmur a man who sat only three or four places off from kendricks and julien rose silently to his feet and moved towards the door it was as yet locked however from the other end of the room the lights were suddenly heightened the faces of the men were now distinctly visible a light in the body of the hall flared up a man was discovered with his hand upon the door handle there was a hoarse murmur of voices  who is he hold fast of the door let no one pass out  the man turned quickly round the light flashed upon his face julien was the first to recognize him and he gripped kendricks by the arm  my god he muttered its falkenberg himself who is the man with the key  kendricks pointed to him they crept closer then that hoarse murmur of voices turned suddenly into a low passionate cry  falkenberg falkenberg himself  the toymaker made no further attempt at concealment he drew himself up and faced them they were creeping towards him now from all corners of the rooman uglylooking set of men men with an ugly purpose in their faces  yes i am falkenberg he cried i am here to spy upon you if you will why not kill me if you choose but i warn you that if you do the whole of germany will rise against you and your cause  dont let him escape some one shouted from the platform  gag him  it is fate  he is ours  a rope  there was no mistaking the feeling of the men julien whispered swiftly in kendricks ear simultaneously his right arm shot out the man who guarded the door felt his neck suddenly twisted back kendricks snatched the key from his hand and thrust it in the lock some one struck him a violent blow on the head he reeled but was still able to turn the key they came then with a howl from all parts of the room julien felt a storm of blows falkenberg with one swoop of his long arm disposed of their nearest assailant  get off man kendricks ordered you first  the door was wide open now they half stumbled half fell into the outer café the orchestra stopped playing people rose to their feet before they well knew what was happening falkenberg had slipped through their midst and passed out of the door one of the pursuers with a howl of rage sprang after him but he tripped against an abutting marble table and fell kendricks and julien stepped quietly to one side threading their way among the throng of customers in the cafe loud voices shouted for an explanation  it was a pickpocket some one called out from among those who came streaming from the rooma tall man with a wound on the forehead did no one see him  they all looked towards the door  he passed out so swiftly they murmured  several of them had already reached the door of the café and were rushing down the street in the direction which falkenberg had taken  there were two others a grim voice shouted from behind  a waiter who had seen the two men sit down looked doubtfully towards them kendricks pushed a note into his hand  serve us with something quickly he begged  the man pocketed the note and set before them the beer which he was carrying kendricks whose knuckles were bleeding laid his hand under the table julien took a long drink of the beer and began to recover his breath  so far he declared i have found your evening with the masses a little boisterous  kendricks laughed  wait till my hand has stopped bleeding he said and we will slip out that was a narrow escape for falkenberg what a pluck the fellow must have  it seems almost like a foolhardy risk julien muttered if those fellows could have got at him theyd have killed him have they gone back to their room i wonder let us hear what the people say about the affair  what was the disturbance he asked  the man shrugged his shoulders  it was a meeting in one of the private rooms of the café he declared a meeting of some society they were taking a vote when they discovered a pickpocket he bolted out of the room they say that he has got away  did he steal much julien inquired  the man shook his head  a watch and chain or something of the sort he told them the excitement is all over now the gentlemen have gone back to their meeting  julien smiled and finished his beer  is our evening at an end kendricks he asked  kendricks shook his head  not quite he replied binding his handkerchief around his knuckles if you are ready there is just one other call we might make  more german brasseries  kendricks smiled grimly  not tonight we climb once more the hill we pay our respects to monsieur albert  the rat mort  exactly     chapter xix   an offer   kendricks as they entered the café recognized his friends with joy openly expressed  it is fate he exclaimed striking a dramatic attitude  it is the gentleman who ate both portions of chicken mademoiselle cried  it is the gallant englishman of the café helder madame laughed her double chin becoming more and more evident  and yonder in the corner sits mademoiselle ixe kendricks whispered to julien for whom does she wait i wonder  for herr freudenberg suggested julien  for herr freudenberg let us pray kendricks replied  the husband of madame the father of mademoiselle the rightly conceived future papainlawtobe of the attendant young man rose to his feet in response to a kick from his wife  if monsieur is looking for a table he suggested there is room here adjoining ours it will incommode us not in the slightest  of all places in the room kendricks declared with a bow the most desirable the most charming madame indeed permitsand mademoiselle  there were more bows more pleasant speeches a small additional table was quickly brought kendricks ignored the more comfortable seat by juliens side and took a chair with his back to the room from here he leaned over and conversed with his new friends he started flirting with mademoiselle he paid compliments to madame he suddenly plunged into politics with monsieur julien listened half in amusement half in admiration for kendricks was not talking idly  a man of affairs monsieur kendricks proclaimed himself to be my interest in both countries madame he continued knowing well that she too loved to talk of the affairs is great i am one of those indeed who have benefited largely by this delightful alliance  alliance monsieur smiled at the word kendricks protested  but what else shall we call it dear friends he argued are we not allied against a common foe the exact terms of the entente what does it matter is it credible that england would remain idle while the legions of germany overran this country  monsieur was becoming interested so was madame it was madame who spokeone gathered that it was usual  what then she demanded would england do  she would come to the aid of your charming country madame  but how madame persisted pertinently  kendricks was immediately fluent he talked in ornate phrases of the resources of the british empire the perfection of her fleet the wonder of her new guns julien who knew him well was amazed not only at his apparent earnestness but at his insincerity he was speaking well and with a wealth of detail which was impressive enough his little company of new friends were listening to him with marked attention julien alone seemed conscious that they were listening to a man who was speaking against his own convictions  monsieur monsieur julien  it was the voice of mademoiselle ixe she was leaning slightly forward in her place julien turned quickly around and she motioned him to a seat by her side he rose at once and accepted her invitation  i do not disturb you she asked it seemed to me that your friend was talking with those strange people there and that you were not very much interested it is dull when one sits here alone  naturally julien agreed my friend talks politics and for my part it is very certain that i would sooner talk of other things with mademoiselle  she was a born flirta matter of nationality as well as temperament and not to be escapedand her eyes flashed the correct reply but a moment later she was gazing wistfully at the door  you expect herr freudenberg julien inquired  i cannot tell she replied i must not say that i am expecting him because he did not ask me to meet him here but i thought perhaps that he might comeso i risked it i was restless tonight i do not sing this week because herr freudenberg is in paris and without any occupation it is hard to control the thoughts i sat at home until i could bear it no longer eh bien i sent for a little carriage and i ventured here there is a chance that he may come  mademoiselle permits that i offer her some supper julien suggested  she hesitated and glanced at the clock  you are very kind sir julien she answered i have waited because i have thought that there was a chance that he might come and to sup alone is a drear thing if monsieur reallyah behold after all it is he it is he who comes what happiness  it was indeed herr freudenberg who had mounted the stairs and was yielding now his coat to the attentive vestiaireherr freudenberg unruffled and precisely attired in evening clothes he showed not the slightest signs of his recent adventure he chatted gayly to albert and waved his hand to mademoiselle he came towards them with a smile upon his face walking lightly and with the footsteps of a young man yet mademoiselle shivered her lip drooped  he is not pleased she murmured i have done wrong  there was nothing apparent to others in herr freudenbergs manner to justify her conviction he raised her fingers to his lips with charming gayety  dear marguerite he exclaimed this is indeed a delightful surprise and sir julien too i am enchanted once more let us celebrate let us sup i am in time eh  with me if you please julien insisted taking up the menu  herr freudenberg smiled genially  host or guest who cares so long as we are joyous he cried sitting on mademoiselles other side although tonight he added with a humorous glance at julien it should surely be i who entertains dear marguerite  he patted her hand she looked at him pathetically and he smiled back again  be happy my child he begged it is gone that little twinge it was perhaps jealousy he whispered in her ear sir julien has captured many hearts  she drew a sigh of content she raised his hand to her lips then she dabbed at her eyes with the few inches of perfumed lace which she called a handkerchief it was passing that evil moment  there is no man in the world she told him softly who should be able to make you jealous in your heart you know  he laughed lightly  you will make me vain dear one give me your little fingers to hold for a moment thereit is finished  he looked around the room with the light yet cheerful curiosity of the pleasureseeker then he leaned over towards julien  what does our shockheaded friend the journalist do in that company he asked with a backward motion of his head  julien smiled  he is devoted to madame with the double chin he is apparently also devoted to mademoiselle the daughter of madame with the double chin he is contemplating i believe an alliance with the bourgeoisie  herr freudenberg watched the group for a moment with a slight frown  they are types he said under his breath absolute types kendricks is studying them without a doubt  he continued his scrutiny of the room then he leaned towards mademoiselle  dear marguerite  yes  there is mademoiselle soupelles there he pointed out sitting with an untidylooking man in a morning coat and a red tie you see them  but certainly mademoiselle agreed they are together always it is an alliance that  it would please me herr freudenberg continued still speaking almost under his breath to converse with the companion of mademoiselle soupelles from you dear marguerite i conceal nothing i made no appointment with you tonight because it was my intention to speak with that person and i could not tell where he would be all has happened fortunately we spend our evening together after all see what you can do to help me go and talk to your friend mademoiselle soupelles bring them here if you can sir julien thinks he is ordering the supper but he is too late i ordered it from albert as i entered  mademoiselle rose at once and shook out her skirts she kissed her hand across the room to her friend  i go to speak to her she promised what i can do i will you know that dear one but he is a strangelooking man this companion of hers you know who he is his name is jesen if i were susanne i would see to it that he was more commeilfaut  herr freudenberg laughed  never mind his appearance he said he can drive the truth into the hearts of this people as swiftly and as surely as any man who ever took up a pen bring him here little sweetheart and tomorrow we visit cartier together  she glanced at him almost reproachfully  as if that mattered she murmured as she glided away  julien turned discontentedly to his companion  this fellow will take no order from me he objected do you own this place herr freudenberg that you must always be obeyed here  by no means herr freudenberg replied tonight is an exception i ordered supper as i entered you see there are others whom i may ask to join you shall have your turn when you will and i will be a very submissive guest but tonightwell i have even at this moment charged mademoiselle with a message to her friend and her friends companion i have begged them to join us on these nights i like companyplenty of company  in that case perhaps julien suggested i may be de trop  freudenberg laid his hand upon his companions shoulder  my friend he said earnestly it is not for you to talk like that tonight of all nights if i say little it is because we are both men of few words and i think that we understand you know very well what you and your shockheaded friend have done for me not that i believe he went on that it would ever come to me to be hounded to death by such a gang i am too fervent a believer in my own star for that but one never knows it is well anyhow to escape with a sound skin  why did you run such a risk julien asked him  partly freudenberg answered because i was really curious to know what those fellows were driving at and partly he added because alas i am possessed of that restless spirit that everlasting craving for adventures which drives one on into any place where life stirs i knew that these people were plotting something against me i wanted to hear it with my own ears to understand exactly what it was against which i must be prepared but now sir julien i question you as for me my presence there was reasonable enough but what were you doing in such a place what interests have you in german socialism  julien shrugged his shoulders  i cannot say that i have any he admitted it was kendricks who took me he is showing me parisparis from his own point of view he took me first to a restaurant where we dined for two francs and sat at the same table with those people to whom he is now making himself so agreeable kendricks has democratic instincts his latest fad is to try and instil them into me  herr freudenberg looked thoughtfully across at the journalist still deep in argument with his friends  i am not sure that i understand that man he declared in a sense he impresses me i should have put him down as one of those who do nothing without a set and fixed purpose but enough of other people listen i wish to speak with youof yourself i am glad that we have met tonight i have another and altogether a different proposition to make to you  julien remained silent for several moments herr freudenberg watched him  a proposition to make to me julien repeated at last well let me hear it  herr freudenberg leaned towards him  sir julien he said there has happened to you as to many of us a little slip in your life it is a wise thing if for a few months you pass off the stage of european affairs you are of an adventurous spirit will you undertake a commission for me listen i will guarantee that it is something which does not and could not ever by any chance affect in the slightest degree the interests of your country it is a commission which will take you a year to execute and it will lead you into a new land it will require tact diplomacy and some courage if you succeed your reward will be an income for life if you fail the worst that can happen to you is that you will have passed a year of your life without effective result still you will at least have traveled you will at least have seen new phases of life  julien was puzzled  you cannot seriously propose to me he protested to undertake a diplomatic errand for a country which has absolutely no claims upon meto which i am not even attracted he added  herr freudenberg tapped with his forefinger upon the table upon his lips was a genial and tolerant smile he had the air of a preceptor devoting special pains upon the most backward member of his kindergarten class  my friend he said there is no political question involved whatever the mission which i ask you to undertake would lead you into a remote part of africa where neither your country nor mine has at present any interests more than this i cannot tell you unless you show signs of accepting my invitation the negotiations which you would have to conduct are simply these four years ago a distinguished german scientist who was in command of a somewhat rash expedition was captured by the ruler of the country to which i wish you to travel for some time the question of a mission to ascertain his fate has been upon the carpet it is true that we have received letters from him he professes to be happy and contented to have been kindly treated and to have accepted a post in the army of his captor we wish to know whether these letters are genuine or not if they are genuine all is well but a suspicion still remains among some of us that the person in question is being held in torture as an example to other white men who might penetrate so far this is the first object in the journey which i propose to you there is nothing political about it at all as you perceive it is purely a matter of humanity ah i see that our party is to be increased here are some new friends who arrive  mademoiselle ixe had succeeded she returned now to her place followed by the girl with the chestnutcolored hair and her companion at close quarters the latter at any rate was scarcely prepossessing he was a man of middle age untidily dressed whose clothes were covered with cigar ash and recent wine stains whose linen was none of the cleanest and whose eyes behind his pincenez were already bloodshot herr freudenberg however seemed to notice none of these unpleasant defects he grasped him vigorously by the hand  it is monsieur jesen he exclaimed often you have been pointed out to me and i have long wished to have the pleasure of making your acquaintance sit down and join us monsieur your little friend tooah mademoiselle  he bent low over the girls hand and placed a seat for her the party was now arranged their host beamed upon them all  come he continued this is perhaps my last night in paris for some time we have had adventures too within these few hours you find us celebrating my english friend here is one of us i will not introduce him by name why should we trouble about names we are all friends all good fellows here to pass the time agreeably to drink good wine to look into beautiful eyes mademoiselle to amuse ourselves it is the science of life that monsieur jesen mademoiselle dear marguerite my english friend here let me be sure that your glasses are filled to the very brim garçonto the very brim let us drink together to the joyous evenings of the past to the joyous evenings of the future to these few present hours that lie before us when we shall sit here and taste further this very admirable vintage to the wine we drink to the lips we love to this hour of life  for the moment there was no more serious conversation herr freudenberg had started a vein of frivolity to which every one there was quick to respond only every now and then he himself the giver of the feast had suddenly the look of a different man as he sat and whispered in the ear of monsieur jesen     chapter xx   falkenberg acts   at two oclock with obvious reluctance kendricks new friends departed their leavetaking was long and ceremonious kendricks indeed insisted upon escorting mademoiselle to the door madame left the place with the assured conviction that a prospective soninlaw was soon to present himselfit could be for no other reason that the english gentleman had so sedulously attached himself to their party monsieur having less sentiment was not so sure mademoiselle had both hopes and fears they discussed the matter fully on their homeward drive  kendricks strolled over to the table where julien was and touched him on the shoulder  is this to be another allnight sitting he asked  herr freudenberg was deep in conversation with monsieur jesenthe friend of mademoiselles friend he glanced up but his greeting was almost perfunctory kendricks looked keenly at the man who was leaning back in his padded seat the eyes of monsieur jesen were a little more bloodshot now he had spilt wine down the front of his waistcoat cigar ash upon his coatsleeve he was by no means an inviting person to look at yet about his forehead and mouth there was an expression of power herr freudenberg with obvious regret abandoned his conversation for a moment  you are taking your friend away he remarked suavely we shall part from him with regret sir julien he added whispering in his ear i must have your answer to my proposition i will put it into absolutely definite shape if you like within the next few days  i move into my old roomsnumber 17 rue de montpeliertomorrow morning or rather this morning julien replied you might telephone or call there at any time  tell me is what i have proposed in any way attractive to you herr freudenberg asked still speaking in an undertone  in a sense it is julien answered it needs further consideration of course i must also consult my friend  herr freudenberg glanced at kendricks and shrugged his shoulders he had the air of one slightly annoyed kendricks was bending over mademoiselle ixe herr freudenberg whispered in juliens ear  you take too much advice from your boisterous friend dear sir julien he asserted mark my words he will try to keep you here cooling your heels upon the mat he will prevent you from raising your hand to knock upon the door of destiny these men who write are like that they do not understand action  kendricks turned from mademoiselle  you are ready julien he asked  quite julien answered  they made their adieux herr freudenberg watched them leave the room the man by his sidemonsieur jesenalso watched a little curiously  an english journalist herr freudenberg remarked some say a man of ability i find him a trifle boisterous and uncouth monsieur jesen our conversation interests me immensely i feel sure  jesen looked suspiciously around  we have talked enough of business he declared it is an idea this of yours for the rest i cannot tell a wonderful idea he continued and as for me am i not the man to embrace it  you have but to say a single word herr freudenberg reminded him softly and all is arranged  monsieur jesen puffed furiously at a cigarette the fingers which had held the match to it were shaking the man himself seemed unsteady on his seat yet it was obvious that his brain was working  herr freudenberg he said there is but one weak point in all your chain of arguments to do as you ask it will be necessary that ii paul jesen so wellknown whose opinions are followed by millions of my country peopleit would be necessary for me to abandon my convictions to turn a rightaboutface ask yourself is it not like selling ones honor when one writes the things one does not believe  herr freudenberg smiled  my friend you ask me a question the reply to which is already spoken i tell you that behind at the back of your brain you know and realize the truth of all these things think man call to mind the arguments i have used remember i have lifted the curtain i have shown you the things that arrive the things that are inevitable  mademoiselle the companion of monsieur jesen had had enough of this it was her weekly holiday she yawned and tapped her friend upon the arm  my dear paul she protested while you and herr freudenberg talk as two men who have immense affairs marguerite and i we weary ourselves if i am to be alone like this very good i speak to my friends there is monsieur de chaussin there he throws me a kiss do you wish that i sit with him he looks indeed as though he had plenty to say or there is the melancholy italian gentleman who raises his glass always when i look and the two americans  you have reason little one monsieur jesen interrupted herr freudenberg this is no place for such a discussion  agreed herr freudenberg exclaimed we owe our apologies to mademoiselle your charming friend and mademoiselle my adored companion he added turning to marguerite come let us drink more wine let us talk together what is your pleasure mademoiselle the friend of my good friend monsieur jesen will you have them dance to us is there music to which you would listen or shall we pray marguerite here that she sings let us at any rate be gay and for the rest monsieur jesen time has no count for us who live our lives when we leave here you and i will talk more  it was daylight before they left the whole party got into herr freudenbergs motor  i drive you first to your rooms monsieur jesen he said i take then the liberty of entering with you the little conversation which we have begun is best concluded within the shelter of four walls  monsieur jesen was excited yet nervous  it is too late he muttered to talk business  herr freudenberg smiled  ah he cried you jest my friend look out of that window you see the sunshine in the streets you breathe the fresh clear air too late indeed it is morning and the brain is keenest then dont you feel the fumes of the hot room of the wine of the tobacco smoke all pass away with the touch of that soft wind  monsieur jesen stared he was conscious of a very bad headache an uncomfortable sense that he had as usual on his weekly holiday eaten and drunk and smoked a great deal more than was good for him he gazed with wonder at this tall sparelooking man who had drunk as much and smoked as much and eaten as much as any one else and yet appeared exactly as he had done four hours ago even his linen was still spotless his eyes were bright his manner buoyant  monsieur he murmured you are marvelous i have never before met a german merchant like you  herr freudenberg sat quite still for a moment he looked at mademoiselle the friend of monsieur jesen and he realized that theirs was no casual acquaintance in both he recognized the characteristics of fidelity as he had always the genius to do he took his risks  monsieur jesen he announced i am no german maker of toys let me ascend with you to your room and you shall hear who i am and why i have said these things to you  monsieur jesen held his hand to his head something in the manner of this new friend of his was in a sense mesmeric  you shall ascend monsieur he said i do not know who you are but you are evidently a very wonderful person we will ascend and you shall wait while i place my head in cold water and susanne mixes me some absinthe then i will listen  the automobile came to a standstill about halfway down a shabby street in a somewhat shabby neighborhood herr freudenberg noticed this fact without change of countenance but with secret pleasure he turned to marguerite  dear marguerite he whispered for an hour or so i must leave you you will permit that my man takes you to your apartments and returns for me here  may i not wait for you here in the automobile she asked timidly  herr freudenberg shook his head kindly  dear little one he murmured not this morning indeed i have important affairs on hand as soon as i am free i will telephone sleep well little girl  he stepped out on to the pavement the postern door in front of them was opened in response to monsieur jesens vigorous knocking from some invisible place by a string the three of them climbed four flights of rickety stairs they reached at last a stone landing monsieur jesen threw open a door and led the way into an untidylooking salon  monsieur will forgive the fact he begged that i am not better housed if it were not for little susanne here he added patting her upon the shoulder i doubt whether i should keep a roof above my head at all  it is not like this herr freudenberg declared that genius should be treated  indeed mademoiselle susanne intervened it is what i tell him always monsieur they pay him but a beggarly three hundred francs a monthhe who writes all the editorials he who is the spirit of the papers it is not fair i tell dear paul that it is wicked and as he says the money if it were not for me he would squander it in a minute i have even to go with him to the office for there are many who know when paul draws his little cheque  herr freudenberg set down his hat upon the table he looked around at all the evidences of unclean and sordid life then he looked at the man it was a queer housing this for genius his face remained expressionless of the disgust he felt he showed no sign in the building of houses one must use many tools  monsieur jesen he said and mademoisellei speak to you both for i recognize that between you there is indeed a union of sympathy and souls mademoiselle then i address myself to you on certain terms i have offered to purchase for monsieur paul here a twothirds share of the newspaper upon which he works that twothirds share which he and i both know is in the market at this moment i am willing at midday tomorrow or rather today to place within his hands the sum required i am willing to send my notary with him to the office and the affair could be arranged at halfpast twelve from then he practically owns le jour its politics are his to control i make him this offer mademoiselle and it is a greater one than it sounds for the money which i place in his hands to make this purchasefive hundred thousand francsis his completely and absolutely you move at once into apartments befitting your new position monsieur paul jesen is no longer a struggling and illpaid journalist he is the proprietor of an important journal through whose columns he shall help to guide the policy of your nation  monsieur jesen sat down his fingers were clutching one another mademoiselle stared at herr freudenberg her color was coming and going  monsieur i do not understand she cried are you a prince in disguise why do you do this  mademoiselle herr freudenberg replied your question is the question of an intelligent woman why do i do this not for nothing i assure you it is my custom to make bargains indeed but i make them so that those with whom i deal shall never regret the day they met herr freudenberg i offer you this splendid future you and monsieur jesen there on one condition and it is a small one for already the truth has found its way a little into his brain le jour has supported always wholly and entirely the entente between great britain and your country i have tried to point out to paul jesen here what all farseeing people must soon appreciatethat the entente is doomed  the girl glanced at jesen jesen was looking away out of the dusty window  mademoiselle herr freudenberg continued i will not weary you at this hour in the morning with politics i have talked long with monsieur jesen and i think that i have shown him something of the truth you came to the rescue of great britain when she lay friendless and powerless you saved her prestige you saved her without doubt from invasion what have you gained nothing what can you ever gain nothing her army of toy soldiers would be of less use to you than a single corps from across the elbe her fleetyou have no possessions to guard it is for herself only that she maintains it i ask you to think quietly for yourself and ask yourself on whose side is the balance of advantage you can reply to that question in one way and one way only france has been carried away on a wave of enthusiasm a wave of sentimentcall it what you will but france is a farseeing people the moment is ripe i propose to paul jesen that his should be the hand and le jour the vehicle which shall bring the french people to a proper understanding of the political situation  who then are you mademoiselle susanne persisted  herr freudenberg barely hesitated  mademoiselle he said we speak of great things we three in this little chamber of yours i who have often talked of great things before have learned in life one lesson at least and that is when one may trust it is not my desire that many people should know who i am it suits my purpose better to move in paris as a private citizen but to you two let me tell the truth i am prince falkenberg  there was a silence the man looked at him sober enough now in amazement the girls hands were clasped together she was watching the manher man she crept to his side her arm was around his neck  dear paul she whispered think think how sweet life might be there is so much truth in all this i know little of politics but think of the hard times we have lived through think how glorious to have you ride in your automobile to the offices of your newspaper to see you pass into the editors sanctum instead of waiting outside to have me call for you perhaps and take you out to lunchno never at drevels any moreat the café de paris or henrys or paillards or out in the bois and the excursions dear paul think of them the countryhow we both love the country you remember when we first went out together to the little town on the river where no one ever seemed to have come from paris before how sleepy and quiet the long afternoon when we lay in the grass and heard the birds sing and the murmur of the river and we had only a few francs for our dinner and we had to leave the train and walk that last four miles because you had drunk one more bock dear paul think what life might be if one were really rich  the mans eyes flashed  it is true he muttered all my life i have been a straggler  you have done your genius an ill turn my friend herr freudenberg said slowly no man can be at his best who knows care i prince falkenberg i promise you that it is the truth which i have spoken the truth which i shall show you you lose no shadow of honor or selfrespect there will come a day when the millions of readers whom you shall influence will say to themselvespaul jesen he is the man who saw the truth it is he who has saved france you accept  monsieur le prince susanne cried he accepts  jesen rose to his feet he had become a little unsteady again he struck the table with his fist  i accept he declared       book two     chapter i   the flight of lady anne   it was exactly nine fortyfive in the evening about three weeks later when the twotwenty from london steamed into the gare du nord julien from his place among the little crowd wedged in behind the gates gazed with blank amazement at the girl who among the first to leave the train was presenting her ticket to the collector at that moment she recognized him with a purely mechanical effort he raised his hat and held out his hand  lady anne he exclaimed whyi had no idea you were coming to paris he added weakly  she laughedthe same frank goodhumored laugh except that she seemed to lack just a little of her usual selfpossession  neither did i she confessed until this morning  he looked at her blankly she was carrying her own jewelcase he could see no signs of a maid or any party  but tell me he asked where are the rest of your people  she shook her head  nowhere i am quite alone  julien was speechless  you must really forgive me he continued after a moments pause if i seem stupid it is scarcely a month ago since i read of your engagement to harbord the papers all said that you were to be married at once  she nodded  thats exactly it she said thats why i am here  what you mean that you are going to be married here asked julien  i am not going to be married at all she replied cheerfully between ourselves julien she added i found i couldnt go through with it  couldnt go through with it he repeated feebly  lady anne was beginning to recover herself  dont be stupid she begged you used to be quick enough cant you see what has happened i became engaged to the little beast i stood it for three weeks i didnt mind him at the other end of the room but when he began to talk about privileges and attempt to take liberties i found i couldnt bear the creature anywhere near me then all of a sudden i woke up this morning and remembered that we were to be married in a week that was quite enough for me i slipped out after lunch caught the twotwenty train and here i am  exactly julien agreed here you are  with my luggage she continued swinging the jewelcase in her hand and laughing in his face  with your luggage julien echoed seriously is that all that you have brought  every bit she answered you know mother  yes i know your mother he admitted  well i didnt exactly feel like taking her into my confidence lady anne explained smiling under those circumstances i thought it just as well to make my departure as quietly as possible  then they dont know where you are  really she assured him you are becoming quite intelligent they do not  in other words youve run away  marvelous she murmured i suppose its the air over here  a sudden idea swept into juliens mind of course it was ridiculous yet for a moment his heart gave a little jump perhaps she divined his thought for her next words disposed of it effectually  of course i knew that you were in paris but i had no idea that we should meet certainly not like this i have a dear friend to whose apartments i shall go at once she is a milliner  she is a what julien asked blankly  a smile played about lady annes lips  my dear julien she exclaimed you know you never did understand me i repeat that she is a milliner and that she is a dear friend of mine and i am going just as i am to tell her that i have come to spend the night she will have to find me rooms she will have to help me find employment  kendricks who had come by the same train and whom julien was there to meet was hovering in the background julien seeing him could do no more than nod vaguely  lady anne he began  you neednt bother about that she interrupted we were always good friends werent we she added carelessly besides to call me lady anything would be rather ridiculous under the present circumstances  well anne then he said please let me get my bearings i understand that you were engaged to harbordyou werent forced into it i suppose  not at all i tried to run along the usual groove but i came up against something too big for me i dont know how other girls do it i simply found i couldnt samuel harbord is rather by way of being something outrageous you know  of course he is julien agreed with sudden appreciation of the fact  you neednt be so vigorous about it i remember your almost forcing him on to me the day you called to say goodbye  i was talking rubbish julien asserted you see i was in rather an unfortunate position myself that day wasnt i no one likes to feel like a discarded lover i can understand your chucking harbord all right but i cant quite see why it was necessary for you to run away from home to come and stay with a little milliner  she laughed  my dear julien you dont know those harbords there are hordes of them countless hordesmothers and sisters and cousins and aunts theyve besieged the place ever since our engagement was announced if the merest whisper were to get about among them that i was thinking of backing out theres nothing they wouldnt do theyd make the whole place intolerable for mefollow me about in the street weep in my bedroom hang around the place morning noon and night besides mother would be on their side and the whole thing would be impossible  i have no doubt julien admitted that the situation would be a trifle difficult but to talk about earning your own livingyou lady anne  lady fiddlesticks she interrupted what a stupid old thing you are julien you never found out i suppose that at heart i am a bohemian  no i never did he assented vigorously  ah well she remarked you were too busy flirting with that carraby woman to discover all my excellent qualities we mustnt stay here must we are you very busy or do you want to drive me to my friends house of course meeting you here will be the end of me if any one sees us still i dont suppose you object to a little scandal and the more i get the happier i shall be  ill take you anywhere julien promised you dont mind waiting while i speak to the man whom i have come to meet  not at all she replied you are sure he wont object  of course not julien assured her kendricks is an awfully good sort  the two men gripped hands kendricks was carrying his own bag and smoking his accustomed pipe he had apparently been asleep in the carriage and was looking a little more untidy than usual  i got your wire all right julien said and i am thundering glad to see you are you just in search of the ordinary sort of copy or is there anything special doing  something special kendricks answered and youre in it when can we talk no hurry as long as i see you some time tonight  i am entirely at your service julien declared i have been bored to death for the last few weeks and i am only too anxious to have a talk you dont mind if i see this young lady to her friends house first i dont know exactly where it is but it wont take very long she is all alone and as long as we have met i feel that i ought to look after her  naturally kendricks agreed i can go to my hotel and meet you anywhere you say for supper  julien glanced at his watch  it is ten oclock within a minute or two he announced supposing we make it halfpast eleven at the abbaye  kendricks nodded  thatll suit me so long  he strode away in search of a cab julien returned to lady anne and took the jewelcase from her fingers  its all arranged he said you are quite sure that you have no more luggage  she laughed  not a scrap have you ever traveled without luggage julien it makes you feel that you are really in for adventures  does it he replied a little weakly somehow or other he had never associated a love for adventures with lady anne  isnt it fun to be in paris once more she continued i want a real rickety little voiture and i want the man to have a white hat if possible and i want to drive down into paris over those cobbles  any particular address  she handed him a card he called an open victoria and directed the man together they drove out of the station yard lady anne leaned forward looking around her with keen pleasure  julien she cried this is delightful meeting you i hope i shant be a bother to you but really it is rather nice to feel that i have one friend here  you couldnt possibly be a bother to me he declared im rather a waif here myself you know and i am honestly glad to see you  she looked at him quickly and breathed a little sigh of relief  now thats sweet of you she said of course i dont see why you shouldnt be we were always good friends werent we and it makes me feel so much more comfortable to remember that we never went in for the other sort of thing  there was just one moment he murmured ruminatingly  she turned her head  stop at once she begged that moment passed as you know if it hadnt things might have been different if it hadnt i should feel differently about being with you now we are forgetting that moment if you please julien do theres a good fellow if you wanted to be goodnatured you could be so nice to me until i get used to being alone  forgotten it shall be by all means he promised cheerfully do you know that the address you gave me is only a few yards away  oh bother she exclaimed i knew that it was somewhere up by the gare du nord  they turned off from the rue lafayette and pulled up opposite a milliners shop  mademoiselle rignaut lives up above lady anne said alighting its sweet of you to have brought me julien  i am going to wait and see that you are all right he replied ringing the bell  there was a short delay then the door was opened a young woman peered out  who is it she asked quickly  a little of lady annes confidence for the moment had almost deserted her the girls face was invisible and the interior of the passage looked cheerless nevertheless she answered briskly  dont you remember me mademoiselle janette i am lady annelady anne clonarty you know  there was a wondering scream an exclamation of delight and julien stood on the pavement for fully five minutes then lady anne reappeared followed by her friend  sir julien she said this is mademoiselle rignaut i am awfully lucky mademoiselle rignaut has a room she can let me have and we are going to raid her shop and get everything i want she has costumes as well as hats  julien shook hands with the little frenchwoman who had not yet recovered from her amazement  but this is wonderful monsieur is it not she cried to see dear lady anne like this such a surprise such a delight but miladi she added suddenly you must be hungrystarving  i am lady anne admitted frankly  the little womans face fell  but only this afternoon she explained my servant was taken away to the hospital what can we  what you will both do julien interrupted is to come and have supper with me  do you really mean it lady anne asked doubtfully what about your friend  he wont mind julien assured her you shall take your first step into bohemia my dear anne we had arranged to sup in the montmartre you and mademoiselle rignaut must come i can give you half an hour to get readymore if you want it  what larks lady anne exclaimed can i come in a traveling dress  you can come just as you are julien replied one visits these places just as one feels disposed ill be off and get a taximeter automobile instead of this thing and come back for you whenever you say  you are a brick lady anne declared i shall love to go  monsieur is too kind mademoiselle rignaut agreed but as for me it is not fitting  rubbish lady anne interrupted briskly youve got to get all that sort of stuff out of your head janette and to start with you must come to supper with us bless you i couldnt go alone with sir julien i was engaged to be married to him three months ago  mademoiselle shook her head feebly  but indeed miladi anne she protested you are a strange people you english i do not understand  lady anne took her by the arm and turned towards the open door  dont bother about that well be ready in half an hour julien  julien returned to the gare du nord and treated himself to a whiskey and soda he was surprised at the pleasurable sense of excitement which this meeting had given him during the last few weeks in paris he had found little to interest or amuse him he had been in fact very distinctly bored the newspapers and illustrated journals although they were always full of interest to him had day by day brought their own particular sting although his affection for lady anne had been of a distinctly modified character yet he had found it curiously unpleasant to read everywhere of her engagement of her plans for the future and to look at the photographs of her and her intended bridegroom which seemed to stare at him from every page somehow or other although he told himself that personally it was of no consequence to him he yet found the present situation of affairs far more to his liking  he lounged about the gare du nord smoking a cigarette and thinking over what she had told him there was a good deal in the present situation to appeal to his sense of humor he thought of the duke and the duchess when they discovered the flight of their daughtertheir efforts to keep all details from the papers of harbord and his horde of relationsharbord who had neither the dignity nor the breeding to accept such a reverse in silence he could imagine the gossip at the clubs and among their friends he himself was immensely surprised he had considered himself something of a judge of character and yet he had looked upon lady anne as a goodnatured young person brimful of common sense without an ounce of sentimenta perfectly wellordered piece of the machinery of her sex the whole affair was astonishing perhaps to him the most astonishing part was that he found himself continually looking at the clock counting almost the minutes until it was possible for him to start on this little expedition     chapter ii   to our new selves   julien found a taximeter automobile and punctually at the time appointed drove to the little milliners shop in the rue st antoine lady anne and her companion were waiting for him and they drove off together in high good humor the manager at the abbaye bowed before them with special deference he recognized julien as an occasional customer and lady anne even in her traveling gown was a person to inspire attention  they chose a table and ordered supper for four kendricks had not yet arrived but it was barely halfpast eleven and the place was almost empty lady anne was in high spirits and chattering all the time julien looked at her occasionally in amazement they had seldom been alone together in london but on those few occasions when the conventions had demanded it he had been inclined to find her rather stupid she was certainly nothing of the sort this evening  i suppose i am a baby she exclaimed laughing but tonight i feel as though i were beginning a new life tell me mademoiselle have you a place for me as a seamstress or will you have me for a model my figure is good enough isnt it  miladi mademoiselle rignaut declared deprecatingly there is no girl in my shop with a figure like yours but it is not well for you to talk so indeed it is shocking  lady anne laughed gayly  now my little friend she said let us understand one another there is no more miladi i am anneanne to you and anne to julien here ive finished with the miladi affair i dare say i shouldnt care about being a model but all the same i am going to earn my own living  earn your own living mademoiselle rignaut echoed in something like horror  she had met the duke and the duchessshe had traveled even to london and had passed the night beneath the ducal roof lady annes mother had very sound ideas of economy and mademoiselle rignaut was cheap and yet undoubtedly french  earn my own living without a doubt lady anne repeated helping herself to a roll you dont mind my eating some bread and butter do you julien i couldnt lunchi was much too excited and the tea on the train was filthy why of course i am going to earn my own living she continued ive only got a few thousand francs with me and some jewelry i believe i have got a small income but heaven knows whether they will let me have it  juliens eyes were suddenly lit with humor  why the duke will be here for you tomorrow he exclaimed to take you back  she leaned back in her seat with an air of deliberation  im free she insisted im twentysix years old thank heaven twentysix years ive had of itenough to crush any one no more you know i like this sense of freedom she went on its perfectly amazing how young i feel julien do you remember when mother wouldnt let us lunch together at the ritz without a chaperon  i do he assented im sure we didnt need one either  she smiled reminiscently  what sticks we were what a silly life i really have the most delightful feeling as though i were starting things all over again as though there were all sorts of wonderful adventures before me  julien looked at her quickly there was no woman in the place half so goodlooking or with any pretensions to such style he was conscious of an odd twinge of jealousy  youll have no trouble in finding adventures he remarked a little grimly  her eyes flashed back an answer to his thought  bless you i dont want anything to do with men fancy having been engaged to you and to samuel harbord what further thrills could possibly be in store for me  well i dont know julien retorted i suppose if i was a stick there must have been something about you which induced me to be one  not a bit of it she objected you were a solemn studious gentlemanly wellbehaved wellconducted prigvery much a male edition of what i was myself what a life we should have lived together heres your friend you know i rather like the look of him hes so delightfully untidy i should think he belongs round about the new world doesnt he  hes a working journalist julien answered a very clever fellow and a good friend of mine  then i shall adore him lady anne decidednot because he is a good friend of yours but because he is a working journalist why i saw him sitting waiting for you the day you came and wished me that touching goodbye she added i liked him even then it seemed so sweet of him to come and help you through that terrible ordeal  she held out her hand to kendricks very charmingly when he was presented  dont be terrified at finding us here please she begged i know you have some business to talk over with julien but you see we were starving and julien had to be polite to me because we were once engaged to be married i promise you that when we have eaten we will go home  kendricks looked at her for a moment and smiled  you know he said i believe youve run away  she laughed  i felt sure that i was going to like your friend julien she exclaimed he understands things so quickly  i am a newspaper man you see he told her just as i left i was reading all sorts of things about your wedding and the presents and the rest of it i saw you in the train and recognized you  dont think ive come over after julien she continued cheerfully i never dreamed of seeing himnot just yet at any rate i had no idea where to run to but paris seemed to me so easy and so natural and somehow or other it must be more difficult to worry any one into going back from a foreign country not that ive any idea of going back she broke off i think im going to enjoy life hugely out here  but it is most astonishing mademoiselle rignaut declared with a gasp  my little friend here lady anne went on hasnt got over it all yet she doesnt understand the sheer barbarity of being a dukes daughter the worst of it is shell never have an opportunity of trying it for herself heaven save the others julien i hope we are going to have some champagne mother never liked me to drink champagne at a restaurant you see she explained we werent rich enough to be in really the smart set or else i should have been allowed to do any mortal thing and if you arent in the very smart set it is best to turn up your nose at them and to ape propriety thats what we did it suited father because it was cheap and mother because she said it went with my style  champagne by all means julien agreed i ordered it some time ago and here comes the lobster  julien tell him to give me some wine lady anne begged i am thirsty  julien gave the order to the sommelier she raised the glass to her lips and looked at him  to our new selves she exclaimed laughing and to the broken bonds  julien raised his glass at once  to our new selves he echoed     chapter iii   work for julien   the new anne had not forgotten her natural stubbornness at halfpast twelve she rose from the supper table and declined absolutely to allow julien to escort her home  my dear julien she declared the thing is ridiculous we have finished with all that i am a bohemian i expect to walk about these streets when and where and at what hour i choose you have business with mr kendricks and i am glad of it you certainly shall not waste your time gallivanting around with me janette and i together could defy any sort of danger  but my dear anne julien protested you cannot make these changes so suddenly to drive you home would take at the most half an hour  i shall enjoy the drive immensely lady anne answered coolly but we shall take it alone dont be foolish julien come and find us a little carriage and say good night nicely  he was forced to obey he found a carriage and helped her in she even stopped him when he would have paid for it  for the present she said i prefer to arrange these matters for myself thanks ever so much for the supper she added and come and see me in a day or two wont you  she gave him her hand and smiled her farewells at him the lamplight flashed upon her as she leaned forward to say goodbye and julien for the first time realized that her hair was a beautiful shade of brown and that there was a quiet but very effective beauty about her face which he had never appreciated she waved her hand and laughed at him in frank goodfellowship which he somehow felt vaguely annoying the carriage rolled away and he went back to kendricks  my friend the latter exclaimed pay your bill and let us depart i am in no humor for the cafés tonight let us go to your rooms and sit quietly or drivewhichever you choose  you have news julien remarked  i have news and a proposition for you kendricks replied i am not sure that we do ourselves much good by being seen about paris together just now i am not sure even whether it is safe  julien stared at him  you are making fun of me  not i kendricks assured him we are both being drawn into a queer little cycle of events events which perhaps we may influence when we get back to your rooms i will tell you about it until then not a word  they drove down the hill talking of lady anne  somehow kendricks remarked she doesnt fit in in the least with your description of her i imagined a cold rather stupid young woman of very moderate intelligence and certainly no sense of humor do you know that your lady anne is really a very charming person  she puzzles me a little julien confessed something has changed her  kendricks nodded  whatever has done it has done a good thing she gave you your congé quite calmly didnt she  absolutely julien admitted she brushed me away as though i had been a misbehaving fly  after all kendricks said you were of the same kidneya prig of the first water you know julien i am never tired of telling you so am i never mind its good for you have you seen herr freudenberg this week  julien shook his head  not since we were all at the rat mort together nearly a month ago did i tell you that he made me an offer then  no you told me nothing about it kendricks replied leaning forward with interest what sort of an offer go on tell me about it  he wanted me julien continued to undertake the command of an expedition to some place which he did not specify to discover whether a german who was living there was being held a prisoner  oh là là kendricks interrupted tell me what your reply was  i told him that i must consult you first as a matter of fact i never thought seriously about it at all the whole affair seemed to me so vague and it didnt attract me in the least i dont know whether you can understand what i mean but to me it appeared to be an entirely artificial suggestion if such a thing had been reasonable at all i should have said that it was an offer invented on the spur of the moment by herr freudenberg to get me out of paris  really julien declared kendricks i am beginning to have hopes of you there are times when you are almost bright  what are you here for julien asked is there anything wrong in london  anything wrong kendricks growled you and your foolish letters julien you left the way open for that little bounder carraby and hell do for us lord how they love him in berlin  they are not exactly appreciating him over here are they julien remarked i dont understand the tone of the press at all theres something at the back of it all  there is kendricks agreed grimly sit tight wait till we are in your rooms ill tell you some news  we are there now julien replied as the little carriage pulled up follow me kendricks and take care of the stairs i hope you like the smell of new bread you see the ground floor is occupied by a confectioners shop it keeps me hungry half the time  delicious kendricks murmured are these your rooms  julien nodded and turned on the electric light  not palatial as you see but comfortable and i flatter myself typically french dont you love the red plush and the gilt mirror of course one doesnt sit upon the chairs or look into the mirror but they at least remind you of the country youre in  kendricks threw open the window the hum of the city came floating into the room they drew up easychairs  whiskey and soda at your side julien pointed out you can smoke your filthy pipe to your hearts content i wont even insult you by offering you a cigar now go ahead  kendricks lit his pipe and smoked solemnly  your remarks he declared are actuated by jealousy you havent the stomach for a mans smoke now listen theres the very devil of a mischief abroad and falkenbergs at the bottom of it do you know what hes doing  i know nothing  you remember the night that we were up at the rat mort he was talking with a dirtylooking man in a red tie and pincenez  i remember it quite well julien admitted  well he was the leader writer in le jourjesena brilliant man an absolutely wonderful writer but shiftless do you know what falkenberg has done the paper was in the market the controlling share of it and he bought it or rather he put the money into jesens hands to buy it with the whole tone of the paper with regard to foreign affairs has turned completely round every other day there is a scathing article in it attacking the entente with england youve read them of course  so has every one julien replied gravely the people here talk of little else  it is known kendricks continued that falkenberg has made every use of his frequent visits to this city to ingratiate himself with certain members of the french cabinet and to impress them with his views to some extent there is no doubt that he has succeeded the german pressthe inspired portion of it at any rateis backing all this up by articles extremely friendly towards france and deriding her friendship with england  this too i have noticed julien admitted  carraby is in hot water already kendricks went on he had a chance on monday in the house when he was asked a question about the german gunboat which is reported to have gone to agdar the fool muddled it he gave the sort of suave methodist reply one expected and the german press jeered at him openly julien its serious the french people are honest enough but they are impressionable a liberal government was never popular with them you were the only liberal foreign minister in whom they believed this man carraby they despise besides he has jewish blood in his veins and you know what that means over here jesens articles come thundering out and already other papers are beginning to follow suit the poison has been at work for months you remember monsieur and madame and mademoiselle with whom i talked so earnestly well they were but types i talked to them because i wanted to find out their point of view there are many others like them they look upon the entente with goodnatured tolerance they doubt the real ability of britain to afford practical aid to france should she be attacked this goodnatured tolerance is being changed into irritation falkenbergs efforts are ceaseless the moment he has the two countries really estranged he will strike  against which julien asked quickly  heaven only knows kendricks answered for my part i have always believed that it would be against england there is no strategic reason for a war between france and germany germany needs more than france can give her she does not need money she needs territory falkenberg is a rabid imperialist a dreamer of splendid dreams a real genius he is fighting today with the subtlest weapons the mind of man ever conceived now julien listen i am here with a direct proposition to you  but what can i do julien exclaimed  this kendricks replied it is my idea i saw lord southwold this morning and he agreed we want you to write for our paper a series of articles dated from paris and signed in your own name and we want you to attack falkenberg and the game he is playing we will arrange for them to appear simultaneously in one of the leading journals here we want you to write openly of these german spies who infest paris we want you first to hint and then to speak openly of the purchase of le jour by means of german gold we want you to combat the popular opinion here that our army is a wooden box affair and that we as a nation are too crassly selfish to risk our fleet for the benefit of france we want you to strike a great note and tell the truth julien those articles signed by you and dated from paris may do a magnificent work  juliens eyes were already agleam  splendid he muttered rising to his feet if only i can do it  of course you can do it kendricks insisted firmly before you spoke so often you used to write for the nineteenth century every month you havent forgotten the trick some of your sentences i remember even now i tell you julien they helped me to appreciate you i liked you better when you took up the pen sometimes than i liked you in those perfect clothes and perfect manner in your office at downing street your tongue had the politicians trick of gliding over the surface of things your pen scratched and spluttered its way into the heart of affairs get back to it julien i want your first article before i leave paris tonight  ill do my best julien promised its a great scheme im going to commence now  i hoped you would kendricks replied youve got the atmosphere here youre sitting in the heart of the france that belongs to the french it isnt for nothing that ive taken you round a little with me since we were here chance was kind too when it brought us up against freudenberg remember julien journalism isnt the gentlemanly art it was ten or twenty years ago you can take up your pen and stab thats what we want  its fine julien declared it is war  kendricks rose to his feet  im going to bed he announced the last month has been exciting and theres plenty more to come i need sleep julien just a word of caution  fire away julien sighed he was already gazing steadfastly out of the window already the sentences were framing themselves in his mind  the day upon which your first article appears kendricks said freudenberg will strike your life here will never be wholly safe you will be encompassed with spies and enemies why this wildcat scheme of his of sending you off on some expedition was solely because you are the one man of whom he is afraid he feared lest carraby might make some hideous blunder in a crisis and that the country might demand you back that is why he wanted you out of the way  you may be right julien admitted whats that strikingone oclock till tonight david  kendricks nodded and left the room julien sat for a moment before the open window it was rather an impressive view of the city with its millions of lights the fine buildings of the place de la concorde in clear relief against the deep sky the eiffel tower glittering in the distance the subtle perfume of pleasure in the air julien stood there and raised his eyes to the skies already his brain was moving to the grim music of his thoughts he looked away from the city to the fertile country some faint memory of those once blackened fields and desolate villages stole into his mind he turned to his desk drew the paper towards him and wrote     chapter iv   a startling disclosure   julien was driving a few afternoons later with madame christophor she had picked him up in the bois where he had gone for a solitary walk in her luxurious automobile they passed smoothly beyond the confines of the park and out into the country after her brief summons and the few words of invitation they relapsed into a somewhat curious silence  my friend madame christophor remarked at length glancing thoughtfully towards him i find a change in you you are pale and tired and silent it is your duty to amuse me but you make no effort to do so yet you have lost that look of complete dejection you have indeed the appearance of a man who has accomplished something who has found a new purpose in life  julien to some extent recovered himself  dear madame christophor he exclaimed it is true my manners are shocking yet in a way i have an excuse i have been hard at work for the last few days i was writing all night until quite late this morning it was because i could not sleep that i came out to sit under the treeswhere you found me in fact  writing she repeated so you are changing your weapons are you you are going to make a new bid for power  julien shook his head  it is not that he answered i have no personal ambitions connected with my present work it was an ideaa great ideabut it was not my own yet the work has been an immense relief  she looked away relapsing once more into silence he glanced towards her the weariness of her expression was more than ever evident today the weariness that was not fretful that seemed indeed to give an added sweetness to her face yet its pathos was always there her eyes which looked steadily down the road in front of them were full of the fatigue of unwelcome days  you men so easily escape she murmured we women never  julien was conscious of a certain selfishness in all his thoughts connected with his companion he had been so ready always to accept her society to accept and profit by the stimulus of her intellect yet he himself had given so little had shown so little interest in her or her personal affairs he sat a trifle more upright in his place  dear madame christophor he said earnestly you have been so kind to me you have shown so much interest always in my doings and my troubles why not tell me something of your own life i have felt so much the benefit of your sympathy is there nothing in the world i could do for you  she sighed  no person in the world she declared could help me certainly not one of your sex i start with an instinctive and unchanging hatred towards every one of them  but madame julien protested is that reasonable  it is the truth she replied i do my best when we are together to forget it so far as you are concerned i succeed because you do not use with me any of the miserable devices of your sex to provoke an interest whether they really desire it or not you treat me sir julien as it pleases me to be treated it is for that reason i am sureit must be for that reasonthat i find some pleasure in being with you whereas the society of any other man is a constant irritation to me  julien hesitated  you know he began i am not naturally a curious person i have never asked a question of you or about you from the few people with whom i have come in contact over here at the same time  do you mean she interrupted do you seriously mean that you are ignorant as to who i really am as to any part of my history  entirely julien assured her  she was thoughtful for several moments  well that is strange she declared you are upsetting one of my pet theories all the men whom i have ever known have been more curious than women are you interested in me by any chance sir julien  immensely he replied  i am glad to hear it do you know that is a great concession for me to make but it is the truth i like you to be interested in me yet i must confess that your ignorance as to who i really am astonishes me perhaps she added gravely if you knew you would not be sitting by my side at the present moment  i cannot believe he said smiling that you are such a very terrible person  terrible perhaps that is not the word she admitted  there is one thing he went on concerning which i have always been curious  and that  the little manicure girl whom i met in the soho restaurant he replied promptly what on earth was her reason for wishing me to come and see you why did you want me to come  i thought she murmured that we had agreed not to speak of those matters for the present  that was some time ago things are changing around us every day it is possible that within a very short time i may find myself in such a position here that i am forced to know exactly who are my friends and who my enemies  can you believe she asked that you would ever find me among the latter  julien thought for several moments  i shall not ask you he proceeded not to be offended with me for what i am going to say it was a chance remark i heardno more it certainly however did suggest some association there is a man who comes often to paris who calls himself a maker of toys he says that he comes from leipzig and that his name is herr freudenberg  she sat as still as a statue not a line of her features was changed julien turned a little in his seat as he watched he saw that her bosom underneath the lace scarf which she wore was rising and falling quickly her teeth came suddenly together he saw the lids droop over her eyes as though she were in pain  herr freudenberg she repeated what of him  i knew him in the days when i counted for something in the world julien explained dont you remember that on the night when we dined together at the maison léon dor he sent one of his emissaries for me he was a man in whom i had always felt the greatest the most complete interest i went to him gladly since then as you will know if you read the papers events have moved rapidly i am beginning to realize now how completely and absolutely that man is the enemy of my country  it is true that she murmured  for some reason julien continued he seemed anxious to remove me from paris he made me a somewhat singular offer he wanted me to go to some distant country on a missionnot political and yet for germany  and do you go  no he replied i have found other work i dont think that i seriously considered it at any time yet i have always been curious as to why he should have made such an offer to me  she had the air now of a woman who had completely recovered control of herself  sir julien she asked i beg of you to tell me this if you do not know who i am why have you mentioned herr freudenbergs name to me  madame julien answered because the man who brought me the message from herr freudenberg the man who conducted me to him the man concerning whom you told me that strange pathetic little storyhe let fall one word i asked him no question i wished for no information except from you yet i am only human i have had impulses of curiosity  herr freudenberg is my husband madame christophor declared  julien looked at her in amazement for the moment he was speechless  i say what is perhaps literally but not actually true she went on he was my husband we are separated we are not divorced because we were married as roman catholics we are separated there will never be anything else between us  julien remained silent it was so hard to say anything the womans tone told him that around her speech hovered a tragedy  now you know that herr freudenberg is my husband she asked are you not a little afraid to be sitting here by my side  why should i be  dont you know she continued that he is your enemy  julien looked grave  no i have scarcely realized that he answered i think perhaps when he reads yesterdays papers he may be feeling like that at present so far as he knows what have i done  you she said were the only man who ever stood up to him who ever dealt a blow at his political supremacy at the conference of berlin you triumphed german papers politely and in a very veiled manner reminded him of his defeat it was not a great matter it is true but none the less the conference of berlin was the first diplomatic failure in which he had ever been concerned and you were responsible for it  you think then julien remarked that he still harbors a grudge against me for that  without a doubt now tell me what you mean when you speak of yesterdays papers  i am writing a series of articles julien told her they commenced yesterday they will appear in a french paperle grand journaland in the english post they are written with the sole idea of attacking herr freudenberg when he reads the first he will understandhe will be my enemy  she held out her hand  then say goodbye to me now my friend she murmured for you will die  julien laughed scornfully  we do not live in those days he reminded her we fight with the pen with diplomacy with all the weapons of statecraft and intrigue if you will but this is not now the paris of dumas one does not assassinate  my friend she said earnestly you do not know herr freudenberg if indeed you have become during these last few days his enemy by this time next week you will surely have passed into some other sphere of activity there are no methods too primitive for him no methods too subtle or too cruel he can be the most charming the most winning the most generous the most romantic person who ever breathed or he can be a nero a cruel and brutal butcher a murderer either of reputations or bodieshe cares little which  presently julien declared i shall begin to feel uncomfortable  oh you have courage of course she admitted with a scornful little shrug of the shoulders no one has ever denied that to your race but you have also the unconquerable stupidity which makes heroes and victims of your soldiers  julien smiled  well i am at least warned and for that i thank you now let me ask you another question you have told me this very strange thing about yourself and herr freudenberg you have told me of your feelings concerning him yet you have not really told me exactly on what terms you are with him at present forgive me if i find this important  i do not receive him she replied i have no interest in his comings or his goings i have a solemn promise a promise to which he has subscribed upon his honor that he shall not seek to cross the threshold of my house he sent me an ambassador once quite lately to make me a certain proposition connected with you  with me julien repeated  she nodded  he has great faith in my powers she went on looking him full in the face also apparently some belief in your susceptibility is that unkind of me never mind it is the truth he imagined perhaps that i might help him to rid paris of your presence there was just one thing he could offer me which i desired he came to offer it  you refused julien exclaimed  her eyes rested upon his her expression was faintly provocative  how could i accept an offer she asked to deal with a thing which did not belong to me you have shown no signs at present sir julien of becoming my abject slave  the car rushed through a straggling village all the time she was watching him then she threw herself back among the cushions with a little laugh  a week or so ago she murmured i had a fancy that if i had triedwell that perhaps you were not so different from other men i should have loathed my conquest i should probably have loathed you but i think that i should have expected it at the present moment she went on glancing into a little gold mirror which she had picked up from a heap of trifles lying on the table before her at the present moment i am disillusioned my vanity is wounded though my relief is great nevertheless sir julien tell me what has happened to you during the last few days  work julien replied the sort of work i was craving for  not only that she insisted setting down the mirror with a sigh there is something else  if there is julien assured her i am not yet conscious of it  they had emerged from the country lane along which they had been traveling and were returning now to paris along the broad highroad they were going at a fair speed when suddenly a huge racing car came flashing by them covered with dust and with all the indications of having come a great distance madame christophor leaned forward in her seat and clutched her companions arm her eyes were fixed upon the figure of the man leaning back by the side of the driver  you see she muttered  herr freudenberg julien gasped  she nodded already the car had vanished in a cloud of dust  he is just from germany or from the frontier he very seldom comes all the way by rail the car is always waiting  i shall see him then tonight julien declared already without a doubt he knows already he is my enemy what about you madame christophor  my friend she promised you will have nothing to fear from me so long as i can forget your sex i rather like you  are you going to answer my question about the little girl who sent me to you he asked  i will tell you if you like she said mademoiselle senn was once in my service she occasionally executes commissions for me in london she knows everybody it was in obedience to my wishes that she gave you that message  but why julien demanded what interest had you in me  none she answered a little coldlyno personal interest i sent that message because i discovered that the individual who has just passed us in the automobile was framing certain schemes in connection with you if you should come to paris politically as well as personally he and i are enemies he hates america and the whole anglosaxon race it has amused me more than once to thwart his schemes i intended to set you upon your guard you see it is very simple mademoiselle senn wrote me at first that she did not know you and that she feared you were inaccessible then she wired me of an accidental meeting and that she had delivered my message the whole affair is simpler than it seemed is it not so now listen i have satisfied your curiosity you now shall answer a question who is miss clonarty  julien gazed at her in astonishment  miss clonarty he repeated  madame christophor nodded  the name seems to surprise you a young english woman called on me today in answer to my advertisement for a secretary who could write and speak english she said that her name was miss anne clonarty and she referred me to you  if she is the lady whom i suppose she is julien replied you will be perfectly safe in engaging her  madame christophor looked at him from underneath the lids of her eyes  do you think that i do not know she asked with a shade of contempt in her tonethat i do not sometimes read the papers do you think that i have not seen that lady anne clonarty the girl whom you were engaged to marry disappeared from her home the other day on the eve of her marriage to another man it is this girl who comes to me for my situation is it not so  julien was silent  i knew nothing of her coming i did not even know that you wanted a secretary  i wonder why she came to paris madame christophor remarked is she in love with you  there was never any question of anything of the sort julien declared fervently  you have seen her since she arrived in paris  entirely by accident i saw her alight from the train i was at the gare du nord to meet kendricks  madame christophor leaned back in her seat  is it your wish that i engage her  certainly julien replied i am sure that you will find her competent at the same time i dont know how long she will keep this thing up  as a rule i do not care for handsome women around me madame christophor said composedly lady anne is much too goodlooking to please me she has all the freshness and vitality she added dropping her voice a little which seem to have left me forever  you have experience julien reminded her experience in itself is wonderful even though one has to pay for it  they were in the streets of paris now madame christophor shrugged her shoulders and sat up  it is one of the misfortunes of my sex she said a little bitterly that without experience we lack charmin the eyes of you men that is to say it is your own folly are you coming home with me my friend or shall i set you down somewhere  as near the gare du nord as possible if you please julien begged i have wearied you enough for one afternoon  madame christophor looked at him thoughtfully there was a slight frown upon her forehead  somewhere near the gare du nord she repeated     chapter v   the first article   julien found lady anne in a small stuffy apartment on the third floor of the house in the rue st antoine before her was a sewingmachine and the floor of the room was littered with oddments of black calico she herself was seated apparently deep in thought before an untrimmed hat  what on earth my dear anne he exclaimed are you doing  she merely glanced up at his entrance her eyes were still far away  dont interrupt she begged i am seeking for an inspiration in my younger days i used to trim hats i dont suppose anything i could do would be of any use here but one must try everything  but i thought he protested that you were going to be a ladys secretary or something of that sort  i have applied for a situation she admitted i am not engaged yet by the bye i gave your name as a reference i wonder if there is any chance for me  as a matter of fact he told her i have just left the lady whose advertisement you answered  madame christophor  madame christophor if you are really anxious for that post i can assure you that it is yours  she flung the hat to the other end of the room  good she exclaimed i dont think this sort of thing is in my line at all tell me is madame christophor half as charming as she looks  i have known her only a short time julien replied but she is certainly a very wonderful woman  what does she do lady anne asked to require a secretary  she is a woman of immense wealth i believe julien answered and she has many charities she is married but separated from her husband i think on the whole that she must have led a rather unhappy life  i think it is very extraordinary lady anne remarked that she should be willing to take a secretary who knows nothing of typewriting or shorthand i told her how ignorant i was but she didnt seem to mind much  julien sat down by the side of the sewingmachine  anne he began do you really think youre going to care for this sort of thing  what sort of thing she demanded  why life on your own you have been so independent always and a person of consequence you know what it means to be a servant  not yet lady anne admitted i think though that it is quite time i did i am rather looking forward to it  julien was a little staggered she looked over at him and laughed scornfully  after all she said i am not sure julien whether you are a person of much understanding you proposed to me because i happened to be the sort of girl you were looking for my connections were excellent and my appearance i suppose satisfactory you never thought of me myself me as an independent person in all your life do you believe that i am simply lady anne clonarty a reasonable puppet a walking doll to receive some ones guests and further his social ambitions dont you think that i have the slightest idea of being a woman of my own whats wrong with me i wonder julien that you should take me for something automatic  you acted the part he reminded her  with you yes she replied scornfully i should like to know how much you encouraged me to be anything different a sawdust man i used to think you oh we matched all right i am not denying that i was what i had to be i sometimes wonder if misfortune will not do you good  misfortune is lending you a tongue at any rate he retorted  as yet she objected i know nothing of misfortune the impulse which led me to chuck things was just the most wonderful thing that ever came to me in life i awoke this morning feeling like a freed woman i sang while i got up it seemed to me that i had never seen anything so beautiful as the view of paris from my poky window and i got up without a maid too julien i had no perfectly equipped bathroom to wander into not much luxury about these rooms of janettes  he glanced at her admiringly  you certainly look as though the life agreed with you he answered put on your hat and come out to dinner  she rose to her feet at once  i have been praying for that she confessed you know julien i should starve badly the one thing i cant get rid of is my appetite you dont expect me to make a toilette because i cant  nothing of the sort he assured her come as you are  she kept him waiting barely five minutes she was still wearing her smart traveling suit and the little toque which she had worn when she left home she walked down the street with him humming gayly  have you read the english papers this morning julien she asked  not thoroughly he admitted  columns about me she declared blithely the general idea is that i am suffering from a lapse of memory they have found traces of me in every part of england not a word about paris thank goodness  but do you mean to say that no one has an idea of where you are wont your mother be anxious  not a bit of it lady anne laughed i left a note for her just to say that she wasnt to worry she knows ill take care of myself all right julien dont you love these streets and their crowds of people every one looks as though they were on a holiday  so they are julien replied life is only a holiday over here in england we go about with our eyes fixed upon the deadliest thing in life we can imagine over here depression is a crime they call into their minds the most joyous thing they can think of it becomes a habit they think only of the pleasantness of life they keep their troubles buried underneath  it is the way to live she murmured  this at any rate he answered leading the way into henrys is the place at which to dine just fancy we were engaged for three months and not once did i dine with you alone now we are not engaged and we think nothing of it  less than nothing she agreed except that i am frightfully hungry  they found a comfortable table julien took up the menu and wrote out the dinner carefully  in this country he said leaning back we are spared the barbarity of table dhôte dinners therefore we must wait but what does it matter there is always something to talk about  i am glad to hear that you feel like that julien i remember sometimes when we were alone together in england we seemed to find it a trifle difficult  since then he replied we have both burst the bondsi of necessity you of choice  i dont believe she declared helping herself to hors doeuvres that we are either of us going to be sorry for it  one can never tell so far as you are concerned i havent got over the wonder of it yet you never showed me so much of the woman throughout our engagement as you have shown me during the last few days  my dear julien she protested you didnt know where to look for it why does this funny little man with the muttonchop whiskers hover around our table all the time  he is distressed julien explained to see you eating so much bread and butter he fears that you will not have an appetite for the very excellent dinner which i have ordered  he is right she decided never mind i will leave the rolls alone i am still i can assure you ravenous  she leaned back and looking out into the room began to laugh people who passed never failed to notice her she was certainly a strikinglooking girl and she had above all the air  julien she cried this is really too amusing did you see who went by just then it was lord athlingtonmy venerable unclewith the lady with the yellow hair he saw you here with mesaw us sitting together alone having dinnerme unchaperoned a runaway isnt it delicious  julien looked after his companions elderly relative with a smile  i wonder he remarked whether your uncles magnificent unconsciousness is due to defective eyesight or nerve  nerve without a doubt she insisted we all have it besides dont you see hes changed their table so as to be out of sight i wonder what he really thinks of me if wed belonged even to the really smart set in town it wouldnt have been half so funny they do so many things that seem wrong that people forget to be shocked  i can conceive he murmured that your mothers ambitions would scarcely lead her in that direction  lady anne shrugged her shoulders  i dont think she could get in if she tried the really disreputable people in society are so exclusive i wonder julien if i shall be allowed to come out and dine with you when i am madame christophors secretary  once a week perhaps he suggestedscarcely oftener i am afraid  ah well she declared i shall like work i am convinced julien you are spoiling me i am sure this is a cuisine de luxe i told you to take me to a cheap restaurant  we will try them all in time he answered i had to start by taking you to my favorite place  you really mean then she asked that you are going on being nice to me of course i havent the slightest claim on you i suppose as a matter of fact i treated you rather badly didnt i  not a bit of it he assured her i was a failure that was all but of course i am going on being nice to you there arent too many people over here whom one cares to be with there arent very many just now he continued who care to be with me  idiotic she replied tell me about this work of yours  he explained kendricks idea her eyes glistened  its really splendid she declared how i should love to have seen your first article  you shall read it afterwards he told her i have a copy of le grand journal in my overcoat pocket  she beckoned to the vestiaire  i will not wait a moment she insisted i shall read it while dinner is being served its a glorious idea this to fight your way back with your pen there are those nowadays who tell us you know julien that there is more to be done through the press than in parliament your spoken words can influence only a small number of people what you write the world reads  she explained what she desired to the vestiaire he reappeared a minute or two later with the newspaper she spread it out before her julien read it over her shoulder he himself had seen it before but his own eyes were the brighter as he reread it when she had finished she said very little they ate the first course of their dinner almost in silence then she laid her hand suddenly upon his  julien dear she said i have done you a wrong i am sorry  a wrong he repeated  she looked at him almost humbly there was something new in her eyes something new in her expression  i am afraid she continued that i never looked upon you as anything more than the ordinary stereotyped politician a skilful debater of course and with the chessboard brains of diplomacy thisshe touched the newspaper with her forefingerthis is something very different  do you like it then  like it she repeated scornfully cant you feel yourself how different it is from those precise cynical little speeches of yours it is as though a smouldering bonfire had leapt suddenly into flame there is genius in every line go on writing like that julien and you will soon be more powerful than ever you were in the house of commons  he laughed it was absurd to admit it but nothing had pleased him so much since the coming of his misfortune she was thoughtful for some time every now and then glancing back at the newspaper over their coffee she broke into a little reminiscent laugh  did i tell you about mrs carraby she asked mother and i met her at wumbledon house two or three days after her husbands appointment had been confirmed i can see her now coming towards us there were so many people around that she had to risk everything oh it was a great moment for mother she never troubled even to raise her lorgnettes she never attempted any of that glaringthroughyou sort of business she just looked up at mrs carrabys hand and looked up at her eyes and walked by without changing a muscle of course i did the samevery nearly as well too i believe cat  julien frowned slightly  you can imagine he said that i am not very keen about discussing mrs carraby yet after all her husband and his career were i suppose the most important things in life to her  then shes going to have a pretty rocky time lady anne decided i dont understand much about politics but i know its no use putting a tradesman into the foreign office hes wobbly already and as for mrs carrabywell i dont know if she ever went on with you like it julien but you remember bob sutherlandthe one in the guards i meanwell shes going an awful pace with him  i think he declared that mrs carraby can take care of herself  perhaps lady anne replied looking thoughtfully at her cigarette you see the woman knows in her heart that shes impossible she copies all our bad tricks she sees that we all flirt as a matter of course and she tries to outdo us its the old story what one person can do with impunity another makes an awful hash of we can go to the very gates because when we get there we know how to shrug our shoulders and turn away i am not sure that mrs carraby has breeding enough for that shell go through if bob has his way  you are becoming rather an advanced young person julien remarked as he paid the bill  my dear julien she said ive told you before that you never knew me if you had appreciated me as i deserved when you came that cropper you wouldnt have called on me to say goodbye youd have left that redheaded friend of yours at home and told me that the empty place in the taxicab was mine  he laughed and then suddenly became grave  supposing i had he whispered  she looked at him startled in that moment he seemed to see a new thing in her face a new and marvelous softness it passed like a flashso swiftly that it left him wondering whether it was not indeed a trick of his imagination  absurd she murmured tell me what is there we can do now must i go home  on the contrary he declared you are engaged to me for the evening only i must call at my rooms do you mind  i mind nothing she assured him let us take a carriage and drive about the streets julien what a yellow moon  they clambered into a little voiture and with a hoarse shout and a crack of the whip from the cocher they started off lady anne leaned back with an exclamation of content  if only it werent so theatrical she sighed the streets seem so clean and the buildings so white and the sky so blue and the people so gay yet i suppose the bitterness of life is here as in the other places why do you want to call at your rooms julien  there is just a chance he explained that there may be a telegram from kendricks i want to know what they think of my article  she laughed scornfully  i can tell you that there is only one thing they can think how these people will hate you who are trying to make mischief between france and england  julien smiled grimly  i shouldnt be surprised he admitted it may come to a tussle between us yet  they pulled up before the door of his rooms she too alighted  i want to see what your quarters are like she said calmly i may come up maynt i  by all means he assented  she followed him up the dark stairs and into his room he turned on the lights she looked around at his little salon with its french furniture its open windows with the lime trees only a few feet away and threw herself into an easychair with a sigh of content  julien how delightful she exclaimed is there anything for you  he walked to the mantelpiece there was a telegram and a note for him the former he tore open and his eyes sparkled as he read it aloud  magnificent be careful am coming over at once  kendricks  he passed it on to her then he opened the note  i am coming to your rooms for my answer tonight  carl freudenberg  even as he read it there was a knocking at the door she looked up doubtfully  who is that  it may be the man who writes me here he told her  she rose softly to her feet and pointed to the door which divided the apartments he nodded and she passed through into the inner room julien went to the outside door and threw it open it was indeed herr freudenberg who stood there  come in he invited  herr freudenberg removed his hat and entered     chapter vi   falkenberg fails   herr freudenberg was dressed for the evening with his usual fastidious neatness he had the air of a man who had been engaged for many nights in some arduous occupation there were dark rims under his eyes the lines upon his forehead were deeper nevertheless he smiled with something of his old gayety as he accepted the chair which julien placed for him  my dear sir julien he said i have come a good many hundred miles at a most inconvenient moment for the sake of a brief conversation with you  julien raised his eyebrows  you surprise me he exclaimed i had no idea that the mission you spoke of was so urgent  nor is it herr freudenberg replied as a matter of fact it scarcely exists at all or if it did exist it was created simply as a means of removing you from within the reach of practical politics for some months i have foresight you see sir julien i saw what was coming permit me to tell you that i do not like your letter in le grand journal yesterday a letter which i understand appeared also in the london post  i am sorry julien said calmly still to be perfectly frank it wasnt written with a view of pleasing or displeasing you it was written in a strenuous attempt to preserve the friendship between france and england  it is to be followed i presume by others herr freudenberg asked  it is the first of a series julien admitted  you know herr freudenberg remarked glancing at his fingernails for a moment that it is most diabolically clever  you flatter me julien murmured  not at all i have spoken the truth i am here to know what price you will take to suppress the remainder of the series  julien considered  i will take he replied the exact amount of the last war indemnity which was paid to you by france  herr freudenberg smiled  a mere trifle to the war indemnity we shall be asking from england before very long  i am not avaricious julien declared those are my terms  herr freudenberg sighed  my friend he said it would be better if you talked of this matter reasonably there are other ways of securing the noncontinuance of those letters than by purchase  precisely julien answered but paris in its beaten thoroughfares at any rate is a lawabiding city i dont fancy that i shall come to much grief here  a brave man herr freudenberg remarked seldom believes that he will come to grief  if the blow falls nevertheless it is at least considerate of you that you bring me warning  rubbish herr freudenberg interposed listen sir julien i ask you to consider this matter as a reasonable person we dont want war we dont mean to have war but the desire of my ministersmy own desirereally is to inflict a crushing diplomatic humiliation upon the present government of great britain it is composed of incompetent and objectionable persons we desire to humiliate them yet who is it that we find taking up the cudgels on their behalf youthe man whom they drove out the man whom from sheer jealousy they ousted from their ranks why you should be with us not against us  i have no grudge whatever against my party julien said you seem to have been misinformed upon that subject besides i am an englishman and a patriot the whole series of my articles will be written and i shall do my best to point out exactly the means by which this present coolness between our two countries has been engineered  i will give you herr freudenberg offered a million francs not to write those articles  julien pointed to the door  you are becoming offensive  herr freudenberg rose slowly to his feet there was a little glitter in his eyes  i have gone out of my way he declared to be friendly with you most obstinate of englishmen that now is finished you shall not write those articles  you threaten me  i do  there are times julien remarked quietly when i scarcely know whether to take you seriously there is surely a little of the burlesque about such a statement  herr freudenberg shrugged his shoulders slightly  you think so nevertheless no man whom i have ever threatened has done the thing against which i have warned him  julien turned towards the door to open it herr freudenberg with footsteps like a cat came up behind him suddenly he threw his long sinewy arm around the others neck taken utterly unprepared julien was powerless herr freudenberg swung him round upon his back and knelt upon his chest  this he said calmly distresses me extremely yet what am i to do  he whistled softly the door was opened estermen came in with suspicious alacrity there was scarcely any need of words in a moment juliens legs and arms were bound and a gag thrust between his teeth herr freudenberg moved before the door and listened  estermen has reported to me he remarked that you keep no manservant any intrusion here therefore is scarcely to be feared you will permit me  he took one of the tumblers from the tray rinsed it out with sodawater and poured the contents of a small phial into it then he came and stood over julien  my obstinate englishman he proceeded this tumbler contains the waters of forgetfulness let me assure you upon my honor that the liquid is harmless its one effect is to reduce those who take it to such a state that for the space of a week or two their mental faculties are impaired you will drink this in a few minutes you will awake feeling weak languid indisposed for exercise incapable of mental effort the doctor will prescribe a tonic you will go away but it will be months before you are able to set yourself to any task requiring the full use of your faculties at the end of that time i trust that you will have found wisdom will you swallow the draught  julien shook his head violently herr freudenberg sighed  i was hoping he continued that you would not force me to mention the alternative i should dislike exceedingly having to inflict any more lasting injury upon you but you stand in my path and i permit no one to do that drink and in a month or two all will be as it is now refuse and i shall leave estermen to deal with you and let me warn you that his methods are not so gentle as mine more men than one who have been foolish have disappeared in paris  if you move a step this way a calm voice said from the other end of the room i shall shoot  herr freudenberg turned his head estermen whose nerves were less under control gave a little cry lady anne was standing upon the threshold of the doorway between the two rooms and in her very steady hand was grasped a small revolver the two men were speechless  it has taken me some time to find this lady anne went on and longer still to find the cartridges i do not understand in the least what has happened but i am perfectly serious when i tell you that i shall shoot either of you two if you move a step towards me  herr freudenberg looked into the revolver looked at lady anne and made her a little bow  mademoiselle he said who you may be i do not alas know sir julien however is indeed to be congratulated that he possesses already so charming and courageous a friend with the entrée to his bedroom  lady anne lifted the revolver a few inches and fired the bullet struck the wall barely a foot over herr freudenbergs head a faint puff of blue smoke floated up towards the ceiling  i do not like impertinence she remarked if you have any more such speeches to make  mademoiselle i have none herr freudenberg interrupted bowing allow me on the contrary to offer you my apologies and to express my admiration for your bearing i must alas acknowledge myself for the moment vanquished i shall leave you to release our dear friend sir julien but if you are wise mademoiselle if you are really his friend you will advise him to obey the injunction which i have sought to lay upon him today a little affair like this which goes wrong is nothing i have a dozen means of enforcing my words not one of which has ever failed  i do not know who you are lady anne said calmly or what it is against which you are warning sir julien but i am perfectly certain of one thing he will do what is right and what he conceives to be his duty without fear of threats from you or any one  herr freudenberg bowed low estermen who had been glancing more than once uneasily towards the revolver was already at the door  mademoiselle herr freudenberg declared bravery is a splendid gift discretion a finer sir julien knows who i am and he knows that i have yet to admit myself vanquished in any scheme in which i engage he will use his judgment meanwhile mademoiselle  he bowed low turned and left the room lady anne listened to his retreating footsteps then she crossed the room quickly and bent over julien  are you hurt she asked breathlessly  he shook his head she fumbled for a few minutes with the gag and removed it  not a bit he assured her dont put the revolver down yet but fetch me a knife youll find one on the mantelpiece in the bedroom  she did as he told her in a few minutes he was free he stood up gasping  the fellow came up behind me he explained while i was walking to the door anne what a brick you are  he held out his hand she took it laughing frankly  my dear julien she exclaimed what else could any one do i heard the row andshall i admit itpeeped through the keyhole i couldnt see anything so i opened the door softly and heard something of what was going on this old revolver was lying on your dressingtable but i had an awful hunt for the cartridges whoever were those men  julien smiled  when i tell you he said you will think that i am mad yet this is the truth the man with whom you talked was prince von falkenberg  what the german minister  julien nodded  it seems incredible doesnt it falkenberg is a man possessed of one ideato upset the relations between france and england for that purpose he has been paying secret visits to paris for the last year he has corrupted the press here he has wormed his way into the confidence of one or two of the ministers the thing is a perfect mania with him he has taken it into his head that the articles which kendricks has made me promise to write and the first one of which appeared in le grand journal yesterdaythe one you read at dinnertimeare going to be exploited as an exposure of his methods for that reason he came ostensibly to confirm an offer which he made me some time ago when i refused he offered me a large sum of moneyanything to get rid of me and to stop my writing these articles of course i declined and there you are  lady anne began to laugh once more  well she said i suppose im not dreaming it sounds like a page out of an operabouffe that man who was here whom i threatened to shoot was really prince falkenberg  theres no doubt whatever about it julien assured her the very first night i was in paris he sent for me anne he went on turning once more towards her i havent thanked you half enough what a nerve you have you were splendid  dont talk rubbish julien she protested the stroke of luck was that i happened to be there it must have been quite a surprise for him to see an apparently respectable young woman step out of your bedroom i am inclined to fear julien that i am compromised anyhow mother would say so  between ourselves julien remarked i dont think that falkenberg will mention the occurrence just wait while i put on another collar and well go to that musichall  she glanced at the clock  i think you shall take me home instead  he looked at her quickly  this affair has upset you  my dear julien she said dryly what an absurd idea of course i am quite used to these little affairs to seeing you lie bound and gagged and pointing a revolver at that unpleasantlooking prince with a horrible fear inside me all the time that if i did aim at anything i shouldnt hit it nevertheless i think ill go home if you dont mind  they descended the stairs and he called a little voiture  i suppose it would sound silly he ventured after a time if i said anything more about thanking you  ridiculous she replied but what are you going to do are you going to the police  he shook his head  i think that herr freudenberg as he calls himself would be too clever for me if i tried anything of that sort you see i have put this revolver into my pocket i am going to avoid the lonely places and have kendricks with me as much as possible  she nodded  take care of yourself she advised in a matteroffact tone as they turned into the street where mademoiselle rignaut lived i dont want to hear of any tragedies  when shall i see you again julien asked  it depends upon what reply i get from madame christophor she answered she may want me at once and i dont know yet whether ill get an evening out or not i shall have to leave you to discover that good night  she vanished within the dark doorway julien stepped back into the carriage more than a little puzzled to him anne had always seemed the prototype of all that was serene and matteroffact tonight he had found her unrecognizable there was something too in her face as she had turned away a slight tremble in her voice that bewildered him as he drove back to his rooms through the lighted streets it was strange that notwithstanding the exciting adventure through which he had passed his thoughts were chiefly concerned with the problem of this unfamiliar lady anne     chapter vii   lady anne declines   my dear julien  the duchess was very impressive indeed from the depths of an easychair in her sittingroom at the ritz hotel she held out both her hands and in her eyes was that peculiar strained look which julien had only been privileged to observe once or twice in his life it indicated or rather it was the duchesss substitute for emotion julien at once perceived therefore that this was an occasion  first of all she went on motioning him to a chair first of all before i say a single word about this strange thing which has brought me to paris let me congratulate you i always knew dear julien that you would do something that you would not allow yourself to be altogether crushed by the machinations of that hateful woman  really julien began i am not quite sure  i mean your letters of course she interrupted the duke when he finished the first one said only one thingwonderful that is just how we all feel about them julien i met lord cardington only a few hours before i left london and he was absolutely enthusiastic if one thing he said will save the country it is this splendid attack upon the new diplomacyas you so cleverly called it the duke tells me that that first article of yours is to be printed as a leaflet and distributed throughout the country  i am very glad julien said to hear all this tell me what brings you to paris is the duke with you  the duchess smiled at him reproachfully  you ask me what brings me to paris julien come come you and i mustnt begin like that i want you to tell me at once where she is  where who is  anne of course please dont play with me consider what a terrible time we have all been through  julien did not at once reply his very hesitation seemed to afford the duchess a lively satisfaction  there she declared you are not going to pretend then that you dont know that is excellent julien tell me at once where to find her take me to her  i am afraid i cant do that julien objected  my dearmy dear julien the duchess protested this is all so foolish why should there be any mystery about annes whereabouts i am not angry i ought to be perhaps but you see i have guessed my dear girls secret ive felt for her terribly during the last few weeks but it was so hard to know what to do it seemed shocking at the time but perhaps after all the course which she adopted was the wisest  i am very glad to hear that you are taking it like that julien remarked and i am sure anne will be i think the best thing i can do is to go and see her and tell her that you are here  she does not know then the duchess interrupted  why of course not julien replied i received your note early this morningbefore i was up in factand you begged me so earnestly to come round at once that i came straight here without calling anywhere  the duchess coughed  very well julien i will leave you to go and fetch anne whenever you like i shall await you here impatiently tell me how it was that you both managed to deceive us so completely  julien shook his head  i havent the slightest notion what you mean  the duchess shrugged her shoulders  for my part she said i always looked upon dear anne as the most unemotional unsentimental person naturally i thought that she was a little attracted towards you but on the other hand i had no idea that she looked upon marriage as anything but a reasonable and necessary part of life i had no idea even that she had any real affection for you  affection for me  julien looked up the duchess was regarding him as a mother might look at a naughty child whom she intended to pardon  i did notice she continued that anne seemed very silent for some time after your departure and there was a curious lack of enthusiasm about her preparations for the wedding with mr samuel harbord she scarcely looked even at the pearls he gave her you know that i found them on the floor of her bedroom after she had gone away well well never mind that the duchess went on when i got her hurried note and understood the whole affair i must say that on the whole it was a relief to me dear anneshe is only like what i was at her age before i married the duke you ought to be very proud and happy julien  i should be very happy julien declared to understand in the least what you are talking about  the duchess stared at him  my good man she cried my own daughter runs away on the eve of her marriage throws all society into a commotion comes to paris to join the man whom she cares foryouyou julienand then you affect to misunderstand  julien was speechless for several moments he was conscious of a little wave of strange emotion the walls of the hotel sittingroom fell away he was standing on the edge of the wood behind the shrubbery of laurels the smell of the country gardens the distant music the delicious stillness the queer troubled look in annes eyes her suddenly quickened breath that moment which had passed so soon it came back to him with a peculiar insistence during those few seconds  then he brushed it away  my dear duchess he said slowly you are laboring under some extraordinary mistake anne and i were very good friends and i think that we should have made a reasonably contented couple that however was naturally broken off at once owing to my misfortune annes visit to paris her sudden flight from london had nothing whatever to do with me i met her here entirely by accident no word has passed between us which would suggest for a single moment that she looked upon this matter any differently  the duchess listened to him steadily at first there were signs of a coming storm like a skilful general however she abandoned her position and changed her tactics she got up and walked to the window produced a handkerchief from her pocket and stood dabbing her eyes she looked out over the place vendôme julien who had not the least idea what to say kept silent  julien she said at last turning around thisthis is a blow to me if what you say is true and of course it is dear annes life is ruined at present every one sympathizes with her you know samuel harbord notwithstanding his enormous wealthyou have no idea julien how horrid he was about the settlementsis very unpopular there wasnt a soul except his own people who didnt thoroughly enjoy his position anne had run away to paris they all said because she declined to give up her old sweetheart you know what they will all say now she came and you would have none of her i ask you julien as a man of the world isnt that the view people are bound to take  it is a very stupid view julien declared anne cares no more for me than for any other man she isnt that sort even if i were in a position to marry any one i am quite sure that she would refuse me  the duchess began to see her way she tried however to banish the look of relief from her face  my dear julien she said very gently you men however well you mean sometimes make such mistakes i want to show you what i am sure you will see to be your duty things of course can never be as we had once hoped on the other hand i am a mother julien and i want to see my daughters happy we are very very poor but a little privation is good for all of us the duke will settle two thousand a year upon anne and i am quite sure that you can earn money with that wonderful pen of yours and then of course there is your own small income  anne doesnt want to marry me and he added after a moments hesitation i dont want to marry anne you forget that i am an outcast from life i have to start things all over again what should i do with a wife who has been used to the sort of life anne has always led  dear julien the duchess repeated i want to show you your duty if you do not marry anne every one in london will say that she came to you and you refused her it is your duty at least to give her the opportunity it is unfortunate that she came here perhaps but we have finished with all that she is here every one knows that she is here and you have been seen together  julien rose from his chair and walked up and down the room  i havent talked very much with anne he said pausing after a while but it seems to me that she is making a bid for liberty she is an independent sort of girl you know after all although she was very well content up to a certain point to take things as they came i dont believe for a moment that she would marry me  at least the duchess persisted do your duty and ask her if necessary even let people know that you have asked her it is your duty julien  julien hesitated no longer  very well he decided since you put it like that i will ask anne but i warn you i think she will refuse me  she will do nothing of the sort the duchess declared but oh julien it would make me so happy if you would take me to her if i could have just a few minutes talk with her first before you said anything serious  julien smiled  dear duchess i think not i will go to see anne alone i will ask her to marry me in my own way i will tell her that you are here and whether she consents to marry me or not i will bring her to see you but my offer shall be made before you and she meet  you are a little hard dear julien the duchess murmured but let it be so only remember that the poor dear child may be feeling very sensitiveshe must know that she has placed herself so completely in your power be nice to her julien  the duchess offered him a tentative but somewhat artificial embrace which julien with great skill evaded  we shall see he remarked what happens i shall find you here i suppose  the duchess nodded  i have traveled all night she said half closing her eyes directly i saw that it was my duty i came here without waiting a single second i shall lie down and rest and hope julien until i see you both i shall hope and pray that you will bring anne here to luncheon with me and that we shall have a little family gathering  anne was seated before the wideopen window in the little back room leading from mademoiselle rignauts workshop a sewingmachine was on the table in the middle of the apartment the floor was strewn with fragments of material anne in a perfectly plain black gown similar to those worn by the other young ladies of the establishment was making bows she looked at julien as he entered in blank amazement then a shadow of annoyance crossed her face  my dear julien she exclaimed fancy letting you climb these four flights of stairs besides these are my working hours i am not receiving visitors  rubbish julien interposed theres surely no need for you to pose as a seamstress  she laughed  dont be foolish why not a seamstress i am absolutely determined to do work of some sort i am tired of living on other people and other peoples efforts until i hear from madame christophor or find another post i am doing what i am fit for here dont make me any more annoyed than i am at present i am cross enough with janette because she will make me sit in here instead of with the other girls  he came across the room and stood by her side before the window the slight haze of the midsummer morning rested over the city with its tangled mass of roofs and chimneys its tall white buildings with funny little verandas the sweep of boulevards and statelier buildings in the distance she looked up and followed his eyes  dont you like my view she asked one misses the roar of london do you notice how much shriller and less persistent all the noises are yet it has its own inspiration hasnt it  without a doubt julien answered of course you can guess what i came for  if it were to ask me to lunch she said composedly threading her needle i am sorry but i cant come i have to make twentyfive of these bows and i am rather slow at it  luncheon might have followed as an afterthought he replied my real mission was to suggest that you should marry me  lady annes fingers paused for a moment in the air she sat quite still her eyes were half closed there was a curious little quiver at her heart a little throb in her ears on the whole however she kept her selfcontrol marvelously  whatever put that into your head she inquired going on with her work  he hesitated it was in his mind to tell her of that evening at clonarty to speak of it to recall that one wave of emotion on which indeed they might have floated into a completer understanding he looked at her steadfastly she was very graceful very good to look upon she sat upright in her poor cane chair bending over her foolish little task but he missed any inspiration which might have guided his tongue she looked so thoroughly selfpossessed so splendidly superior to circumstances  isnt it natural he asked you and i were always good friends we have come together here and we are both a little lonely i have never known any one else in the world anne he continued with whom i have been able to think of marriage with moremore content one might live quite a pleasant life here we should not be paupers at any rate there would be no reason for you to sit in this stuffy room making bows or to go and write madame christophors letters  is that all  again he was tempted for a single moment she had raised her eyes and he had fancied that in that swift upward glance he had seen the light of an almost eager questioning an almost pathetic search he bent towards her but she refused obstinately to look at him again  dear anne he said i have always been fond of you  again her fingers were idle an idea seemed to have occurred to her she asked him a question  how long is it since you have seen my mother  he did not at once reply she raised her head and looked at him then she knew the truth she set her teeth and fought a little sob was strangled in her throat  i left your mother a few minutes ago he told her she arrived in paris this morning and sent for me  lady anne worked for a time in silence then she laid the bow which she had finished upon the table and leaned back in her chair clasping her right knee with her hands  you really are the queerest person julien she declared how you were ever a success as a diplomatist i cant imagine you came in with the air of one charged with a high and holy mission it was so obvious and yet for a moment it puzzled me how i would love to have been with you this morningwith you and my mother i meansomewhere behind a curtain never mind youve done the really right and honorable thingyou have given me my chance i am very grateful julien  she looked frankly enough into his face now and laughed julien remained silent  cant you see both of you anne went on you silly people that something quite alien to us and our set has found its way into my lifea sort of middleclass complaintheaven knows what you would call itbut it came just in time to place me in a most awkward position i still havent any doubt that marriage is a very respectable and desirable institution but to me the idea of it as a matter of convenience has suddenly becomewell a little worse than the thing which we all shudder at so righteously when we pass along the streets of paris of course i know she added thats a shocking point of view my mother would hold and you too that a legalized sale is no sale at all that matrimony is a perfectly hallowed institution a perfectly moral state and all the rest of it you see i very nearly admitted it myselfi very nearly sold myself  she shuddered then she rose to her feet straight and splendid with all the grace of her beautiful young womanhood  men dont think just as we do about this she continued you are all much too oriental but a woman has at least a right to keep what she doesnt choose to sell even if in the end she chooses to give it  julien moved a step nearer to her  anne he said supposing one cared  every fibre of her body was set in an effort of resistance the mocking laugh rose readily enough to her lips the words were crushed back in her throat only the faintest shadow shone for a moment in her eyes  ah julien she murmured lightly if one cared but does that really come i wonder not to such men as you not often i am afraid to such women as i  the door was suddenly opened little mademoiselle rignaut was covered with confusion  but miladi she exclaimed a thousand pardons  janette anne interrupted if i hear that once more i leavei seek another situation  but mademoiselle then mademoiselle rignaut corrected a thousand pardons indeed i had no idea  my dear janette lady anne protested why do you apologize for entering your own workshop it is foolish this i go now dear julien to put on my hat you shall drive me to where my mother is stayingthe ritz i suppose afterwards you shall leave us wait in the street below i shall be less than two minutes  mademoiselle rignaut was still apologetic as she conducted julien down the narrow stairs  but indeed she declared there never was a young lady so strange with such charming manners so sweet as dear miladi anne all the time she smiles inconveniences are nothing one would imagine that she were happy and yet at night  at night what julien asked  mademoiselle shook her head  miladi anne is not quite so cheerful as she seems at night i fancy that she does not sleep too well one hears her and alas monsieur sir julien last night i heard her sobbing quietly  lady anne sobbing julien exclaimed it seems impossible  indeed but women are strange mademoiselle rignaut sighed     chapter viii   a declaration of independence   lady anne came gayly down to the street a few minutes later she was still wearing the plain black gown and the simplest of hats nevertheless she looked charming her fresh complexion with its slight touch of sunburn her wealth of brown hair and the distinction of her carriage made her everywhere an object of admiration in a city where the prevailing type of beauty was so different  poor mother she exclaimed as they crossed the place de lopéra tell me was she very theatrical this morning julien  julien smiled  i am afraid i must admit that she was he declared i found her very interesting  i hate to talk about her anne continued it makes one feel so unfilial but really she is the most wonderful marionette that ever lived the perfect life you see i have been behind the scenes so long every now and then a little of the womans nature crops up her cut to mrs carraby for instance was quite one of the events of the season it was so perfectly administered so utterly scathing i hear that the poor creature went to bed for a fortnight afterwards gracious i hope i am not distressing you julien she added hastily  not in the least julien assured her grimly i have no interest in mrs carraby  lady anne sighed  thats how you men talk when your little feeling has evaporated julien youre a selfish crowd you make the world a very difficult place for a woman  i think he said that your sex avenges itself  i am not sure she replied men so often place the burden of their own follies upon a womans shoulders  you rebuke me rightly julien declared bitterly  i was not thinking of you she told him reproachfully i am sorry julien i should not have said that  it was the truth he confessed absolutely the truth still i have never blamed mrs carraby for my disasters it was my own asinine simplicity tell me when shall i see you again i think i ought to leave you here  she laughed  you want to know about my interview with mother well you shall know all about that i promise you because i have changed my mind i intend to make you an auditor dont desert me julien please remember this is really a trying moment for me i have to face an irate and obstinate parent if friendship is worth anything come and help me  i cant help thinking he objected that your mother would rather talk to you alone  then you will please to consider me and not my mother anne insisted as they drew up before the door of the hotel i wish you to remain  the duchess received them perfectly she did not attempt anything emotional she simply held out both her hands a little apart  you dear sensible people she cried anne how dared you give us such a shock  anne leaned over and kissed her mother  mother she announced i am not going to marry julien  the duchess started the expression which flashed from her eyes was unmistakably genuine  dont talk nonsense anne she exclaimed sharply  no nonsense about it anne retorted i cant bear to talk when any one is standing up sit down and in a few sentences ill let you know how hopeless it all is  there was real fear in the duchesss eyes  anne she gasped is there a man then  you idiotic person of course there isnt anne replied why on earth you should all talk about a man directly a girl breaks away for a time i cant imagine now sit down there and listen i brought julien along because if you bully me too much i shall make him take me away we are excellent friends julien and i and he has been very kind to me since i came here but i met him entirely by accident and if i hadnt i am quite sure that we might have lived here for years and never come across one another  but i have told every one in london the duchess protested i have explained everything i have told them how you always loved julien what a terrible blow his troubles were and how you suddenly found that it was impossible for you to marry any other man and like a dear romantic child that you are you ran away to him  yes lady anne said dryly thats a very pretty story thats just what i imagined you would tell everybody when you knew that id come here that is just she continued slowly what you have been rubbing into poor julien this morning before he came to see me very well mother up to a certain point it came off you see julien called most dutifully found me sitting in an atticattic is the correct word isnt itand made his declaration no i dont think he declared anything on second thoughts he effectually concealed any feelings he might have had it was a suggestion which he made  my manner of expressing myself julien began a little stiffly  your manner of expressing yourself was perfect anne interrupted it was a great deal too perfect my preux chevalier only you see julien only you see mother julien offered me exactly what i left home to escape from i have come to the conclusion she went on smoothing her skirt about her knees that it is most indecent and wholly improper even to think of marrying a man who does not love you and whom you do not love  the duchess closed her eyes  anne what have you been reading she murmured  not a thing anne went on i never did read half enough im simply acting by instinct julien and i were engaged for three months and at the end of that time we were complete strangers the idea of marrying a stranger was not attractive to me let that go julien went along came samuel  we will not talk about mr harbord the duchess interposed hastily  oh yes we will now so far as julien was concerned anne continued i dare say i should have smothered my feelings because there is nothing revolting about him he is quite an attractive person and physically everything to be desired but when it came to a man who was not a gentleman whose manners were odious who offended my taste every time he opened his mouthwhy you see the thing couldnt be thought of day by day it got worse towards the end he began to try and put his hands on me that made me think thats why i came to paris  anne the duchess declared severely you are indecent  on the contrary anne insisted i think it was the most decent thing i ever did now please listen i will not come back to england i will not marry julien i will not think of or discuss the subject of marriage with any one i am a free person and i havent the least intention of spending my life moping i am going to have a pleasant time and i am going to have it in my own way you have two other daughters motherviolet and lucy unless they change they are exactly what you would have them be satisfied devote your energies to them and count me a black sheep you can make me a little allowance if you likea hundred a year or sobut whether i have it or not i am either going to make bows in mademoiselle rignauts workshop or i am going to be secretary to a very delightful ladya mrs christophor or something of the sort  the duchess roseshe had an idea that she was more dignified standing  anne she said i am your mother not only that but i ask you to remember who you are the women of england look for an example to us they look to us to live regular and lawabiding lives to be dutiful wives and mothers you are behaving like a creature from an altogether different world you speak openly of things i have never permitted mentioned i ask you to reflect do you owe nothing to me do you owe nothing to your father to our position  a great deal mother anne replied but i owe more to myself than to any one else in the world  the duchess felt hopeless she looked toward julien  there is so much of this foolish sort of talk about she complained it all comes of making friends with socialists and labor people and having such terrible nonsense printed in the reviews what are we to do julien cant you persuade anne i am sure that she is really fond of you  i wouldnt attempt to influence her for a single moment julien declared i wont say whether i think she is right or wrong on the whole i am inclined to think that she is right  you too desert me the duchess exclaimed  well it all depends upon ones conception of happiness of course julien replied but so far as i am concerned let me tell you that the idea of a girl like anne married to an insufferable bounder like harbord just because hes got millions of money simply made me boil  anne for some reason or other was looking quite pleased  i am so glad to know you felt like that julien its really the nicest thing youve said to me all the morning well thats over now mother why dont you give us some lunch and take the four oclock train back its the calais train which i know you always prefer  the duchess reflected for a moment there were advantages in lunching at the ritz with julien on one side of her and anne on the other she gave a little sigh and consented     chapter ix   foolhardy julien   the luncheon in the beautiful restaurant of the ritz was a meal after the duchesss own heart she was at home here and received the proper amount of attention not only that but many acquaintancesmostly foreign but a few englishpaused at her table to pay their respects to every one of these she carefully introduced her daughter and sir julien the situation was not without its embarrassments lady anne however dissipated them by an unaffected fit of laughter  mother thinks she is putting everything quite right by lending us the sanctity of her presence she declared we have been seen lunching at the ritz after this who shall say that i ran away from home to meet a riding master in paris or some other disreputable person i may perhaps be pitied as the victim of a hopeless infatuation for you julien but for the rest if we only sit here long enough i shall be whitewashed  the duchess was a little uneasy  i must say anne she protested that you seem to have developed a great deal of levity during the last few days its not a subject to be alluded to so lightly ah now let me tell you who this is a wonderfully interesting person i can assure you she was born in paris of american parents very wealthy indeed married when quite young to prince falkenberg and separated from him within two years they say that she lives a queer half bohemian sort of life now but she is still a great person when she chooses my dear princess  madame christophor who had entered the room on her way to a luncheon party paused for a moment and shook hands then she recognized julien  really she murmured this is most unexpected my dear duchess you have quite deserted paris is this your daughterlady anne i scarcely remember her and yet  we met yesterday lady anne interrupted promptly you know i want to be your secretary madame christophor if you will let me my mother has entirely cast me off so it doesnt matter  the duchess made a most piquant gesture it was really an insufferable position but she was determined to remain graceful  my dear madame christophor she said you have no grownup children of course so i cannot ask for your sympathy but i have a daughter here who is giving me a great deal of trouble i flatter myself that i have modern views of life but annewell i wont discuss her  madame christophor smiled  young people are different nowadays duchess she remarked if lady anne really wants to come into life on her own why not she can be my secretary if she chooses i shall pay her just as much as i should any one else and i shall send her away if she is not satisfactory there are a great many young people nowadays duchess she continued in very much your daughters position who do these odd things i always think that it is better not to stand in their way sir julien i want to speak to you before you leave this restaurant i have something important to say  the duchess was a little taken aback to her it seemed a social cataclysm something unheard of that her daughter should propose to be any ones secretary yet this woman who was certainly of her own order had accepted the thing as entirely naturalhad dismissed it even with a few casual remarks julien who since madame christophors arrival had been standing in his place was somewhat perplexed  you are lunching here he asked  with the servian ministers wife i shall excuse myself early it is a vital necessity that we talk for a few minutes before you leave here five minutes ago i sent a note to your rooms  i shall be at your service julien replied slowly  i shall expect you in the morning madame christophor said smiling at lady anne dont be later than ten oclock i am always at home after four duchess if you are spending any time in paris she added  they watched her as she passed to the little group who were awaiting her arrival she was certainly one of the most elegant women in the room lady anne looked after her with a faint frown  i wonder she murmured if i shall like madame christophor  i had no idea julien the duchess remarked that you were friendly with her  julien evaded the question  at any rate he said turning to anne this will be better for you than making bows  i suppose so she assented all the same i am very much my own mistress in that dusty little workshop if madame christophorisnt that the name she chooses to be called bybecomes exacting i am not even sure that i shant regret my bowmaking  tell me exactly how long you have known her julien the duchess persisted  since my arrival in paris this time julien answered i hadwell a sort of introduction to her  she is received everywhere the duchess continued because i know she visits at the house of the comtesse deschelles who is one of the few women in paris of the old faction who are entirely exclusive at the same time i am told that she leads a very retired life now and is more seen in bohemia than anywhere i am not at all sure that it is a desirable association for anne  well you can leave off troubling about that anne said remember however much we make believe i have really shaken the dust of respectability off my feet hamilton place knows me no longer i am a dweller in the byways even if i come back it will be as a stranger people will be interested in me perhaps as some one outside their lives that strange daughter of the poor dear duchess you know they will say who ran away to paris some terrible affair no one knows the rights of it cant you hear it all they will be kind to me of course but i shant belong alas  the duchess was studying her bill and wondering how much to tip the waiter she only answered absently  my dear anne you are talking quite foolishly i wish i knew she added plaintively a few minutes later what you have been reading or whom you have been meeting lately  dont bother about me anne begged what you want to do now is to tell parkins to pack up your things and ill come and see you off by the four oclock train julien must wait outside for my future employer what i really think is going to happen is that shes going to ask for my character julien be merciful to me remember that above all things i have always been respectable remind her that if i were too intelligent i should probably rob her of her secrets or money or something i am really a most machinelike person nature meant me to be secretary to a clever woman and my handwritingdont forget my handwriting nothing so clear or so rapid has ever been seen  the duchess signed her bill slightly undertipped the waiter and accepted his subdued thanks with a gracious smile  i can see she said as they left the room that i shall have to wash my hands of you nevertheless i shall not lose hope  she shook hands solemnly with julien and he performed a like ceremony with lady anne  when shall i see you again he asked the latter  you had better question madame christophor concerning my evenings out she replied it is not a matter i know much about i am sure you are quite welcome to any of them  julien found a seat in the broad passageway several acquaintances passed to and fro whom so far as possible he avoided madame christophor came at last she was the centre of the little party who were on their way into the lounge when she neared julien however she paused and made her adieux he rose and waited for her expectantly  we are to talk here he asked  she nodded  in that corner  she pointed to a more retired spot he followed her there  order some coffee she directed  he obeyed her and they were promptly served she waited chatting idly of their luncheon party of the coincidence of meeting with the duchess until they were entirely freed from observation then she leaned towards him  sir julien she said i have read your articles the first and the second you are a brave man  he smiled  are you going to warn me once more against herr freudenberg he asked  she shook her head  if you do not know your danger she continued you would be too great a fool to be worth warning remember that freudenberg came from berlin as fast as express trains and his racingcar could bring him the moment he read the first  i have already had a brief but somewhat unpleasant interview with him julien remarked  i congratulate you she went on unpleasant interviews with herr freudenberg generally end differently now listen to me i have a proposition to make there is one house in paris where you will be safemine i offer you its shelter come there and finish your work  julien made no reply he sipped his coffee for a moment then he turned slowly round  madame christophor he said once you told me that you disliked and distrusted all men why then should i trust you  she winced a little but her tone when she answered him was free of offense  why should you indeed she replied yet you should remember that the man against whose cherished schemes your articles are directed is the man whom i have more cause to hate than any other in the world  herr freudenberg he murmured  prince adolf rudolf von falkenberg she corrected him do you know the story of my married life  i have never heard it he told her  i will spare you the details she continued my husband married me with the sole idea of using my house my friends my social position here for the furtherance of his schemes under my roof i discovered meetings of spies spies paid to suborn the different services in this countrythe navy the army the railway works when i protested he laughed at me he made no secret of his ambitions he is the sworn and inveterate enemy of your country his feeling against france is a slight thing in comparison with his hatred of england for the last ten years he has done nothing but scheme to humiliate her when i discovered to what purpose my house was being put i bade him leave it i bade him choose another hotel and when he saw that i was in earnest he obeyed it is one of the conditions of our separation that he does not cross my threshold that is why i say sir julien that you have nothing to fear in accepting the shelter of my roof  madame christophor julien said earnestly i am most grateful for your offer at the same time i honestly do not believe that i have anything to fear anywhere herr freudenberg has made one attempt upon me and has failed i do not think that he is likely to risk everything by any open assaults in these civilized days of the police the telephone and the law courts one is not so much at the mercy of a strong man as in the old days i do not fear herr freudenberg  madame christophor shrugged her shoulders  my friend she admitted i admire your courage but listen you say that one attempt has already been made to silence you for every letter you write there will be another made at each fresh one these creatures of herr freudenbergs will have learned more cunning in the end they are bound to succeed why risk your life i offer my house as a sanctuary there is no need for you to pass outside it you could take the exercise you require in my garden which is bounded by four of the highest walls in paris you can sit in a room apart from the rest of the house with three locked doors between you and the others you may write there freely and without fear  julien smiled  i am afraid it is my stupidity he said but i cannot possibly bring myself to believe in the existence of any danger i will promise you this if i may if any further attempt should be made upon me any attempt which came in the least near being successful i will remember your offer for the present my mind is made up i shall remain where i am  she shrugged her shoulders  ingrate  not that by any means he assured her heartily you know that i am grateful you know that if i refuse for the moment your offer it is not because i mistrust you i simply feel that i should be taking elaborate precautions which are quite unnecessary  i might even spare you she remarked smiling lady anne for your secretary  even that inducement he answered steadily does not move me  she sighed  you will have your own way she said and yet there is something rather sad about it i know so much more of this paris than you i know so much more of herr freudenberg remember that there are a quarter of a million germans in this city and of that quarter of a million at least twenty thousand belong to one or the other of the secret societies with which the city abounds all of them are different in tone but they all have at the end of their programme the cause of the fatherland by this time you will have been named to them as its enemy twenty thousand of them my friend and not a scruple amongst the lot  he moved in his place a little restlessly  one does not fight in these ways nowadays he protested  pigheaded englishman she murmured you to say that too  his thoughts flashed back to those few moments of vivid life in his own rooms he thought of freudenbergs calm perseverance an uncomfortable feeling seized him  i do not know she went on leaning a little towards him why i should interest myself in you at all  why do you then he asked looking at her suddenly  she played with the trifles that hung from her chatelaine he watched for the raising of her eyes but he watched in vain she did not return his inquiring look  never mind she said i have warned you it is for you to act as you think best if you change your mind come to me i will give you sanctuary at any time take me to my automobile please  he obeyed her and watched her drive off then he went slowly and unmolested back to his rooms     chapter x   the second attempt   the concierge of juliens apartments issued with a somewhat mysterious air from his little lodge as his tenant passed through the door he was a short man with a fierce bristling moustache he wore a semimilitary coat always too short for him and he was so stout that he was seldom able to fasten more than two of the buttons of his waistcoat  monsieur  what is it pierre julien asked any callers for me  there have been callers indeed monsieur pierre replied callers whose errand i do not quite understand they asked many questions concerning monsieur when they had finished the manbah he was a germanhe thrust into my hand a hundred franc note he said no word of this to monsieur sir julien i put the note into the bottom of my trousers pocket but i made no response i am not dishonorable i keep the note because these men should think me craven enough to give them information to hear their questions and to say nothing to monsieur one of my own lodgers it was an insult that therefore i keep the hundred franc note therefore i tell monsieur all that these two men did ask  you showed julien declared a rare and excellent discretion proceed  they asked questions monsieur on every conceivable subject pierre continued their interest in your doings was amazing they asked what meals you took in the house at what hour you went out and at what hour you returned then the shorter of the two wished to take the room above yours i asked him more than double the price but he would have engaged it then i told him that i was not sure there was a gentleman to whom it was offered they come back this afternoon to know the result  if they find a lodging in this house julien said i fear that i must leave  it shall be pierre decided as monsieur wishes i am not to be tempted with money when it comes to a question of retaining an old tenant the room is let to another it is finished  julien climbed the stairs thoughtfully to his apartments locked himself in and sat down before his desk for an hour or more he worked then there came a timid knock at the door he looked around frowning after a moments hesitation he affected not to notice the summons and continued his work the knocking came again however low but persistent julien rose to his feet turned the key and opened the door  mademoiselle he exclaimed genuinely surprised  it was mademoiselle ixe who glided past him into the room she signed to him to close the door he did so and turning slowly faced her she was standing a few yards away her lips a little parted pale notwithstanding the delicately artistic touch of coloring upon her cheeks her hands were crossed upon the jade top of her lace parasol in her muslin gown and large hat she formed a very effective picture as she stood there with her eyes now fixed upon julien  mademoiselle he began i do not quite understand  look outside she begged see that there is no one there i am so afraid that i might have been followed  julien stepped out onto the landing and returned  there is no one about at all he assured her  she drew a little sigh  but it is rash this monsieur sir julien you are gladyou are pleased to see me make me one of your pretty speeches at once or i shall go  but mademoiselle julien said wheeling a chair towards her who indeed could be anything but glad to see you at any time yet forgive me if i am stupid tell me why you have come to see me this afternoon and why you are afraid that you are followed  why she murmured looking up into his eyes ah monsieur sir julien it is hard indeed to tell you that  mademoiselle ixe was without doubt an extraordinarily pretty young woman she was famous even in paris for her figure her looks the perfection of her clothes the daintiness and distinction of those small adjuncts to her toilette so dear to the heart of a parisienne julien looked at her and sighed  perhaps mademoiselle he said you will find it hard also to tell me whether you come of your own accord or at the instigation of herr freudenberg  she looked genuinely hurt julien however was merciless  it is perhaps because herr freudenberg has told you that i once lost great things through trusting a woman that you think to find me an easy victim he went on come am i to give you those sheets over there he added pointing to his writingtable and promise for your sake never to write another line or have you more serious designs  monsieur julien she faltered  he suddenly changed his tone  am i cruel he asked forgive me mademoiselleforgive me marguerite  she held out her delicately gloved hand towards him her face she turned a little away and one gathered that there were tears in her eyes which she did not wish him to see  take off my glove please she whispered i did not think you would be so cruel even for a moment  he took her fingers in his fingers which promptly returned his pressure his right arm stole around her  monsieur sir julien she continued very softly please promise that you will speak to me no more now of herr freudenberg tell me that you are glad i have come say some more of those pretty things that you whispered to me in the rat mort  his arm tightened about her she was powerless  julien she murmured  he laughed quietly suddenly she struggled to escape from him  let me go she cried sir julien but you are rough monsieur  he flung her from him back into the chair in his left hand he held the pistol he had taken from the bosom of her gowna dainty little affair of ivory and silver he turned it over curiously she lay back in the chair where he had thrown her gripping its sides with tremulous fingers her eyes deepset distended staring at him he thrust the weapon into his pocket  really he said i thought better of herr freudenberg why doesnt he come himself  oh he will come she answered  will he julien replied i should have thought better of him if he had come first instead of sending a woman to do his work  she sat up in the chair julien had known well how to rouse her  you do not think that he is afraid she cried afraid of you bah for the rest it was i who insisted on coming he was troubled i knew why i said to myself it is a risk i will take i will go to sir juliens rooms i will shoot him i will pretend that it was a love affair i will go into court all with tears i will wear my prettiest clothes nothing indeed will happen an affair of jealousya moment of madness one takes account of these things then herr freudenberg himself has great friends here friends in high places he will see that nothing happens  a very pretty scheme julien remarked sarcastically supposing however i turn the tables upon you mademoiselle you are here and i have taken away this little plaything would herr freudenberg be jealous if he knew i wonder  she glanced at the door  locked julien continued grimly do you still wish me to come and make pretty speeches to you he added you are certainly looking very charming mademoiselle your gown is exquisite what can i do more than echo what all paris has saidthat there is no one of her daughters more bewitching can you wonder if i lose my head a little when i find you here with me in my roomsa visit too of pure affection  she rose to her feet the patch of color upon her cheeks had become more vivid  you will let me go she faltered  julien unlocked the door  mademoiselle he answered i shall most certainly let you go permit me to thank you for the pleasure which your brief visit has afforded me  the door was opened before her julien stood on one side the smile with which he dismissed her was half contemptuous half kindly upon the threshold she hesitated  sir julien  mademoiselle ixe  if there were no herr freudenberg she whispered if it were not my evil fortune monsieur sir julien to love him so foolishly so absolutely so that every moment of separation is full of pain every other man like a figure in a dreamif it were not for this monsieur sir julien i do not think that i should like to leave you so easily  julien made no reply she passed out with a little sigh he heard the flutter of her laces and draperies as she crossed the passage and commenced the descent of the stairs julien was closing the door when he heard a familiar voice and a heavy footstep kendricks with a gladstone bag in his hand came bustling up  julien you dog he exclaimed savagely youre at it again why the devil cant you keep these women at arms length what has that pretty little creature of herr freudenbergs been doing here  julien laughed as he closed the door  dont be a fool david she wasnt here at my invitation  tears in her eyes kendricks muttered sobbing to herself as she went down the steps crocodiles tears i know these dd women julien out with it what did she come for  julien produced the pistol from his pocket  it was he explained her amiable intention to please her lord and master at the slight expense of my life fortunately the game was a new one to her and she kept on feeling the bosom of her gown to see whether the pistol was there still  what did you do kendricks demanded  what was there for me to do julien replied i took her little toy away and told her to run off this is the second time david estermen and freudenberg have had a shy at me here themselves and theyd have gotten me all right but for an accident i wont tell you what the accident was for the moment owing to your peculiar prejudices how are things in london  kendricks threw himself into an easychair and began to fill his pipe  julien he declared youve done the trick im proud of my advice proud of the result there isnt a club or an omnibus or a tube or a publichouse where that letter of yours isnt being talked about they tell me its the same here have you seen the german papers  not one  never was such a thunderbolt launched kendricks continued they are all either stupefied or hysterical freudenberg left berlin an hour after he saw the article you tell me youve met him already  yes hes been here julien replied he offered to make me a croesus if id stop the letters when i refused well we had a scuffle and by jove they nearly got me he means to wipe me out  well see about that kendricks muttered im not going to leave your side till were through with this little job  madame christophor suggested that i should go there and finish julien said what do you think of that  madame fiddlesticks kendricks retorted angrily the wife of falkenberg do you want to walk into the lions jaws  she is separated from her husband julien reminded him my own impression is that she hates him  id never believe it kendricks insisted the fellow has the devils own way with these women look at that little wretch i met on the stairs a harmless flirting little opera singer a year ago now shed come here and murder a man against whom she hasnt the slightest grudge for his sake i tell you the fellows got an unwholesome influence over every one with whom he comes in contact  have you read todays letter julien asked abruptly  read it man alive it made the heart jump inside me i tell you its set the war music dancing wherever a dozen men have come together i always thought you had a pretty gift as a maker of phrases julien but i never knew you dipped your pen in the ink of the immortals i tell you no one doubts anything you have written thats the genius of it no one denies it no one attempts arguments every one in england and france whose feelings have been ruffled is already wanting to shake hands all over again one sees that giant figure the worlds mischiefmaker suddenly caught at his job its gorgeous how about number four  half written julien declared pointing to his table  kendricks went to the door and locked it went to the cupboard and brought out the whiskey and soda undid his gladstone bag buttoned a life preserver on his left wrist and laid a mauser pistol on the table by the side of him  julien he said i feel like the biggest ass unhung but i am here with my playthings to be watchdog get to your desk and write man one drink first come  they raised their glasses  what have you called number three kendricks asked  a maker of toys julien replied  heres damnation to him kendricks said raising the glass to his lips now get to work julien     chapter xi   by the princes orders   once more mademoiselle sat beneath a canopy of pink roses surrounded by obsequious waiters with the murmur of music in her ears opposite the man she adored yet without a doubt mademoiselle was disturbed her fixed eyes were riveted upon the newspaper which herr freudenberg had passed into her hand she was suddenly very pale  send some of these people away she begged i am frightened  herr freudenberg smiled with a wave of his hand they were alone  dear marguerite he said quietly compose yourself all those who stand in my way and the way of my country must be swept aside but remember this they have all received their warning i lift my hand against no one who has not first received a chance of escape  he was a man so gallant she faltered so comme il faut listen to me please  she laid the newspaper upon the table and kept the flat of her hand still upon it then she leaned towards him  you will not be angry with me she implored indeed i did it to please you to win if i could a little more of your love i knew that this man sir julien stood in your path and that you found it difficult to remove him an impulse came to me we had talked together gayly as a man of gallantry may talk to a woman like myself it might easily pass for flirting those things that he has said although you dear one she added looking across the table know how it is with me when such words are spoken well i bought cartridges for my little pistol that you gave me i thrust it into the bosom of my gown i wore my prettiest clothes and yesterday i went to his rooms  herr freudenbergs cold eyes were suddenly fixed upon her face his fingers stopped their drumming upon the tablecloth  proceed  i meant to shoot him she confessed i thought that if i could not escape afterwards it was so easy for people to believe that he was my lover that it was a crime of jealousy a moments passion i said to myself too that you would help so that after all my punishment would be a very small affair in no other way it seemed to me could he have been disposed of so easily  sweet little fool herr freudenberg murmured did it never enter into your little brain that you are known as my companion  she shook her head  that would have counted for nothing people would not have believed that i had any other motive i should have declared that it was a love affair  what happened  he was too quick for me mademoiselle admitted he saw me feel the spot where the pistol lay concealed hehe snatched it away  and afterwards herr freudenberg inquired with the ghost of a smile upon his lips  she raised her eyes  he let me go she replied he threw open the door and he laughed at me forgive me please if i am sad if indeed i weep he was a gallant gentleman  herr freudenberg sighed slowly he raised his glass to his lips and drank  it is an amiable epitaph he declared many a man has gone up to heaven with a worse cheer up my little marguerite a year or two more or less in a mans life is no great matter and after all it was not one warning which this rash man received you have not yet read the account of the affair  mademoiselle slowly withdrew the palm of her hand from the paper the paragraph was headed  shocking explosion in the rue de montpelier  she looked up  i cannot read it she murmured tell me  it is simple he replied this afternoon an unfortunate explosion occurred in the house in the rue de montpelier where sir julien had his apartments the whole of the front of the premises was blown away it is regrettable he added with a little shrug of the shoulders that in all seven people perished including the concierge mr kendricks an english journalist was taken away alive but terribly injured to the hospital his companion who seems to have been within a few feet of him when the explosion occurred was unfortunately blown to pieces the details as to his fate might perhaps interfere with your appetite but let me at least assure you my dear marguerite herr freudenberg continued that such a death is entirely painless i regret the necessity for such means but the man had his chance i regret also the fate of the other poor people who lost their lives unfortunately it was necessary to remove sir julien in such a way that no suspicion should be cast upon any one person the death of the concierge for instance was absolutely essential he was suspicious about some of my men who had been making inquiries  but it is horrible she gasped  little one he went on life is like that to succeed one has to cultivate indifference sir julien portel had many warnings he knew very well that if he persisted in writing those articles he was braving my defiance already he has done mischief enough the whole series would have undone the work of the last two years tonight herr freudenberg continued with a sigh of relief we may open the journal without apprehensions there are no more secrets disclosed no more of these marvelously written appeals to  herr freudenberg stopped short his eyebrows had drawn closer together he was gazing at the sheet which he held in his hand with more expression in his face than mademoiselle had ever seen there before  my god he muttered  she too bent forward she too saw the article with its heading a maker of toys  herr freudenberg waved her back line by line he read the article when he had finished his face was almost ghastly he drained his glass and called for the sommelier  serve more wine he ordered briefly  what is it that you have seen she asked  i was a fool not to have been prepared he answered there is another article in tonights paper but of course he would have sent it off beforebefore the explosion happened it is worse than the others he went on hoarsely thank heaven that man is out of the way i would give a million marks to be able to destroy every copy of this paper that was ever issued it is not fair fighting it is barbarous no longer can i hope for any privacy in this country you seeyou see marguerite he has written of me openly the toymaker from leipzigthat is what he has called me these two kendricks and he they saw through me from the first they knew what it was that i desired damn them  mademoiselle crossed herself instinctively once she had been religious  poor sir julien  herr freudenberg sighed  tomorrow night at any rate he said there will be no article we have made sure of that i pray to heaven that it may not be too late  she shuddered the service of dinner was resumed  put the paper away she begged dont let us think of it any more after all as you say he was warned nothing that one feels now can do any good give me some wine talk to me of other things  estermen came in to them presently herr freudenberg insisted upon his taking a chair once more he dismissed the waiters  all goes well estermen announced there is not an idea at headquarters as to the source of the explosion i have been round with the newspaper men  how is kendricks herr freudenberg asked  alive but barely conscious  it is a pity herr freudenberg said coldly kendricks is responsible for a good deal of the trouble did you see that tonights article is here  estermen nodded  he must have been a day ahead he explained it was probably a later one of the series upon which he was engaged when the thing occurred  this one will do sufficient harm herr freudenberg remarked grimly  estermen shrugged his shoulders  it is true and yet we have a great start public opinion is thoroughly unsettled even those who accepted the entente as the most brilliant piece of diplomacy of the generation are beginning to wonder what really has been gained by it if i were at berlin estermen continued with a covert glance up at his master now is the time i should choose tomorrow le grand journal will be silent tomorrow i should send a polite notification to the english government that owing to the unsettled condition of the country and the nervousness of certain german residents his imperial majesty has thought it wise to send a warship to agdar  the german subjects are a trifle hypothetical herr freudenberg muttered we had the utmost difficulty in persuading an exconvict to go out there  what does it matter estermen asked he is there he represents the glorious liberties of the fatherland millions have been spent before now for the blood of one man  marguerite sighed she was leaning back in her place watching the boughs of the lime trees swinging gently back and forth in the night breeze the cool moonlight outside refreshing in its contrast to the overlit and overheated auditorium of the musichall on the stage a revue was in full swing mademoiselle ixe glanced at it but seldom her eyes seemed to be always outside  tell me she demanded almost passionately why cannot one leave the world alone it is great enough and beautiful enough will germany be really the happier do you think if she triumphs against england it doesnt seem worth while life is so short the joy of living is so hard to grasp dont you think she added leaning towards her companion her beautiful eyes full of entreaty that for one night at least all thoughts of your country and of her destinies might pass away let us live in the world that amuses itself that takes the pleasures that grow ready to its hand whose arms are not rapacious and whose sword lies idle forget for a little time dear friend let us both forget  herr freudenberg smiled as he finished his wine  ah dear marguerite he said you preach the great philosophy we will try humbly to follow in your footsteps lead on and we will followup to the montmartre if you will or down to the rue royale what does it matter sweetheart so long as we are together  she shivered a little as his fingers touched hers although her eyes still besought him the vestiaire was standing by with her lace coat she rose slowly to her feet  to the rue royale she decided tonight i have no fancy for the montmartre     chapter xii   distressing news   mrs carraby advanced into the library of the great house in grosvenor square her husband had risen from his desk and was standing with his hands in his pockets upon the hearthrug his dress was as neat and correct as ever his hair as accurately parted his small moustache as effectually twirled yet there was a frown upon his face an expression of gloomy peevishness about his expression his wife stood and looked at him looked at him and thought  you are back early he said what is the matter you dont look radiantly happy i thought you were looking forward so much to this bazaar  i was she replied i am disappointed  he saw then that her silence was not a matter of indifference but of anger  whats wrong he asked quickly  her lips parted for a moment one saw that her teeth were firmly clenched there was a wicked light in her strangecolored eyes  it was that woman again she mutteredthe duchess  what about her carraby demanded shes bound to be civil to you now anyway  is she mrs carraby replied is she indeed well her civility this afternoon has been such that i shall have to give up my stall i cant stay there  what do you mean he demanded  nothing except that before everybody she once more cut me dead cut me wickedly mrs carraby declared you dont understand the tragedy of this to a woman you are not likely to she did it in such a way this time that there isnt a person worth knowing in london who isnt laughing about it at the present moment  beast of a woman he muttered  mrs carraby came a little further into the room she sank into an easychair and sat there her hands were tightly clenched her face was hard and cold her tone icy yet one felt that underneath a tempest was raging  you know algernon she went on we had some hard times when you first began to make your way a little when we first took this house even things werent altogether easy americans can come from nowhere do the most outrageous things in the world and take london by storm london on the other hand is cruel to english people who have only their money she was cruel to us algernon but with all the snubs and all the difficulties i ever had nothing has ever happened to me like today  youll get over it  get over it she repeated yes but i thought that that sort of thing was at an end i thought that when you were a cabinet minister no one would dare to treat me as though i were a social nobody  you must remember that the duchess has a special reason he reminded her i suppose its that portel affair  yes mrs carraby agreed it is the portel affair  they were both silent there wasnt much to be said for the moment  have you heard he inquired presently whether lady anne is with him in paris  no she replied somehow or other people dont seem to talk scandal about lady anne they say that she is staying for a time with an old friend there algernon  yes  is it true that you are doing so badly at the foreign office she asked bluntly  a little flush mounted almost to his forehead  i have had the devils own luck he muttered  i cant take up a newspaper she continued bitterly without finding it full of abuse of you they say that during six weeks the entente cordiale has vanished they say that you have lost the friendship of france that she trusts us no longer and that germanys tone becomes more threatening and more bullying every day solely on account of your weakness  we cant afford to risk a war carraby explained i am a radical minister i have represented a radical constituency ever since i came into parliament what the devil should i have to say to my people if within a couple of months of taking office we were plunged into war  i do not pretend mrs carraby remarked to be an active politician but i have heard it said that the best way to avoid war is to show that you are not afraid of it they say that that is where sir julien portel was so splendid do you know that the leading article of one of your own papers this morning declares that germany would never have dared to have said so much to us if she had not known that she had only a puppet to deal with in the cabinet you know what all the other papers are hinting at is it true algernon that you gave two hundred thousand pounds to the party  whether it is true or not carraby retorted it makes no difference i wanted this post wanted it for your sake as much as my own and i wish to heaven that it was at the bottom of the sea id resign tomorrow if i could do so with dignity i cant now of course every one would say i was chucked to make things worse he went on savagely there come these infernal letters of portels  mrs carraby raised her eyebrows  why ive heard it said that those letters are the one hope this country has i have heard it said that but for those letters france and england would be as far apart today as they ever were i heard it said only this afternoon that those letters were our only hope of peace they were compared with the letters of junius whoever he was lord cardington told me himself that they were the most splendid political prose he had ever read in his life  that may be true enough carraby growled but they make it all the harder for me no doubt portel was a good minister no doubt he was doing very well in his post now he writes these letters every one remembers it every one is asking for him back again its hell mabel i wish to god wed let the man alone mrs carraby looked at her husband steadfastly she was a little taller than he she looked at him from his wellbrushed hair to the trim patent boots which adorned his small feet she looked at him and in those strangecolored eyes of hers were unmentionable things she turned away and walked to the window in imagination she was back again in juliens rooms she lived again through those few minutes if he had answered differently  outside in the square the newsboys were shouting she had stood before the window for some time when a familiar name fell upon her ears she turned around and touched the bell  what is it that you want her husband asked  a paper she replied  a very correct butler brought her the pall mall gazette a moment or two later she scanned it eagerly then it slipped from her shuddering fingers she turned upon her husband  he is dead she cried cant you read it death of an englishman in an explosion in paris mr kendricks a journalist seriously injured sir julien portel the excabinet ministerdead  she stood as though turned to stone then something in her husbands face seemed to bring her back to the present she turned upon him her face was suddenly lit with some strange quivering fire it was one of the moments of her life  you miserable worm she shrieked you dare to stand there and smile because a man is dead you  he tried to draw himself up tried to rebuke her he might as well have tried to stem a torrent  ive done my best to share your rotten scheming life she cried to help you in your dirty ways and to crawl up into the places we coveted once i saw the truth once a real man was kind to me and i saw the difference ive felt it in my heart ever since for your sake and my own for the sake of our rotten miserable ambitions i ruined him and sent him to his death he is dead do you hear you and i did it we are murderers and to think that i did it for you that yousuch a creature as youmight take his place  she threw up her hands high above her head there had been people who had doubted her good looks no one at that instant would have denied her beauty carrabys eyes were fixed upon her and he was afraid even when she had cast herself face downward upon the couch and lay with her head buried in her hands he dared not go near he stood there gazing at her across the room perhaps he too though his understanding was less tasted a little of the poison  in the splendid library of his palace in berlin the maker of toys leaned back in his chair after a long and successful days work there lingered upon his lips still the remnants of a grim smile which the dictation of a dispatch to london had just evoked his secretary gathered up his papers his master was disposed to be genial  my young friend he remarked those letters from paristhey were stopped just in time eh  just in time indeed highness the young man replied i have friends who write me from there they assure me that their effect was tremendous the cessation of them was indeed an act of providence  prince falkenbergs lips relaxed there were hard lines at the corners of his mouth yet if this were indeed a smile it was no pleasant thing to look upon  an act of providence without a doubt he exclaimedprovidence which watches always over the destinies of our dear fatherland  i shall bring you now highness the foreign papers the young man suggested  if you please his master replied i read them now thank heaven with an easier feeling  the young man retreated and reappeared in a few minutes with a pile of newspapers prince falkenberg rose and stretched himself lit a long black cigar and threw himself into a comfortable chair before the high window  your highness will take some coffee perhaps the young man asked  presently  the great minister unfolded his newspapers a reference in the english times perplexed him he turned to the journal which only a few days ago he had opened with almost a shudder he undid the wrapper shook it open and looked at it then suddenly he sat like a man turned to stone the cigar burnt out between his teeth his eyes were riveted upon that page the black letters seemed to have become lurid the sentences stabbed he was face to face with the impossible the paper which he read was dated on the preceding day before him was a fourth article dated from paris dated less than fortyeight hours ago signed julien portel the title of the article was the worlds great mischiefmaker he read on read from that first sentence to the last read the naked truth about himself saw his motives exposed his secret visits to paris derided his foibles photographed he saw himself the laughing stock of europe then he leaned over and rang the bell  neudheim he said let it be given out that i leave tonight for falkenberg as usual let the automobile be prepared for a long journey i leave in half an hour  the young man stared he had fancied that those flying visits of his masters for a time were to be discontinued  your highness goes south he asked  i drive all night prince falkenberg replied see that the count rudolf is prepared to accompany me quick give the orders     chapter xiii   estermens deathwarrant   in the untidy salon of his bachelor apartments in the boulevard maupassant estermen awaited the coming of his master in veritable fear and trembling in all his experience he had never been compelled to face a crisis such as this there had been small failures punished perhaps by a sarcastic word or biting sentence there had been no failure to compare with this one herr freudenberg deliberately and of his own free choice was accustomed to take huge risks when they came he accepted them but when they were not inevitable he as sedulously avoided them the wrecking of juliens apartments in the rue de montpelier was by far the most hazardous enterprise which had been attempted since the days of the toymakers first secret visits to paris half a dozen human beings had been done to death in a manner which invited and even challenged the attentions of the french police a terrible risk had been run and run in vain the blow had been struck at the very moment when its object was unattainable estermen shivered as he tried to imagine for himself the coming interview gone he feared was his life of pleasant luxury among the fleshpots and easy ways of paris his bachelor apartments occupied in name by him but of which the real tenant was his dreaded master and behind all this apprehension lurked another grisly and terrible fear for the twentieth time during the last few minutes he peered through the closely drawn venetianblind and his blood ran cold on the pavement opposite before the small table of a café a man was sittingthe same man for two days he had been therea gaunt and silent person with a wonderful trick of gazing away into space from the columns of his newspaper but estermen knew all about that he knew even the mans name he knew that he was one of the most persistent and successful of french detectives his name was jean charles and he had never known failure estermen looked at him through the blind and his pale face was ugly with fear  the moment arrived the long gray traveling car covered with dust swung around the corner and stopped below herr freudenberg was travelstained and almost unrecognizable in his motor clothes as he stepped out and passed into the block of apartments contrary to his usual custom he did not at once present himself before the man who awaited him in fear and trembling estermen heard him enter his own suite of rooms on the other side of the stairway and give a few brief orders then there was a peremptory knock at the door herr freudenberg was announced and entered  to the man who had been waiting for his sentence there was something terrible in the grim impassivity of prince falkenbergs features his face was set and white and sphinxlike only his eyes shone with a fierce unusual fire  what have you to say estermen he demanded  it was a miracle estermen faltered sir julien descended the stairs with the copy in his hand to speak to a caller for seventeen hours he had been in his rooms for the following seventeen hours he would probably have been there too for the intervening thirty seconds he happened to be upon the pavement it was a miracle  this was the end of all the specious story which estermen had gone over so often to himself yet he had done his cause no harm for the few sentences he spoke were the truth  you have discovered his present whereabouts his master demanded  estermen hesitated he feared that this was another blow which he was about to deal  he is at the house of madame christophor in the rue de st paul he faltered  his news however did not discompose prince falkenberg on the contrary he seemed if anything to find the intelligence agreeable  have you made any inquiries as to his condition  estermen shrugged his shoulders  the household of madame christophor he replied is as you know outside my sphere of influence it is besides incorruptible i myself am personally obnoxious to madame i could do nothing but wait for your coming  prince falkenberg stood with his hands behind him thinking he had relapsed into his former grim and impenetrable silence and while he waited the sweat stood out in beads upon estermens forehead greatly he feared that the worst was to come  have you anything else to say to me his master asked  nothing estermen replied with faltering lips  prince falkenbergs eyes were fierce orbs of light and his servant quailed before him  have you any reason to believe that the origin of the crime is suspected  it was the question which above all others he had dreaded estermen was a coward and a fluent liar the latter gift however availed him nothing he felt as though the nerves of his tongue were being controlled by some other agency against his will he told the truth  jean charles is watching these apartments  ah  prince falkenbergs single exclamation was the death sentence of his agent estermen knew it and his knees knocked one against the other  for six years prince falkenberg said after a moments pause you have lived an easy and a comfortable life estermena life i dare say spent among the gutter vices which would naturally appeal to a person of your temperament a life apart from the small services which i have required of you directed altogether by your own inclinations be thankful for those six years as you well know but for me they would have been spent either in prison or in the problematical future worlda matter entirely at the discretion of the judge who tried you it pleased me to rescue you for my own purpose you were possessed of a certain amount of low cunning and a complete absence of all ordinary human qualities a combination which made you a useful servant of my will my one condition has been always before you the present case demands your fulfillment of it  estermen began to tremble  the man may be there by accident he faltered there is no certainty as yet that i am even suspected imim horribly afraid to die he added with an ugly little laugh  so are most men of your kidney prince falkenberg replied composedly nevertheless die you must and tonight write your confession make it clear that one of the victims was your personal enemy ill dictate it if you like  i can do it myself estermen muttered let melet me write the confession first and then make an attempt to escape he pleaded if i am taken the confession shall be found upon me it will make no difference let me have a chance i know the secret places of the city i have friends who might help me to escape  prince falkenberg watched his agent for a moment in contemptuous curiosity estermen was walking restlessly up and down the few feet of carpet his fingers and the muscles of his face twitching his words had come with difficulty as though he had suddenly developed an impediment in his speech his sallow complexion had become yellow his carefully waxed moustache was drooping a speck of saliva was issuing from his lips  the request which you make to me prince falkenberg replied i absolutely refuse i know you and your cowardly temperament too well to allow you to come alive into the hands of the french police  you value your own life highly enough estermen snarled  it is not so prince falkenberg asserted if i had ever valued my own life highly there would have been no herr freudenberg and if the whole history of herr freudenberg is discovered i follow you my friend post haste if i seem to be taking any pains to hold my own remember that mine is a life which is valuable to the fatherland you have been and you are only a feeder at the troughs one more or less such as you in the world makes just the difference of a speck of dustthat is all  estermen shrank cowering into his seat  id rather livein torturein prison or in chainsanywhere he gasped i cant think of death  prince falkenberg was becoming impatient  my dear estermen he exclaimed what prison do you suppose remains open for the murderer of seven men you shrink from death yet let me assure you that the guillotine with the certain prospect of it before you day after day through a long trial is no pleasant outlet from the world for a sybarite be a philosopher go and die as you have lived write your confession summon your dearest friend by telephone give a little supperyoull have plenty of timebut see that the affair is over before midnight this is my advice to you estermen these are also my orders my final orders if i find you alive when i return or the confession unwritten i will show you how death may be made more horrible than anything you have yet conceived  prince falkenberg turned on his heel and left the apartment estermen remained for several moments shrinking back in the chair upon which he had collapsed then he rose and with trembling footsteps stole to the window peering out from behind the blind the man at the café opposite was still there     chapter xiv   sanctuary   this afternoon madame christophor declared looking thoughtfully at julien i am going to send you a new secretary  he turned a little eagerly in his easychair  lady anne he exclaimed  are you glad she asked  julien hesitated his eyes sought his companions face she was seated at the small writingtable drawn up close to his side her head resting upon her left hand the pen in her right fingers sketching idle figures at the bottom of the sheet which she had just written she was wearing a dress of strangecolored muslin a shade between gray and silver but from underneath came a shimmer of blue and there were turquoises about her neck her large soft eyes were fixed steadfastly upon his there was a sort of question in them which he seemed to have surprised there more than once during the last few days a sudden uneasiness seized him his brain was crowded with unwilling fancies there were without doubt symptoms of coquetry in her appearance he had spoken of blue as the one sublime color as she leaned a little back in her chair resting from her labors he could scarcely help noticing the blue silk stockings and suède shoes which matched the hidden color of her skirt the ribbon which gleamed from the dusky masses of her hair madame christophor was always a very beautiful and a very elegant woman and it seemed to have pleased her during these last few days to appear at her best julien gripped for a moment at his bandaged arm  you are in pain you would like me to change the bandage she suggested almost eagerly  not yet he replied it is still quite comfortable  she looked at him thoughtfully  you have the air of wanting something she remarked is there anything that displeases you  displeases me if you knew how strange that sounded he exclaimed i do not think that any one ever lived with such luxury or was treated with so much kindness as i during the last few days you make every second perfect  madame christophor sighed almost as julien finished his speech he regretted its conclusion madame christophor on the other hand although she sighed seemed vaguely content  you see the fates against whom you have so great a grievance have done something to atone she declared no doubt you hated to leave your work to come and speak to me in the street that afternoon no doubt your redheaded journalist friend hated me also yet if you had not come if my automobile had been detained a few minutes on the wayah it is terrible indeed to think what might not have happened  she shivered a moment later she raised her eyes and continued  i think she said you must abandon a little of your hostility against my sex it was a woman who worked this mischief in your life and a woman who was fortunate enough to save it i think you can almost cry quits with us sir julien  he smiled he was struggling to lead back their conversation to a lighter level a certain change in this womans tone and manner a change which was reflected even in her appearance disturbed him painfully  the balance is already on my side dear hostess he assured her you have left me an eternal debtor to your sex i shall never again indulge in generalities or wholesale condemnation it is after all foolish but tell me why you are sending lady anne to help me today  she watched for any trace of disappointment in his tone there was none on the contrary his mention of lady anne was accompanied by a slight eagerness which puzzled her  i have a few social duties to attend to she explained a little vaguely lady anne is quite efficient i like her handwriting too it is like herselfcleancut legible there are no hidden pools about lady anne  yet he said a woman always keeps some part of herself concealed  you think that lady anne too has her secret madame christophor asked raising her eyes  i think that if she has she is quite capable of keeping it he replied  there was a knock at the door lady anne entered she came a few yards into the room with a slight smile upon her lips and nodded pleasantly to julien in her slim stateliness the untroubled serenity of youth reflected in her smiling face she represented perfectly the other type of womanhood madame christophor rose deliberately to her feet for one swift moment she measured the things between them she herself was conscious of a greater intellectual maturity a more subtle quality in her looks a beauty less describable more exotic perhaps but also more provocative the arts of her sex were at her fingertips the small arts disdained by this welllooking and perfectly healthy young woman she turned her head quickly towards sir julien it was the idle impulse of the man or woman who plucks the petals from a flower julien was gazing steadfastly at lady anne madame christophor picked up her belongings and moved towards the door  be merciless today my friend she exclaimed pausing upon the thresholdvirulent if you will le jour was screaming at you last night jesen has lost his head a little or is it the lash of his master which he feels how can one tell  after tonight julien remarked with a smile who will read le jour i shall tell the story of the purchase of that paper by herr freudenberg french people will not love to think that the pen of jesen has been guided by the hand of germany  madame christophor made a little grimace  my friend she declared my house is i believe the safest spot in paris yet there are limits remember that you have become a celebrity there is an agitation in england to have you back at the foreign office all paris is divided upon the subject of your life or death and there are men here in the city who seek for you night and day with death in their hands my house is sanctuary but no one can write such things as you are writing and deem himself secure against any risk  he smiled at her confidently  yet you would not have me leave out one single line you would not have me lower the torch for one second you suggest cautionyou who havent the word fear in your vocabulary it is your house not mine there are more bombs to be bought in paris yet tell me would you have me spare a single word of the truth  she flashed back her answer across the room for the moment she forgot lady anne they two were on another plane  not one word she assured him with soft yet vibrant earnestness i would have you write the truth in letters of fire upon the clouds for all paris to see you have a message see that it goes out  madame christophor closed the door softly behind her julien remained looking at the spot from which she had disappeared then he drew a little breath  she is wonderful he muttered  lady anne took up her pen she avoided looking at him  let us begin she said  they wrote for hours julien was in the mood for this final and fierce attack upon le jour and all the powers that stood behind it he held up falkenberg to derisionthe charlatan of modern politics the puck of berlin whose one sincerity was his hatred for england and one capacity the giant capacity for mischief he wound up his article with a scathing and personal denunciation of falkenberg and a splendidly worded appeal to the french nation not for one moment to be deceived as to the character of this tireless and ambitious schemer after his countrys welfare all the time anne took down his words in fluent and flowing writing when at last he had finished he looked at the sheets which surrounded her with something like amazement  why what a pig ive been anne he exclaimed glancing from the table to the clock you must have been writing for nearly three hours  she was busy picking up the sheets  quite i should say she answered but i loved it now i am going to ring for tea and afterwards you must read it through we might get the manuscript down to the office tonight  i shall need you when i read it through he reminded her there will be corrections  either madame christophor or i will be here she replied madame christophor may have some other work for me  he looked at her curiously  even you are different he murmured  tell me at once what you mean she begged  i wish i knew he confessed to tell you the truth anne a curious feeling of detachment seems to have come over meduring the last few days especially it is such a short time since i was living the ordinary sort of mechanical life in london engaged to be married to you and my doings day by day all mapped outa life interesting of course but without any real variation and now here i am hanging on to life by the thin edge of nothing writing such things as i should never have dared to have said from my seat in the house practically an adventurer do you wonder that sometimes i am not quite sure that it isnt all a nightmare i am actually hiding here in paris from assassinsin paris the most civilized city in the worldthe guest of a woman whose acquaintance i made only because a little manicurist in soho insisted upon it and you anne are here by my side a professional secretary the friend of a milliner more intimate and on better terms with me than you were in the days when we were engaged to be married what has happened to us anne how did we get here  she laughed at him tolerantly  weve come a little into our own i suppose she remarked as for me i feel a different woman since i stepped out of the madetoorder world and youwell dont be angry but youre not nearly so much of a prig are you julien youre less starched and more human of course we are more companionable we are both more human  he nodded  i suppose that so far as i am concerned kendricks had something to do with ithe was always trying to make me look at things differently but it seems such a short time for such an absolute change  she was balancing her pen upon the inkpotkeeping her eyes turned from him  it isnt always a matter of time you know julien she said thoughtfully you were never really a prigi was never really a machine for wearing a readymade smile and a few smart frocks it took a shock to make us see things but neither of us remained wilfully blind youll be back in your world before long and a better man than ever  and you  i have hopes some day of becoming a perfect secretary she confessed if i fail i will at least make more bows than any one else in a day  he leaned towards her showing a sudden and dangerous forgetfulness of his bandaged arm  anne he said firmly if i go back you go back sometimes i think that i shall never regret anything that has happened if  the door was softly opened it was madame christophor who entered with a little pile of letters in her hand lady anne with slightly heightened color rose to her feet there was something in madame christophors eyes which was almost fiercely questioning  i am not disturbing you i trust she asked slowly i bring sir julien some letters  he caught up the sheets which lay by his side  i will not even look at them until i have corrected my article he declared  madame christophor settled herself composedly in an easychair  lady anne shall read it aloud she proposed calmly and i will assist in the corrections for the french edition i may be able to suggest the papers today are most amusing she continued the german press is almost unreadable no wonder that there is a price upon your head my friend  julien moved restlessly in his place  i have had the most extraordinary luck he remarked no other man naturally knew so much of anglogerman and anglofrench relations and instead of being at home in downing street and muzzled i happened to be here on the spot to run up against falkenberg discover his little schemes and with my own special knowledge to see through them at once no one else ever had such an opportunity  madame christophor smiled enigmatically she was looking thoughtfully across at her guest  it is not every opportunity in life she murmured which a man knows how to embrace     chapter xv   nearing a crisis   that night for the first time since his arrival in the house as a guest julien dined downstairs to his surprise when he presented himself in the smaller salon to which he had been directed he found the table laid for two only madame christophor who was standing on the threshold of the wintergarden opening out from the apartment read his expression and frowned  you expected lady anne to dine she asked bluntly  julien was taken a little aback  it seemed natural to expect her he admitted  madame christophor moved towards the bell but julien intercepted her he remembered all that he owed to this woman he was ashamed of his lack of tact  dear madame christophor he pleaded forgive me if for a moment i forgot how altered things are indeed it was not a matter of choice with me of course it will give me the greatest pleasure to dine têteàtête with you  he was perhaps a shade too impressive but madame christophor as all women who greatly desire to read in a mans words what they choose to find there hesitated finally with a shrug of the shoulders she turned away from the bell  three is such an impossible number she declared with wellassumed carelessness lady anne has her own salon adjoining her apartment she dines there always if i am without company i enjoy the rest of being alone she is very delightful in her own way your dear lady anne but she and i have not much in common come and see my roses  she led the way into the conservatory a domeshaped building with colored glass at the top fragrant almost faint with the perfume of roses and drooping exotics a little fountain was playing in the middle when the butler announced the service of dinner and they returned to take their places she left the door open  tonight she announced as they sat side by side at the small round table i am going to take advantage of the situation i am your hostess and you are an invalid it is my opportunity to talk are you a good listener sir julien  she had dropped her voice almost to a whisper those beautiful deepset eyes were challenging his she seemed to have made up her mind that for that night at any rate her beauty should be unquestioned she wore a dress of black net fitting very closely a wonderful background for her white skin and the ropes of pearls which were twined about her neck he had never seen her décolletée but he remembered reading in a ladies fashion paper that a famous sculptor had once declared her neck and bust to be the most beautiful in paris she had even added the slightest touch of color to her cheeks there was no longer any sign of the wrinkles at the sides of her eyes she read the half ingenuous half unwilling admiration in his face and she laughed at him  ah my friend she murmured i can see that you object to the rôle of listener very well then you shall talk you shall tell me of your life in england you shall tell me what dreams have come to you for the days when once more you shall help to shape the destinies of your nation tell me how you mean to live shall you be againwhat was it lady anne thought youa prig  i am like many other and more famous men he remarked i have learned much in adversity  i read the english papers she continued presently i have also a large correspondence do you know that there is nearly a rebellion in your party questions have been asked about you in the house both sides want you back there is a feeling that you were allowed to go much too easily that the indiscretion of which you were guilty was a trifle this man carraby is what you calla cad that does not do in the high places nationality cannot conceal a lack of breeding  i have thought over many things julien admitted if the way is made clear for me i shall go back why not i believe that i can serve my country and it is the life for which i am best fitted carraby may have his good points but his ambitions have been a little too extensive he would have made a better mayor of the town where he was born  you are right she declared there is no place for such men in the great world you will go back it is written seei drink to englands future prime minister  she raised her glass which the butler had just filled with champagne she looked into his eyes as she drank and julien was conscious of a passing uneasiness she set the glass down empty her hand lay for a moment near his  you will go back she murmured you will forget the people whom you have met in your brief period of adversity will seem to you like shadows is it not so  he took her hand and raised it boldly to his lips  it will never be like that with you dear hostess he assured her there are things which one does not forget  she did not withdraw her hand its pressure upon his fingers was faint but insistent  do you remember when we first met she said softly how bitter we were against the otherseven at first against one another you had been betrayed by that unimportant woman and the whole sex was hateful to you i had just come from seeing the tragedy caused by a mans crass selfishness i too was wearing the fetters to me the whole of your sex seemed abominable you see she went on my marriage was a terrible disappointment i fancied that i was marrying a great man a genius an inspired statesman and i found myself allied to a political machine my wealthhave i told you i wonder that i am very wealthyhelped him for the rest i was a puppet by his side i lived in berlin for one year official life in berlin for an american woman even though she be princess von falkenberg is still intolerable the men were bad enough the women worse i could not breathe i was no part of my husbands life i was no part of any ones life the german women did not understand me my husbandoh he is very german in his heartonly laughed at my complaints he would have been perfectly willing to see me become as those othershausfrauen bearers of children a domestic article so we separateddivorce at that moment was impossible i came back to paris  you had no children julien asked  one boy she answered her eyes becoming very soft do not let us speak of him for a moment  the service of dinner continued outside the water from the fountain fell into the basin with a gentle monotonous sound the perfume of the roses stole through the open doorway one softlyshaded lamp had been lit but the rest of the lofty room remained in shadowy obscurity the light from that one lamp seemed to fall full upon madame christophors beautiful face  i loved my boy she went on it was part of my husbands cruelty to detach him from me he has the law on his side i may not even see rudolf very well i do my best to steel my heart i come here to live i have many friends but falkenberg is the only man to whom i have ever belonged and he has treated me as he would have treated one of those othershis companions for the moment i have occupied myself here in work of different sorts i have tried in my way to do good among women less happy even than i wherever i went i saw that every woman who has sinned every woman who is miserable every woman who has become a blot upon the earth is what she is by reason of mans selfishness can you wonder that i have grown a little bitter  i wonder at nothing in the woman who has been falkenbergs wife julien replied he seems to me the most unscrupulous person who ever breathed yet in his way he is marvelously attractive  he is she admitted i fell in love with him against my will directly my reason intervened the madness was over how old do you think i am sir julien  julien was a little startled  how old he repeated  a foolish question of course she continued how could you be honest i am twentynine years old i believe that i am the richest woman in paris i am tired of being called brilliant and cynical of showing fortunehunters to the door of living my life in loneliness falkenberg has sworn that if i take any steps to make a divorce possible i shall never see my boy again i have not seen him as it is for nearly two years the threat is losing its terrors you are listening my friend  of course  she turned to the butler the other servants had already left the room  bring coffee into the wintergarden she ordered come sir julien  she lit a cigarette and threw it away almost immediately her eyes were gleaming like stars she laid her fingers upon his arm as they passed out into the perfumed air of the conservatory and he seemed to feel some touch of the fire that was burning in her veins she swayed a little towards him the color in her cheeks was brilliant her bosom was rising and falling quickly she was splendidly handsome nerved up to great things a woman inspired by a purpose julien was afraid he too felt something of the excitement of the moment but his brain seemed numbed there was nothing he could say she threw herself back into a low chair and drew him down to her side with her other hand she caught hold of a cluster of pink roses and pressed their cool blossoms to her cheek  sir julien she murmured i have looked so steadfastly into life i have striven so hard to find a place there i have something to give i do not come emptyhanded i can place offerings upon the altar of the great god i have myself my brains such as they are and the golden key which unlocks the wonderful doors can you wonder that i ask for something in return i have stood in the marketplace of life i have passed down between the stalls and i am humiliated there is no life there is no career upon this world for a woman it is a strange doctrine perhaps to preach in these days but i have searched and i know it to be the truth nature meant woman for man and if she rebels there is no seat for her alone among the mighty places alone i can win none of the things i desire you see i talk to you like this nakedly because we are of the order of those who understand you very nearly married a dukes daughter and became a middleclass politician dont do it dont think of it any more julien you were meant for the great places and i thinki thinkthat i was meant to hold the torch to light you there  madame christophor  she started at his tone in the splendid arrogance of her assured position her brilliant gifts her almost inspired individuality failure had never occurred to her even now she refused to read the message in his set face  you feel perhaps she went on leaning towards him that you are pledged to lady anne dear sir julien rub your eyes i want you to seeall the way to the skies lady anne is a sweet girl who will look nice at the head of any ones table she will read the papers and take an intelligent interest in her husbands work and ask him trite and obvious questions to prove that she understands all about it she will give you phenacetin when you have a headache she will fill your house with the right sort of people she will be very amiable and very satisfied shell always read the debates and shell sit up for you at night in a pretty dressinggown and all the time the wall will grow brick by brick and you will look up to the skies and find them empty and listen for the music and hear none and a web will be spun about your heart and your brain will be clogged and the fine thoughts will go and youll never be anything but a successful politician you know very well that all the paths to the great pit of unhappiness are crowded with men who have been successful in their profession  she swayed even closer towards him her head a little thrown back her eyes inviting him he scrambled to his feet still she held out her hands  wont you trust me she begged believe me that i know the way into the great places julien  listen he cried hoarsely you have offered me everything except your love thank heaven you did not offer me that i love lady anne  everything except my love she exclaimed with the first note of trouble in her tone everything except my love are you mad  i love lady anne he repeated setting his teeth  they stood facing one another she tore a handful of the blossoms from a syringa tree and commenced crushing them in her fingers the sound of footsteps scarcely disturbed her the butler appeared followed by lady anne the former excused himself with a grave face  madame he announced the prince von falkenberg is here  madame christophor turned slowly around  the prince von falkenberg where  in the waitingroom madame  she moved away she did not glance towards julien  i come she announced   lady anne had some letters in her hand which she handed to julien he threw them hastily aside and drew her suddenly into his arms and into the shadow of the giant palm  anne he pleaded not because of your mother not because you would make me a suitable wife but because i love you will you marry me  he felt her relax in his arms  julien she murmured  i didnt finish the sentence he went ontomorrow at the embassy  absurd  its the only way he insisted confidently we couldnt be married in london all the tribe of harbord would come and boo and it would save no end of gossip and bother when we got back annei love you very much and i want you just as soon as i can get you  of course if you put it like that she said softly  well  this is the only frock i have  the rue de la paix is at our gates he reminded her  be sensible she begged you cant show yourself about paris something terrible will happen  not it he replied confidently its too late  his arm crept a little further around her waist he drew her even further back among the drooping palms  i think that i like this better than the last time you asked me she whispered     chapter xvi   falkenbergs last effort   madame prince falkenberg declared with a formal bow i owe you a thousand apologies for this visit  madame christophor looked at him across the room and in her eyes there was no welcome nor any angeronly surprise  you break she reminded him the word of a prince  falkenberg smiled icily  there are cataclysms in life he said whirlpools into which one may sometimes be drawn ones will is overborne i myself am in that unfortunate position  madame christophor looked steadfastly at her visitor was it her fancy or was he really growing older this man of iron the story of the last few weeks was written into his face there were shadows under his eyes a deep line across his forehead  since you are here be seated she invited sinking herself wearily into a chair tell me as quickly as you can what has brought you  portel has brought me falkenberg answered grimly they tell me that he has taken shelter under the shadow of your petticoats  shelter from your assassins  precisely falkenberg admitted  i do not admire your methods madame christophor remarked they seem to me not only brutal but clumsy you killed seven men and injured several others to no purpose  madame falkenberg declared to secure the death of that man i would have destroyed a whole quarter of paris and every person in it  madame christophor shivered  thorough as usual my dear prince she murmured nevertheless i find such statements loathsome we should have outlived the days of barbarity i do not understand men who deal in such fashion with their enemies  falkenberg frowned  there is something between us greater than personal enmity he retorted fiercely my personal enemy i would deal with in such a manner as i make no doubt would commend itself to your scruples julien portel is more than that he is the enemy of my country upon him therefore i shall have no mercy  i will not argue with you she replied there is a plainer issue before us in passing my threshold you have broken your word of honor what do you want  i want julien portel  madame christophor shrugged her shoulders  you have wanted him for some little time  never so badly as at this instant falkenberg declared bitterly he has set all europe in a ferment with those infernal letters he knows too much he knows whence came the money which bought le jour he knows every detail of my campaign here  there are surely others she objected who must have guessed  but there was no one else he interrupted who had the special knowledge which portel has he came from the foreign office with the records of the last two years in his mind at berlin he and i crossed swords he is the only englishman who has ever caused me a moments uneasiness  are you sure she asked that your campaign here has been a wise one  the wisdom of solomon he replied grimly can be made to look like folly by the accident of failure there is no doubt as to its wisdom no one has studied these matters as i have studied them no one has seen the truth more clearly an alliance between england and america is a matter of a few years only and when it comes the progress of germany is set back for a generation the one absolute necessity before me was to cut the bonds between england and france and to settle with england alone and quicklydiplomatically if possible by force of arms as a last resource we dont seek war henriette we are not really a bloodthirsty nation we seek territory we need new landsfruitful lands trade the command of the seas if we cannot get what we want by peaceful means then it must be war england for the present is weakly governed she is in the throes of labor troubles her political parties are illbalanced there is a puppet at the foreign office now is the time to strike  is it wise to tell me your secrets she inquired coldly i have no sympathy for you or your country  i have a bargain to strike with you and you must understand he answered twentyfour hours ago we dispatched a gunboat to a certain neutral port which comes under the influence of england we paid a german to go there and send us word that he was in danger we have sent an intimation to the french and english governments to england it is an insult i have taken the chance that france has had enough of this entente now you understand why i must have julien portel before they can get him back to the foreign office before he can do more mischief a strong man in downing street at this juncture might upset everything  i understand well enough why you need julien portel she admitted i am still in the dark however as to why you imagine that i shall give him up  because i am going to buy him from you falkenberg asserted  she glanced across the room at him half curiously half scornfully  buy him you  exactly he replied you smile because you do not understand i offer you a dispensation for your divorce and your son  a little tremor seemed to pass through her whole frame for a moment she closed her eyes then she sprang to her feet and stood quivering before him  this is one of your traps she exclaimed you dont mean it  to prove that i do he insisted i have brought rudolf with me to paris he can be in your arms in a few minutes look into the street if you will  she crossed the room hastily and lifted the curtain a low cry broke from her lips in the tonneau of the great touring car outside a little boy was lying back amongst the cushions asleep  he is tired falkenberg said slowly with his eyes fixed upon the woman he has come all the way from berlin without an hours rest am i to take him back tomorrow it is for you to decide  madame christophor turned toward the door falkenberg barred the way  not yet he declared do you accept my terms  but he is hungry she cried i can see that he is hungry and he is so palelet me fetch him in  of course he is hungry his father agreed he has also been asking me questions about you all the way he believes that he is going to see you i too believe that you consent  tell me exactly what it is that you require she demanded  take me to portel he answered swiftly inform him that you cannot any longer permit him the shelter of your roof  she sat down and began to laugh softly but in unnatural fashion falkenberg watched her with grim curiosity  and then she inquired  he hesitated  i have made some plans he said slowly if he passes outside your doors tonight he will write no more articles  but the whole of the english press is clamoring for his return to power there will be no need for his penhe will take up his old position  precisely falkenberg assented it is not my intention that he shall return to that position  madame christophor sat with her eyes fixed upon the wall then she began to laugh once more in the same strange manner falkenberg was curious  you find my intentions amusing he asked  i find the situation amusing she replied half an hour ago i offered sir julien portel what is left of my life  falkenberg stood perfectly still watching her closely then his eyes filled with a sudden bright light  you he exclaimed youprincess von falkenbergoffered yourself to this man and were refused  you are indeed a genius she admitted i was refused  there was a brief silence falkenberg waited madame christophor remained silent her attitude puzzled him a little he was afraid to speak for fear of striking the wrong note nevertheless the onus of speech was thrust upon him  madame he said at last i anticipate your reply this man has put an intolerable insult upon you while he lives you could never forget it there are some privileges still belonging to me i claim the right of avenging that affront  it comes convenientlythe affront she remarked through her clenched teeth  conveniently or not the affront exists he cried you cannot refuse me now you would not have him go unpunished  i am not sure that he was to blame  not to blame falkenberg repeated with emphasis would you have me believe that you threw yourself at his head unasked without encouragementyou the proudest woman in france one does not believe such folly  nevertheless it is the truth madame christophor declared  falkenberg smiled incredulously but he said nothing madame christophor had found her way once more to the window she stood there looking down into the car the boy was still asleep she gripped the windowcurtains with both her hands he was so pale so tired and how he had grown  i give you even his heritage falkenberg promised make of him a frenchman or an american if you will he is your own son take him i give my firstborn for my country you will not refuse what i offer  madame christophor made no answer falkenberg however saw the longing in her face it was enough he suddenly changed his tactics  this julien portel he saidit is another woman he prefers  he saw her bosom heave the storm against which she had been struggling all the time seemed on the point of bursting the hot blood was singing in her ears her eyes were aflame she crossed the room and rang the bell falkenberg was content to wait he felt that he had won the butler appeared almost immediately  you will conduct the prince von falkenberg into the wintergarden she directed he desires to speak to sir julien portel  and you falkenberg asked turning towards her  a swift gesture showed him her disordered countenance it was reasonable  i follow she announced     chapter xvii   defeat for falkenberg   among the palms of madame christophors conservatory julien and lady anne were living through a brief new chapter of their history the wonderful thing had come to them it was amazingalmost unrealizable a new glamor enveloped the merest trifles they spoke in halting sentences they were at times almost incoherent the marvel of it was so great  lady anne was the first to hear the sound of approaching footsteps she listened it was not madame christophor who returned she laid her hand upon juliens arm  it is jean the butler who comes she whispered he conducts some one  on the threshold of the wintergarden only a short distance away they heard jeans voice  monsieur le prince will find sir julien portel a few steps further on  monsieur le prince anne faltered with whitening face julien what does it mean  julien rose to his feet the footsteps were close at hand now upon the tessellated pavement then through the drooping palm boughs they saw him julien was standing tense and prepared his uninjured arm was ready to strike falkenberg was there  you julien exclaimed well  the iron prince had disappeared it was herr freudenberg maker of toys suave genial fascinating who bowed before them  why so surprised sir julien he asked you forget that this is my wifes house the little difficulties which have existed between us have today i am happy to say been removed i have restored her son to madame la princesse we are reunited henceforth my wishes are the wishes also of madame you will present me it is lady anne clonarty i believe  they were both bewildered for the moment falkenberg was supreme he bowed low upon the hesitating words of introduction  dear lady anne he murmured do not be prejudiced against me sir julien believes that i am his enemy i am not i am his sincere and heartfelt admirer  lady annes eyebrows were slowly raised  you have surely she remarked a strange manner of showing such sentiments  falkenberg smiled whimsically he had the expression of a penitent boy who has misbehaved  it is at least consistent he pleaded i admire sir juliens talents to such an extent that i am perhaps a trifle too anxious that he should not use them against my country  you havent forced your way in here to bandy phrases julien asserted a little harshly what is it that you want  you falkenberg answered softly you my friend madame la princessemy wife whom you have known as madame christophorfinds it impossible against my wishes to offer you any longer the shelter of her roof i am here to escort you if you will to your new quartersto follow you if i cannot reconcile you to my company  julien was startled lady anne incredulous  i do not believe the former declared that madame christophor intends any such act of inhospitality  as to that falkenberg replied pleasantly my wife will be here herself in a few moments you shall hear what she has to say from her own lips you must remember that i have paid a price i have given up the guardianship of my son you yourself he continued looking steadfastly at julien may know if any other cause exists likely to have influenced my wife in granting my request  julien set his teeth but he did not flinch  what is it that you want with me prince falkenberg he demanded another brutal attempt at massacre i owe you this he added raising his bandaged arm do you imagine that you can continue to use the methods of other generations with impunity the thing is absurd there are too many who know already the secret of herr freudenberg maker of toys there are too many who will know also before long the secret of the explosion in the rue de montpelier  falkenberg nodded gravely  i understand he admitted one moves of course always with the knife at ones heart yet until now i personally am safe another man dies tonight even as we talk here and confesses himself guilty of the rue de montpelier affair but let that pass we have crossed swords sir julien and i frankly admit although i have gained my end tonight that i am worsted the money i spent to purchase le jour has been thrown away the months of careful intrigue the sacrifices and efforts i have made to destroy the entente have been rendered almost futile by your diabolical pen very well for what you have done i will accept defeati will accept defeat without malice but there is the future  what of it julien asked  i do not intend falkenberg declared in a low firm tone to have you back a member of any english government i prefer carraby and such as he  you flatter me julien remarked grimly  not in the least falkenberg objected you know the position as well as i the political party of which you are a member is in power for a long time you have got hold of the middle class youve bought the irish vote youve bought labor in the ranks of your party there isnt a man whom i fearonly you i will not have you go back  but as it happens julien announced i am going back i have heard from england this evening your friend carraby is resigning  falkenberg shook his head he remained calm but there was an ominous flash in his eyes  you would make a mistake he asserted no one ever goes backsuccessfully do i not knowi who am twenty years your senior i who have felt my way into all the corners and crevices of life listen to me please  he drew a chair towards them and sat down crossing his knees and looking towards them both in friendly fashion  sir julien he said and you my dear young lady your entire future depends upon this little conversation can you not put it out of your minds for a few moments that i am the dangerous falkenberg the mischiefmaker the ogre of all respectable britons can you not remember only that i am a wellmeaning not unkindly old gentleman who has some good advice to offer you at least will listen to me lady anne do i look like an assassin by choice do i seem like the sort of person to indulge in these dangerous exercises for mere amusement you are both young you have both your lives before you why do you sir julien voluntarily put the yoke about your neck why do you my gracious young lady suffer the man with whom your life is to be linked to deliver himself over voluntarily into a state of bondage politics lose all glamor to those who have dwelt within the walls sir julien has dwelt there and so have i he knows in his heart whether it is worth while one lives always amidst a clamor of evil tongues a pestilent trail of poisonous suspicions one gives up ones life to be flouted and misunderstood to be accused of evil motives and every imaginable crime when it is all over when one has time to think of all that one has missed one feels that all one has done could have been done just as well by the next man in the street that is the end of it and against all that you two have the world before you you can be richvery rich indeed you can make an idyll of this love of yours you can travel around the world in your own yacht you can visit all strange countries you can wander where you will and all the time affairs in the world will go on very much the same as if you had stayed and given the best hours of your life to the dusty treadmill i am an old man lady anne and i have an evil name in your country they call me greedy subtle and ambitious i may be all these things but let me assure you that if i had my time over again my master could find another servant and my country another toiler there are fairer flowers in life to be plucked than any which can be reached from the high places in downing street or berlin let me at least lady anne make sure of your support mind i am not threatening nowi plead  lady anne looked at him gravely  sir julien she declared will answer you for himself  but i want your own decision falkenberg insisted i want you to see the truth as i see it i want you to tell me that you agree with me  she shook her head  but i do not she exclaimed to me you have spoken like a sophist one does not gain happiness by seeking it you may be honest in some part of what you sayi cannot tell only i think that you have mistaken sir juliens ideasand mine  you disappoint me falkenberg murmured  sir julien smiled  not very much i think he said you always did believe in trying the hundredth chance let us come back to the reasonable part of our discussion do you propose then that i should leave this house at this moment with you  my car is entirely at your service falkenberg suggested  do i seem to you so ingenuous julien inquired i am wondering what resources are open to me i might propose to lady anne here that she telephone for the gendarmes why should i not have an escort to take me to an hotel  falkenberg shrugged his shoulders  i like the idea he admitted by all means do as you say only do me the favor to remember that this is my wifes house and with her authority i request that you leave it immediately  i wonder julien asked what may be in store for mewhat pleasant schemes you have hatched  falkenberg shrugged his shoulders  listen he saidif you listen attentively you will hear the murmur of paris calling you back almost you can hear the falling of a thousand feet upon the pavements of the boulevards the voice of life you may find an asylum there who can tell  they heard the soft swirl of a womans gown passing over the marble floor they all turned it was madame christophor who stood there  still here she remarked  julien frowned  it is not my intention to linger he assured her prince von falkenberg has given me your message i am prepared to go  lady anne moved hastily forward  do you know she cried that they will kill him do you know that this man she added pointing to falkenberg has admitted it would you dare to send him out to be butchered in the streets  the young lady exaggerates falkenberg protested this is a perfectly respectable neighborhood what possible harm can come to an english gentleman besides i have offered him if he will the protection of my car  madame christophor sighed she waved back sir julien  alas she exclaimed there has been a slight misunderstanding  she touched a bell which stood on the table by her side almost immediately a tall palefaced man in dark clothes appeared followed by jean the butler  my dear prince she said to her husband i do assure you that you need have no special anxiety let me present to you monsieur bourgan of the french detective service monsieur bourganthe prince von falkenbergsir julien portel  monsieur bourgan saluted the two men looked at himas yet they scarcely understood  i suppose madame christophor continued that i am a somewhat nervous woman but you see i can always plead the privilege of my sex i was delighted to have sir julien here with me but in a sense it was a responsibility it occurred to me then to send a message to the minister of the police who happens to be a great friend of mine and at his suggestion monsieur bourgan here who is as i have no doubt you both well know very distinguished in the service has taken up his residence in my house he has occupied as a matter of fact the next room to sir juliens forgive me she added smiling at them all if i kept this little matter secret but i know that men hate a fuss i propose dear prince she added turning to her husband that monsieur bourgan accompanies you to your rooms you need not fear then any molestation  there was an absolute silence it was broken at last by the prince von falkenberg  i must confess he said slowly that i do not altogether understand  madame christophor faced him with a faint smile upon her lips the smile itself told him all that he desired to know  but my dear prince she declared it is my anxiety for your safety which induces me to propose this only a few minutes ago you were telling me that you feared that you had become an extremely unpopular person in paris and that the very streets were not safe for you under the circumstances one can scarcely wonder at it the french government however is above all small feelings a private citizen in paris even though he be an enemy of france is a person to be respected the protection of the detective force of paris is at your service monsieur bourgan you will do me the great favor of conducting my husband to his rooms afterwards you will return here to continue your watch over sir julien  i am entirely at your command madame monsieur bourgan replied  falkenberg hesitated for one single moment he seemed to be measuring the distance between julien and himself under the pretense of picking up a match monsieur bourgan was almost between them falkenberg laughed softly then most graciously he made his adieux  lady anne he said bowing one is permitted to wish you every happiness sir julien let me assure you he continued that it has been a pleasure to renew our acquaintance dear henriette he added this care for my safety touches me and the boy  he is safe in my room she assured him it is absurd of me no doubt but i have turned the key upon him and placed a footman outside the door take care of yourself dear rudolf monsieur bourgan i know will watch over you well yet you are one of those who take risks always  falkenberg raised her fingers to his lips  almost dear henriette he murmured you make me regret that i ever have to leave paris at all  she leaned a little towards him  i bear you no illwill rudolf she said softly take my advice leave paris quickly  his eyes held hers as though seeking for some meaning to her words she only shook her head he turned and followed jean monsieur bourgan brought up the rear madame christophor shrugged her shoulders  really she declared with a sigh life is becoming altogether too complicated never mind i have got rid of prince falkenberg for you sir julien between ourselves i think that he will receive a hint to leave paris and before very long listenthere goes his car  dear madame christophor lady anne whispered you are wonderful  madame christophor was already moving away  not really wonderful she replied only a little human i must go to my boy     chapter xviii   the one way out   estermen started up from his chair in the unlit room the figure of his master seemed to have assumed a portentous almost a threatening shape  whos that he cried out  falkenberg calmly turned on the electric light  still here my friend he remarked significantly  estermen began to tremble  there is plenty of time he faltered i am not sure about the man opposite it may be some one else he is watching  falkenberg walked to the window and stood there in the full glare of the light the man opposite was still sipping his eternal coffee he glanced casually at falkenberg and back at his paper  you fool the latter said to estermen cant you see that he is waiting only to draw the others in do you know that ii von falkenberg chancellor of germany have received what they are pleased to call a hint from the french minister of police that it would be advisable for me to leave paris this is your blundering estermen  not mine only the man muttered do you know that there are those who wait for you in your rooms  falkenberg turned away  stay here till i return he ordered  he turned the key of his own apartments and entered his servant hurried up to him  there waits for your highness he announced the baron von neudheim  falkenberg started  here he exclaimed  in his excellencys private apartment there waits also  falkenberg had already departed he opened the door of his room his secretary rose hastily to his feet  what do you here neudheim falkenberg demanded what has happened  excellency the young man replied there is trouble within half an hour of your leaving i had important news i dared not telegraph i have followed you i took a special train from the frontier  go on falkenberg said calmly it is something serious  indeed yes your excellency the baron continued it is concerning the agdar matter  falkenbergs face lit up  an ultimatum he exclaimed so much the better  baron von neudheim shook his head  for once i am afraid he said we have been trapped his excellency himself sent for me the reply from downing street has been received  well falkenberg interrupted impatiently  your excellency the reply to our note is exceedingly courteous it states that the unrest referred to had already been reported to the british government and a warship which left portsmouth under sealed orders some months ago was instructed to proceed to the port last week the note goes on to state that no intimation was given to germany as the british government was not aware that germany had any interests but it further contains an assurance that the welfare of all white men will receive equal attention falkenberg set his teeth  what battleship was sent he asked  the aida the young man replied slowlya firstclass cruiser twentysix thousand tons  falkenberg was silent for a moment his face had grown dark  and ours he muttered was a thirdrate gunboat who in all downing street could have planned a coup like this  it was sir julien portelhis last official action the baron answered the papers tomorrow will be full of this the press of germany and england and france have the whole story  which is to say falkenberg exclaimed that we are to be the laughingstock of europe anything else  there is an imperial summons commanding your presence at potsdam at once neudheim acknowledged reluctantly  i start for the frontier in a quarter of an hour falkenberg decided i shall drive to châlons and telegraph for a special train from there  you will let me accompany you the young man begged  falkenberg hesitated then he shook his head  no it is my wish that you return by train take a days holiday if you will you will be back in time  the young mans expression was clouded he was obviously disappointed  but excellency he pleaded there is trouble in berlin it is best indeed that i should be by your side  falkenberg held out his hand  my dear fritz he replied you will obey my orders as you always have done it is my wish that you return by the ordinary train tomorrow night  there is nothing i can dono message  nothing falkenberg interrupted look after yourself leave me now if you please  the young man moved reluctantly towards the door  excellency he protested i do not desire a days holiday things in berlin are bad let us talk together on our way north you have never yet known defeat we can plan our way through or fight it dont tell me to leave you dear master he wound up with a sudden change of tone there are still ways  falkenberg laid his hand upon the young mans shoulder  fritz he said my orders if you please remember that i never suffer them to be disputed goodbye  the young man left the room as he passed down the stairs he shivered falkenberg passed into an inner apartment already he had guessed who it was waiting for him mademoiselle rose to her feet with a little cry  at last she exclaimed dear maker of toys how long you have been how weary it has been to wait  she came into his arms he patted her head gently  dear little one  you are taking me to supper she begged  he shook his head her face fell the big tears were already in her eyes  but you are troubled she cried oh come and forget it all for a time isnt that what you told me once was my use in the worldthat i could chatter to you or sing or lead you through the light paths so that your brain could rest let me take you there dear one tonight if ever you have the look in your face you need rest come to me  he looked at her steadfastly looked at her feeling as one far away gazing down upon some strange element in life then a thought came to him  little one he whispered you are irresistible wait then it may be as you desire only after supper i pass on  and i with you she implored  he shook his head  wait here  once more he returned to estermens apartments estermen was still there smoking furiously the room was blue with tobacco smoke falkenberg regarded him with distaste  make yourself presentable man he ordered we sup in the montmartre and we leave in a few minutes  what i estermen exclaimed springing up  you and i and mademoiselle falkenberg told him i have made plans you may perhaps escapewho can tell  estermen with a little sob of relief hurried into his sleeping apartment soon they were all three in the big car gliding through the busy streets it was getting towards midnight and they took their place among the crowd of vehicles climbing the hill only wherever the street was broad enough they passed always ahead at the rat mort they came to a standstill falkenberg led the way up the narrow stairs greeted albert with both hands nodded amiably to the chef dorchestre the flower girl and the head waiter who crowded around him  for as many as choose to come he declared the round table the best supper in france it is a gala night albert serve us of your best mademoiselle will sing we are here to taste the joys of life  albert led the way  ah monsieur he said it is good indeed to hear your voice there is no one who comes here who enters more splendidly into the spirit of the place when you are here i know that it will be a joyful evening for all they catch it too those others he explained sometimes they come here stolid british they look around them they eat they drink they sit like stuffed animals then comes monsieurdear monsieur he talks gayly he laughs he waves salutes he drinks wine he makes friends the thing spreads it is the spiritthe real spirit behold even the dull once they catch it they enjoy  falkenberg took the cushioned seat in the corner close to his side was mademoiselle her hand already clasping his estermen gaunt redeyed still haggard with fear sat a few feet away  wine falkenberg ordered pommerybottles of it never mind if we cannot drink it let us look at it let us imagine the joys that come added to those we feel  already the wine was rushing into their glasses falkenberg raised his glass  to our last supper dear marguerite he whispered  she shivered all over she looked at him her face was suddenly strained  you jest  jest but is it not a night for jests he answered why not ah marguerite i take it back to our first supper let us say to ourselves that tonight we stand upon the threshold of life let us say to ourselves that never before have i seen how blue your eyes shine how sweet your mouth how soft your fingers how dear the thrill which passes from you to me close to me margueriteclose to me little one our first evening  dearest she whispered first or last there could never be another it is you who make my life it is you who when you go leave it desolate  he held her hand more tightly  ah little friend he murmured you spoil me with your sweet phrases you set the music playing in my heartthe witch music i think come we must speak to estermen he continued looking resolutely away from her we cannot have him sitting there glum a deathshead at our feast estermen drink man is this a funeral party wake up mademoiselle who dances there looks towards you why not you see she waves her hand you have waltzed with her before ask her to sit down with us i have ordered supper see mademoiselle approaches estermen more glasses waiter open more wine there is champagne here for everybody mademoiselle does us great honor permit me  the little dancing girl obeyed his invitation she sat by estermens side but she cast a longing glance at falkenberg their glasses were filled estermen drank quickly all the time looking about him with the furtive air of a whipped dog  tonight falkenberg cried as he lifted his glass i have but one commandbe joyful why not tonight i have marguerite by my side and youyou can choose from the world of marguerites there is nothing in life like thisthe hour of midnight the music of the moment the wine of the hour the woman we love drink estermen once more fix your thoughts upon the present mademoiselle looks around her she finds you dull she will seek for another admirer ah mademoiselle he added leaning across the table if the sweetest girl in paris were not here already by my side do you think that i would permit you to be for an instant the companion of a dumb admirer  mademoiselle laughed back into his eyes  if monsieurs friend were but as gallant as monsieur himself  he is depressed falkenberg declared but it passes behold another glass like that estermen drink till you feel it bubbling in your veins look at him now  falkenberg leaned back in his place and pressed his companions arm indeed the wine was working its magic the terror was passing from estermens face already he was becoming more natural  leave them alone falkenberg said softly he will have no relapse the wine is in his blood ah marguerite never did you seem so sweet to me as tonight when my face is set for the cold north have you joy in remembering little one have you sentiment enough for that  i have sentiment enough she whispered to suffer every time you leave me tonight i am afraid to let you go oh dearmy deartake me with you i have begged you before but tonight i beg you in a different manner i am afraid to be left alone i care not where or whatever the end of your journey may be take me with you dear one it is because i love that i ask this  he looked at her for a moment and there were wonderful things in his eyes  ah little girl he murmured you teach one so much one passes through life too often with ones eyes closed one finds the great things in strange places the rarest flowers even by the roadside drink your wine press my fingerslike that see it is the chef dorchestre who approaches you shall singsing to me little one  he motioned to the musician who with a smile of delight held up his hand to the orchestra mademoiselle hummed a few bars the man who listened nodded his head then he raised his violin he passed his bow across the strings with the touch of his fingers he drew from them a little melody mademoiselle assented her head was back against the wall her eyes half closed then she began to sing sang so that in a few moments the passionate words which streamed from her lips held the room breathless it was no ordinary music it was the love prayer of a woman starting in sadness passing on to passion ending in wild entreaty as she finished she turned her head towards her companion  you shall not go alone she cried and her words might well have been the text of her song  falkenberg shook his head  something gayer he beggedsomething more like the wine which foams in our glasses  she obeyed him after only a moments hesitation yet in the first few bars her song came to an abrupt end her voice choked she leaned suddenly forward in her place her face was hidden between her hands they all gazed at her curiously  nerves one declared  hysterics another echoed  it is the life they lead these women an american explained to a little party of guests they weep or they laugh always life with them quivers all the time they pass from one emotion to anotherthey seldom know which look it is over with her  it was over indeed she raised her head and sang sang ravishingly charmingly a gay lovesong falkenberg was the first to applaud her  tonight dear he murmured you are wonderful you sing from the heart your voice has feeling you bring to one the exquisite moments behold the supper arrives estermen has made friends now with his little danseuse sit closer to me dear these are the golden hours give me your hand look into my eyes drink with me how the minutes pass there is magic in this place  towards four oclock falkenberg and his companions came down the narrow stairs out into the morning a fine rain was falling the pavements were already wet falkenberg was still gay still laughing and talking behind a little companythe chef dorchestre the chief maître dhôtel the flower girlwondering at his generosity stood at the head of the stairs to bid him godspeed he gave a louis to the commissionaire and called for a special carriage he had almost to lift marguerite inside  dear child he said holding her hands here we must part for a timenot for so long perhaps who can tell it is a comfortable carriage this here is a handful of money for the fare it is of no use to me  he emptied his pockets into her lap as she sat there she made no effort to pick up the shower of gold and silver  what do you meanthat it is of no use to you  we drive for home he answered we shall need no money to take us there listen  he drew her face very close to his  when you arrive at your apartment he said you will find there a little packet from me be wise dear if chance will have it that we do not meet again very soon may it help you to take all out of life that you can find only sometimes when the heart is joyous when the wine flows and your feet are keeping time to the music of life think for a momentof one who dwells alas in a quieter country dear marguerite  he kissed her first upon the lips and then lightly on the forehead then gently he thrust away the arms which she had wound around his neck he waved to the coachman to drive off with a little shrug of the shoulders he took his own place in the great touring car estermen too clambered into the tonneau  you have supped well i trust henri the prince asked the chauffeur  without a doubt excellency the man replied  then drive for the frontier falkenberg ordered we will stop you when we need a rest  they left paris in the semidarkness they were away in the country before the faintest gleam of daylight broke through the eastern clouds even then the way was still obscured it was a stormy morning and banks of murky clouds were piled up where the sun should have risen the rain still fell soon they commenced to ascend a range of hills at the summit falkenberg pulled the checkstring  henri he said come in behind here i will drive for a timeit will amuse me  the man descended falkenberg took his place at the wheel estermen obeying his gesture scrambled into the seat by his side  go to the signpost his master ordered the chauffeur tell me exactly how many miles to rheims  the man clambered up the bank the gray morning twilight was breaking now through a sea of clouds from where they were the vineyards sloped down to the bank a thin curving line of silver marked the course of the river here and there a little gleam of sunlight fell upon the country below them estermen closed his eyes  it makes me giddy he muttered i hope that you will drive slowly down the hill  falkenberg glanced to the leftthe chauffeur was still peering at the milestone he slipped in the clutch and the car glided off gathering speed as though by magic  you have left henri estermen cried he is running after us stop the car cant you stop it  falkenberg turned his head only once the stone walls now on either side seemed flying past them estermen looked into his face and quaked with fear  this ride is for you and me alone my friend falkenberg replied sit tight and say your prayers if it pleases you this is better after all than poison or the cold muzzle of a revolver at your forehead close your eyes if you are afraid or open them if you have the courage and see the world spin by we start on the great journey  estermen shrieked he half rose to his feet but falkenberg holding the wheel with his right hand struck him across the face with his left so that he fell back in his place  if you try to leave the car he said i swear that i will stop and come back i will shoot you where you lie like a dog be brave man be thankful that you are going to your death in honorable company and in honorable fashion its better this than the guillotine isnt it look at the country below like patchwork coming up to us listen to the wind rushing by you see the trees how they bend you feel the rain stinging your cheeks sit still man and fix your thoughts where you will think of mademoiselle la danseuse think of her kisses think of the perfume of the violets at her bosom you see we arrive watch that corner of the viaduct  they were traveling now at a terrific speed falling fast to the level country before them was a high bridge crossing the river on the left a portion of it was being repaired and a few boards alone were up for protection falkenberg recognizing the spot for which he had been looking settled down in his seat a grim smile parted his lips  jean charles will never place his hand upon your shoulder now he cried can you hear the wind sob estermen soon youll hear the water in your ears hold fast dont spoil the end  they were going at sixty miles an hour and with the slightest swerve of the steering wheel they turned to the left on entering the bridge and struck the boards henri in his account of the accident declared that although the car turned over before it reached the river falkenberg never left his seat estermen on the other hand was thrown violently out and struck the water head foremost from the condition of his body it would seem that death was instantaneous falkenberg was found with his arms locked around the steering wheel his head bent forward he too seemed to have been drowned almost immediately the steering wheel was jammed the car wrecked  the authorities who had left only a temporary protection while they repaired the viaduct on the bridge were severely censured the makers of the car were subjected to a very searching crossexamination the brakes and the uncertain light were blamed henri who from the hillside a mile or more back had watched with ghastly face was the only one who understood the accident and he kept silent     chapter xix   all ends well   the duchess of clonarty was famous for doing the right thing three weeks after the return of julien and lady anne to london she gave a large dinnerparty in their honor at a quarter past eight a telephone message from the house of commons was received explaining that sir julien would be ten minutes late owing to his having to speak at greater length than he had first intended upon the agdar question lady anne was waiting for him and they would arrive together certainly within a quarter of an hour the duchess made every use of her opportunity she was at her very best during that brief period which ensued while they waited for the delayed guests  you know my dear lady cardington she explained raising her voice a little to indicate that this was not entirely a confidence i never dreamed that dear anne had so much selfconfidence and resolution even now i have scarcely given up wondering at it if she had only told me that she was so sincerely attached to julien i would never have listened for one moment to that harbord affair it was a mistake of course she rippled on but then one learns so much by ones mistakes notwithstanding their wealth they were most terrible and impossible people i am sure the association would have been most distasteful to the duke poor henry used to lock himself in his study when any of them were about the place and what it would have been if they were really able to call themselves connections i cannot imagine you were speaking of the carraby woman a few minutes ago my dear eva of course you have heard about her her husband when he resigned gave out that he was obliged to go abroad for his wifes health my dear his wife had already left him three days before she was seen in paris with bob sutherland i hear the divorce suit is filed what a terrible woman  a great escape i am sure for sir julien lady cardington declared  the duchess drew a little breath  poor julien was always so chivalrous she murmured how thankful your dear husband must be to think that at last he has one person in his cabinet who does command some sort of a following in the country  the duchess delivered her little shaft and moved to the door sir julien and lady anne portel had just been announced it was almost a family dinner the duchess took juliens arm and drew him into a corner while the others filed past  is it true she whispered that the carraby woman has bolted  julien nodded  i am afraid there isnt a doubt about it he admitted  how are things tonight anything new she asked  quite calm again he replied the trouble seems to have passed over falkenbergs death upset the whole scheme which was brewing against us whatever it may have been all the notes which are being interchanged at the present moment are perfectly pacific  the duchess sighed  after all she said my little visit to paris was not so wild i dont think you would ever have found out about anne but for me  julien smiled  if i really believed that he assured her and i shall try to then i should feel that i owed you more than any person upon the earth  the dinner was a success lady anne seemed certainly to have developed she was looking wonderfully handsome and though her eyes strayed more than once to the end of the table where her husband was sitting she carried on her share of the conversation with just that trifle of assurance which marks the transition from girlhood to the dignity of marriage after the women had left conversation for a few moments was necessarily political the duke who read the times and the spectator and attended every debate in the house of lords spoke with some authority  i believe he said firmly that we have passed through a crisis greater than any one even those in power know of it is my opinion that falkenberg was the bitter enemy of this countrythat it was he indeed who kept alive all that suspicious and jealous feeling of which we have had constant evidences from berlin he was dying all the time to make mischief i am sorry of course for his tragical end on the other hand i am inclined to believe that his departure from the sphere of politics was the best thing that has happened to this country for many years  there is no doubt lord cardington declared that he was working hard to estrange france and england your letters sir julien made that remarkably evident  the good that men do lives after them some one quoted also the evil i am afraid it will be some time before france and england are on exactly the same terms  i would not be so sure julien interposed setting down his glass the politics of paris are the politics of france and the spirit of the parisian is essentially mercurial besides the days of the great alliance draw nearerthe next step forward after the arbitration treaty who can doubt that when that is completed france will embrace the chance of permanent peace  the duke rose to his feet  five minutes only i am allowed gentlemen he said my wife wants some of us some of us have to go back to westminster i shall ask you therefore before we separate as this is in some respects an occasion to drink to the health of my soninlaw sir julien portel though a politician of the old type i do not fail to appreciate what we owe to the new school i am a reader of the oldfashioned newspapers but i recognize the fact that the modern press sometimes exercises a new and wonderful function in politics it is my opinion that by means of this modern journalism sir julien portel has maintained the peace of the world i ask you therefore not only as my private friends and relatives but as politicians to drink tonight to the health of my soninlaw  they all rose  and with that toast lord cardington added as he bowed toward julien let me associate the fervent pleasure felt by all of us in welcoming back once more the colleague to whom we have so many reasons to be thankful  the party broke up soon afterwards lady anne drove back with her husband to westminster she sat by his side in the closed car which had been her fathers wedding present her hands linked together were passed through his arm she was a very well satisfied woman  julien she declared its lovely to be back here but i wouldnt have been without those few weeks in paris for anything in the world i dont think we can ever get back down into the bottom of the ruts do you  if ever we feel like it he answered smiling well cross the channel again and take mademoiselle janette with us and seek for more adventures  lovely she exclaimed i shall hold you to that mind  no need he replied kendricks is going to stay there as correspondent for the post we must go and see him occasionally there is no one who understands better the temperament of the parisian than he  there will be no more herr freudenberg to circumvent she remarked  paris always has its problems he answered kendricks realizes that the plotting of the world takes place within a mile of montmartre  they were nearing westminster julien drew his wife towards him and kissed her  i shall only be about twenty minutes dear he suggested why not wait  of course she replied i have a little electric lamp here and a book id love to  julien walked blithely into the house lady anne turned on the lamp drew out her book and leaned back among the cushions with a deep sigh of content                                       that same night wandering around paris kendricks met monsieur madame and mademoiselle  it is the gallant englishman mademoiselle exclaimed  it is the gentleman who ate both portions of chicken madame cried clapping her hands  it was a veritable meeting kendricks willingly joined their little party and sat down with them in the brightlylit cafe monsieur ordered wine  the business affairs of monsieur are prospering i trust he said after all the entente remains  kendricks lifted his glass  i drink to it he exclaimed it is the sanest thing today in european politics drink to it yourself monsieur and you madame and you mademoiselle you shall accuse us no longer we english of selfishness or stupidity for what reason think you did we order a warship to agdar and brave the whole wrath of germany  monsieur held out his hand  my friend he declared it was a stroke of genius that it was what we none of us expected from any english minister it was magnificent i confess itit has altered my opinions i drink with you now cordially and heartily i drink to the entente i believe in it i am a convert  kendricks shook hands with every one solemnly he shook hands last with mademoiselle and forgot to release her little fingers for several moments  tell us of your friend monsieur madame asked politely  but kendricks did not hear he was whispering in mademoiselles ear her dark eyes were fixed upon the tablecloth her pretty lips were parted a most becoming flush of color was in her cheeks monsieur looked at madame and winked madame smiled well pleased  lentente monsieur murmured  madame nodded
