stopped short  he was there on his knees with his arms around the terrified woman  to the nearest police station thats where im off     chapter i  a mysterious visitor   the man and the woman stood facing one another although in the uncertain firelight which alone illuminated the room neither could see much save the outline of the others form the woman stood at the further end of the apartment by the side of the deskhis desk the slim trembling fingers of one hand rested lightly upon it the other was hanging by her side nervously crumpling up the glove which she had only taken off a few minutes before the man stood with his back to the door through which he had just entered he was in evening dress he carried an overcoat over his arm and his hat was slightly on the back of his head a cigarette was still burning between his lips the key by means of which he had entered was swinging from his little finger so far no words had passed between them both were apparently stupefied for the moment by the others unexpected presence  it was the man who recovered his selfpossession first he threw his overcoat into a chair and touched the brass knobs behind the door instantly the room was flooded with the soft radiance of the electric lights they could see one another now distinctly the woman leaned a little forward and there was amazement as well as fear flashing in her soft dark eyes her voice when she spoke sounded to herself unnatural to him it came as a surprise for the world of men and women was his study and he recognized at once its quality  who are you she exclaimed what do you want  he shrugged his shoulders  it seems to me he answered that i might more fittingly assume the role of questioner however i have no objection to introduce myself my name is herbert wrayson may i ask he continued with quiet sarcasm to what i am indebted for this unexpected visit  she was silent for a moment and as he watched her his surprise grew equivocal though her position was he knew very well that this was no ordinary thief whom he had surprised in his rooms engaged to all appearance in rifling his desk the fact that she was a beautiful woman was one which he scarcely took into account there were other things more surprising which he could not ignore her evening dress of black net was faultlessly made and he knew enough of such things to be well aware that it came from the hands of no ordinary dressmaker a string of pearls her only ornament hung from her neck and her black hat with its drooping feathers was the fellow of one which he had admired a few evenings ago at the ritz in paris it flashed upon him that this was a woman of distinction one who belonged naturally if not in effect to the world of which even he could not claim to be a habitant what was she doing in his roomsof what interest to her were he and his few possessions  herbert wrayson she repeated leaning a little towards him if your name is herbert wrayson what are you doing in these rooms  they happen to be mine he answered calmly  yours  she picked up a small latchkey from the desk  this is number 11 isnt it she asked quickly  no number 11 is the flat immediately overhead he told her  she appeared unconvinced  but i opened the door with this key she declared  mr barnes and i have similar locks he said the fact remains that this is number 9 and number 11 is one story overhead  she drew a long breath presumably of relief and moved a step forward  i am very sorry she declared i have made a mistake you must please accept my apologies  he stood motionless in front of the door he was pale cleanshaven and slim and in his correct evening clothes he seemed a somewhat ordinary type of the wellbred young englishman but his eyes were grey and his mouth straight and firm  she came to a standstill her eyes seemed to be questioning him she scarcely understood his attitude  kindly allow me to pass she said coldly  presently he answered  her veil was still raised and the flash of her eyes would surely have made a weaker man quail but wrayson never flinched  what do you mean by that she demanded i have explained my presence in your room it was an accident which i regret let me pass at once  you have explained your presence here he answered after a fashion but you have not explained what your object may be in making use of that key to enter mr barnes flat are you proposing to subject his belongings to the same inspection as mine he asked pointing to his disordered desk  my business with mr barnes is no concern of yours she exclaimed haughtily  under ordinary circumstances no he admitted but these are not ordinary circumstances forgive me if i speak plainly i found you engaged in searching my desk the presumption is that you wish to do the same thing to mr barnes  and if i do sir she demanded what concern is it of yours how do you know that i have not permission to visit his roomsthat he did not himself give me this key  she held it out before him he glanced at it and back into her face  the supposition he said does not commend itself to me  why not  he looked at the clock  you see he declared that it is within a few minutes of midnight to be frank with you you do not seem to me the sort of person likely to visit a bachelor such as mr barnes in a bachelor flat at this hour without some serious object  she kept silence for several moments her bosom was rising and falling quickly and a brilliant spot of colour was burning in her cheeks her head was thrown a little back she was regarding him with an intentness which he found almost disconcerting he had an uncomfortable sense that he was in the presence of a human being who if it had lain in her power would have killed him where he stood further he was realizing that the woman whom at first glance he had pronounced beautiful was absolutely the first of her sex whom he had ever seen who satisfied completely the demands of a somewhat critical and highly cultivated taste the silence between them seemed extended over a time crowded and rich with sensations he found time to marvel at the delicate whiteness of her bosom gleaming like polished ivory under the network of her black gown to appreciate with a quick throb of delight the slim roundness of her perfect figure the wonderful poise of her head the soft richness of her braided hair every detail of feature and of toilet seemed to satisfy to the last degree each critical faculty of which he was possessed he felt a little shiver of apprehension when he recalled the cold brutality of the words which had just left his lips yet how could he deal with her differently  is this manmorris barnesyour friend she asked breaking a silence which had done more than anything else to unnerve him  no he answered i scarcely know the man i have never seen him except in the lift or on the stairs  then you have no excuse for keeping me here she declared i may be his friend or i may be his enemy at least i possess the key of his flat presumably with his permission my presence here i have explained i can assure you that it is entirely accidental you have no right to detain me for a moment  the clock on the mantelpiece struck midnight a sudden passion surged in his veins a passion which although at the time he could not have classified it was assuredly a passion of jealousy he remembered the man barnes whom he hated  you shall not go to his roomsat this hour he exclaimed you dont know the man if you were seen  she laughed mockingly  let me pass she insisted  he hesitated she saw very clearly that she was conquering a moment before she had respected this man after all though he was like the others  i will go with you and wait outside he said doggedly barnes at this houris not always sober  her lips curled  be wise she said and let me go i do not need your protection or  she broke off suddenly the interruption was certainly startling enough from a table only a few feet off came the shrill tinkle of a telephone bell wrayson mechanically stepped backwards and took the receiver into his hand  who is it he asked  the voice which answered him was faint but clear it seemed to wrayson to come from a long way off  is that mr wraysons flat in cavendish mansions it asked  yes wrayson answered who are you  i am a friend of mr morris barnes the voice answered may i apologize for calling you up but the matter is urgent can you tell me if mr barnes is in  i am not sure but i believe he is never in before one or two oclock wrayson answered  will you write down a message and leave it in his letterbox the voice asked anxiously it is very important or i would not trouble you  very well wrayson answered what is it  tell him instantly he returns to leave his flat and go to the hotel francis a friend is waiting there for him the friend whom he has been expecting  a lady wrayson remarked a little sarcastically  no the voice answered a friend will you do this will you promise to do it  very well wrayson said who are you and where are you ringing up from  remember you have promised was the only reply  all right tell me your name wrayson demanded  no answer wrayson turned the handle of the instrument viciously  exchange he asked who was that talking to me just now  dont know was the prompt answer we cant remember all the calls we get ring off please  wrayson laid down the receiver and turned round with a sudden sense of apprehension there was a feeling of emptiness in the room he had not heard a sound but he knew very well what had happened the door was slightly open and the room was empty she had taken advantage of his momentary absorption to slip away  he stepped outside and stood by the lift listening the landing was deserted and there was no sound of any one moving anywhere the lift itself was on the ground floor it had not ascended recently or he must have heard it he returned to his room and softly closed the door again the sense of emptiness oppressed him a faint perfume around the place where she had stood came to him like a whiff of some delicious memory he set his teeth lit a cigarette and sitting down at his desk wrote a few lines to his neighbour embodying the message which had been given him with the note in his hand he ascended to the next floor  there was apparently no light in flat number 11 but he rang the bell and listened there was no answer no sound of any one moving within for nearly ten minutes he waitedlistening he was strongly tempted to open the door with his own key and see for himself if she was there then he remembered that barnes was a man whom he barely knew and cordially disliked and that if he should return unexpectedly the situation would be a little difficult to explain reluctantly he descended to his own flat and mixing himself a whisky and soda lit a pipe and sat down determined to wait until he heard barnes return in less than a quarter of an hour he was asleep     chapter ii  the horror of the hansom   wrayson sat up with a sudden and violent start his pipe had fallen on to the floor leaving a long trail of grey ash upon his waistcoat and trousers the electric lights were still burning but of the fire nothing remained but a pile of ashes as soon as he could be said to be conscious of anything he was conscious of two things one was that he was shivering with cold the other that he was afraid  wrayson was by no means a coward he had come once or twice in his life into close touch with dangerous happenings and conducted himself with average pluck he never attempted to conceal from himself however that these few minutes were minutes of breathless unreasoning fear his heart was thumping against his side and the muscles at the back of his neck were almost numb as he slowly looked round the room his eyes paused at the door it was slightly open to his nervous fancy it seemed to be shaking his teeth chattered he felt his forehead and it was wet  he rose to his feet and listened there was no sound anywhere from above or below he tried to remember what it was that had awakened him so suddenly he could remember nothing except that awful start something must have disturbed him he listened again still no sound he drew a little breath and with his eyes glued upon the halfclosed door recollected that he himself had left it open that he might hear barnes go upstairs with a little laugh still not altogether natural he moved to the spirit decanter and drank off half a wineglassful of neat whisky  nerves he said softly to himself this wont do what an idiot i was to go to sleep there  he glanced at the clock it was five minutes to three then he moved towards the door and stood for several moments with the handle in his hand gradually his confidence was returning he listened attentively there was not a sound to be heard in the entire building he turned back into the room with a little sigh of relief  time i turned in he muttered wonder if thats rain  he lifted the blind and looked out a few stars were shining still in a misty sky but a bank of clouds was rolling up and rain was beginning to fall the pavements were already wet and the lampposts obscured he was about to turn away when a familiar but unexpected sound from the street immediately below attracted his notice the window was open at the top and he had distinctly heard the jingling of a hansom bell  he threw open the bottom sash and leaned out a hansom cab was waiting at the entrance to the flats wrayson glanced once more instinctively towards the clock who on earth of his neighbours could be keeping a cab waiting outside at that hour in the morning with the exception of barnes and himself they were most of them early people once more he looked out of the window the cabman was leaning forward in his seat with his head resting upon his folded arms he was either tired out or asleep the attitude of the horse was one of extreme and wearied dejection wrayson was on the point of closing the window when he became aware for the first time that the cab had an occupant he could see the figure of a man leaning back in one corner he could even distinguish a whitegloved hand resting upon the apron the figure was not unlike the figure of barnes and barnes as he happened to remember always wore white gloves in the evening barnes it probably was waitingfor what wrayson closed the window a little impatiently and turned back into the room  barnes and his friends can go to the devil he muttered i am off to bed  he took a couple of steps across the room and then stopped short the fear was upon him again he felt his heart almost stop beating a cold shiver shook his whole frame he was standing facing his halfopen door and outside on the stone steps he heard the soft even footfall of slippered feet and the gentle rustling of a womans gown  he was not conscious of any movement but when she reached the landing he was standing there on the threshold with the soft halo of light from behind shining on to his white fiercely questioning face she came towards him without speech and her veil was lowered so that he could only imperfectly see her face but she walked as one newly recovered from illness with trembling footsteps and with one hand always upon the banisters when she reached the corner she stopped and seemed about to collapse she spoke to him and her voice had lost all its quality it sounded harsh and unreal  why are youspying on me she asked  i am not spying he answered i have been asleepand woke up suddenly  give mesome brandy she begged  she stood upon the threshold and drank from the wineglass which he had filled when she gave it back to him he noticed that her fingers were steady  will you come downstairs and let me out she asked i have looked down and it is all dark on the ground floor i am not sure that i know my way  he hesitated but only for a moment side by side they walked down four flights of steps in unbroken silence he asked no question she attempted no explanation only when he opened the door and she saw the waiting hansom she very nearly collapsed for a moment she clung to him  he is therein the cab she moaned where can i hide  whoever it is wrayson answered with his eyes fixed upon the hansom he is either drunk or asleep  or dead she whispered in his ear go and see  then before wrayson could recover from the shock of her words she was gone flitting down the unlit side of the street with swift silent footsteps his eyes followed her mechanically then when she had turned the corner he crossed the pavement towards the cab even now he could see little of the figure in the corner for his silk hat was drawn down over his eyes  is that you barnes he asked  there came not the slightest response then for the first time the hideous meaning of those farewell words of hers broke in upon his brain had she meant it had she known or guessed he leaned forward and touched the whitegloved hand he raised it and let go it fell like a dead inert thing he stepped back and confronted the cabman who was rubbing his eyes  theres something wrong with your fare cabby he said  the cabby raised the trap door looked down and descended heavily on to the pavement  well im blowed he said here wake up guvnor  there was no response the cabby threw open the apron of the cab and gently shook the recumbent figure  i cant wait ere all night for my fare he exclaimed wake up god luv us he broke off  he stepped hastily back on to the pavement and began tugging at one of his lamps  push his hat back sir he said lets ave a look at im  wrayson stood upon the step of the cab and lifted the silk hat from the head of the recumbent figure then he sprang back quickly with a little exclamation of horror the lamp was shining full now upon the mans face livid and white upon his staring but sightless eyes upon something around his neck a fragment of silken cord drawn so tightly that the flesh seemed to hang over and almost conceal it  throttled by god the cabman exclaimed im off to the police station  he clambered up to his seat and without another word struck his horse with the whip the cab drove off and disappeared wrayson turned slowly round and closing the door of the flats mounted with leaden feet to the fourth story  he entered his own rooms and walked without hesitation to the window which was still open the fresh air was almost a necessity for he felt himself being slowly stifled his knees were shaking a cold icy horror was numbing his heart and senses a feeling of nightmare was upon him as though he had risen unexpectedly from a bed of delirium there in front of him a little to the left was the broad empty street amongst whose shadows she had disappeared on one side was the park and there was obscurity indefinable mysterious on the other a long row of tall mansions a rainsoaked pavement and a curving line of gas lamps beyond the river marked with a glittering arc of yellow dots further away the glow of the sleeping city shelter enough there for any oneeven for her a soft damp breeze was blowing in his face from amongst the dripping trees of the park the birds were beginning to make their morning music already the blackness of night was passing away the clouds were lightening the stars were growing fainter wrayson leaned a little forward his eyes were fixed upon the exact spot where she had crossed the road and disappeared all the horror of the coming day and the days to come loomed out from the background of his thoughts     chapter iii  discussing the crime   the murder of morris barnes considered merely as an event came as a godsend to the halfpenny press which has an unwritten but immutable contract with the public to provide it with so much sensation during the week in season or out of season nothing else was talked about anywhere under the influence of the general example wrayson found himself within a few days discussing its details with perfect coolness and with an interest which never flagged he seemed continually to forget his own personal and actual connection with the affair  it was discussed amongst other places at the sheridan club of which wrayson was a member and where he spent most of his spare time at one particular luncheon party the day after the inquest nothing else was spoken of for the first time in wraysons hearing a new and somewhat ominous light was thrown upon the affair  there were four men at the luncheon party which was really not a luncheon party at all but a promiscuous coming together of four of the men who usually sat at what was called the colonels table first of all there was the colonel himselfcolonel edgar fitzmaurice cb dsoeasily the most popular member of the club a distinguished retired officer whitehaired kindly and genial a man of whom no one had ever heard another say an unkind word whose hand was always in his none too wellfilled pockets and whose sympathies were always ready to be enlisted in any forlorn cause deserving or otherwise at his right hand sat wrayson on his left sydney mason a rising young sculptor and also a popular member of this somewhat bohemian circle opposite was stephen heneage a man of a different and more secretive type he called himself a barrister but he never practised a journalist at times but he seldom put his name to anything he wrote his interests if he had any he kept to himself in a club where a mans standing was reckoned by what he was and what he produced he owed such consideration as he received to a certain air of reserved strength the more noteworthy amongst a little coterie of men who amongst themselves were accustomed to speak their minds freely and at all times if he was never brilliant he had never been heard to say a foolish thing or make a pointless remark he moved on his way through life and held his place there more by reason of certain negative qualities which amongst a community of optimists were universally ascribed to him than through any more personal or likable gifts he had a dark strong face but a slim weakly body he was never unduly silent but he was a better listener than talker if he had no close friends he certainly had no enemies whether he was rich or poor no man knew but next to the colonel himself no one was more ready to subscribe to any of those charities which the sheridanites were continually inaugurating on behalf of their less fortunate members the man who succeeds in keeping the ego out of sight as a rule neither irritates nor greatly attracts stephen heneage was one of those who stood in this position  they were talking about the murder or rather the colonel was talking and they were listening  there is one point he remarked filling his glass and beaming goodhumouredly upon his companions which seems to have been entirely overlooked i am referring to the sex of the supposed assassin  wrayson looked up inquiringly it was a point which interested him  nearly all of you have assumed the colonel continued that it must have taken a strong man to draw the cord tight enough to have killed that poor fellow without any noticeable struggle as a matter of fact a child with that particular knot could have done it it requires no strength only delicacy of touch rapidity and nerve  a woman then wrayson began  bless you yes a woman could have done it easily the colonel declared only unfortunately there dont seem to have been any women about why ive seen it done in korea with a turn of the wrist its all knack  wrayson shuddered slightly the colonels words had troubled him more than he would have cared to let any one know  woman or man or child mason remarked the person who did it seems to have vanished in some remarkable manner from the face of the earth  he certainly seems the colonel admitted to have covered up his traces with admirable skill i have read every word of the evidence at the inquest and i can understand that the police are completely confused  heneage and mason exchanged glances of quiet amusement whilst the colonel helped himself to cheese  dear old boy the latter murmured hes off on his hobby let him go on he enjoys it more than anything in the world  heneage nodded assent and the colonel returned to the subject with avidity a few moments later  this man morris barnes he affirmed seems to have been a somewhat despicable at any rate a by no means desirable individual he was of jewish origin and he had not long returned from south africa where heaven knows what his occupation was the money of which he was undoubtedly possessed he seems to have spent or at any rate some part of it in aping the life of a dissipated man about town he was known to the fair promenaders of the empire and alhambra he was an habitué of the places where theseerladies partake of supper after the exertions of the evening of home life or respectable friends he seems to have had none  this mason declared leaning back and lighting a cigarette is better than the newspapers go on colonel your biography may not be sympathetic but it is lifelike  the colonels eyes were full of a distinct and vivid light he scarcely heard the interruption he was on fire with his subject  you see he continued that the mans days were spent amongst a class where the passions run loose where restraint is an unknown virtue where self and sensuality are the upraised gods one can easily imagine that from amongst such a slough might spring at any time the weed of tragedy in other words this man morris barnes moved amongst a class of people to whom murder if it could be safely accomplished would be little more than an incident  the colonel lit a cigar and leaned back in his chair he was enjoying himself immensely  the curious part of the affair is though he continued deliberately that this murder as i suppose we must call it bears none of the hallmarks of rude passion on the contrary it suggests in more ways than one the touch of the finished artist the mans whole evening has been traced without the slightest difficulty he dined at the café royal alone promenaded afterwards at the alhambra and drove on about suppertime to the continental he left there at 1230 with a couple of ladies whom he appeared to know fairly well called at their flat for a drink and sent one out to his cabbyrather unusual forethought for such a bounder when he reappeared and directed the man to drive him to cavendish mansions battersea the driver tried to excuse himself both he and his horse were dead tired he said barnes however insisted upon keeping him and off they went at cavendish mansions barnes alighted and offered the man a sovereign naturally enough the fellow could not change it and barnes went in to get some silver from his rooms promising to return in a minute or two the cabby descended and walked to the corner of the street to see if he could beg a match for his pipe from any passerby he may have been away for perhaps five minutes certainly no more during which time he stood with his back to the mansions seeing no one about he returned to his cab ascended to his seat naturally without looking inside and fell fast asleep the next thing he remembers is being awakened by wrayson here so much for the cabby  what a fine criminal judge was lost to the country colonel when you chose the army for a career mason remarked turning round to order some coffee such coherencesuch an eye for detail pass the matches wrayson thanks old chap  the colonel smiled placidly  i am afraid he said that i should never have had the heart to sentence anybody to anything but i must admit that things of this sort do interest me i love to weigh them up and theorize the more melodramatic they are the better  heneage helped himself to a cigarette from masons case and leaned back in his chair  i never have the patience he remarked to read about these things in the newspapers but the colonels résumé is always thrilling do go on there wont be any pool till four oclock  the colonel smiled goodnaturedly  its good of you fellows to listen to my prosing he remarked no use denying that it is a sort of hobby of mine you all know it well well say weve finished with the cabby then enter upon the scene of all people in the world our friend wrayson  hear hear murmured mason  wrayson changed his position slightly with his head resting upon his hand he seemed to be engaged in tracing patterns upon the tablecloth  wrayson knows nothing of barnes beyond the fact that they are neighbours in the same flats being the assistant editor of a journal of worldwide fame however he has naturally a telephone in his flat by means of that instrument he receives a message in the middle of the night from an unknown person in an unknown place which he is begged to convey to barnes the message is in itself mysterious taken in conjunction with what happened to barnes it is deeply interesting barnes it seems is to go immediately on his arrival at whatever hour to the hotel francis presumably he would know from whom the message came and the sender does not seem to have doubted that if it was conveyed to barnes he would obey the summons wrayson agrees to and does deliver it that is to say he writes it down and leaves it in the letterbox of barnes door barnes not having yet returned now we begin to get mysterious that communication from our friend here has not been discovered it was not in the letterbox it was not upon the person of the dead man we cannot tell whether or not he ever received it i believe that i am right so far  absolutely wrayson admitted  our friend wrayson then the colonel continued beaming upon his neighbour instead of going to bed like a sensible man takes up a book and falls asleep in his easychair he wakes up about three or four oclock and his attention is then attracted by the jingling of a hansom bell below he looks out of window and sees a cab both the driver and the occupant of which appear to be asleep the circumstance striking him as somewhat unusual he descends to the street and findswell rather more than he expected he finds the cabman asleep and his fare scientifically and effectually throttled by a piece of silken cord  wrayson turned to the waiter and ordered a liqueur brandy  have one you fellows he asked good four waiter  he tossed his own off directly it arrived his lips were pale and the hand which raised the glass to his lips shook heneage alone who was watching him through a little cloud of tobacco smoke noticed this  have you finished with me colonel wrayson asked  practically the colonel answered smiling unless you can answer one of the three queries suggested by my résumé first who killed morris barnes secondly when was it done thirdly where was it done i have left out a possible fourth why was it done because in this case i think that the motive and the man are practically identical i mean that if you discover one you discover the other  heneage leaned across the table towards the colonel  you are a magician colonel he declared quietly i glanced through this case in the paper and it did not even interest me since i have listened to you i have fallen under the spell of the mysterious have you any theories  the colonels face fell a little  well i am afraid not he admitted regretfully to be perfectly interesting the affair certainly ought to present something more definite in the shape of a clue you see providing we accept the evidence of wrayson and the cabman and i suppose he added laying his hand affectionately upon wraysons shoulder we must the actual murderer is a person absolutely unseen or unheard of by any one if you are all really interested we will discuss it again in a weeks time after the adjourned inquest  i for one shall look forward to it heneage remarked glancing across towards wrayson what about a pool  im on wrayson declared rising a little abruptly  and i mason assented  and i cant the colonel said regretfully i must go down to balham and see poor carlo mallini i hear hes very queer  the colonel loved pool and he hated a sickroom the click of the billiard balls reached him as he descended the stairs but he only sighed and set out manfully for charing cross on the way he entered a fruiterers shop and inquired the price of grapes they were more than he expected and he counted out the contents of his trousers pockets before purchasing  a little short of change he remarked cheerfully yes all right ill take them  he marched out swinging a paper bag between his fingers travelled third class to balham and sat for a couple of hours with the invalid whom he had come to see a lonely italian musician to whom his coming meant more than all the medicine his doctor could prescribe he talked to him glowingly of the success of his recent concert more than a score of the tickets sold had been paid for secretly by the colonel himself and his friends prophesied great things for the future and laughed away all the poor fellows fears as to his condition there were tears in his eyes as he walked to the station for he had visited too many sickbeds to have much faith in his own cheerful words and all the way back to london he was engaged in thinking out the best means of getting the musician sent back to his own country arrived at charing cross he looked longingly towards the club and ruefully at the contents of his pocket then with a sigh he turned into a little restaurant and dined for eighteenpence     chapter iv  under a cloud   exactly one week later six men were smoking their afterdinner cigars at the same round table in the diningroom at the sheridan club as a rule it was the hour when with all the reserve of the day thrown aside badinage and jest reigned supreme and the humourist came to his own tonight chairs were drawn a little closer together voices were subdued and the conversation was of a more serious order not even the pleasant warmth of the room the fragrance of tobacco and the comfortable sense of having dined could altogether dispel a feeling of uneasiness which all more or less shared it chanced that all six were friends of herbert wraysons  the colonel as usual was in the chair but even on his kindly features the cloud hovered  of course he said none of us who know wrayson well would believe for a moment that he could be connected in any way with this beastly affair the unfortunate part of it is that others who do not know him might easily be led to think otherwise  it is altogether his own fault too mason remarked he gave his evidence shockingly  and his movements that night or rather that morning were certainly a little peculiar another man remarked his connection with the affair seemed to consist of a series of coincidences the law does not look favourably upon coincidences  but after all the colonel remarked he scarcely knew the fellow just nodded to him on the stairs and that sort of thing why there isnt a shadow of a motive  we cant be sure of that colonel heneage remarked quietly i wonder how much we really know of the inner lives of even our closest friends i fancy that we should be surprised if we realized our ignorance  the colonel stroked his grey moustache thoughtfully  that may be true he said of a good many of us wrayson however never struck me as being a particularly secretive sort of chap  unfortunately that counts for very little heneage declared the things which surprise us most in life come often from the most unlikely people we none of us mean to be deceitful but a perfectly honest life is a luxury which few of us dare indulge in  the colonel regarded him gravely  i hope he said that you dont mean that you consider wrayson capable  i wasnt thinking of wrayson at all heneage interrupted i was generalizing but i must say this i think that given sufficient provocation or motive there isnt one of us who wouldnt be capable of committing murder a mans outer life is lived according to the laws of circumstances and society his inner one no one knows anything about except himselfand god  heneage mason sighed is always cynical after kümmel  heneage shrugged his shoulders and lit a cigarette  no he said i am not cynical i simply have a weakness for the truth you will find it rather a hard material to collect if you set out in earnest but to return to wrayson let me ask you a question we are all friends of his more or less intimate friends you would all of you scout the idea of his having any share in the murder of morris barnes what did you make of his evidence at the inquest this afternoon what do you think of his whole deportment and condition  i can answer that in one word the colonel declared i think that it is unfortunate the poor fellow has been terribly upset and his nerves have not been able to stand the strain that is all there is about it  wrayson has been working up to the limit for years mason remarked and hes not a particularly strong chap i should say that he was about due for a nervous breakdown  a waiter approached the table and addressed the colonelhe was wanted on the telephone during his absence heneage leaned back in his chair and relapsed into his usual imperturbability he was known amongst his friends generally as the silent man it was very seldom that he contributed so much to their discussions as upon this occasion perhaps for that reason his words when he spoke always carried weight mason changed his place and sat beside him the others had wandered off into a discussion upon a new magazine  between ourselves heneage mason said quietly have you anything at the back of your head about wrayson  heneage did not immediately reply he was gazing at the little cloud of blue tobacco smoke which he had just expelled from his lips  there is no reason he declared why my opinion should be worth any more than any one elses i think as highly of wrayson as any of you  granted mason answered but you have a theory or an idea of some sort concerning him what is it  if you really want to know heneage said i believe that wrayson has kept something back it is a very dangerous thing to do and i believe that he realizes it i believe that he has some secret knowledge of the affair which he has not disclosedknowledge which he has kept out of his evidence altogether  aguiltyknowledge mason whispered  not necessarily heneage answered he may be shielding some one  if you are right mason said anxiously it is a serious affair  very serious indeed heneage assented i believe that he is realizing it  the colonel came back looking a little disturbed  sorry boys but i must be off he announced wrayson has just telephoned to ask me to go down and see him im afraid hes queer ive sent for a hansom  poor chap mason murmured let us know if any of us can do anything  the colonel nodded and took his departure the others drifted up into the billiardroom heneage alone remained seated at the end of the table he was playing idly with his wineglass but his eyes were fixed steadfastly if a little absently upon the colonels empty place     chapter v  on the telephone   it was a little hard even for the colonel to keep up his affectation of cheerfulness when he found himself alone with the man whom he had come to visit his experience of life had been large and varied but he had never yet seen so remarkable a change in any human being in twentyfour hours there were deep black lines under his eyes his cheeks were colourless every now and then his features twitched nervously as though he were suffering from an attack of st vitus dance his hand which had lain weakly in the colonels was as cold as ice although there was a roaring fire in the room he had admitted the colonel himself and almost dragged him inside the door  did you meet any one outsideupon the stairs he asked feverishly  no one upon the stairs the colonel answered there was a man lighting his pipe in the doorway  wrayson shivered as he turned away  watching me he declared there are two of them they are watching me all the time  the colonel took off his coat the room seemed to him like a furnace then he stretched out his hands and laid them upon wraysons shoulders  what if they are he declared cheerfully they wont eat you besides it is very likely the dead mans rooms they are watching  they followed me home from the inquest wrayson muttered  the colonel laughed  and if id been living here he remarked theyd have followed me home just the same now herbert my young friend he continued sit down and tell me all about it like a man youre in a bit of trouble of course underneath all this lets hear it and well find the best way out  the colonels figure was dominant his presence alone seemed to dispel that unreal army of ghosts and fancies which a few moments before had seemed to wrayson to be making his room like the padded cell of a lunatic asylum his tone too had just enough sympathy to make its cheerfulness reassuring wrayson began to feel glimmerings of common sense  yes he said ive something to tell you thats why i telephoned  the colonel rose again to his feet and began fumbling in the pocket of his overcoat  god bless my soul i almost forgot he exclaimed and the fellows would make me bring it we guessed how you were feelingmuch better to have come up and dined with us here we are get some glasses theres a good chap  a goldfoiled bottle appeared and a packet of hastily cut sandwiches wrayson found himself mechanically eating and drinking before he knew where he was then in an instant the sandwiches had become delicious and the wine was rushing through his veins like a new elixir of life he was himself again the banging of anvils in his head had ceased he was shaken perhaps but a sane man his eyes filled with tears and he gripped the colonel by the hand  colonel youreyouregod knows what you are he murmured all the ordinary things sound commonplace i believe i was going mad  the colonel leaned back and laughed as though the idea tickled him  not you he declared bless you i know what nerves are out in india thirtyfive years ago ive had to relieve men on frontier posts who hadnt seen a soul to speak to for six months weird places some of them toogives me the creeps to think of them sometimes now light up that cigar he added throwing one across and lets hear the trouble  wrayson lit his cigar with fingers which scarcely shook he threw the match away and smoked for a moment in silence  its about this morris barnes affair he said abruptly ive kept something back and im a clumsy hand at telling a story that doesnt contain all the truth the consequence is of course that im suspected of having had a hand in it myself  the colonels manner had for a moment imperceptibly changed lines had come out in his face which were not usually visible his upper lip had stiffened one could fancy that he might have led his men into battle looking something like this  what is it that you know he asked  there was another person in the flats that night who was interested in morris barnes who visited his rooms who was with me when i first saw him dead  the colonel shaded his face with his hand the heat from the fire was intense  why have you kept back this knowledge he asked  becauseit was a woman and i am a fool wrayson answered  there was a silence then the colonel pushed back his chair and dabbed his forehead with his handkerchief the room was certainly hot and the handkerchief was wet  tell me about it he said quietly i expected something of the sort  on that morning wrayson began i returned home about twelve oclock let myself in with my own latchkey and found a woman standing before my open desk going through my papers  a friend the colonel asked  a complete stranger wrayson answered her surprise at seeing me was at least equal to my own i gathered that she had believed herself to be in the flat of morris barnes which is the corresponding one above  what did you do the colonel asked  what i should have done i am not sure wrayson answered but while i was talking to her the telephone bell rang and i received that message which i spoke about at the inquest it was a mysterious sort of businessi can hear that voice now i was interested and while i stood there she slipped away  is that all the colonel asked  no wrayson answered with a groan i wish to god it was  the colonel moved his position a little the cigar had burnt out between his fingers but he made no effort to light it  go on he said tell me the rest tell me what happened afterwards  i wrote down the message for barnes and left it in his letterbox there seemed then to be no light in his flat afterwards i lit a pipe left my door open and sat down with the intention of waiting till barnes came home and explaining what had happened i fell asleep in my chair and woke with a start it was nearly three oclock i was going to turn in when i heard the jingling of a hansom bell down below i looked out of the window and saw the cab standing in the street almost at the same time i heard footsteps outside i went to the door of my flat and came face to face with the girl descending from the floor above  at three oclock in the morning the colonel interrupted  wrayson nodded  she was white and shaking all over he continued rapidly she asked me for brandy and i gave it to her she asked me to see her out of the place and i did so when i opened the door to let her out and we saw the man leaning back in the cab she moaned softly to herself i said something about his being asleep or drunkor dead she whispered in my ear and then she rushed away from me she turned into the albert road and disappeared almost at once i could not have followed her if i would i had just begun to realize that something was wrong with the man in the cab  this is all the colonel asked  it is all wrayson answered  you do not know her name or why she was here you have not seen her since  wrayson shook his head  i know absolutely nothing he said beyond what i have told you  the colonel struck a match and relit his cigar  i should like to understand he said quietly why you avoided all mention of her in your evidence  wrayson laughed oddly  i should like to understand that myself he declared i can only repeat what i said before she was a woman and i was a fool  in plain english the colonel said you did it to shield her  yes wrayson answered  the colonel nodded thoughtfully  well he said you were in a difficult position and you made a deliberate choice i tell you frankly that i expected to hear worse things do you believe that she committed the murder  no wrayson answered i do not  you believe that she may be associated withthe person who did  i cannot tell wrayson declared  in any case the colonel continued you seem to have been the only person who saw her whether you were wise or not to omit all mention of her in your evidencewell we wont discuss that the best of us have gone on the wrong side of the hedge for a woman before nowand damned glad to do it what i cant quite understand old chap is why you have worked yourself up into such a shocking state you dont stand any chance of being hanged that i can see  wrayson laughed a little shamefacedly  to tell you the truth he said i am beginning to feel ashamed of myself i think it was the sense of being spied upon and being alonein this roomwhich got a bit on my nerves i feel a different man since you came down  the colonel nodded cheerfully  thats all right he declared the next thing to  the colonel broke off in the midst of his sentence a few feet away from him the telephone bell was ringing wrayson rose to his feet and took the receiver into his hand  hullo he said  the voice which answered him was faint but clear wrayson almost dropped the instrument he recognized it at once  is that mr herbert wrayson it asked  yes wrayson answered who are you  i am the person who spoke to you a few nights ago was the answer never mind my name for the present i wish to arrange a meetingfor some time tomorrow i have a matterof businessto discuss with you  anywhereat any time wrayson answered almost fiercely you cannot be as anxious to see me as i am to know who you are  the voice changed a little in its intonation a note of mockery had stolen into it  you flatter me it said i trust that our meeting will be mutually agreeable you must excuse my coming to battersea as i understand that your flat is subjected to a most inconvenient surveillance may i call at the office of your paper at say eleven oclock tomorrow  yes wrayson answered you know where it is  certainly i shall be there a mr bentham will ask for you good night  wraysons unknown friend had rung off he replaced the receiver and turned to the colonel  do you know who that was he asked eagerly  i can guess the colonel answered  tomorrow at eleven oclock wrayson declared i shall know who killed morris barnes     chapter vi  one thousand pounds reward   but when the morrow came and his visitor was shown into wraysons private office he was not quite so sure about it mr bentham had not in the least the appearance of a murderer cleanshaven a little slow in speech quietly dressed he resembled more than anything a country solicitor in moderate practice  he bowed in correct professional manner and laid a brown paper parcel upon the table  i believe he said that i have the honour of addressing mr wrayson  wrayson nodded a little curtly  and you i suppose he remarked are the owner of the mysterious voice which summoned morris barnes to the francis hotel on the night of his murder  it was i who spoke to you mr bentham admitted  very well wrayson said i am glad to see you it was obvious from your message that you knew of some danger which was threatening morris barnes that night it is therefore only fair to presume that you are also aware of its source  you go a little fast sir mr bentham objected  my presumption is a fair one wrayson declared you are perhaps aware of my unfortunate connection with this affair if so you will understand that i am particularly anxious to have it cleared up  it is not at all certain that i can help you his visitor said precisely it depends entirely upon yourself will you permit me to put my case before you  by all means wrayson answered go ahead  mr bentham took the chair towards which wrayson had somewhat impatiently pointed and unbuttoned his coat it was obvious that he was not a person to be hurried  in the first place mr wrayson he said i must ask you distinctly to understand that i am not addressing you on my own account i am a lawyer and i am acting on behalf of a client  who is he wrayson asked what is his name  the ghost of a smile flickered across the lawyers thin lips  i am not at liberty to divulge his identity he answered i am however fully empowered to act for him  wrayson shrugged his shoulders  he may find it necessary to disclose it and before very long he remarked well go on  mr bentham discreetly ignored the covert threat in wraysons words  my mission to you mr wrayson he declared is a somewhat delicate one it is not in fact connected with the actualtragedy to which you have alluded my commission is to regain possession of a paper which was stolen either from the person of morris barnes or from amongst his effects on that night  wrayson looked up eagerly  the motive at last he exclaimed what was the nature of this paper sir  mr benthams eyebrows were slowly raised  that he said we need not enter into for the moment the matter of business between you and myself or rather my client is this i am authorized to offer a thousand pounds reward for its recovery  wrayson was impressed although the others manner left him a little puzzled  why not offer the reward for the discovery of the murderer he asked it would come i presume to the same thing  by no means the lawyer answered dryly i am afraid that i have not expressed myself well my client cares nothing for morris barnes dead or alive his interest begins and ends with the recovery of that paper  but isnt it almost certain wrayson persisted that the thief and the murderer are the same person your client ought to have come forward at the inquest the thing which has chiefly troubled the police in dealing with this matter is the apparent lack of motive  my client is not actuated in any way by philanthropic motives mr bentham said coldly to tell you the truth he does not care whether the murderer of morris barnes is brought to justice or not he is only anxious to recover possession of the document of which i have spoken  if he has a legal claim to it wrayson said he had better offer his reward openly he would probably help himself then and also those who are anxious to have this mystery solved  are you amongst those mr wrayson his visitor asked quietly  wrayson started slightly but he retained his selfcomposure  i am very much amongst them he answered my connection with the affair was an extremely unpleasant one and it will remain so until the murderer of morris barnes is brought to book  or murderess mr bentham murmured softly  wrayson reeled in his chair as though he had been struck a violent and unexpected blow he understood now the guarded menace of his visitors manner he felt the mans eyes taking merciless note of his whitening cheeks  my client the lawyer continued desires to ask no questions all that he wants is the document to which he is entitled and which was stolen on the night when mr morris barnes met with his unfortunate accident  wrayson had pulled himself together with an effort  i presume he said from your frequent reiteration that i may take this as being to some extent a personal offer if so let me assure you sir that so far as i am concerned i know nothing whatever of any papers or other belongings which were in the possession of my late neighbour i have never seen or heard of any i do not even know why you should have come to me at all  i came to you mr bentham said because i was very well aware that for some reason or other your evidence at the inquest was not quite as comprehensive as it might have been  then for heavens sake tell me all that you know wrayson exclaimed take my word for it i know nothing of this document or paper i have neither seen it nor heard of it i know nothing whatever of the man or his affairs i cant help you i would if i could on the other hand you can throw some light upon the motive for the crime who is your client let me go and see him for myself  mr bentham rose to his feet and began slowly to draw on his gloves  mr wrayson he said quietly i am disappointed with the result of my visit to you i admit it frankly you are either an extremely ingenuous person or a good deal too clever for me in either case if you will not treat with me i need not waste your time  wrayson moved to the door and stood with his back to it  i am not at all sure he said that i am justified in letting you go like this you are in possession of information which would be invaluable to the police in their search for the murderer of morris barnes  mr bentham smiled coldly  and are not you he remarked in the same fortunate positionwith the unfortunate exception perhaps of having already given your testimony of the two if disclosures had to be made i think that i should prefer my own position  wrayson remained where he was  i am inclined he said to risk it at least you would be compelled to disclose your clients name  mr bentham visibly flinched he recovered himself almost immediately but the shadow of fear had rested for a moment at any rate upon his impassive features  i am entirely at your service he said coldly my client has at least not broken the laws of his country  wrayson stood away from the door  you can go he said shortly if you will leave me your address  mr bentham bowed  i regret that i have no card with me he said but i have an office a single room only in number 8 paper buildings adelphi if you should happen to come acrossthat document  wrayson held open the door  if i should come to see you he said it will be on other business                                       wrayson lunched at the club that morning and received a warm greeting from his friends the subject of the murder was as though by common consent avoided towards the end of the meal the colonel received a telegram which he read and laid down upon the table in front of him  by jove he said softly id forgotten all about it boys youve got to help me out  were on mason declared what is it a fight  its a garden party my girls are giving tomorrow afternoon the colonel answered i promised to take some of you down come whos going to help me out wrayson good heneage excellent mason good fellows all of you twotwenty from waterloo flannels and straw hats  the little group broke up and the colonel was hurried off into the committee room wrayson and heneage exchanged dubious glances  a garden party in may the latter remarked  taking time by the forelock a little isnt it  wrayson sighed resignedly  its the colonel he declared we should have to go if it were december     chapter vii  the colonels daughter   after all the garden party was not so bad the weather was perfect and the grounds of shirley house were large enough to find amusement for all the guests wrayson who had made great friends with the colonels younger daughter enjoyed himself immensely after a particularly strenuous set of tennis she led him through the wideopen french windows into a small morningroom  we can rest for a few minutes in here she remarked you can consider it a special mark of favour for this is my own den  you are spoiling me wrayson declared laughing may i see those photographs  if you like she answered only you mustnt be too critical for im only a beginner you know heres a bookful of them you can look through while i go and start the next set  she placed a volume in his hand and swung out of the room tall fresh and graceful wrayson watched her admiringly in her perfect naturalness and unaffected goodhumour she reminded him a good deal of her father but curiously enough there was some other likeness which appealed to him even more powerfully and yet which he was unable to identify it puzzled him so that for a moment or two after her departure he sat watching the door through which she had disappeared with a slight frown upon his forehead she was undoubtedly charming and yet something in connection with her seemed to impress him with an impending sense of trouble everything about her person and manners was frank and girlish and yet she was certainly recalling to his mind things that he had been struggling all the afternoon to forget already he began to feel the clouds of nervousness and depression stealing down upon him he struck the table with his clenched fist he would have none of it outside was the delicious sunshine through the open window stole in the perfume of the roses which covered the wall and mignonette from the trim borders and stocks from the bed fringing the lawn the murmur of pleasant conversation was incessant and musical for a time wrayson had escaped he swore to himself that he would go back no more into bondage that he would dwell no more upon the horrors through which he had lived he would take hold of the pleasant things of life with both hands and grip them tightly a man should be master of his thoughts not the slave of unwilling memories he would choose for himself whither they should lead him he would fight with all his nerve and will against the unholy fascination of those few thrilling hours he looked impatiently towards the door and longed for the return of his late companion that he might continue his halflaughing flirtation then he remembered the album still upon his knee and opened it quickly he had dabbled a little in photography he would find something here to keep his thoughts from the forbidden place and he did indeed find somethingsomething which set his heart thumping and drew all the colour which the sun and vigorous exercise had brought from his cheeks something at which he stared with wideopen eyes which he held before him with trembling nerveless fingers the picture of a woman the picture of her  it had lain loose in the book with its back towards him only chance made him turn it over as he looked he understood there was the likeness such likeness as there may be between a beautiful woman a little sad a little scornful with the faint lines of mockery about her curving lips the worldweary light in her distant eyes and the fresh ingenuous girl with whom he had been bandying pleasantries during the last few hours he had felt it unknowingly he realized it now and the thought of what it might mean made him catch at his breath like a drowning man then she came in  he heard her gay laughter outside a backward word flung to one of the tennis players as she stepped in through the window her cheeks still flushed and her eyes aglow  we really ought to watch this set she declared that is if you are not too much absorbed in my handiwork what have you got there  he held it out to her with a valiant attempt at unconcern  do you mind telling me who this is he asked  she glanced at it carelessly enough but at once her whole expression changed the smile left her lips her eyes filled with trouble  where did you find it she asked in a low tone  in the album he answered it was loose between the pages  she took it gently from his fingers and crossing the room locked it in her desk  i had no idea that it was here she said it is a picture of my eldest sister or rather my stepsister  the change in her manner was so apparent that under ordinary circumstances wrayson would not have dreamed of pursuing the subject but the conventions of life seemed to him small things just then  your stepsister he exclaimed i had no ideashall i meet her this afternoon  no she answered gravely what do you sayshall we go out now  she took up her racket but he lingered  please dont think me hopelessly inquisitive miss fitzmaurice he said but i have really a reason for being very interested in the original of that picture i should like to meet your stepsister  you will never do so here i am afraid she answered my father and she disagreed years ago he does not allow us to see or hear from her we may not even mention her name  your father wrayson remarked thoughtfully is not a stern parent by any means  i should think not she answered smiling dear old dad i have never heard him say an unkind word to any one in my life  and yet wrayson began hesitatingly  do you mind if we dont talk any more about it she interrupted simply i think you can understand that it is not a very pleasant subject do you feel like another set or would you rather do something else  tennis by all means if you are rested he answered we will find our old opponents and challenge them again  wrayson made a supreme effort and his spirits for the rest of the afternoon were almost boisterous yet all the time the nightmare was there behind it crept out whenever he caught sight of his host moving about amongst his guests beaming and kindly his daughter the colonels daughter what was he to do the problem haunted him continually all the time he had to be pushing it back  the guests began to depart at last by seven oclock the last carriage was rolling down the avenue the colonel with a huge smile of relief and a large cigar came and took wraysons arm  good man he exclaimed youve worked like a trojan well have one whisky and soda eh and then ill show you your room say when  ive enjoyed myself immensely wrayson declared miss edith has been very kind to me  im glad youve made friends with her the colonel said shes a harumscarum lot im afraid and a sad chatterbox but shes the right sort of a person for a man with nerves like you youre looking a bit white still i see  wrayson would have spoken then but his tongue seemed to cling to the roof of his mouth he had been asked to bring his clothes and dine and in the minutes solitude while he changed he made a resolute effort to face this new problem there was not the slightest doubt in his mind that the girl whom he had surprised in his rooms ransacking his desk and whom subsequently he had assisted to escape from the mansions was identical with the original of this portrait she was the colonels daughter with a flash of horror he remembered that it had been the colonel himself who had pointed out the possibility of a womans hands having drawn that silken cord together half dressed he sat down in a chair and buried his face in his hands  the dinner gong disturbed him he sprang up tied his tie with trembling fingers and hastily completed his toilet once more with a great effort and an almost reckless resort to his hosts champagne he triumphed over the demons of memory which racked his brain at dinner his gayety was almost feverish edith fitzmaurice who was his neighbour found him a delightful companion only the colonel glanced towards him now and then anxiously he recognized the signs of highpressure and the light in wraysons eyes puzzled him  there were no other men dining and in course of time the two were left alone the colonel passed the cigars and touched the port wine decanter which however he only offered in a halfhearted way  if you dont care about any more wine he said we might have a smoke in the garden  wrayson rose at once  i should like it he said abruptly i dont know how it is but i seem halfstifled today  they passed out into the soft cool night a nightingale was singing somewhere in the elm trees which bordered the garden the air was sweet with the perfume of early summer flowers wrayson drew a long deep breath of content  let us sit down colonel he said i have something to tell you  the colonel led the way to a rustic seat a few stars were out but no moon in the dusky twilight the shrubs and trees beyond stood out with black and almost startling distinctness against the clear sky  you remember the girli told you about whom i found in my flat and afterwards wrayson asked hoarsely  the colonel nodded  certainly what about her to tell you the truth i am afraid i  wrayson stopped him with a quick fierce exclamation  dont colonel he said wait until you have heard what i have to say i have seen her picturetoday  the colonel removed his cigar from his mouth  her picture he exclaimed today where my dear fellow this is very interesting you know my opinion as to that young  again wrayson stopped him this time with an oath  in your house colonel he said your daughter showed it to mein an album  the colonel sat like a man turned to stone the hand which held his cigar shook so that the ash fell upon his waistcoat  go on he faltered  i asked who it was i was told that it was your daughter miss ediths stepsister forgive me colonel i had to tell you  the colonel seemed to have shrunk in his place the cigar slipped from his fingers and fell unheeded on to the grass his mouth trembled and twitched pitifully  mymy daughter louise he faltered wrayson you are not serious  it is gods truth wrayson answered i would stake my soul upon it that the girli told you aboutwas the original of that picture when i look at your daughter edith i can see the likeness  the colonels head was buried in his hands his exclamation sounded like a sob  my god he murmured  then there was silence only the nightingale went on with his song     chapter viii  the baroness intervenes   the baroness trifled with some grapes and looked languidly round the room  my dear louise she declared it is the truth what every one tells me of your country you are a dull people i weary myself here  the girl whom she had addressed as louise shrugged her shoulders  so do i so do all of us she answered a little wearily what would you have one must live somewhere  the baroness sighed and from a chatelaine hung with elegant trifles selected a gold cigarette case an attentive waiter rushed for a match and presented it the baroness gave a little sigh of content as she leaned back in her chair she smoked as one to the manner born  one must live somewhere it is true she agreed but why london i think that of all great cities it is the most provincial it lacks what you call the atmosphere the people are all so polite and so deadly deadly dull how different in paris or berlin even brussels  circumstances are a little against us arent they louise remarked our opportunities for making acquaintances are limited  the baroness made a little grimace  you my young friend she said are of the englishvery english quite saxon in fact with you there would never be any making of acquaintances i feel myself in the bonds of a castiron chaperonage whenever i move out with you why is it little one have you never any desire to amuse yourself  i dont quite understand you her companion answered dryly if you mean that i have no desire to encourage promiscuous acquaintances you are certainly right i prefer to be dull  the baroness sighed gently  some of my dearest friends she murmured i havebut there it is a subject upon which we disagree we will talk of something else shall we go to the theatre tonight  as you will louise answered indifferently there isnt much that we havent seen is there  we will send for a paper and see the baroness said we cannot sit and look at one another all the evening with music one can make dinner last out till nine or even half pastan idea my louise she exclaimed suddenly cannot we go to a musichall the alhambra for example we could take a box and sit back  it is not customary louise declared coldly if you really wish it though i donti dont  her speech was broken off in a somewhat extraordinary manner she was leaning a little forward in her chair all her listlessness and pallor seemed to have been swept away by a sudden rush of emotion the colour had flooded her cheeks her tired eyes were suddenly bright was it with fear or only surprise the baroness wasted no time in asking questions she raised her lorgnettes and turned round facing the direction in which louise was looking coming directly towards them from the further end of the restaurant was a young man whose eyes never swerved from their table he was pale somewhat slight but the lines of his mouth were straight and firm and there was not lacking in him that air of distinction which the baroness never failed to recognize she put down her glasses and looked across at louise with a smile she was quite prepared to approve  the young man stopped at their table and addressed himself directly to louise the baroness frowned as she saw how scanty were the signs of encouragement in her young companions face she leaned a little forward ready at the first signs of an introduction to make every effort to atone for louises coldness by a most complete amiability this young man should not be driven away if she could help it  i have been hoping miss fitzmaurice wrayson said calmly that i might meet you somewhere  she shrank a little back for a moment there flashed across her face a quiver as though of pain  why do you think she asked that that is my name  your father colonel fitzmaurice is one of my best friends he answered gravely i was at his house yesterday i only came up this morning i beg your pardon you are not well  every vestige of colour had left her cheeks the baroness touched her foot under the table and louise found her voice with an effort  how did you know that colonel fitzmaurice was my father she asked breathlessly  i found a picture in your sisters album he answered  the answer seemed somehow to reassure her she leaned a little towards him under cover of the music her voice was inaudible to any one else  mr wrayson she said please dont think me unkind i know that i have a great deal to thank you for and that there are certain explanations which you have almost a right to demand from me and yet i ask you to go away to ask me nothing at all to believe me when i assure you that there is nothing in the world so undesirable as any acquaintance between you and me  wrayson was staggered the words were so earnestly spoken and the look which accompanied them was so eloquent he was never sure when he thought it over afterwards what manner of reply he might not have made to an appeal the genuineness of which was absolutely convincing but before he could frame an answer the baroness intervened  louise she said softly do you not think that this place is a little public for intimate conversation and will you not introduce to me your friend  wrayson who had been afraid of dismissal turned at once almost eagerly towards the baroness she smiled at him graciously louise hesitated for a moment there was no smile upon her lips she bowed however to the inevitable  this is mr wrayson she said quietly the baroness de sturm  the baroness raised her eyebrows and she bestowed upon wrayson a comprehending look the graciousness of her manner however underwent no abatement  i fancy she said that i have heard of you somewhere lately or is it another of the same name will you not sit down and take your coffee with usand a cigaretteyes  we are keeping mr wrayson from his friends no doubt louise said coldly besidesdo you see the time amy  but wrayson had already drawn up a chair to the table  i am quite alone he said if i may stay i shall be delighted  why not the baroness asked passing her cigarette case you can solve for us the problem we were just then discussing is it commeilfaut mr wrayson for two ladies one of whom is almost middleaged to visit a musichall here in london unescorted  wrayson glanced from louise to her friend  may i inquire he asked blandly which is the lady who is posing as being almost middleaged  the baroness laughed at him softly with a little contraction of the eyebrows which she usually found effective  we are going to be friends mr wrayson she declared you are sitting there in fear and trembling and yet you have dared to pay a compliment the first i have heard for oh so many months do not be afraid louise is not so terrible as she seems i will not let her send you away now you must answer my question may we do this terrible thing louise and i  assuredly not he answered gravely when there is a man at hand who is so anxious to offer his escort as i  the baroness clapped her hands  do you hear louise she exclaimed  i hear louise answered dryly  the baroness made a little grimace  you are in an impossible humour my dear child she declared nevertheless i declare for the musichall and for the escort of your friend mr wrayson if he really is in earnest  i can assure you he said that you would be doing me a great kindness in allowing me to offer my services  the baroness beamed upon him amiably and rose to her feet  you have come she avowed in time to save me from despair i am not used to go about so much unescorted and i am not so independent as louise see she added pushing a gold purse towards him you shall pay our bill while we put on our cloaks and will you ask afterwards for my carriage and we will meet in the portico  with pleasure wrayson answered rising to his feet as they left the table i will telephone for a box to the alhambra there is a wonderful new ballet which every one is going to see  he called the waiter and paid the bill from a remarkably wellfilled purse as he replaced the change it was impossible for him to avoid seeing a letter addressed and stamped ready for posting which occupied one side of the gold bag the name upon the envelope struck him as being vaguely familiar what had he heard lately of madame de melbain it was associated somehow in his mind with a recent event it lingered in his memory for days afterwards  louise and the baroness left the room in silence in the cloakroom the latter watched her friend curiously as she arranged her wrap  so that is mr wrayson she remarked  yes louise answered deliberately i wish that you had let him go  the baroness laughed softly  my dear child she protested why he seems to me quite a personable young man and he may be useful who can tell  louise shrugged her shoulders she stood waiting while the baroness made somewhat extensive use of her powderpuff  you forget she said quietly that i am already in mr wraysons debt pretty heavily  the baroness looked quickly around she considered her young friend a little indiscreet  i find you amusing ma chère she remarked since when have you developed scruples  louise turned towards the door  you do not understand she said come     chapter ix  a box at the alhambra   the baroness lowered her lorgnettes and turned towards wrayson  there is a man she remarked in the stalls who finds us apparently more interesting than the performance i do not see very well even with my glasses but i fancy no i am quite sure that his face is familiar to me  wrayson leaned forward from his seat in the back of the box and looked downward there was no mistaking the person indicated by the baroness nor was it possible to doubt his obvious interest in their little party wrayson frowned slightly as he returned his greeting  ah then you know him the baroness declared it is a friend without doubt  he belongs to my club wrayson answered his name is heneage i beg your pardon i hope that wasnt my fault  the baroness had dropped her lorgnettes on the floor she stooped instantly to discover them rejecting almost peremptorily wraysons aid when she sat up again she pushed her chair a little further back  it was my clumsiness entirely she declared ah it is more restful here the lights are a little trying in front you are wiser than i my dear louise to have chosen a seat back there  she turned towards the girl as she spoke and wrayson fancied that there was some subtle meaning in the swift glance which passed between the two almost involuntarily he leaned forward once more and looked downwards heneages inscrutable face was still upturned in their direction there was nothing to be read there not even curiosity as the eyes of the two men met heneage rose and left his seat  you know my friend perhaps wrayson remarked he is rather an interesting person  the baroness shrugged her shoulders  we are cosmopolitans louise and i she remarked we wander about so much that we meet many people whose names even we do not remember is it not so chérie  louise assented carelessly the incident appeared to have interested her but slightly she alone seemed to be taking an interest in the performance which from the first she had followed closely more than once wrayson had fancied that her attention was only simulated in order to avoid conversation  this ballet she remarked is wonderful i dont believe that you people have seen any of ityou especially amy  the baroness glanced towards the stage  my dear louise she said you share one great failing with the majority of your countrypeople you cannot do more than one thing at a time now i can watch and talk truly the dresses are ravishing doucet never conceived anything more delightful than that blend of greens tell me about your mysteriouslooking friend mr wrayson is he too an editor  wrayson shook his head  to tell you the truth he said i know very little about him he is one of those men who seldom talk about themselves he is a barrister and he has written a volume of travels a clever fellow i believe but possibly without ambition at any rate one never hears of his doing anything now  perhaps the baroness remarked with her eyes upon the stage he is one of those who keep their own counsel in more ways than one he does not look like a man who has no object in life  wrayson glanced downwards at the empty stall  very likely he admitted carelessly and yet nowadays it is a little difficult isnt it to do anything really worth doing and not be found out they say that the press is lynxeyed  louise leaned a little forward in her chair  and you she remarked are an editor do you feel quite safe amy mr wrayson may rob us of our most cherished secrets  her eyes challenged his her lips were parted in a slight smile underneath the levity of her remark he was fully conscious of the undernote of serious meaning  i am not afraid of mr wrayson the baroness answered smiling my age and my dressmaker are the only two things i keep entirely to myself and i dont think he is likely to guess either  and you he asked looking into her companions eyes  there are many things she answered in a low tone which one keeps to oneself because confidences with regard to them are impossible and yet  she paused her eyes seemed to be following out the mystic design painted upon her fan  and yet he reminded her under his breath  yet she continued glancing towards the baroness and lowering her voice as though anxious not to be overheard there is something poisonous i think about secrets to have them known without disclosing them would be very oftena great relief  he leaned a little towards her  is that a challenge he asked if i can find out  the colour left her face with amazing suddenness she drew away from him quickly her whisper was almost a moan  no for gods sake no she murmured i meant nothing you must not think that i was speaking about myself  i hoped that you were he answered simply  the baroness turned in her chair as though anxious to join in the conversation at that moment came a knock at the door of the box wrayson rose and opened it heneage stood there and entered at once as though his coming were the most natural thing in the world  thought i recognized you he remarked shaking hands with wrayson i believe too i may be mistaken but i fancy that i have had the pleasure of meeting the baroness de sturm  the baroness turned towards him with a smile nevertheless wrayson noticed what seemed to him a strange thing the slimfingered bejewelled hand which rested upon the ledge of the box was trembling the baroness was disturbed  at brussels i believe she remarked inclining her head graciously  at brussels certainly he answered bowing low  she turned to louise  louise she said you must let me present mr heneagemiss deveney mr heneage has a cousin i believe of the same name in the belgian legation i remember seeing you dance with him at the palace  the two exchanged greetings heneage accepted a chair and spoke of the performance the conversation became general and of stereotyped form yet wrayson was uneasily conscious of something underneath it all which he could not fathom the atmosphere of the box was charged with some electrical disturbance heneage alone seemed thoroughly at his ease he kept his seat until the close of the performance and even then seemed in no hurry to depart wrayson however took his cue from the baroness who was obviously anxious for him to go  goodnight heneage he said i may see you at the club later  heneage smiled a little oddly as he turned away  perhaps he said  it was not until they were on their way out that wrayson realized that she was slipping away from him once more then he took his courage into his hands and spoke boldly  i wonder he said if i might be allowed to see you ladies home i have something to say to miss fitzmaurice he added simply turning to the baroness  by all means she answered graciously if you dont mind rather an uncomfortable seat we are staying in battersea it seems a long way out but it is quiet and louise and i like it  in battersea wrayson repeated vaguely  the baroness looked over her shoulder they were standing on the pavement waiting for their electric brougham  yes she answered dropping her voice a little in frederic mansions by the bye we are neighbours i believe are we not  quite close ones wrayson answered i live in the next block of flats  the baroness looked again over her shoulder  your friend mr heneage is close behind she whispered and we are living so quietly louise and i that we do not care for callers tell the man home simply  wrayson obeyed and the carriage glided off heneage had been within a few feet of them when they had started and although his attention appeared to be elsewhere the baroness caution was obviously justified she leaned back amongst the cushions with a little sigh of relief  mr wrayson she inquired may i ask if mr heneage is a particular friend of yours  wrayson shook his head  i do not think that any man could call himself heneages particular friend he answered he is exceedingly reticent about himself and his doings he is a man whom none of us know much of  the baroness leaned a little forward  mr heneage she said slowly is associated in my mind with days and events which just at present both louise and i are only anxious to forget he may be everything that he should be perhaps i am prejudiced but if i were you i would have as little to do as possible with that man  we do not often meet wrayson answered and ours is only a club acquaintanceship it is never likely to be more  so much the better the baroness declared dont you agree with me louise  i do not like mr heneage the girl answered but then i have never spoken a dozen words to him in my life  you have known him intimately wrayson asked the baroness  she shrugged her shoulders and looked out of the window  never that quite she answered i know enough of him however to be quite sure that the advice which i have given you is good  the carriage drew up in the albert road within a hundred yards or so of wraysons own block of flats the baroness alighted first  you must come in and have a whisky and soda she said to wrayson  if i may he answered looking at louise  the baroness passed on louise with a slight shrug of the shoulders followed her     chapter x  outcast   the room into which a waiting man servant showed them was large and handsomely furnished whisky and soda wine and sandwiches were upon the sideboard the baroness stopping only to light a cigarette moved towards the door  i shall return she said in a quarter of an hour  she looked for a moment steadily at her friend and then turned away louise strolled to the sideboard and helped herself to a sandwich  come and forage wont you she asked carelessly there are some pâté sandwiches here and you want whisky and soda of courseor do you prefer brandy  neither thanks wrayson answered firmly i want what i came for please sit down here and answer my questions  she laughed a little mockingly and turning round faced him her head thrown back her eyes meeting his unflinchingly the light from a roseshaded electric lamp glittered upon her hair she was wearing black again and something in her appearance and attitude almost took his breath away it reminded him of the moment when he had seen her first  first she said i am going to ask you a question why did you do it  do what he asked  she gave vent to a little gesture of impatience he must know quite well what she meant  why did you give evidence at the inquest and omit all mention of me  i dont know he answered bluntly  you have committed yourself to a story she reminded him which is certainly not altogether a truthful one you have run a great risk apparently to shield me why  i suppose because i am a fool he answered bitterly  she shook her head  no she declared that is not the reason  he moved a step nearer to her  if i were to admit my folly he said what difference would it makeif i were to tell you that i did it to save youthe inconvenience of an examination into the motive for your presence in morris barnes rooms that nightwhat then  it was generous of you she declared softly i ought to thank you  i want no thanks he answered almost roughly i want to know that i was justified in what i did i want you to tell me what you were doing there alone in the rooms of such a man with a stolen key and i want you to tell me what you know about his death  is that all she asked  isnt it enough he declared savagely it is enough to be making an old man of me anyhow  you have a right to ask these questions she admitted slowly and i have no right to refuse to answer them  none at all he declared you shall answer them  there was a moments silence she leaned a little further back against the sideboard her eyes were fixed upon his but her face was inscrutable  i cannot she said slowly i can tell you nothing  wrayson was speechless for a moment it was not only the words themselves but the note of absolute finality with which they were uttered which staggered him then he found himself laughing a sound so unnatural and ominous that for the first time fear shone in the girls eyes  dont she cried and her hands flashed towards him for a moment as though the sight of him hurt her dont be angry have pity on me instead  his nerves already overwrought gave way  pity on a murderess a thief he cried not i i have suffered enough for my folly i will go and tell the truth tomorrow it was you who killed him you did it in the cab and stole back to his rooms to robafterwards horrible horrible  her face hardened his lack of selfcontrol seemed to stimulate her  have it so she declared i never asked you for your silence if you repent it go and make the best bargain you can with the law they will let you off cheaply in exchange for your information  he walked the length of the room and back anything to escape from her eyes already he hated the words which he had spoken when he faced her again he was master of himself  listen he said i was a little overwrought i spoke wildly i have no right to make such an accusation but  she held out her hand as though to stop him but he went steadily on  but i have a right to demand that you tell me the truth as to what you were doing in barnes rooms that night and what you know of his death remember that but for me you would have had to tell your story to a less sympathetic audience  i never forget it she answered and for the first time her change to a more natural tone helped him to believe in himself and his own judgment if you want me to tell you how grateful i am i might try but it would be a very hard task  all that i ask of you he pleaded is that you tell me enough to convince me that my silence was justified tell me at least that you had no knowledge of or share in that mans death  i cannot do that she answered  he took a quick step backwards the horror once more was chilling his blood floating before his eyes  you cannot he repeated hoarsely  no i knew that the man was in danger of his life she went on calmly on the whole i think that he deserved to die i do not mind telling you this though i would have saved him if i could  he drew a great breath of relief  you had nothing to do with his actual death then  nothing whatever she declared  it was all i asked you this he cried reproachfully why could you not have told me before  she shook her head  you asked me other things she answered calmly so much of the truth you shall know at any rate i have pleaded not guilty to the material action of drawing that cord around the worthless neck of the man whom you knew as morris barnes i plead guilty to knowing why he was murdered even if i do not know the actual person who committed the deed and i admit that i was in his rooms for the purpose of robbery that is all i can tell you  he drew a little nearer to her  enough do you know what it is that you have said what are you who are you  she shrugged her shoulders somehow from her side at least the tragical note which had trembled throughout their interview had passed away she helped herself to soda water from a siphon on the sideboard  you appear somewhat to my surprise she remarked to know that i wonder at poor little edith giving me away  all that i know is that you are living here under a false name he declared  she shook her head  my mothers she told him the discarded daughter always has a right to that you know  her eyes mocked him he felt himself helpless this was the opportunity for which he had longed and it had come to him in vain he recognized the fact that his defeat was imminent she was too strong for him  i am disappointed he said a little wearily you will not let me believe in you  why should you wish to she asked quickly  almost immediately she bit her lip as though she regretted the words which had escaped her almost involuntarily but he was ready enough with his answer  i cannot tell you that he said gravely i never thought of myself as a particularly emotional person in fact i have always rather prided myself on my common sense that night i think that i went a little mad your appearance you see was so unusual  she nodded  i must have been rather a shock to you she admitted  she watched him closely the fire in his eyes was not yet quenched  yes he said you were a shock and the worst of it isthat you remain one  ah  you mean to keep me at arms length he said slowly to tell me as little as possible and get rid of me i am not sure that i am willing  she only raised her eyebrows she said nothing  you have told me nothing of the things i want to know he cried passionately who and what are you what place do you hold in the world  none she answered quietly i am an outcast  he glanced around him  you are rich  on the contrary she assured him i am nearly a pauper  how do you live then he asked breathlessly  she shrugged her shoulders  why do you ask me these questions she said i cannot answer them whatever my life may be i live it to myself  he leaned a little towards her his breath was coming quickly and she too caught something of the nervous excitement of his manner  there are better things he began  not for me she interrupted quickly i tell you that i am an outcast of you i ask only that you go awaynowbefore the baroness returns and do your best to blot out the memory of that one night from your life remember only that you did a generous action remember that and no more  too late he answered i cannot do it  you are a man she answered and you say that  it is because i am a man and you are what you are that i cannot he answered slowly  there was a moments breathless silence only he fancied that her face had somehow grown softer  you must not talk like that she said you do not know what you are sayingwho or what i am listen i think i hear the baroness  she leaned a little forward and the madness fired his blood half stupefied she yielded to his embrace her lips rested upon his her frightened eyes were half closed his arms held her like a vise he could feel her heart throbbing madly against his how long they remained like it he never knewwho can measure the hours spent in paradise she flung him from her at last taking him by surprise with a sudden burst of energy and before he could stop her she had left the room in her place the baroness was standing upon the threshold dressed in a wonderful blue wrapper and with a cigarette between her teeth she burst into a little peal of laughter as she looked into his distraught face  for an englishman she remarked you are a little rapid in your love affairs my dear mr wrayson is it not so so she has left you planté là  iwas mad wrayson muttered  the baroness helped herself to whisky and soda  come again and make your peace my friend she said you will see no more of her tonight  wrayson accepted the hint and went     chapter xi  false sentiment   with his nerves strung to their utmost point of tension wrayson walked homeward with the unseeing eyes and mechanical footsteps of a man unable as yet fully to collect his scattered senses but for him the events of the evening were not yet over he had no sooner turned the key in the latch of his door and entered his sittingroom than he became aware of the fact that he had a visitor the air was fragrant with tobacco smoke a man rose deliberately from the easychair and throwing the ash from his cigarette into the fire turned to greet him wrayson was so astonished that he could only gasp out his name  heneage he exclaimed  heneage nodded of the two he was by far the more at his ease  i wanted to see you wrayson he said and i persuaded your housekeeperwith some difficultyto let me wait for your arrival can you spare me a few minutes  of course wrayson answered sit down will you have anything  heneage shook his head  not just now thanks  wrayson took off his hat and coat threw them upon the table and lit a cigarette  well he said what is it  i have come heneage said quietly to offer you some very good advice you are run down and you look it you need a change i should recommend a sea voyage the longer the better they say that your paper is making a lot of money why not a voyage round the world  what the devil do you mean wrayson asked  heneage flicked off the ash from his cigarette and looked for a moment thoughtfully into the fire  three weeks ago last thursday i think it was he began reflectively i had supper with austin at the green room club after the theatre he persuaded me rather against my will i remember for i was tired that night to go home with him and make a fourth at bridge austins flat as you know is just below here on the albert road  wrayson stopped smoking the cigarette burned unheeded between his fingers his eyes were fixed upon his visitor  go on he said  we played five rubbers heneage continued still looking into the fire it may have been six i left somewhere in the small hours of the morning and walked along the albert road on the unlit side of the street as i passed the corner here i saw a hansom waiting before your door and youwith somebody else standing on the pavement  anything else wrayson demanded  no heneage answered i saw you i saw the lady and i saw the cab it was a cold morning and i am not naturally a curious person i hurried on  wrayson picked up the cigarette which had fallen from his fingers and sat down he could scarcely believe that this was not a dreamthat it was indeed stephen heneage who sat opposite to him heneage the impenetrable whose calm measured words left no indication whatever as to his motive in making this amazing revelation  you are naturally wondering heneage continued why having seen what i did see i kept silence i followed your lead because i fancied in the first place that the presence of that young lady was a personal affair of your own and that she could have no possible connection with the tragedy itself you were evidently disposed to shield her and yourself at the same time i considered your attitude reasonable if a little dangerous no man is obliged to give himself away in matters of this sort and i am no scandalmonger the situation however has undergone a change  wrayson looked up quickly  what do you mean he asked  tonight heneage said calmly i recognized your nocturnal visitor with the baroness de sturm  and what of that wrayson demanded  heneage who was leaning back in his chair looking into the fire with half closed eyes straightened himself and turned directly towards his companion  how much do you know about the baroness de sturm he asked  nothing at all wrayson answered i met her for the first time tonight  heneage looked back into the fire  ah he murmured i thought that it might be so the young lady is perhaps an old friend  i cannot discuss her wrayson answered i can only say that i will answer for her innocence as regards any complicity in the murder of morris barnes  heneage nodded sympathetically  still he remarked the man was murdered  i suppose so wrayson admitted  and in a most mysterious manner heneage continued you have gathered i dare say from your knowledge of me that these affairs always interest me immensely i am almost as great a crank as the colonel i have been thinking over this case a great deal but i must confess that up to tonight i have not been able to see a gleam of daylight i had dismissed the young lady from my mind now however i cannot do so  simply because you saw her with the baroness de sturm wrayson asked  they are living together heneage reminded him a condition which naturally makes for a certain amount of intimacy  do you know anything against the baroness wrayson demanded  against her heneage repeated thoughtfully well that depends  do you mean to insinuate that she is an adventuress wrayson asked bluntly  certainly not heneage replied she is a representative of one of the oldest families in europe a persona grata at the court of her country and an intimate friend of queen helenas she is by no means an adventuress  then why wrayson asked should you attach such significance to the fact of her friendship with miss deveney  because heneage remarked lighting another cigarette i happen to know that the baroness is at present under the strictest police surveillance  wrayson started heneages first statement had reassured him his later one was simply terrifying he stared at his visitor in dumb alarm  i came to know of this in rather a curious way heneage continued my information in fact came direct from her own country she is being watched with extraordinary care in connection with some affair of which i must confess that i know nothing she is staying in london a city which i happen to know she detests without any ostensible reason of all parts she has chosen battersea as a place of residence it is her companion whom i saw leaving your flat at three oclock on the morning of barnes murder i am bound to say wrayson that i find these facts interesting  why have you come to me wrayson asked what are you going to do about them  i am going to set myself the task of solving the mystery of morris barnes death heneage answered calmly if i succeed i am very much afraid that directly or indirectly the presence of miss deveney in the flats that night will become known  and you advise me therefore wrayson remarked to take a voyagein plain words to clear out  exactly heneage agreed  wrayson threw his cigarette angrily into the fire  what the devil business is it of yours he demanded  heneage looked at him steadily  wrayson he said i am sorry that you should use that tone with me i am no moralist i admit frankly that i take this matter up because my personal tastes prompt me to but murder however great the provocation is an indefensible thing  i am not seeking to justify it wrayson declared  i am glad to hear that heneage answered i cannot believe either that you would shield any one directly or indirectly connected with such a crime i am going to ask you therefore to tell me what miss deveney was doing in these flats on that particular evening  wrayson was silent in the light of what he had just been told about the baroness he knew very well how heneage would regard the truth of course she was innocent innocent of the deed itself and of all knowledge of it but heneage did not know her he would be hard to convince so wrayson shook his head  i can tell you nothing he said i admit frankly my sympathies are not with you i should not say a word likely to bring even inconvenience upon miss deveney  dare you tell me heneage asked calmly that her visit was to you no i thought not he added as wrayson remained silent i believe that that young lady could solve the mystery of morris barnes death if she chose  then wrayson had an idea at any rate the disclosure would do no harm  do you know who miss deveney is he asked  heneage looked across at him quickly  do you  yes she is the eldest daughter of the colonel  our colonel heneage exclaimed  wrayson nodded  her real name is miss fitzmaurice he said her mothers name was deveney  heneage looked incredulous  are you sure about this he asked  absolutely wrayson answered i saw her picture the day of the garden party and i recognized her at once there is no doubt about it whatever she and the baroness were schoolfellows in brussels there is no mystery about their friendship at all  heneage was thoughtful for several moments  this is interesting he said at last but it does not of course affect the situation  you mean that you will go on just the same wrayson demanded  certainly and it rests with you to say whether you will be on my side or theirs heneage declared if you are on mine you will tell me what miss deveney was doing in these flats on that night of all others if you are on theirs you will go and warn them that i am determined to solve the mystery of morris barnes deathat all costs  i had no idea wrayson remarked quietly that you were ambitious to shine as an amateur policeman  we all have our hobbies heneage answered take the colonel for instance the most harmless the most goodnatured man who ever lived nothing in the world fascinates him so much as the details of a tragedy like this however gruesome they may be i have seen him handle a murderers knife as though he loved it his favourite museum is the professional chamber of horrors in scotland yard my own interests run in a slightly different direction i like to look at an affair of this sort as a chess problem and to set myself to solve it i like to make a silent study of all the characters around to search for motives and dissect evidence human nature has its secrets and very wonderful secrets too  i once wrayson said thoughtfully saw a man tracked down by bloodhounds my sympathies were with the man  heneage nodded  your view of life he remarked was always a sentimental one  no correct view wrayson declared can ignore sentiment  granted but it must be true sentiment not false heneage said this sentiment which interferes with justice is false sentiment  justice is altogether an arbitrary a relative phrase wrayson declared i know no more about the case of morris barnes than you do i knew the man by sight and repute and i knew the manner of his life and it seems to me a likely thing that there is more human justice about his death than in the punishing the person who compassed it  there are cases of that sort heneage admitted that is the advantage of being an amateur like myself my discoveries if i make any are my own i am not bound to publish them  wrayson smiled a little bitterly  you would be less than human if you didnt he said  heneage rose to his feet and began putting on his coat wrayson remained in his seat without offering to help him  so i may take it i suppose he said as he moved towards the door that my visit to you is a failure  i have not the slightest idea of running away if that is what you mean wrayson answered i am obliged to you for your warning but what i did i am prepared to stand by  i am sorry heneage answered good night     chapter xii  tidings from the cape   wrayson paused for a moment in his work to answer the telephone which stood upon his table  what is it he asked sharply  his manager spoke to him from the offices below  sorry to disturb you sir but there is a young man here who wont go away without seeing you his name is barnes and he says that he has just arrived from south africa  it was a busy morning with wrayson for in an hour or so the paper went to press but he did not hesitate for a moment  i will see him he declared bring him up yourself  wrayson laid down the telephone morris barnes had come from south africa it was a common name enough and yet from the first he was sure that this was some relative what was the object of his visit the ideas chased one another through his brain was he too an avenger  there was a knock at the door and the clerk from downstairs ushered in his visitor wrayson could scarcely repress a start it was a younger edition of morris barnes who stood there with an ingratiating smile upon his pale face a trifle more semitic in appearance perhaps but in other respects the likeness was almost startling it extended even to the clothes for wrayson recognized with a start a purple and white tie of particularly loud pattern the cut of his coat the glossiness of his hat and boots too were all strikingly reminiscent of the dead man  his visitor was becoming nervous under wraysons close scrutiny his manner betrayed a curious mixture of diffidence and assurance he seemed overanxious to create a favourable impression  i took the liberty of coming to see you mr wrayson he said twisting his hat round in his hand my name is barnes sydney barnes morris barnes was my brother  wrayson pointed to a chair into which his visitor subsided with exaggerated expressions of gratitude he had very small black eyes set very close together and he blinked continually the more wrayson studied him the less prepossessing he found him  what can i do for you mr barnes he asked quietly  i have just come from cape town the young man said such a shock it was to meabout my poor brother oh such a shock  how did you hear about it wrayson asked  just a newspaperi read an account of it all it did give me a turn and no mistake directly id finished i went and booked my passage on the dunottar castle i had a very fair berth over theretwo quid a week but i felt i must come home at once fact is he continued looking down at his trousers i had no time to get my own togs together i was so anxious you see thats why im wearing some of poor morriss  are you the only relative wrayson asked  pon my sam i am the other answered with emphasis we hadnt a relation in the world father and mother died ten years ago and morris and i were the only two anything that poor morris possessed belongs to me sure theres no one else to claim a farthings worth you must know that yourself mr wrayson eh  if as you say you are the only relative your brothers effects of course belong to you wrayson answered  its a sure thing the young man declared ive been to the landlord of the flat and he gave me up the keys at once theres only one quarters rent owing pretty stiff thoughisnt it fifty pounds  your brothers was a furnished flat i believe wrayson answered that makes a difference of course  the young mans face fell  then the furniture wasnt his he remarked  wrayson shook his head  no the furniture belongs to the landlord there will be an inventory of course and you will be able to find out if anything was your brothers  it was obvious that mr sydney barnes had not as yet entered upon the purpose of his visit he fidgeted for a moment or two with his hat and looked up at wrayson only to look nervously away again to set him more at his ease wrayson lit a cigarette and passed the box over  thank you mr wrayson thank you sir his visitor exclaimed you see im a smoker he added holding up his yellowstained forefinger that is i smoke when i can afford to things have been pretty dicky out in south africa lately you know terrible hard it has been to make a living  your brother was supposed to have done pretty well out there wrayson remarked more for the sake of keeping the conversation alive than anything the effect of his words however was electrical mr sydney barnes leaned over from his chair and his little black eyes twinkled like polished beads  mr wrayson he declared a week before he sailed for england morris was on his uppers he was caught in johannesburg when the war broke out and he had to stay there when he turned up in cape town again his own mother wouldnt have known him he was in ragshed come down on a freighthe hadnt a scrap of luggage or a copper to his name that was morris when he came to me in cape town  wrayson was listening attentively he almost feared to let his visitor see how interested he was  he was fair done in the young man continued he never had the pluck of a chicken and the night he found me in cape town he cried like a baby he had lost everything he said it was no use staying in the country any longer he was wild to get back to england and yet do you know sir all the time i had the idea that he was keeping something back from me and he was he was too the  he stopped short the vindictiveness of his countenance supplied the epithet  youll excuse me if im a bit excited mr wrayson he continued ill leave you to judge how ive been served when you hear all he got over me and i lent him nearly half of my savings and he started back to england he took this flat at two hundred pounds a year the very week he got back and hes lived from what i can hear like a lord ever since will you believe this sir he sent back the money he borrowed from me a quid at a time and wrote me to say he was saving it with great difficultyout of his salary of three pounds a week when hed paid back the lot i never heard another line from him i was doing rotten myself and he knew well enough that i should have been over first steamer if id known about his two hundred a year flat and all the rest of it what do you think of my brother sir eh what do you think of him treated me nicely didnt he nine pounds ten it was i lent him and nine pounds ten was all i had back and here he was living like a duke and lying to me about his three pounds a week and there was i hawkering groceries on a barrow selling sham diamonds any blooming thing to get a mouthful to eat nice sort of brother that eh what  wrayson repressed an inclination to smile there was something grimly humourous about his visitors indignation  you must remember he said that your brother is dead and that his death itself was a terrible one besides even if you have had to wait for a little time you are his heir now  the young man was breathing hard the perspiration stood out in little beads upon his forehead he showed his teeth a little he was becoming more and more unpleasant to look upon as his excitement increased  look here mr wrayson he exclaimed im coming to that ive been through his things clothes i never saw such a collection all from a west end tailor too and boots patent with white tops pumps everything slap up heaven knows what he must have spent upon his clothes bills from restaurants too why he seems to have thought nothing of spending a quid or two on a dinner or a supper photographs of ladies little notes asking him to tea why between you and me mr wrayson sir he was living like a prince and look here  he rose to his feet and planked down a bankbook on the desk in front of wrayson  look here sir he declared every three months within a day or two cashfive hundred pounds here you are heres the last march 27cash £500 look back january 1by cash £500 october 2cash £500 there you are right back to the very day he arrived in england and he left south africa with ten bob of mine in his pocket after hed paid his passage and from what i can hear he never did a days work after he landed and me over there working thirteen and fourteen hours a day and half the time stonybroke theres a brother for you cain was a fool to him  but you must remember that after all you are going to reap the benefit of it now wrayson remarked  ah but am i the young man exclaimed fiercely thats what i want to know look here ive been through every letter and every scrap of paper i can find ive been to the bank and to his few pals and strike me dead if i can find where that five hundred pounds came from every three months it was in gold always he must have gone and changed it somewherefive hundred golden sovereigns every three months and i cant find where they came from  have you been to a solicitor wrayson asked  not yet the young man answered i dont see what good hell be when i do morris was always one of the close sort and i cant fancy him spending much over lawyers  what made you come to me wrayson inquired  well the caretaker at the flat told me that you and morris used to speak now and then and im trying every one im afraid he wasnt quite classy enough for you to have palled up with but i thought he might have let something slip perhaps  wrayson shook his head  he never spoke to me of his affairs he said he always seemed to have plenty of money though  doesnt the bankbook prove it the young man exclaimed excitedly every one who knew anything about him says the same there was i half starved in cape town and here was he spending two thousand a year beast he was ill find out where it came from if it takes me a lifetime  wrayson leaned back in his chair nothing since the events of that night itself had appealed to him more than the coming of this young man and his strange story  i am sorry that i have no information to give you he said on the other hand if i can help you in any other way i shall be very glad  what should you advise me to do the young man asked  i should like to think the matter over carefully wrayson answered what are your engagements for today can you lunch with me  i have no engagements his visitor answered eagerly when and what time  wrayson repressed a smile  i shall be ready in twenty minutes he answered we will go out together if you dont mind waiting  im on mr sydney barnes declared crossing his legs dont you hurry on my account ill wait as long as you like     chapter xiii  searching the chambers   wrayson took his guest to a popular restaurant where there was music and a fivecourse luncheon for three and six their conversation during the earlier part of the meal was limited for mr sydney barnes showed himself possessed of an appetite which his host contemplated with respectful admiration his sallow cheeks became flushed and his nervousness had subsided long before the arrival of the coffee  i say this is all right this place is he said leaning back in his chair with a large cigar between his teeth jolly expensive i suppose isnt it  wrayson smiled  it depends he answered i dont suppose your brother would have found it so a bachelor can do himself pretty well on two thousand a year  i only hope i get hold of it mr sydney barnes declared fervently this is the way i should like to live this is  i hope you will wrayson answered an income of that sort could scarcely disappear into thin air could it by the bye mr barnes that reminds me of a very important circumstance which up to now we have not mentioned i mean the way your brother met with his death  the young man nodded thoughtfully  ah he remarked he was murdered wasnt he some one must have owed him a nasty grudge morris always was a one to make enemies  i dont know whether the same thing has occurred to you wrayson continued but i cant help wondering whether there may not have been some connection between his death and that mysterious income of his  ive thought of that myself the young man declared all the same i cant see what he could have carried about with him worth two thousand a year  exactly wrayson answered but you see the matter stands like this he was in receipt of about £500 every three months as his bankbook proves this sum would represent five per cent interest on forty thousand pounds now considering your brothers position when he left you at cape town and the fact that you cannot discover at his bankers or elsewhere any documents alluding to property or shares of any sort one can scarcely help dismissing the hypothesis that this payment was the result of dividends or interest at any rate let us put that out of the question for the moment your brother received five hundred pounds every three months from some one people dont give money away for nothing nowadays you know from whom and for what services did he receive that money  mr sydney barnes looked puzzled  ask me another he remarked facetiously  you do not know of any secrets i suppose which your brother may have stumbled into possession of  not i he went about with his eyes open and his mouth closed but i never heard of his having that sort of luck  he could not have had any adventures on the steamer for he came back steerage wrayson continued thoughtfully and he was in funds almost from the moment he landed in england i am afraid mr barnes that he must have been deceiving you in cape town  if i could only have a dozen words with him the young man muttered savagely  it would be useful wrayson admitted but unfortunately it is out of the question either he was deceiving you or he was in possession of something which turned out far more valuable than he had imagined  if so where is it mr sydney barnes demanded if it was worth that to him it may be to me  exactly wrayson remarked but the question of your brothers murder comes in there people dont commit a crime like that for nothing you know if it was information which your brother had it died with him if it was documents they were probably stolen by the person who killed him  come thats cheerful the young man declared ruefully if youre guessing right where do i come in  im afraid you dont come in wrayson answered but remember i am only following out a surmise have you looked through your brothers papers carefully  ive gone through em all mr sydney barnes answered but of course i was looking for scrip or a memorandum of investments or something of that sort perhaps if a clever chap like you were to go through them you might come across a clue  it seems hard to believe that he shouldnt have left something of the sort behind him wrayson answered it might be only an address or a name or anything  will you come round with me and see mr barnes demanded eagerly it wouldnt take you long youre welcome to see everything there is there  wrayson called for the bill  very well he said we will take a hansom round there at once  they left the place a few minutes later and drove to battersea  theres a quarter to run the landlord says so im staying here barnes explained as he unlocked the front door i cant afford a servant or anything of that sort of course but i shall just sleep here  the rooms had a ghostly and unkempt appearance the atmosphere of the sittingroom was stuffy and redolent of stale tobacco smoke wraysons first action was to throw open the window  there isnt a sign of a paper anywhere except in that desk the young man remarked youll find things in a mess but whatever was there is there now ive destroyed nothing  wrayson seated himself before the desk and began a careful search there were restaurant bills without number and a variety of ladies cards more or less soiled there were empire and alhambra programmes a bundle of racing wires and an account from a bookmaker showing a small debit balance there were other miscellaneous bills a plaintive epistle from a lady signing herself flora and begging for the loan of a fiver for a week and an invitation to tea from a spinster who called herself poppy amongst all this mass of miscellaneous documents there were only three which wrayson laid on one side for further consideration one of these was a note dated from the adelphi a few days before the tragedy and written in a stiff legal hand it contained only a few lines  dear sir  my client will be happy to meet you at any time on thursday you may be pleased to appoint either here or at your own address please reply making an appointment by return of post  yours faithfully  w bentham  the second document was also in the shape of a letter from a firm of private detective agents and was dated only a day earlier than the lawyers letter it ran as follows  my dear sir  in reply to your inquiry our charges for watching a single person in london only are three guineas a day including all expenses for that sum we can guarantee that the person with whose movements you desire to keep in touch will be closely shadowed from roof to roof so long as the person remains within seven miles of charing cross a daily report will be made to you and should legal proceedings ensue from any information procured by us you may rely upon any witness whom we might place in the box  trusting to hear from you  we are yours sincerely  mckenna  foulds  the third document which wrayson had preserved was the cunard sailing list for the current month the plan of a steamer which sailed within a week of the murder and a few lines from the steamship office respecting accommodation  these at any rate will give you something to do wrayson remarked you can go to the lawyer and find out who his client was who desired to see your brother there is a chance there you can go to mckenna  foulds and find out who it was whom he wanted shadowed and you can go to the cunard office and see whether he really intended sailing for america  mr sydney barnes looked a little doubtful  i suppose he suggested timidly you couldnt spare the time to go round to these places with me you see im not much class over here even in morriss togs theyd take more notice of you being a gentleman good god whats that  both men had started for the sound was unexpected some one was fitting a latchkey into the door     chapter xiv  the dead mans brother   at the sight of the two men who awaited her entrance the baroness stopped short whatever alarm or surprise she may have felt at their presence was effectually concealed from them by the thick veil which she wore through which her features were undistinguishable as though purposely she left to them the onus of speech  wrayson took a quick step towards her  baroness he exclaimed what are youi beg your pardon but what are you doing here  she raised her veil and looked at them both attentively in her hand she still held the latchkey by means of which she entered  do you know she answered quietly i was just going to ask you the same thing  our presence is easily explained wrayson answered this is mr sydney barnes the brother of the mr barnes who used to live here he is keeping the flat on for a short time  the baroness was surprised and showed it without a moments hesitation however she accepted wraysons words as an introduction to the young man and held out her hand to him with a brilliant smile  i am very glad to meet you mr barnes she said even under such painful circumstances i knew your brother very well and i have heard him speak of you  illustration at the sight of the two men the baroness stopped short  mr sydney barnes did not attempt to conceal his surprise he shook hands with the baroness however and regarded her with undisguised admiration  well this licks me he exclaimed frankly do you mean to say that you were a friend of morriss  certainly the baroness answered why not  oh i dont know the young man declared im getting past being surprised at anything i suppose its the oof that makes the difference a friend of morriss you said why perhaps he hesitated and glanced towards wrayson  there is no harm in asking the baroness at any rate wrayson said the fact of the matter is he continued turning towards her that mr sydney barnes here finds himself in a somewhat extraordinary position he is the sole relative and heir of his brother and he has come over here from south africa naturally enough to take possession of his effects now there is no doubt from his bankbook and his manner of life that morris barnes was possessed of a considerable income according to his bankbook it was £2000 a year  the baroness nodded thoughtfully  he told me once that he was worth as much as that she remarked  exactly but the curious part of the affair is that up to the present mr sydney barnes has been unable to discover the slightest trace of any investments or any sum of money whatever now can you help us did morris barnes ever happen to mention to you in what direction his capital was invested did he ever give you any idea at all as to the source of his income  the baroness stood quite still as though lost in thought wrayson watched her with a curious sense of fascination he knew very well that the subtle brain of the woman was occupied in no fruitless attempt at reminiscence he was convinced that the baroness had never exchanged a single word with morris barnes in her life she was thinking her way through this problemhow best to make use of this unexpected tool their eyes met and she smiled faintly she judged rightly that wrayson at any rate was not deceived  i cannot give you any definite information she said at last but  she hesitated and the young mans eagerness escaped all bounds  but what he cried leaning breathlessly towards her you know something what is it go on go on  i think that if i can remember it she continued i can tell you the name of the solicitor whom he employed  the young man dashed his fist upon the table he was pale almost to the lips  by god you must remember it he cried dont say youve forgotten its most important two thousand a yearpounds think  she turned towards wrayson she wished to conciliate him but the young man was not a pleasant sight  it was something like benton she suggested  wrayson glanced downward at one of the three documents which he had preserved  bentham he exclaimed was that it  the face of the baroness cleared at once  of course it was how stupid of me to have forgotten his offices are somewhere in the adelphi  barnes caught up his hat  where is that he exclaimed im off  wrayson held out his hand  wait a moment he said there is no hurry for an hour or so this affair may not be quite so simple after all  why not the young man demanded fiercely its my money isnt it i can take out letters of administration it belongs to me hell have to give it up  in the long run i should say that he willif he has it wrayson answered but before you go to him remember this he has seen the account of your brothers death he did not appear at the inquest he has taken no steps to discover his next of kin both of these proceedings were part of his natural duty  mr wrayson is quite right the baroness remarked mr bentham has not behaved as an honest man he will have to be treated firmly but carefully you are a little excited just now wait for an hour or so and perhaps mr wrayson will go with you  barnes turned towards him eagerly and wrayson nodded  yes ill go he said i know mr bentham slightly he once paid me rather a curious visit but never mind that now  was it in connection with this affair the baroness asked him quietly  wrayson affected not to hear he passed his cigarette case to barnes who was stamping up and down the room muttering to himself  look here youd better have a smoke and calm down young man he said its no use going to see bentham in a state like this  the young man threw himself into a chair suddenly he sat up again and addressed the baroness  i say he exclaimed how is it that you have a key to this flat what did you come here for this afternoon  the baroness laughed softly  well i got the key from the landlord a few days ago i told him that i might take the flat and he told me to come in and look at it and return the keywhich you see i havent done to be quite honest with you though i had another reason for coming here  the young man looked at her with mingled suspicion and admiration she had raised her veil now and even wrayson was aware that he had scarcely realized how beautiful a woman she was her tailormade gown of dark green cloth fitted her to perfection she was turned out with all that delightful perfection of detail which seems to be the frenchwomans heritage her smile half pathetic half appealing was certainly sufficient to turn the head of a dozen young men such as sydney barnes  i have told you she continued that your brother and i used to be very good friends i wrote him now and then some rather foolish letters he promised to destroy them butmen are so foolish you know sometimesi was never quite sure that he had kept his word and i meant to take this opportunity of looking for myself that he had not left them about you do not blame me mr sydney you are not cross  he kept his eyes upon her as though fascinated  no he said no i mean of course not  these letters she continued you have not seen them mr sydney no or you mr wrayson  we have not come across any letters at all answering to that description wrayson assured her  the baroness glanced across at barnes who was certainly regarding her in somewhat peculiar fashion  why does mr sydney look at me like that she asked with a little shrug of the shoulders he does not think that i came here to steal why mr sydney she added i am very very much richer than ever your brother was  richerthan he was richer than two thousand a year he gasped  the baroness laughed softly but heartily she stole a sidelong glance at wrayson  why my dear young man she said it costs meoh quite as much as that each year to dress  barnes looked at her as though she were something holy when he spoke there was awe in his tone the problem which had formed itself in his thoughts demanded expression  and you say that you were a pali mean a friend of morriss you wrote him letters  the baroness smiled  why not she exclaimed women have queer tastes you know we like all sorts of men i think i must ask mr wrayson to bring you in to tea one afternoon would you like to come  yes he answered  she nodded a farewell and turned to wrayson  as for you she said under her breath you had better come soon if you want to make your peace with louise  may i come this afternoon he asked  she nodded and held out her exquisitely gloved hand  i knew you were going to be an ally she murmured under her breath dont let the others get hold of him  she was gone before wrayson could ask for an explanation the others if only he could discover who they were  he turned back into the room  do you mind coming down into my flat for a moment barnes he asked i want to telephone to the office before i go out with you again  the young man followed him heavily he seemed a little dazed in wraysons sittingroom he stood looking about him as though appraising the value of the curios pictures and engravings with which the apartment was crowded wrayson while waiting for his call watched him curiously in his present state his vulgarity was perhaps less glaringly apparent but his lack of attractiveness was accentuated his ears seemed to have grown larger his pinched semitic features more repulsive and his complexion sallower he was pitchforked into a world of which he knew nothing and he seemed stunned by his first contact with it only one thing remainedthe greed in his eyes they seemed to have grown narrower and brighter with desire  he did not speak until they were in the cab then he turned to wrayson  i say he exclaimed what was her name  wrayson smiled  the baroness de sturm he answered  baroness real baroness all ok i suppose  without a doubt wrayson answered  and morris knew hershe wrote letters to him he continued a womanlike that  he was silent for several moments it was obvious that his opinion of his brother was rising rapidly his tone had become almost reverential  ive got to find where that money is he said abruptly if i go through fire and water to get it ill have it ill keep on morriss flat ill go to his tailor illyoure laughing at me but i mean it ive had enough of grubbing along on nothing a week and living in the gutters i want a bit of morriss luck  wrayson put his head out of the cab the young mans face was not pleasant to look at  we are there he said come along     chapter xv  the lawyers suggestion   the offices of mr bentham were situated at the extreme end of a dingy depressing looking street which ran from the adelphi to the embankment gardens it was a street of private hotels which no one had ever heard of and where apparently no one ever stayed a few cranky institutions existing under the excuse of charity had their offices there and a firm of publishers whose glory was of the past still dragged out their uncomfortable and profitless existence in a building whose dusty windows and smokestained walls sufficiently proclaimed their fast approaching extinction they found the name of mr bentham upon a rusty brass plate outside the last building in the street with the additional intimation that his offices were upon the first floor there they found him without clerks without even an errand boy in a large bare apartment overlooking the embankment the room was darkened by the branches of one of a row of elm trees and the windows themselves were curtainless there was no carpet upon the floor no paper upon the walls no rows of tin boxes none of the usual surroundings of a lawyers office the solicitor who had bidden them enter did not at first offer them any salutation he paused in a letter which he was writing and his eyes rested for a moment upon wrayson and for a second or two longer upon his companion  good afternoon mr bentham wrayson said my name is wraysonyou remember me i daresay  i remember you certainly mr wrayson the lawyer answered his eyes were resting once more upon sydney barnes  this wrayson explained is mr sydney barnes a brother of the mr morris barnes who was i believe a client of yours  scarcely the lawyer murmured a client of mine although i must confess that i was anxious to secure him as one possibly if he had lived a few more hours the epithet would have been in order  wrayson nodded  from a letter which we found in mr barnes desk he remarked we concluded that some business was pending between you hence our visit  mr bentham betrayed no sign of interest or curiosity of any sort  i regret he said that i cannot offer you chairs i am not accustomed to receive my clients here if you care to be seated upon that form pray do so  wrayson glanced at the form and declined sydney barnes seemed scarcely to have heard the invitation his eyes were glued upon the lawyers face  will you tell me precisely mr bentham said in what way i can be of service to you  i want to know where my brothers money is barnes declared stepping a little forward two thousand a year he had weve seen it in his bankbook five hundred pounds every quarter day and we cant find a copper you were his lawyer or were going to be you must have known something about his position  mr bentham looked straight ahead with still impassive face no trace of the excitement in sydney barnes face was reflected in his features  two thousand a year he repeated calmly it was really as much as that was it your brother had i believe once mentioned the amount to me i had no idea though that it was quite so large  i am his heir the young man declared feverishly ill take my oath theres no one else im going to take out letters of administration he hadnt another relation on gods earth  mr bentham regarded the young man thoughtfully  have you any idea mr barnes he asked as to the source of this income  of course i havent barnes answered thats why were here you must know something about it  your brother was not my client the lawyer said slowly if his death had not been quite so sudden i think that he might have been as it is i know very little of his affairs i am afraid that i can be of very little use to you  you must know something barnes declared doggedly you must tell us what you do know  your brother was mr bentham said a very remarkable man has it never occurred to you mr barnes that this two thousand a year might have been money received in payment of services renderedmight have been in short in the nature of a salary  not likely barnes answered contemptuously morris did no work at all he did nothing but just enjoy himself and spend money  nothing but enjoy himself and spend money mr bentham repeated ah did you see a great deal of your brother during the last few years  i saw nothing of him at all i was out in south africa i have only just got back not but that id been here long ago the young man added with a note of exasperation in his tone if id had any idea of the luck he was in why i lent him a bit to come back with though i was only earning thirty bob a week and the brute only sent it me back in bits and not a farthing over  that was not considerate of him mr bentham agreednot at all considerate your brother had the command of considerable sums of money in fact mr barnes i may tell you without any breach of confidence i think that if he had kept his appointment with me on the night when he was murdered i was prepared on behalf of my client to hand him a cheque for ten thousand pounds  barnes struck the table before him with his clenched fist  for what he cried hysterically ten thousand pounds for what  your brother mr bentham said calmly was possessed of securities which were worth that much or even more to my client  and where are they now barnes gasped  i do not know mr bentham answered if you can find them i think it very likely that my client might make you a similar offer  it was the first ray of hope barnes moistened his dry lips with his tongue and drew a long breath  securities he muttered what sort of securities  there unfortunately mr bentham said i am unable to help you i am an agent only in the matter they were securities which my client was anxious to buy and your brother was not unwilling to sell for cash notwithstanding the income which they were bringing him in  but how can i look for them if i dont know what they are barnes protested  there are difficulties certainly the lawyer admitted carefully polishing his spectacles with the corner of a silk handkerchief but then as you have doubtless surmised the whole situation is a difficult one  you can get to know barnes exclaimed your client would tell you  mr bentham sighed gently  of course he said i am only quoting my own opinion but i do not think that my client would do anything of the sort these securities happen to be of a somewhat secret nature your brother was in a position to make an exceedingly clever use of them it appears incidentally to have cost him his life but there are risks of course in every profession  barnes stared at him with wideopen eyes he seemed for the moment struck dumb wrayson who had been silent during the greater part of the conversation turned towards the lawyer  you believe then he asked that morris barnes was murdered for the sake of these securities  i believenothing the lawyer answered it is not my business to believe mr morris barnes was in the receipt of an income of two thousand a year which we might call dividend upon these securities my client through me made mr barnes a cash offer to buy them outright and although i must admit that mr barnes had not closed with us yet i believe that he was on the point of doing so he had doubtless had it brought home to him that there was a certain amount of danger associated with his position generally the night on which my client arrived in england was the night upon which mr morris barnes was murdered the inference to be drawn from this circumstance i can leave i am sure to the common sense of you two gentlemen  first then wrayson said it would appear that he was murdered by the people who were paying him two thousand a year and who were acting in opposition to your client  mr bentham shrugged his shoulder gently  it does not sound unreasonable he admitted  and secondly wrayson continued if that was so he was probably robbed of these securities at the same time  now that also mr bentham said smoothly sounds reasonable but as a matter of fact he continued looking down upon the table there are certain indications which go to disprove it my personal opinion is that the assassingranted that there was an assassin and granted that he was acting on behalf of the parties we have referred tomet with a disappointment  in plain words wrayson interrupted you mean that the other side have not possessed themselves of the securities  they certainly have not mr bentham declared they still remainthe property by inheritance of this young gentleman heremr sydney barnes i believe  his tone was so even so expressionless that its slightest changes were noticeable it seemed to wrayson that a faint note of sarcasm had crept into these last few words mr barnes himself however was quite oblivious of it his yellowstained fingers were spread out upon the table he leaned over towards the lawyer his under lip protruded his deepset eyes seemed closer than ever together he was grimly tragically in earnest  look here he said what can i do to get hold of em i dont care what it is im game ill deal with your manthe cash client ill give you a commission see five per cent on all i get hows that ill play fair now chuck away all this mystery what were these securities where shall i start looking for them  mr bentham regarded him with stony face there are certain points he said upon which i cannot enlighten you my duty to my client forbids it i cannot describe to you the nature of those securities i cannot suggest where you should look for them all that i can say is that they are still to be found and that my client is still a buyer  the young man turned to wrayson his face was twitching with some emotion probably anger  did you ever hear such bally rot he exclaimed he knows all about these securities all right they belong to me he ought to be made to tell  wrayson shrugged his shoulders  it does seem rather a wildgoose chase doesnt it he remarked cant you tell him a little more mr bentham  mr bentham sighed as though his impotence were a matter of sincere regret to him  the only advice i can offer mr barnes he said is that he induce you to aid him in his search between you i should never be surprised to hear of your success  and why wrayson asked should you consider me such a useful ally  mr bentham looked at him steadily for a moment  you appear to me he said to be a young man of intelligenceand you know how to keep your own counsel i should consider mr barnes very fortunate if you could make up your mind to aid him in his search  it is not my affair wrayson answered stiffly i could not possibly pledge myself to enter upon such a wildgoose chase  mr bentham turned over some papers which lay upon the table before him he had apparently had enough of the conversation  you must not call it exactly that mr wrayson he said mr barnes success in his quest would probably result in an act of justice to society to you personally i should imagine it would be expressly interesting  what do you mean wrayson asked quickly  the lawyer looked at him calmly  it should solve the mystery of morris barnes murder he answered  wrayson touched his companion on the shoulder  i think that we might as well go he said mr bentham does not mean to tell us anything more  barnes moved slowly towards the door but with reluctance manifested in his sullen face and manner  i dont know how im going to set about this job he said turning once more towards the lawyer i shall do what i can but you havent seen the last of me yet mr bentham if i fail i shall come back to you  the lawyer shrugged his shoulders he was already absorbed in other work     chapter xvi  a dinner in the strand   wrayson was conscious from the moment they left mr benthams office of a change in the deportment of the young man who walked by his side a variety of evil passions had developed one at least more tolerablehe was learning the lesson of selfrestraint he did not speak until they reached the corner of the street  where can we get a drink he asked almost abruptly i want some brandy  wrayson took him to a bar close by they sat in a quiet corner  i want to ask you something he said leaning halfway over the little table between them how much do you know about the lady who came into my brothers flat when we were there  the direct significance of the question startled wrayson this young man was beginning to think  how much do i know of her he repeated very little  she is really a baronessnot one of these fakedup ones  she is undoubtedly the baroness de sturm wrayson answered a little stiffly  and she has plenty of coin  certainly wrayson answered she is a great lady i believe in her own country  barnes struck the table softly with the flat of his hand his eyes were searching for his answer in wraysons face almost before the words had left his lips  do you believe then he asked that a woman like that wrote loveletters to morris you knew morris he was what those sort of people call a bounder same as me if he knew her at all it was a wonder i cant believe in the loveletters  wrayson shrugged his shoulders  the whole affair he declared everything connected with your brother is so mysterious that i really dont know what to say  you knew morris the young man persisted you know the baroness set em down side by side they dont go eh you know that morris could tog himself up as much as he liked and he was always a good un at that when he had the brass but hed never be able to make himself her sort and if shes a real lady and wasnt after the brass then i dont believe that she ever wrote him loveletters what  wrayson said nothing the young man held out his empty glass to a waiter  more brandy he ordered briefly look here mr wrayson he added adopting once more his mysterious manner those loveletters dont go what did the baroness want in my brothers flat she struck me dumb when i first saw her i admit it id have swallowed anything more fool me i tell you though im not having any more will you come along with me to her house now and see if we cant make her tell us the truth  wrayson shook his head deliberately  mr barnes he said i am sorry to disappoint you and i sympathize very much with your position but you mustnt take it for granted that i am shall we say your ally in this matter i havent either the time or the patience to give to investigations of this sort i have done what i could for you and i will give you what advice i can or help you in any way if you care to come and see me but you mustnt count on anything else  barnes face dropped he was obviously disappointed  you wont come and see the baroness with me even he asked  i think not wrayson answered to tell you the truth i dont think that it would be of any use even if your suspicions are correctand you scarcely know what you suspect do youthe baroness is much too clever a woman to allow herself to be pumped by either you or me  wrayson felt himself subjected for several moments to the scrutinizing stare of those blinking unpleasant eyes  youre not taking her side against me are you barnes asked distrustfully  certainly not wrayson answered impatiently you must be reasonable my young friend i have done what i can to put you in the way of helping yourself but i am a busy man i have my own affairs to look after and i cant afford to play the part of a twentiethcentury don quixote  i understand the young man said slowly you are going to turn me up  you are putting a very foolish construction upon what i have said wrayson answered irritably i have gone out of my way to help you but frankly i think that yours is a wildgoose chase  barnes rose to his feet and finished his brandy  i dont believe it he declared im going to have that two thousand a year if i have to take that man bentham by the throat and strangle the truth out of him if i cant find out without ill make him tell me the truth if i swing for it by god i will  they left the place together and walked towards the corner of the street  i shouldnt do anything rash if i were you wrayson said i fancy youd find bentham a pretty tough sort to tackle you must excuse me now i am going into the club for a few minutes  how are you wrayson a quiet voice asked behind  wrayson turned round abruptly it was stephen heneage who had greeted himthe one man whom at that moment he was least anxious to meet of any person in the world already he could see that heneage was taking quiet but earnest note of his companion  wrayson nodded a little abruptly and left barnes without any further farewell  coming round to the club he asked  heneage assented and glanced carelessly behind at barnes who was walking slowly in the opposite direction  whos your friend he asked you shook him off a little suddenly didnt you  he is not a friend wrayson answered and i was trying to get rid of him when you came up he is nobody of any account  heneage shook his head thoughtfully  it wont do wrayson he said that young man possessed a cast of features which are positively unmistakable  what do you mean wrayson demanded  i mean that he was a relation and a near relation too i should imagine of our deceased friend morris barnes heneage answered coolly i shall be obliged to make that young mans acquaintance  damn you and your prying wrayson exclaimed angrily i wish  he stopped abruptly heneage was already retracing his steps  wrayson after a moments indecision went on to the club and made his way at once to the billiardroom the colonel was sitting in his usual corner chair watching a game of pool beaming upon everybody with his fatherly smile encouraging the man who met with ill luck and applauding the successful shots he was surrounded by his cronies but he held out his hand to wrayson who leaned against the wall by his side and waited for his opportunity  colonel he said at last in his ear taking advantage of the applause which followed a successful shot i want half an hours talk with you quite by ourselves can you slip away and come and dine with me somewhere  the colonel looked dubious  im afraid they wont like it he answered freddy and george are here and tempests coming in later  i cant help it wrayson answered you can guess what its about its a serious matter  the colonel sighed  we might find an opportunity later on he suggested  it wont do wrayson answered i want to get right away from here i wouldnt bother you if it wasnt necessary  im sure you wouldnt the colonel admitted well slip away quietly when this game is over it wont be long good shot freddy sixpence you divide  they found themselves in the strand about half an hour later  where shall we go wrayson asked somewhere quiet  across the way the colonel answered we shant see any one we know there  wrayson nodded and they crossed the street and entered luigis it was early for diners and they found a small table in a retired corner wrayson ordered the dinner and then leaned across the table towards his guest  its that barnes matter colonel he said quietly heneage has taken it up and means going into it thoroughly he saw me letting out your daughter that night  the colonel was in the act of helping himself to hors doeuvre his fork remained suspended for a moment in the air then he set it down with trembling fingers the cheery light had faded from his face he seemed suddenly older his voice sounded unnatural  heneage he repeated sharply stephen heneage what affair is it of his  none wrayson answered he likes that sort of thing thats all he sawyour daughter with a ladythe baroness de sturm and the seeing them together after he had watched her come out of the flat that night seemed to suggest something to him he warned me that he had made up his mind to solve the mystery of morris barnes murder he advised me in fact to clear out and now since then  the waiter brought the soup wrayson broke off and talked for a moment or two to the maître dhôtel who had paused at their table presently when they were alone he went on  since then a young brother of barnes has turned up from south africa there was some mystery about morris barnes and the source of his income the brother is just as determined to solve this as heneage seems to be to discover thethe murderer they will work together and i am afraid not for myself you know for whom  the colonel was very grave he ate slowly and he seemed to be thinking  there is one man a solicitor named bentham wrayson continued who i believe knows everything but i do not think that even heneage will be able to make him speak his connection with the affair is on behalf of a mysterious client young barnes and i went to see him this afternoon but beyond encouraging the boy to search for the source of his brothers income he wouldnt open his mouth  a solicitor named bentham the colonel repeated mechanically ah  do you know him wrayson asked  i have heard of him the colonel answered a most disreputable person i believe he has offices in the adelphi  wrayson nodded  and whatever his business is he continued it isnt the ordinary business of a solicitor he has no clerksnot even an office boy  the colonel poured himself out a glass of wine  no clerksnot even an office boy it all agrees with what i have heard a bad lot wrayson i am afraida thoroughly bad lot are you sure that up to now he has kept his own counsel  i am sure of it wrayson answered  the colonel seemed in some measure to have recovered himself he looked wrayson in the face and though grave his expression was decidedly more natural  herbert he asked sinking his voice almost to a whisper who do you believe murdered morris barnes  god knows wrayson answered  do you believethatmy daughter had any hand in it  no wrayson declared fiercely  the colonel was silent for a moment he seemed to be contemplating the label on the bottle of claret which reposed in its cradle by their side  and yet he said thoughtfully she would necessarily be involved in any disclosures which were made  and so should i wrayson declared and those two sydney barnes and heneage mean to bring about disclosures that is why i felt that i must talk to some one about this colonel cant you get your daughter to tell us the whole truthwhat she was doing in barnes flat that night and all the rest of it we should be forewarned then  the colonel covered his face with his hand for a moment the question obviously distressed him  i cant herbert he said in a low tone you would scarcely think would you that i was the sort of man to live on irreconcilable terms with one of my own family but there it is dont think hardly of her it is more the fault of circumstances than her fault but i couldnt go to see herand she wouldnt come to see me  wrayson sighed  it is like the rest of this cursed mystery utterly incomprehensible he declared i shall never  with his glass half raised to his lips he paused suddenly in his sentence his face became a study in the expression of a boundless amazement his eyes were fastened upon the figures of two people on their way up the room preceded by the smiling maître dhôtel some words or rather an exclamation broke incoherently from his lips he set down his glass hurriedly and a stain of red wine crept unheeded across the tablecloth  look he whispered hoarselylook     chapter xvii  a confession of love   the colonel turned bodily round in his chair the couple to whom wrayson had drawn his attention were certainly incongruous enough to attract notice anywhere the man was lank elderly and of severe appearance he was bald he had slight sidewhiskers he wore spectacles and his face was devoid of expression he was dressed in plain dinner clothes of oldfashioned cut the tails of his coat were much too short his collar belonged to a departed generation and his tie was ready made in a small scotch town he might have passed muster readily enough as the clergyman or lawyer of the place as a diner at luigis ushered up the room to the soft strains of la mattchiche and followed by such a companion he was almost ridiculously out of place if anything she was the more noticeable of the two to the casual observer her hair was dazzlingly yellow and arranged with all the stiffness of the coiffeurs art she wore a dress of black sequins cut perilously low and shorn a little by wear of its pristine splendour her complexion was as artificial as her highpitched voice her very presence seemed to exude perfumes of the patchouli type she was the sort of person concerning whom the veriest novice in such matters could have made no mistake yet her companion seemed wholly unembarrassed he handed her the menu and looked calmly around the room  who are those people the colonel asked rather a queer combination arent they  the man is bentham the lawyer wrayson answered his eyes were fixed upon the lady who seemed not at all indisposed to become the object of any stray attention  that bentham the colonel repeated under his breath but what on earthwhere the mischief could he pick up a companion like that  wrayson scarcely heard him he had withdrawn his eyes from the lady with an effort  i have seen that woman somewhere he said thoughtfullysomewhere where she seemed quite as much out of place as she does here lately too  hm the colonel remarked leaning back in his chair to allow the waiter to serve him shes not the sort of person youd be likely to forget either is she  and by heavens i havent wrayson declared suddenly laying down his knife and fork i remember her now it was at the inquestbarnes inquest she was one of the two women at whose flat he called on his way home what on earth is bentham doing with her  you think the colonel remarked quietly that there is some connection  of course there is wrayson interrupted does that old fossil look like the sort to take such a creature about for nothing colonel he doesnt know himselfwhere those securities are hes brought that woman here to pump her  the colonel passed his hand across his forehead  i am getting a little confused he murmured  and i wrayson declared with barely suppressed excitement am beginning to see at least the shadow of daylight if only you had some influence with your daughter colonel  the colonel looked at him steadfastly wrayson wondered whether it was the light or whether indeed his friend had aged so much during the last few months  i have no influence over my daughter wrayson he said i thought that i had already explained that and herbert he added leaning over the table why dont you let this matter alone it doesnt concern you you are more likely to do harm than good by meddling with it there may be interests involved greater than you know of you may find understanding a good deal more dangerous than ignorance it isnt your affair anyhow take my advice let it alone  i wish i could wrayson answered with a little sigh frankly i would if i could but it fascinates me  all that i have heard of it the colonel remarked wearily sounds sordid enough  wrayson nodded  i think he said that it is the sense of personal contact in a case like this which stirs the blood i have memories about that night colonel which i couldnt describe to youor any one and now this young brother coming on the scene seems to bring the dead man to life again hes one of the worst type of young bounders i ever came into contact with a creature without sentiment or feeling of any sortnothing but an almost ravenous cupidity hes wearing his brothers clothes nowthinks nothing of it he hasnt a single regret i havent heard a single decent word pass his lips but he wants the money nothing else the money  do you believe the colonel asked that he will get it  who can tell wrayson answered that morris barnes was in possession of valuables of some sort everything goes to prove just think of the number of people who have shown their interest in him there is bentham and his mysterious client the baroness de sturm and your daughter andthe person who murdered him apparently even though he lost his life barnes was too clever for them for his precious belongings must still be undiscovered  the colonel finished his wine and leaned back in his chair  i am tired of this subject he said i should like to get back to the club  wrayson called for the bill a little unwillingly he was in a sense disappointed at the colonels attitude  very well he said we will bury it but before we do so there is one thing i have had it in my mind to sayfor some time i want to say it now it is about your daughter colonel  the colonel looked at him curiously  my daughter he repeated under his breath  wrayson leaned a little forward something new had come into his face this was the first time he had suffered such words to pass his lipsalmost the first time he had suffered such thoughts to form themselves in his mind  i never looked upon myself he said quietly as a particularly impulsive person yet it was an impulse which prompted me to conceal the truth as to her presence in the flat buildings that night it was a serious thing to do and somehow i fancy that the end is not yet  why did you do it the colonel asked you did not know who she was it could not have been that  why did i do it wrayson repeated i cant tell you i only know that i should do it again and again if the need came if i told you exactly how i felt it would sound like rot but im going to ask you that question  well  the colonels grey eyebrows were drawn together his eyes were keen and bright so he might have looked in time of stress but he was not in the least like the genial idol of the sheridan billiardroom  if i came to you tomorrow wrayson said and told you that i had met at last the woman whom i wished to make my wife and that woman was your daughter what should you say  i should be glad the colonel answered simply  you and she are for some unhappy reason not on speaking terms that  good god the colonel interrupted whom do you mean whom are you talking about  about your daughterwhom i shieldedthe companion of the baroness de sturm your daughter louise  the colonel raised his trembling fingers to his forehead his voice quivered ominously  of course of course god help me i thought you meant edith i never thought of louise and edith has spoken of you lately  i found your younger daughter charming wrayson said seriously but it was of your daughter louise i was speaking i thought that you would understand that  my daughterwhom you foundin morris barnes flatthat night  exactly wrayson answered and my question is this i cannot ask you why you and she parted but at least you can tell me if you know of any reason why i should not ask her to be my wife  the colonel was silent  no he said at last there is no reason but she would not consent i am sure of that  we will let it go at that wrayson answered come  he had chosen his moment for rising so as to pass down the room almost at the same time as mr bentham and his strange companion prolific of smiles and somewhat elephantine graces the ladys darkened eyes met wraysons boldly and finding there some encouragement she even favoured him with a backward glance in the vestibule he slipped a halfcrown into the attendants hand  see if you can hear the address that lady gives her cabman he whispered  the boy nodded and hurried out after them wrayson kept the colonel back under the pretence of lighting a fresh cigar when at last they strolled forward they met the boy returning he touched his hat to wrayson  alhambra sir he said quietly gone off alone sir in a hansom gentleman walked  the colonel kept silence until they were in the street  coming to the club he asked a little abruptly  no wrayson answered  you are going after that woman the colonel exclaimed  i am going to the alhambra wrayson answered i cant help it it sounds foolish i suppose but this affair fascinates me it works on my nerves somehow i must go  the colonel turned on his heel without another word he crossed the strand leaving wrayson standing upon the pavement wrayson with a little sigh turned westwards     chapter xviii  an amateur detective   wrayson easily discovered the object of his search she was seated upon a lounge in the promenade her ample charms lavishly displayed and her blackened eyes mutely questioning the passersby she welcomed wrayson with a smile which she meant to be inviting albeit she was a little suspicious men of wraysons stamp and appearance were not often such easy victims  saw you at luigis didnt i he asked hat in hand  she nodded and made room for him to sit down by her side  did you see the old stick i was with she asked i dont know why i was fool enough to go out with him trying to pump me about poor old barney too all the time just as though i couldnt see through him  old barney wrayson repeated a little perplexed  she laughed coarsely  oh come that wont do she declared im almost sure youre on the same lay yourself didnt i see you at the inquestmorris barnes inquest of course you know whom i mean right enough  i know whom you mean now wrayson admitted yes i was there queer affair wasnt it  the lady nodded  i should like a liqueur she remarked with apparent irrelevance benedictine  they were seated in front of a small table and were at times the object of expectant contemplation on the part of a magnificent individual in livery and kneebreeches wrayson summoned him and ordered two benedictines  now i dont mind telling you the lady continued leaning over towards him confidentially that im dead off that old man who came prying round and took me out to dinner to pump me about poor barney he didnt get much out of me for one thing i dont know much but the little i do know id sooner tell you than him  youre very kind wrayson murmured he used to come to these places a good deal didnt he  she nodded assent  he was always either here or at the empire he wasnt a bad sort barney although he was just like all the rest of them close with his money when he was sober and chucking it about when hed had a drop too much what did you want to know about him in particular  well for one thing wrayson answered where he got his money from  she shook her head  he was always very close about that she said the only story i ever heard him tell was that hed made it mining in south africa  you have really heard him say that wrayson asked  half a dozen times she declared  that proves at any rate he remarked thoughtfully that there was some mystery about his income because i happen to know that he came back from south africa a pauper  very likely she remarked barney was always the sort who would rather tell a lie than the truth  did he say anything to you that night about being in any kind of danger he asked  she shook her head  no i dont think so i didnt take particular notice of what he said because he was a bit squiffy i believe he mentioned some thing about a business appointment that night but i really didnt take much notice  you didnt tell them anything about that at the inquest wrayson remarked  i know i didnt she admitted you see i was so knocked over and i really didnt remember anything clearly that i thought it was best to say nothing at all theyd only have been trying to ferret things out of me that i couldnt have told them  i think that you were very wise wrayson said you dont happen to remember anything else that he said i suppose  no except that he seemed a little depressed but theres something else about barney that i always suspected that ive never heard mentioned yet mind you it may be true or it may not but i always suspected it  what was that wrayson demanded  i believe that he was married she declared impressively  married  wrayson looked incredulous it certainly did not seem probable  where is his wife then he asked why hasnt she turned up to claim his effects besides he lived alone he was my neighbour you know his brother has taken possession of his flat  the lady rather enjoyed the impression she had made she was not averse either to being seen in so prominent a place in confidential talk with a man of wraysons appearance it might not be directly remunerative but it was likely to do her good  he showed me a photograph once she continued a babyfaced chit of a girl it was but he was evidently very proud of it a little girl of his down in the country he told me then do you know this he was never in london for sunday every weekend he went off somewhere and i never heard of any one who ever saw him or knew where he went to  this is very interesting wrayson admitted but if he was married surely his wife would have turned up by now  why should she the lady answered dont you see that she very likely has what all you gentlemen seem to be so anxious abouthis income  by jove wrayson exclaimed softly of course if there was anything mysterious about the source of it all the more reason for her to keep dark  well thats what ive had in my mind she declared summoning the waiter ill take another liqueur if you dont mind  wrayson nodded his thoughts were travelling fast  did you tell mr bentham this he asked  not i she answered the old fool got about as much out of me as he deservedand thats nothing  im sure im very much obliged wrayson answered drawing out his pocketbook i wonder if i might be allowed  he glanced at her inquiringly she nodded im not proud she declared                                       as an amateur detective wrayson remarked to himself as he strolled homewards i am beginning rather to fancy myself and yet  his thoughts had stolen away he forgot morris barnes and the sordid mystery of which he was the centre he remembered only the compelling cause which was driving him towards the solution of it the night was warm and he walked slowly his hands behind him and ever before his eyes the shadowy image of the girl who had brought so many strange sensations into his somewhat uneventful life would he ever see her he wondered without the light of trouble in her eyes with colour in her cheeks and joy in her tone he thought of her violetrimmed eyes her hesitating manner her air always as of one who walked hand in hand with fear she was not meant for these things her lips and eyes were made for laughter she was after all only a girl if he could but lift the cloud and then he looked upwards and saw herleaning from the little iron balcony and looking out into the cool night  he half stopped she did not move it was too dark to see her features but as he looked upwards a strange idea came to him was it a gesture or some unspoken summons which travelled down to him through the semidarkness he only knew as he turned and entered the flat that a new chapter of his life was opening itself out before him     chapter xix  desperate wooing   wrayson felt from the moment he crossed the threshold of the room that he had entered an atmosphere charged with elusive emotion he was not sure of himself or of her as she turned slowly to greet him only he was at once conscious that something of that change in her which he had prophetically imagined was already shining out of her eyes she was at once more natural and further removed from him  i am glad she said simply i wanted to say goodbye to you  he was stunned for a moment he had not imagined this  she nodded  goodbye he repeated you are going away  tomorrow oh i am glad you dont know how glad i am  she swept past him and sank into an easychair she wore a black velveteen evening dress cut rather high without ornament or relief of any sort and her neck gleamed like polished ivory from which creeps always a subtle shade of pink her hair was parted in the middle and brushed back in little waves her eyes were full of fire and her face was no longer passive beautiful she had seemed to him before but beautiful with a sort of impersonal perfection she was beautiful now in her own right the beauty of a woman whom nature has claimed for her own who acknowledges her heritage the fearfrozen subjectivity in which he had yet found enough to fascinate him had passed away he felt that she was a stranger  always she murmured i shall think of london as the city of dreadful memories i should like to be going to set my face eastwards or westwards until i was so far away that even memory had perished but that is just where the bonds tell isnt it  there are many who can make the bonds elastic he answered it is only a question of going far enough  alas she answered a few hundred miles are all that are granted to me and london is like a terrible octopus its arms stretch over the sea  a few hundred miles he repeated with obvious relief northward or southward or eastward or westward  southward she answered the other side of the channel that at least is something i always like to feel that there is sea between me and a place which iloathe  is london so hateful to you then he asked  perhaps i should not have said that she answered say a place of which i am afraid  he looked across at her he too in obedience to a gesture from her was seated  come he said we will not talk of london then tell me where you are going  she shook her head  to a little paradise i know of  paradise he reminded her was meant for two  there will be two of us she answered smiling  he felt his heart thump against his ribs  then if one wanted to play the part of intruder  she shook her head  the third person in paradise was always very much de trop she reminded him  it depends upon the people who are already there he protested  my friend she said is in search of solitude absolute and complete  he shook his head  such a place does not exist he declared confidently your friend might as well have stayed at home  she relies upon me to procure it for her she said  a rare smile flashed from wraysons lips  you cant imagine what a relief her sex is to me he exclaimed  i dont know why she answered pensively do you know anything about the north of france mr wrayson  not much he answered i hope to know more presently  her eyes laughed across at him  you know what i said about the third person in paradise  i cant admit your paradise he said  you are a heretic she answered it is a matter of sex of course  naturally paradise is so relative it may be the halo thrown round a court in the city or a rose garden in the country any place where love is  and may i not love my friend she demanded  you may love me he answered the passion suddenly vibrating in his tone i will be more faithful than any friend i will build paradise for youwherever you will i will build the walls so high that no harm or any fear shall pass them  she waved him back something of the old look which he hated so to see was in her face  you must not talk to me like this mr wrayson she said indeed you must not  why not he demanded if there is a reason i will know it  she looked him steadily in the eyes  cant you imagine one for yourself she asked  he laughed scornfully  you dont understand he said there is only one reason in the world that i would admiti dont even know that i would accept that the other things dont count they dont exist  she looked at him a little incredulously she was still sitting and he was standing now before her her fingers rested lightly upon the arms of her chair she was leaning slightly forward as though watching for something in his face  tell me that there is another man he cried that you dont care for me that you never could care for me and i will go away and you shall never see my face again but nothing short of that will drive me from you  he spoke quickly his tone was full of nervous passion it never occurred to her to doubt him  you can be what else you like he continued thief adventuressmurderess so long as there is no other man come to me and i will take you away from it all  she laughed very softly and his pulses thrilled at the sound for there was no note of mockery there it was the laugh of a woman who listens to hidden music  you are a bold lover she murmured have you been reading romances lately do you know that it is the twentieth century and i have seen you three times you dont know what you say you cant mean it  by heaven i do he cried and for one exquisite moment he held her in his arms then she freed herself with a sudden start she had lost her composure her cheeks were flushed  dont she cried sharply remember our first meeting i am not the sort of person you imagine i never can be there are reasons  he swept them aside something seemed to tell him that if he did not succeed with her now his opportunity would be gone forever  i will listen to none of them he declared standing between her and the door they dont matter nothing matters i choose you for my wife and i will have you i wouldnt care if you came to me from a prison better give in louise i shant let you escape  she had indeed something of the look of a beautiful hunted animal as she leaned a little towards him her eyes riveted upon his her lips a little parted her bosom rising and falling quickly she was taken completely by surprise she had not given wrayson credit for such strength of mind or purpose she had believed entirely in her own mastery over him for any such assault as he was now making and she was learning the truth love that makes a woman weak lends strength to the man their positions were becoming reversed it was he who was dictating to her  i am going away she said nervously you will forget me you must forget me  you shall not go away he answered unless i know where dont be afraid you can keep your secrets whatever they are i want to know nothing go on exactly with the life you are leading if it pleases you i shant interfere but you are going to be my wife and you shall not leave london without telling me about it  i am leaving london she faltered tomorrow  i was thinking he remarked calmly of taking a little holiday myself  she laughed uneasily  you are absurd she declared and you must go away really the baroness will be home directly i would rather i would very much rather that she did not find you here  he held out his arms to her his eyes were bright with the joy of conquest  i will go louise he answered but first i will have my answerand no answer save one will do  she bit her lip she was moved by some emotion but he was unable for the moment to classify it  i think she declared that you must be the most persistent man on earth  you are going to find me so he assured her  listen she said firmly i will not marry you  he shrugged his shoulders  on that point he answered i am content to differ from you anything else  she stamped her foot  i do not care for you i do not wish to marry you she repeated i am going away and i forbid you to follow me  no good he declared stolidly i am past all that  she held up her finger and glanced backward out of the window  it is the baroness she said i must go and open the door  for one moment she lay passive in his arms then he could have sworn that her lips returned his kiss she was there when they heard the turning of a latchkey in the door with a little cry she slipped away and left him alone the outer door was thrown open and the baroness stood upon the threshold     chapter xx  stabbed through the heart   the baroness recognized wrayson with a little shrug of the shoulders  ah my dear mr wrayson she exclaimed this is very kind of you you have been keeping louise company i hope and see what droll things happen it is your friend mr barnes who has brought me home this evening and who will take a whisky and soda before he goes is it not so my friend  she turned around but there was no immediate response the baroness looked over the banisters and beheld her escort in the act of ascending  coming right along he called out cheerfully it was the cabman who tried to stop me he wanted more than his fare found hed tackled the wrong johnny this time  mr sydney barnes came slowly into view he was wearing an evening suit obviously too large for him a madeup white tie had slipped round underneath his ear a considerable fragment of red silk handkerchief was visible between his waistcoat and much crumpled white shirt an opera hat also too large for him he was wearing very much on the back of his head and he was smoking a very black cigar from which he had failed to remove the band he frowned when he saw wrayson but followed the baroness into the room with a pronounced swagger  you two need no introduction of course the baroness remarked i am not going to tell you where i found mr barnes i do not expect to be very much longer in england so perhaps i am not so careful as i ought to be louise if she knew would be shocked now mr wrayson do not hurry away you will take some whisky and soda i am afraid that my young friend has not been very hospitable  you are very kind wrayson said to tell you the truth i was rather hoping to see miss fitzmaurice again she disappeared rather abruptly  the baroness shook her finger at him in mock reproach  you have been misbehaving she declared never mind i will go and see what i can do for you  she stood for a moment before a lookingglass arranging her hair and then left the room humming a light tune sydney barnes with his hands in his pockets flung himself into an easychair  i say he began i dont quite see what youre doing here  wrayson looked at him for a moment in supercilious surprise  i scarcely see he answered how my movements concern you  mr barnes was unabashed  oh chuck it he declared you know very well what im thinking of to tell you the truth ive come to the conclusion that theres some connection between this household and my brothers affairs thats why im palling on to the baroness shes a fine womanclass you know and all that sort of thing but what i want is the shino you tumble  wrayson shrugged his shoulders slightly  i wish you every success he said personally i think that you are wasting your time here  perhaps so barnes answered im taking my own risks  wrayson turned away and at that moment the baroness reentered the room  my friend she said addressing wrayson i can do nothing for you whether you have offended louise or made her too happy i cannot say but she will not come down you will not see her again tonight  i am sorry wrayson answered she is going away tomorrow i understand  the baroness sighed  alas she declared i must not answer any questions louise has forbidden it  wrayson took up his hat  in that case he remarked there remains nothing for me but to wish you good night  there was a cab on the rank opposite and wrayson after a moments hesitation entered it and was driven to the club he scarcely expected to find any one there but he was in no mood for sleep and the thought of his own empty rooms chilled him somewhat to his surprise however he found the smokingroom full the central figure of the most important group was the colonel his face beaming with goodnature and his cheeks just a little flushed he welcomed wrayson almost boisterously  come along herbert he cried plenty of room whatll you have to drink and have you heard the news  whisky and soda wrayson answered sinking into an easychair and i havent heard any news  the colonel took his cigar from his mouth and leaned forward in his chair he had the appearance of a man who was striving to appear more grave than he felt  you remember the old chap we saw dining at luigis tonightbentham i think you said his name was  wrayson nodded  of course what about him  hes dead the colonel declared  wrayson jumped out of his chair  nonsense he exclaimed you dont mean it colonel  unfortunately i do the colonel answered he was found dead on the stairs leading to his office about ten oclock tonight a most interesting case the murder presuming it was a murder appears to have been committed  wrayson was suddenly pale  murder he repeated colonel do you mean this  the colonel who hated being interrupted answered a little testily  my dear wrayson he expostulated is this the sort of thing a man invents for fun do listen for a moment if you can in patience it is a deeply interesting case if you remember it was about nine oclock when we left luigis bentham must have gone almost straight to his office for he was found there dead a very few minutes after ten  who killed him and why wrayson asked breathlessly  that i suppose we shall know later the colonel answered the police will be on their mettle this time but it isnt a particularly easy case he was found lying on his face stabbed through the heart that is all anybody knows  the thoughts went rushing through wraysons brain he remembered the man as he had seemed only a few hours ago cold stonily indifferent to young barnes passionate questions inflexibly silent a man who might easily kindle hatreds to all appearance without a soft spot or any human feeling he remembered the close of their interview and sydney barnes rash threat the suggested idea clothed itself almost unconsciously with words  i have just seen young barnes he said he has been at the empire all the evening  the colonel lit another cigar  it takes a man of nerve and deliberation he remarked to commit a murder from what i have heard of him i should not imagine your young friend to be possessed of either the lady whom he was entertaining or rather failing to entertain at dinner  i have seen her since wrayson interrupted shortly she went straight to the alhambra  the colonel nodded  i would have insured her against even suspicion he remarked she was a large placid woman of the flabby order of nerves she will probably faint when she hears what has happened she might box a mans ears but her arm would never drive a dagger home into his heart especially with such beautiful almost mathematical accuracy we must look elsewhere i fancy for the person who has paid benthams debt to society heneage here has an interesting theory  wrayson looked across and found that his eyes met heneages he was sitting a little in the background with a newspaper in his hand which he was however only affecting to read he was taking note of every word of the conversation he was obviously annoyed at the colonels reference to him but he did his best to conceal it  scarcely a theory he remarked laying down his paper for a moment i can hardly call it that i only remarked that i happened to know a little about bentham and that his clients if he had any were mostly foreigners and their business of a shady nature as a matter of fact he was struck off the rolls here some years ago i forget the case now but i know that it was a pretty bad one  so you see the colonel resumed he was probably in touch with a loose lot though what benefit his death could have been to any one it is of course a little hard to imagine makes one think somehow of this morris barnes affair doesnt it i wonder if there is any connection between the two  heneage laid down his paper now and abandoned his attitude of indifferent listener he was obviously listening for what wrayson had to say  connection of some sort between the two men there certainly was wrayson admitted we know that  exactly heneage remarked i speak without knowing very much about the matter but i am thoroughly convinced of one thing if you can find the murderer of morris barnes you will solve at the same time the mystery of benthams death it is the same affair part and parcel of the same tangle  the colonel was silent for a few moments he seemed to be reflecting on heneages words  i believe you are right he said at last i should be curious to know though how you arrived at this decision  heneage looked past him at wrayson  you should ask wrayson he said  but wrayson had risen and was sauntering towards the door  im off he remarked looking backwards and nodding his farewells if i stay here any longer i shall have nightmare time you fellows were in bed too hows the malleni fund colonel  the colonels face relaxed a smile of genuine pleasure lit up his features  going strong he declared triumphantly we shall ship him off for italy next week with a very tidy little cheque in his pocket dear old dobson gave us ten pounds and the concert fund is turning out well  wrayson lit a cigarette and looked back from the open door  youre more at home with philanthropy than horrors colonel he remarked good night everybody     chapter xxi  the flight of louise   the baroness was looking her best and knew it she had slept well the night before and her eyes were soft and clear her maid had been unusually successful with her hair and her hat which had arrived only that morning from paris was quite the smartest in the room she was at her favourite restaurant and her solitary companion was a goodlooking man added to which the caviar was delightfully fresh and the toast crisp and thin consequently the baroness was in a particularly good temper  i really do wish my dear friend she said smiling across at him that i could do what you ask but it is not so simple not so simple as you think you say give me the address of your friend you ask me nicely and i like you well enough to be glad to do it but louise she say to me give no one my address let no one know where i am gone  im sure she didnt mean that to apply to me wrayson pleaded  ah but she even mentioned your name the baroness declared i say to her not even mr wrayson and she answered no no no  and you promised he asked  why yes what else could i do she replied i say to her you are a very foolish girl louise after you have gone you will be sorry mr wrayson will be angry with you and i shall make myself very very agreeable to him and who knows but he will forget all about you but louise she only shake her head she knows her own countrymen too well they are so terribly insularly constant  is that such a very bad quality baroness  ah i find it so she admitted i do not like the man who can think of only one thing only one woman at a time he is so dull he has no imagination if he has only one sweetheart how can he know anything about us for in a hundred different women there are no two alike  that is all very well wrayson answered smiling but you see if a man cares very much for one particular woman he hasnt the least curiosity about the rest of her sex  she sighed gently and her eyes flashed her regrets very blue eyes they were today almost as blue as the turquoises about her throat  they say she murmured that some englishmen are like that it is so much a pitywhen they are nice  i suppose he suggested that yours is the continental point of view  she was silent until the waiter who was filling her glass with white wine had departed then she leaned over towards him her forehead was a little wrinkled her eyebrows raised she had the halfplaintive air of a child who is complaining of being unjustly whipped  yes i think it is she answered the lover as i know him is one who could not be unkind to a woman in his heart he is faithful perhaps to one but for her sake the whole world of beautiful women are objects of interest to him he will flirt with them when they will he is always their admirer in the background there may always be what you call the preference but that is his secret  wrayson smiled across the table  this is a very dangerous doctrine baroness he declared  dangerous she murmured  for us remember that we are a susceptible race  she flung out her hands and shook her head susceptible she denied it vehemently  it is on the contrary she declared you do not lose your heads or your hearts very easily you englishmen  you do not know us he protested  i know you she answered for myself i admit it when i am with a man who is nice i try that i may make him just a little no more but just a little in love with me it makes things more amusing it is better for him and we are not bored but with you mon ami i know very well that i waste my time and so i ask you instead this question tell me why you have invited me to take luncheon with you  she flashed her question across at him carelessly enough but he felt that she expected an answer and that she was not to be deceived  i wanted miss fitzmaurices address he said  naturally but what else  he sighed  i want to know more than you will tell me i am afraid he said i want to know why you and miss fitzmaurice are living together in london and leading such an unusual life and how in heavens name you became concerned in the affairs of morris barnes  ah she said you want to know that so  i do he admitted  and yet she remarked even for that it was not worth while to make love to me you ask so much my friend and you give so little  if you he began a little awkwardly  her light laugh stopped him  ah no my friend you must not be foolish she said i will tell you what i can for nothing and that i am afraid is very little more than nothing but as for offering me a bribe you must not think of that it would not be commeilfaut not at all gentil  tell me what you can then he begged  she shrugged her shoulders  it is so little she declared only this we are not adventuresses louise and i we are living together because we were schoolfellows and because we are both anxious to succeed in a certain undertaking to which for different reasons we have pledged ourselves to succeed we needed some papers which had come into the hands of mr morris barnes that is why i am civil to that littlewhat you call bounder his brother  it sounds reasonable enough this wrayson said but what about the murder of morris baines on the very night you know when louise was there  it is all a very simple matter the baroness answered quietly but yet it is a matter where the death of a few such men would count for nothing a few ages ago it would not have been a matter of a dozen morris barnes no nor a thousand diplomacy is just as cruel and just as ruthless as the battlefield only it works down thereunderground  it is a political matter then wrayson asked swiftly  the baroness smiled she took a cigarette from her little gold case and lit it  ah she exclaimed you must not try to what you say pump me you can call it what you will only to louise as to me it is very much a personal affair shall we talk now for a little of other things  wrayson sighed  i may not know then he begged where louise has gone or why  it would not be her wish the baroness answered that i should tell you  very well wrayson said i will ask you no more questions only this i have told you of this man bentham  the baroness inclined her head he had told her nothing that was news to her  was he on your side or opposed to you  you are puzzling me the baroness confessed  already wrayson explained i know as much of the affair as this morris barnes was in possession of something i do not know whether it was documents or what possible material shape it had but it brought him in a considerable income and both you and some others were endeavouring to obtain possession of it so far i believe that neither of you have succeeded morris barnes has been murdered in vain bentham the lawyer who telephoned to me on the night of his death has shared his fate to whose account do these two murders go yours or the others  i cannot answer that question mr wrayson the baroness said  do you know wrayson demanded dropping his voice a little that but for my moral if not actual perjury louise herself would have been charged with the murder of morris barnes  she had a narrow escape the baroness admitted  she had a narrow escape wrayson declared but the unfortunate part of the affair is that she is not even now safe  the baroness looked at him curiously she was in the act of drawing on her gloves but her fingers suddenly became rigid  what do you mean she asked  i mean wrayson said that another person saw her come out of the flats that night it was a friend of mine who kept silence at first because he believed that it was a private assignation of my own since then events have occurred to make him think differently he has gone over to the other side he is spending his time with young sydney barnes and he has set himself to discover the mystery of morris barnes murder he has even gone so far as to give me warning that i should be better out of england  who is this person the baroness asked calmly  his name is stephen heneage and he is a member of my club the club to which louises father also belongs wrayson replied  the baroness suddenly dropped her veil but not before wrayson had seen a sudden change in her face he remembered suddenly that heneage was no stranger to her he remembered the embarrassment of their meeting at the alhambra  you know him of course he repeated heneage is not a man to be trifled with he has had experience in affairs of this sort he is no ordinary amateur detective  yes i know mr stephen heneage the baroness said tell me does louise know  wrayson shook his head  i have had no opportunity of telling her he answered i might not have thought so seriously of it but this morning i received a note from heneage  yes what did he say  it was only a line or two wrayson answered he reminded me of his previous warning to me to leave england for a time and he underlined it louise ought to know i want to tell her  i am glad you did not tell me this before the baroness said as they left the room together or it would have spoiled my luncheon i do not like your friend mr heneage  you will give me louises address he asked some one must see her  i will send it you the baroness promised before the day is out     chapter xxii  the chÂteau of Étarpe   one would scarcely believe wrayson remarked leaning back in his chair and drawing in a long deep breath that we are within three miles of one of the noisiest and most bustling of french watering places  it is incredible his companion admitted  they were seated in a garden behind the old inn of the lion dor in the village of st Étarpe before them was a round table on whose spotless white cloth still remained dishes of fruit and a bottle of winenot the vin ordinaire which had been served with their repast but something which wrayson had ordered specially and which the landlord himself all smiles and bows had uncorked and placed before them wrayson produced his cigarette case  how did you hear of this place he asked watching the smoke curl upwards into the breathless air i fancy that you and i are the only guests here  wraysons companion tall broadshouldered and heavily bearded was busy filling a pipe from a pouch by his side his features were unmistakably saxon and his cheeks were tanned as though by much exposure to all sorts of weathers he was still apparently on the right side of middle age but his manners were grave almost reserved  i was in the neighbourhood many years ago he answered i had a fancy to revisit the place and you  i discovered it entirely by accident wrayson admitted i walked out from chourville this morning stayed here for some luncheon and was so delighted that i took a room and went straight back for my bag there isnt an emperor in europe who has so beautiful a diningroom as this  together they looked across the valley a wonderful panorama of vineclad slopes and meadows starred with manycoloured wild flowers through which the river wound its way now hidden now visible a thin line of gleaming quicksilver tall poplars fringed its banks and there were white cottages and farmhouses mostly built in the shelter of the vinecovered cliffs to the left a rolling mass of woods was pierced by one long green avenue at the summit of which stretched the grey front and towers of the château de st Étarpe wrayson looked long at the fertile and beautiful country which seemed to fade so softly away in the horizon but he looked longest at the chateâu amongst the woods  i wonder who lives there he remarked i meant to have asked the waiter  i can tell you the stranger said the château belongs to the baroness de sturm  a frenchwoman wrayson asked  half french half belgian she has estates in both countries i believe his companion answered as a matter of fact i believe that this château is hers in her own right as a daughter of the Étarpes she married a belgian nobleman  you seem well acquainted with the neighbourhood wrayson remarked  i have been here before was the somewhat short answer  wrayson produced his cardcase  as we seem likely to see something of one another during the next few days nolens volens he remarked may i introduce myself my name is wrayson herbert wrayson and i come from london  the stranger took the card a little doubtfully  i am much obliged he said i do not carry a cardcase but my name is duncan  an englishman of course wrayson remarked smiling  i am english mr duncan answered but i have not been in england for many years  there was something about his manner which forbade any further questioning on wraysons part the two men sat together in silence and wrayson although not of a curious turn of mind began to feel more than an ordinary interest in his companion one thing he noticed in particular although as the sun sank lower the beauties of the landscape below increased duncans eyes scarcely for a moment rested upon them he had turned his chair a little and he sat directly facing the chateâu the golden cornfields the stainedglass windows of the grey church rising like a cathedral as it were in the midst of the daffodilstarred meadows caught now with the flood of the dying sunlight mingled so harmoniously with their own timemellowed richness the increasing perfume of the flowers by which they were surroundednone of these things seemed for one moment to distract his attention steadily and fixedly he gazed up that deep green avenue empty indeed of any moving object and yet seemingly not empty to him for he had the air of one who sees beyond the world of visible objects of one who sees things dimmed to those of only natural powers with what figures wrayson wondered idly was he peopling that empty avenue what were the fancies which had crept out from his brain and held him spellbound he had admitted a more or less intimate acquaintance with the place was he perhaps a former lover of the baroness when she had been simply amy de st Étarpe wrayson forgot for a while his own affairs in following out these mild speculations the soft twilight stole down upon them here and there little patches of grey mist came curling up the valley a bat came flying about their heads and wrayson at last rose  i shall take a stroll he remarked and turn in good night if i dont see you again  the man named duncan turned his head  good night he said mechanically  wrayson walked down the garden and passed through a wicketgate into the broad white road setting his back to the village he came in a few minutes to the great entrance gate of the château hung from massive stone pillars of great age and themselves fashioned of intricate and curiously wrought ironwork the gates themselves were closed fast and the smaller ones on either side intended for pedestrians were fastened with a padlock wrayson stood for a moment looking through the bars into the park the drive ran for half a mile perfectly straight and then taking an abrupt bend passed upwards into the woods amongst which was the château  what do you want an abrupt voice demanded  wrayson looked round in surprise a man in gamekeepers clothes had issued from the lodge carrying a gun  good evening wrayson said is it permitted for the public to enter the park  by no means was the surly answer cannot monsieur see that the gates are locked  i understood from the landlord of the lion dor wrayson said that the villagers were allowed the privilege of walking in the park  the man looked at him suspiciously  you are not of the village he said  i am staying there wrayson answered  it makes nothing for the present villagers and every one are forbidden to enter there are visitors at the château  wrayson turned away  very well he said good night  the man did not answer him wrayson continued to climb the hill which skirted the park he did not turn round but he heard the gates open and he was convinced that he was being watched if he was not followed he kept on however until he came to some more iron gates from which stretched the grass avenue which led straight to the gardens of the château dimly through the gathering dusk he caught a view of it which was little more than an impression silver grey and quiet with the peace which the centuries can bring it seemed to him with its fantastic towers and imperfectly visible outline like a palace of dreams rather than a dwelling house however magnificent of material stone and brick an owl flew out from the trees a few yards to the left of him and drifted slowly over his head with much flapping of wings and a weird soft call faintly answered in the distance by his mate from far away down in the valley came the slow ringing of a single evening bell save for these things a silence almost wonderful reigned gradually wrayson began to feel that sense of soothed nerves of inexpressible relief which nature alone dispensesher one unequalled drug all the agitation and turmoil of the last few months seemed to fall away from him he felt that he had been living in a world of false proportions that the maze of doubts and fears through which he had wandered was after all no part of life itself merely a tissue of irrelevant issues to which his distorted imagination had affixed a purely fictitious importance what concern of his was it how morris barnes had lived or died and who was bentham that his fate should ever disturb him the secrets of other people were theirs to keep his own secret was more wonderful by far alone from amidst the tangle of his other emotions he felt its survivalmore than its survival its absolute conquest of all other feelings and considerations it was truth he knew that men sought after in the quiet places and it was the truth which he had found if he could but see her coming down the avenue coming to him across the daisystrewn grass beneath the shadow of the stately poplars the very thought set his heart beating like a boys he felt the blood singing in his veins the lovemusic swelling in his heart he shook the gates they too were padlocked then he listened there was no sound of any footfall in the road he moved a few steps higher up and making use of the pillars of the gate he climbed on to the wall it was a sixfoot drop but he came down noiselessly into a bed of moss once more he paused to listen there was no sound save the burring of some night insect over his head stealthily and keeping in the shadow of the trees he began to climb the grassy avenue towards the château     chapter xxiii  a passionate pilgrim   it seemed to wrayson as by and by he began to make bolder and more rapid progress that it was an actual fairy world into which he was passing with beating heart and this strange new sense of delicious excitement as he drew nearer the round norman towers and immense grey front of the château began to take to themselves more definite shape the gardens began to spread themselves out terraced lawns from whose flowerbeds now a blurred chaos so far as colour was concerned waves of perfume came stealing down to him statuary appeared white and ghostly in the half light and here and there startlingly lifelike there were trimmed shrubs and a long wall of roses trailed down from the high stone balcony but as yet there was no sound or sign of human life that was to come  wrayson came to a pause at last he had passed from the shelter of the woods into a laurel walk but further than this he could not go without being plainly visible to any one in the château so he waited and watched there were lights he could see now behind many of the ground floor windows of the chateâu and more than once he fancied that he could catch the sound of music he tried to fancy in which room she was to project his passionate will through the twilight so that she should come to him but the curtains remained undrawn and the windows closed still wrayson waited  then at last providence intervened above the top of the woods over on the other side of the château came first a faint lightening in the sky which gradually deepened into a glow slowly the rim of the moon crept up and very soon the spectral twilight was at an end the shadowy landscape became real and vivid it was a new splendour creeping softly into the night wrayson moved a little further back into his shelter and even as he did so one of the lower windows of the château was thrown open and two women followed by a man stepped out their appearance was so sudden that wrayson felt his breath almost taken away he leaned a little forward and watched them eagerly  the woman who was foremost of the little group was a stranger to him although her features and a somewhat peculiar headdress which she wore seemed in a sense familiar she was tall and dark and she carried herself with the easy dignity of a woman of rank her face was thoughtful and her expression sweet if she was not actually beautiful she was at least a woman whom it was impossible to ignore but wrayson glanced at her only for a minute it was louise who stood by her sidethe music of her voice came floating down to him heavens had he ever realized how beautiful she was he devoured her with his eyes he strained his nerves to hear what they were saying he was ridiculously relieved to see that the man who stood by their side was greyheaded he was beginning to realize what love was jealousy would be intolerable  they moved about the terrace he scarcely knew whether he hoped or feared the more that they would descend and come nearer to him after all it was cruelly tantalizing he dared not disobey the baroness or he would have stepped boldly from his hidingplace and gone up to them but that by the terms of his promise was impossible he was to make his presence known to louise only if he could do so secretly he was not to accost her in the presence of any other person it might be days or weeks before the opportunity cameor it mightit might be minutes for almost without warning she was alone the others had left her with farewells if any of the briefest she came forward to the grey stone parapet and with her head resting upon her hand looked out towards the woods  his heart began to beat fasterhis brain was confused was there any chance that she would descend into the gardensdare he make a signal to her her head and shoulders were bare and a slight breeze had sprung up during the last few minutes perhaps she would feel the cold and go in perhaps  he watched her breathlessly she had abandoned her thoughtful attitude and was standing upright looking around her she looked once at the window she was apparently undecided whether to go in or not wrayson prayed then if he had never prayed before he didnt know to whom he was simply conscious of an intense desire which seemed somehow formulated into an appeal before he was fully conscious of it she was coming down the steps she stood on the edge of the lawn for a moment as though considering then carefully raising her skirts in both hands she picked her way amongst the flowerbeds coming almost directly towards him glancing round he saw her objectivea rustic seat under a dark cedar tree and he saw too that she must pass within a few feet of where he stood she walked as one dreaming or whose thoughts are far distant her head thrown back her eyes half closed the awakening when it came was sudden enough  louise he called to her softly louise  she dropped her skirts for a moment he feared that she was going to cry out  who is that she asked sharply  it is i herbert wrayson he answered dont be afraid shall i come out to you or will you come down the laurel path  you she murmured you  he saw the light in her face and his voice was hoarse with passion  come he cried or i must fetch you louise sweetheart  she came towards him a little timidly her eyebrows arched a divine smile playing about her lips she stood at the entrance to the laurel grove and peered a little forward  where are you she asked is it really you i think that i am a little afraid oh  he took her into his arms with a little laugh of happiness time and life itself stood still her feeble remonstrances were swept away in the tide of his passion his lips hung burning against hers  my sweetheart he murmured thank god you came  she disengaged herself presently a clock from the stables was striking she counted the hours  eleven oclock she exclaimed herbert how long have i been here  dont ask me that he answered only tell me how long you are going to stay  not another minute really she declared they will be sending out search parties for me directly andherberthow did you get here she demanded anxiously  i climbed over the wall he answered cheerfully there didnt seem to be any other way  she seemed almost incredulous  didnt you see any watchmen she asked  there was one at the gates he answered i fancied he followed me up the road but i gave him the slip all right  be careful how you go back she begged this place is supposed to be closely watched  watched why he asked are you afraid of robbers  how much did the baroness tell you she asked  nothing except that i should find you here he declared she made me promise that i would wait for an opportunity of seeing you alone  and why she asked have you come  he took her into his arms again  i have learnt what love is he murmured and i have forgotten the other things  that is all very well she laughed smoothing out her hair but the other things may be very important to me  a man named stephen heneage has taken up this barnes affair he answered he saw you leave the flats that night and he is likely if he thinks that it might lead to anything to give the whole show away he warned me to get away from england andbut you want the truth dont you all these are excuses i came because i wanted youbecause i couldnt live without you louise couldnt we steal away somewhere and never go back why need we we could go to paris tomorrow catch the orient express the next dayi know a dozen hidingplaces where we should be safe enough we will make our own world and our own lifeand forget  forget she drew a little away from him her tone chilled him herbert she said whatever happens i must go nowthis moment where are you stopping  the lion dor he answered down in the village  i will send a note in the morning she said eagerly only you must go now dear some one will be out to look for me and i cannot thinki must have a little time to decide be very careful as you go back if you are stopped be sure and make them understand that you are an englishman good night  he kissed her passionately she yielded to his embrace but almost immediately drew herself away he clutched at her hand but she eluded him with swift footsteps she crossed the lawn just as she reached the terrace the windows opened once more and some one called her name  i am coming in now he heard her answer it has been such a wonderful night     chapter xxiv  an invitation to dinner   the landlord of the lion dor who had appeared for a moment to chat with his guests while they took their morning coffee pointed downwards into the valley where little clouds of mist hung over the lowlands  the messieurs will find themselves hot today he remarked here only there will be a breeze eleven hundred feet up and only three miles from the sea it is wonderful eh  wrayson pointed across towards the château whose towers rose from the bosom of the cool green woods  there also he said it will be very pleasant the château is as high as we are is it not so  the landlord shrugged his shoulders  there is little difference he admitted and in the woods there is always shade but who may go there never was an estate kept so zealously private and does monsieur know since yesterday a new order has been issued the villagers were forbidden even their ancient rights of walking across the park the head forester has posted a notice in the village  i have heard something of it wrayson admitted has any reason been given are the family in residence there  the landlord shook his head  madame la baronne was never so exacting he replied one hears that she has lent the château to friends two ladies are there and one gentleman it is all  do you know who they are wrayson asked  the landlord assumed an air of mystery  one he said is a young english lady the otherwell they call her madame de melbain  what  the exclamation came like a pistolshot from wraysons fellowguest at the inn who up to now had taken no part in the conversation he had turned suddenly round and was facing the startled landlord  madame de melbain he repeated monsieur perhaps knows the lady  there was a moments silence then the man who had called himself duncan looked away frowning  no he said i do not know her the name is familiar but there is no lady of my acquaintance bearing it at present  the landlord looked a little disappointed  ah he remarked i had hoped that monsieur would have been able to give us a little information there are many people in the village who would like to know who this madame de melbain is for it is since her coming that all has been different the park has been closed the peasants and farmers have received orders forbidding them to accept boarders at present and i myself am askedfor a consideration i admitto receive no further guests naturally we ask ourselves monsieur what does it mean one does not wish to gossip but there is much here to wonder at  what is she like this madame de melbain duncan asked  no one has seen her monsieur the landlord answered she arrived in a close carriage since when she has not passed the lodge gates she has her own servants who wait upon her without doubt she is a person of some importance possibly though she is eccentric they say that every entrance to the château is guarded and that a cordon of men are always watching  wrayson laughed  a little exaggeration my friend there eh  the landlord shrugged his shoulders  one cannot tell he declared this at least is singular he continued bending forward confidentially since the arrival of these two ladies several strangers have been observed about the place some of whom have endeavoured to procure lodgings they spoke french but they were not frenchmen or englishmen true this may be a coincidence but one can never tell monsieur has any further commands  monsieur had none and the landlord withdrew smiling and bowing  duncan leaned across the table  my french he said deliberately is rotten i couldnt understand half of what that fellow said do you mind repeating it to me  wrayson did so and his companion listened moodily when he had finished duncan was gazing steadfastly over towards the château and knocking the ashes from his pipe  sounds a little feudal doesnt it he remarked drawing his pouch from his pocket however i dont suppose it is any concern of yours or of mine  wrayson made no direct answer he was fully conscious that his companion was watching him closely and he affected to be deeply interested in the selection of a cigarette  no he said at last it is no concern of ours of course and yet one cannot help feeling a little interested i noticed myself that the lodge gates of the château were rather strictly guarded  very likely the other answered women of fashion who suffer from nerves take strange fancies nowadays this madame de melbain is probably one of these  wrayson nodded  very likely he admitted what are you going to do with yourself all day  loaf i am going to lie down in the fields there amongst the wild flowers in the shade of the woods duncan answered that is if one may take so great a liberty with the woods of madame this sort of country rather fascinates me he added thoughtfully i have lived so long in a land where the vegetation is a jungle and the flowers are exotics there is a species of exaggeration about it all i find this restful  africa wrayson asked  the other nodded silently he did not seem inclined to continue the conversation  you are the second man i have met lately who has come home from africa wrayson remarked and you represent the opposite poles of life  it is very possible duncan admitted we are a polyglot lot who come from there  you were in the war of course wrayson asked  i was in the war duncan answered almost to the finish afterwards i went into rhodesia and incidentally made money thats all i have to say about africa i hate the country and i dont want to talk about it see you later i suppose  he rose from his chair and stretched himself across the lawn the landlord came hurrying his face perturbed and uneasy his bow to wrayson was subtly different here was perhaps an aristocrat under an assumed name a person to be without doubt conciliated  monsieur he announced with a little flourish of the white serviette which from habit he was carrying there is outside a young lady from the château who is inquiring for you  which way wrayson demanded anxiously  monsieur will be pleased to follow me the landlord answered  louise was alone in a victoria drawn up before the front door of the inn wrayson saw at once that something had happened to disturb her even under her white veil he knew that she was pale and that there were rings under her eyes she leaned towards him and held out her hand in conventional manner for the benefit of the landlord who lingered upon the steps  come round to the other side of the carriage herbert she said i have something to say to you the coachman does not understand english i have tried him  wrayson crossed behind the carriage and stood by her side  herbert she asked anxiously will you do something for me something i want you to do very much  if i can he answered simply  you can do this she declared it is very easy i want you to leave this place this morning go away anywhere you can go back to london or you can travel only start this morning  willingly he answered on one condition  what is it she asked quickly  that you go with me he declared  she shook her head impatiently  you know that is not what i mean she said reproachfully i was mad last night you took me by surprise and i forgot everything i was awake all night this morning i can see things clearly nothingof that sortis possible between you and me so i want you to go away  he shook his head gently but firmly  it isnt possible louise he said you mustnt ask me to do anything of that sort after last night its too late you see dear you belong to me now nothing can alter that  it is not too late she answered passionately last night was just an hour of madness i shall cut it out of my life you must cut it out of yours  he leaned over till his head nearly touched hers and under the holland dustsheet which covered her knees he gripped her hand  i will not he answered i will not go away you belong to me and i will have you  she looked at him for a moment without speech wraysons features more distinguished in a general way by delicacy than strength had assumed a curiously set and dogged appearance his eyes met hers kindly but mercilessly he looked like a man who has spoken his last word  herbert she murmured there are things which you do not know and which i cannot tell you but they stand between us they must stand between us forever  of that he said i mean to be the judge and until you tell me what they are i shall treat them as though they did not exist  i came here she said to ask you to beg you to go away  then i am afraid you must write your mission down a failure he answered doggedly for i refuse to go  her eyes flashed at him from underneath her veil he felt the pressure of her fingers upon his hand he heard a little sighcould it have been of relief  if i failed she began  and you have failed he said decidedly  i was to bring you she continued an invitation to dine tonight at the château it is only a verbal one but perhaps you will forgive that  the colour streamed into his cheeks he could scarcely believe his ears  louise he exclaimed you mean it  yes she answered softly it would be better for you better perhaps for me if you would do as i askif you would go away and forget but if you will not do that there is no reason why you should not come to the château a carriage will arrive for you at seven oclock  and you will come with me again into the gardens he whispered passionately  perhaps she murmured  the horses teased by the flies tossed their heads and the jingling of harness reminded louise that half the village from various vantage points were watching the interview between the young lady from the château and the visitor at the inn  i must go at once she said to wrayson about tonight do not be surprised at anything you see at the château i have no time to say more if you notice anything that seems to you at all unusual accept it naturally i will explain afterwards  she spoke a word to the immovable man on the box and waved her hand to wrayson as the horses started forward they were round the corner in a moment and out of sight wrayson turned back to the inn but before he had taken half a dozen paces he stopped short he had happened to glance towards the upper windows of the small hotel and he caught a sudden vision of a mans facea familiar face transformed rigid yet with staring eyes following the departing carriage wrayson himself was conscious of a quick shock of surprise followed by a sense of apprehension what could there possibly have been in the appearance of louise to have brought a look like that into the face of his fellowguest     chapter xxv  the man in the yellow boots   the two men did not meet again until luncheontime anglicized into a oneoclock meal for their benefit already seated at the table they found a short fair man in the costume of a pedestrian tourist he wore a tweed knickerbocker suit and a knapsack lay upon the grass by his side as wrayson and his fellowguest arrived almost at the same time the newcomer rose and bowed  good morning gentlemen he said i trust you will permit me a seat at your table it appears to be the only one  duncan contented himself with a nod wrayson felt compelled to be a little more civil the man certainly seemed harmless enough  a very delightful spot gentlemen he continued and a fine a very fine church that in the valley i am spending my holiday taking photographs of churches of a certain period in this vicinity i am looking forward to explore this one  i am afraid wrayson remarked that i do not know much of ecclesiastical architecture but the aesthetic effect of this one at least is very fine  the newcomer nodded  you are an artist perhaps sir he asked innocently  i hope soin some degree wrayson answered  every one is fundamentally an artist i suppose who is capable of appreciating a work of beauty  duncan smiled slightly to himself so far he had not spoken  it is all new country to me the newcomer continued but from what i have seen of it i should think it a grand place for painters not much for the ordinary tourist eh  that depends wrayson answered upon the ordinary tourist  exactly quite so the little man agreed of course if one wanted a quiet time what could be better than this there must be others who think so besides yourselves  who wrayson asked  your fellowguests here  we have no fellowguests wrayson answered a little incautiously  the newcomer leaned back in his chair with a disconcerted look  then i wonder why he exclaimed the landlord told me that he had not a single room  wrayson bit his lip  i fancy he said that he is not in the habit of having people stay here  i am afraid the little fair man said that it is not an hospitable village i tried to get a room elsewhere but alas with no success they do not seem to want tourists at st Étarpe  wrayson looked at the knapsack at the camera and at the little man himself he spoke english easily and without any trace of an accent his clothes too had the look of having come from an english readymade shop yet there was something about the man himself not altogether british  i fancy the people are busy getting ready for the harvest wrayson remarked at last you will find lots of places as pretty as this along the coast  perhaps so the visitor admitted and yet when one has taken a fancy to a place it seems a pity to have to leave it so soon you couldnt speak a word to the landlord for me sir i supposeyou or your friend i dont fancy he understood my french very well  wrayson shook his head  im afraid it wouldnt be any use he said as a matter of fact i know that he does not intend to take any more visitors he has not the staff to deal with them  it is a pity the little man said dejectedly i think that i must try again in the village by the by sir perhaps you can tell me to whom the château there belongs  madame la baronne de sturm wrayson answered at least so our host told me yesterday  it is a very beautiful placevery beautiful the tourist said reverently i dare say there is a chapel there too can one gain admission there do you know sir  wrayson laid down his knife and fork  look here he said goodhumouredly im not a guidebook you know and i only arrived here yesterday myself youve reached the limit of my information you had better try the landlord he will tell you all that you want to know  duncan pushed his chair back he had eaten very little luncheon but he was filling his pipe preparatory to leaving the table as soon as it began to draw he rose and turned to wrayson the little tourist he absolutely ignored as he had done all the time during the meal  i should like a word with you before you go out he said  wrayson nodded and followed him in a few minutes to the summerhouse at the end of the lawn duncan did not beat about the bush  that little brute over there he said inclining his head towards the table is neither an englishman nor a tourist i have seen him before and i never forget a face  what is he then wrayson asked  heaven knows what he is now duncan answered i saw him last at colenso where he narrowly escaped being shot for a spy he is either a dutchman or a german and whatever he may be up to here ill swear ecclesiastical architecture is not his game  there was a moments silence wrayson had turned involuntarily towards the château and duncan had followed suit they both looked up the broad green avenue to where the windows of the great building flashed back the sunlight at the same moment their mutual action was realized by both of them  wrayson first turned away and glanced round at the table which they had just quitted the little man who was still seated there had lit a cigar and was talking to the waiter he looked back again and moved his head thoughtfully in the direction of the château  he asked questions about the château wrayson remarked do you suppose that there can be anything going on there to interest him  you should know better than i duncan answered you received a visit this morning from one of the two ladies who are staying there  wrayson turned a little pale he looked at duncan steadily for a moment a giant in height his features too were of a large and resolute type his eyes were clear and truthful his expression notwithstanding a certain gloom which scarcely accorded with his years and apparent health was unmistakably honest wrayson felt instinctively that he was to be trusted  look here he said i should like to tell you the truthas much of it as is necessary i happen to know that the young lady with whom you saw me talking this morning and who is a friend of the baroness de sturms is suspected in certain quarters of being implicated in acriminal affair which took place recently in london i myself in a lesser degree am also under suspicion i came over here to warn her  duncan was looking very grave indeed  in a criminal affair he repeated that is a little vague  i am sorry wrayson answered but i cannot very well be more explicit the matter is one in which a good many other people are concerned and i might add that it is a hopeless mystery to me all i know is that a crime was committed that this young lady was present under suspicious circumstances that i in certain evidence i had to give concealed the fact of her presence and that now a third person turns up who also knew of the young ladys presence but who was not called upon to give evidence who is working on his own account to clear up the whole affair he happens to be a friend of mine and he warned me frankly to clear out  i am beginning to follow you duncan said thoughtfully now what about madame de melbain  i know absolutely nothing of her wrayson answered i found out where the young lady was from the baroness de sturm with whom she was living in london and i came over to warn her  the young lady was living with the baroness de sturm duncan repeated is she then an orphan  no wrayson answered she is for some reasoni do not know whyestranged from her family now the question arises has this fellow here come over to track her down is he an english detective  duncan turned deliberately round and stared at the person whom they were discussing  i should doubt it very much he answered for my part i dont believe for a moment that he is an englishman at all  i am very glad to hear you say so wrayson declared but the question is if he is not on this business what the devil is he doing here  have you the entrée to the chateâu duncan asked abruptly  i am invited to dine there this evening wrayson answered  then if i were you duncan said i should make a point of ascertaining if you can the personality of this madame de melbain  wrayson nodded  i shall see her of course he said and i will do so  my own idea duncan said deliberately is that it is in connection with her presence here that the landlord of the inn and the villagers have received these injunctions about strangers try and find out what you can about her and in the meantime i will look after the gentleman over there he wants to be friendlyi will make a companion of him when you come back tonight we will have another talk  its awfully good of you wrayson said and nowive one thing more to say  duncan nodded  go on he said  i have taken you into my confidence so far as was possible wrayson said slowly i am going to ask you a question now  i cannot promise to answer it duncan declared taking up his pipe and carefully refilling it  naturally but i am going to ask it wrayson said an hour or so ago i was talking to the young lady in front of the inn and you were watching us i saw your face at the window as she was driving off  well  the monosyllable was hard and dry  you are neither an inquisitive nor an emotional person wrayson said i am sure of that i want an explanation  of what  of your suddenly becoming both  duncan had lit his pipe now and smoked for a few moments furiously  i will not bandy words with you he said at last you want an explanation which i cannot give  wrayson looked as he felt dissatisfied  look here he said im not asking for your confidence im simply asking you to explain why the sight of that young lady should be a matter of emotion to you you know who she is i am convinced what else  duncan shook his head  im sorry he said you may trust me or not as you like all i can say about myself is this ive been up against it hardvery hard so far as regards the ordinary affairs of life i simply dont count im a negationa purely subjective personage i may be able to help you a little herei shall certainly never be in your way my interest in the placethere i will tell you thatis purely of a sentimental nature my interest in life itself is something of the same sort take my advice let it go at that  i will wrayson declared with sudden heartiness  duncan nodded  ill go and look after our little friend in the yellow boots he said     chapter xxvi  madame de melbain   punctually at halfpast seven the carriage arrived to take wrayson to the château a few minutes drive along a road fragrant with the perfume of hay and with the pleasant sound of the reaping machines in his ears and the carriage turned into the park through the great iron gates which opened this time without demur by the side of the road was a clear trout stream a little further away a herd of deer stood watching the carriage pass the park was uncultivated but picturesque becoming more wooded as they climbed the hill leading to the chateâu wrayson smiled to himself as he remembered that this magnificent home and estate belonged to the woman who was his neighbour at battersea and whom he himself had been more than half inclined to put down as an adventuress  a majordomo in quiet black clothes who seemed to reflect in his tone and manner the subdued splendour of the place received him at the door passing him on at once to a footman in powdered hair and resplendent livery across a great hall whose white stone floor height and stainedglass windows gave wrayson the impression that he had found his way by mistake into the nave of a cathedral he was ushered into a drawingroom whose modernity and comparatively low ceiling were almost a relief here there were books and flowers and music some exquisite watercolours upon the white walls newspapers and magazines lying about which gave the place a habitable air a great semicircular window commanded a wonderful view of the park but wrayson had little time to admire it a door was opened at the further end of the room and he heard the soft rustling of a womans gown upon the carpet it was louise who came towards him  she was dressed in white muslin unrelieved by ornament or any suggestion of colour her cheeks were unusually pale and the shadows under her eyes seemed to speak of trouble yet wrayson thought that he had never seen her look more beautiful she gave him her hand with a faint smile of welcome and permitted him to raise it to his lips  this is very very foolish she said softly and i know that i ought to be ashamed of myself  on the contrary he answered i think that it is very natural but seriously i feel a little overpowered you wont want to live always in a castle will you louise  she sighed and smiled and sighed again  i am afraid that our castle herbert she murmured will exist only in the air but listen i must speak to you before the others come in  i am all attention he assured her  it is about madame de melbain she began a little hesitatingly  he waited for her to continue she seemed to be in some difficulty  i want you to watch and do just what we others do she said and not to be surprised if some of our arrangements seem a little curious for instance although she is the elder do not give her your arm for dinner she will go in first alone and you must take me  i can assure you wrayson said smiling that i shall make no difficulty about that  and she doesnt like to be talked to very much louise continued  i will humour her in that also wrayson promised she is a good sort to let me come here at all  she is very kind and very considerate louise said and her life has been a very unhappy one  wrayson moved his chair a little nearer  need we talk about her any more he asked there is so much i want to say to you about ourselves  she looked at him for a moment a little sadly a little wistfully  ah dont she murmured dont talk about definite things at all for tonighttonight only let us drift  he smiled at her reassuringly  dont be afraid he said i am not going to ask you any questions i am not going to ask for any explanations i think that we have passed all that it is of the future i wanted to speak  dont she begged softly of the past i dare not think nor of the future it is only the present which belongs to us  the present and the future he answered firmly  she rose suddenly to her feet and wrayson instinctively followed her example they were no longer alone two women who had entered by a door at the further end of the apartment were slowly approaching them the foremost was tall and dark a little slim perhaps but with an elegant figure and a carriage of singular dignity her face was youthful and her brown eyes were soft and clear as the eyes of a girl but her dark hair was plentifully streaked with grey and there was about her whole appearance an air of repressed sadness  this is mr wrayson is it not she asked in a very sweet voice but with a strong foreign accent we have so few visitors that one can scarcely make a mistake you are very welcome  she did not offer to shake hands and wrayson contented himself with a low bow  you are very kind he murmured  monsieur le baron she remarked turning to an elderly gentleman who had just entered will doubtless find your coming pleasant the entertainment of three ladies must have seemed at times a little trying let me make you gentlemen known to one another monsieur wrayson monsieur le baron de courcelles and ida she added turning to her companion who had moved a few steps apart permit that i present to you also mr wraysonmademoiselle de courcelles  the conversation for a moment or two followed the obvious lines madame de melbain and louise had drawn a little apart a few remarks as to the beauty of the chateâu and its situation passed between wrayson and the baron the name of its owner was mentioned and wrayson indicated his acquaintance with her at the sound of her name madame de melbain turned somewhat abruptly round and seemed to be listening but at that moment the door was thrown open and the majordomo of the household who had received wrayson announced dinner he directly addressed madame de melbain  madame is served he murmured respectfully  the little procession arranged itself as louise had intimated madame de melbain led the way ushered by the majordomo and followed immediately by the baron and mademoiselle de courcelles wrayson with louise brought up the rear they crossed the white flagged hall and entered an apartment which wrayson although his capacity for wonder was diminishing felt himself compelled to pause and admire it was of great height and again the curiously shaped windows were filled with stained glass the oakpanelled walls black with age were hung with portraits sombre and yet vivid and upon a marble pedestal at the end of the room lifelike and untouched by the centuries stood a wonderful presentation of ralph de st Étarpe the founder of the house clad in the armour of his days the dinner table with its brilliant and modern appurtenances of flowers and plate standing in the middle of the floor seemed like a minute and yet startling anachronism the brilliant patches of scarlet geranium the deep blue livery of the two footmen the glitter of the venetian glass upon the table were like notes of alien colour amongst surroundings whose chief characteristic was a magnificent restraint and yet such dignity as it was possible to impart into the everyday business of eating and drinking was certainly manifest in the meal which presently took its leisurely course  wrayson although no one could accuse him of a lack of savoir faire found himself scarcely at his ease madame de melbain erect dignified and beautiful sat at the head of the table and although she addressed a remark to each of them occasionally she remained always unapproachable the baron made only formal attempts at conversation and mademoiselle de courcelles was absolutely silent wrayson was unable to divest himself of the feeling of representing an alien presence amongst a little community drawn closely together by some mysterious tie louise was his only link with them and to louise he decided to devote himself entirely regardless of the apparent demands of custom his position at the table enabled him to do this and very soon he discovered that it was precisely what was expected of him the conversation between the others such as it was lapsed into german or some kindred tongue wrayson found himself able presently to talk confidentially with louise  remember he said after a slight pause that i have finished altogether with the role of investigator i no longer have any curiosity about anything still i think that there is something which i ought to tell you  she smiled  you may tell me as much as you like she said as long as you dont ask questions  exactly well there is another englishman staying at the lion dor he appears to be a decent fellow and a gentleman i am not going to talk about him i imagine that he is harmless  we have heard of him louise murmured it certainly appears as though he were only an ordinary tourist has any one else arrived  yes wrayson answered some one else has arrived and i want to tell you about him  louise was obviously disturbed she refused a course a little impatiently and turned towards wrayson anxiously  but the landlord she said in a low tone has orders to receive no more guests  this man arrived to luncheon today wrayson answered the landlord could not refuse him that he wished for a room and was told that he could not be taken in  well who is he what is he like she demanded  he is a miserable sort of bounderan imitation cockney tourist with readymade english clothes a knapsack and a camera i should have felt suspicious about him myself but the other fellow whom i told you about who is staying at the inn recognized him he had seen him abroad and what he told me seems decisive i am afraid that he is a spy  wrayson cursed himself for a moment that he had been so outspoken for the girl by his side seemed almost on the point of collapse her eyes were full of fear and she clutched at the tablecloth as though overcome with a spasm of terror  dont be alarmed wrayson whispered in her ear i am sure i am quite sure that he is not here for what you may fear i dont believe he is an englishman at all  the girl recovered herself amazingly  i was not thinking of myself she said quietly and wrayson noticed that her eyes were fixed upon the pale distinguished face of the woman who sat with a certain air of isolation at the head of the table     chapter xxvii  the spy   wrayson found himself a few minutes later alone with the baron who with some solemnity rose and took the chair opposite to him conversation between them however languished for the baron spoke only in monosyllables and his attitude gave wrayson the idea that he viewed his presence at the chateâu with disfavour with stiff punctiliousness he begged wrayson to try some wonderful burgundy and passed a box of cigarettes he did not however open any topic of conversation and wrayson embarrassed in his choice of subjects by the fact that any remark he could make might sound like an attempt at gratifying his curiosity remained also silent in a very few minutes the baron rose  you will take another glass of wine sir he asked  wrayson rose too with alacrity and bowed his refusal they recrossed the great hall and entered the drawingroom louise and madame de melbain were talking earnestly together in a corner and from the look that the latter threw at him as they entered wrayson was convinced that in some way he was concerned with the subject of their conversation it was a look deliberate and scrutinizing in a sense doubtful and yet not unkindly behind it all wrayson felt that there was something which he could not understand there was something of the mystery in those dark sad eyes which seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere of the place and the lives of these people  louise rose as he approached and motioned him to take her vacated place  madame de melbain would like to talk to you for a few moments she said quietly afterwards will you come on to the terrace  she swept away through the open window and was at once followed by the baron mademoiselle de courcelles was playing very softly on a grand piano in an unseen corner of the apartment wrayson and his hostess were alone  she turned towards him with a faint smile she spoke with great deliberation but very clearly and there was in her voice some hidden quality indefinable in words yet both musical and singularly attractive  i shall not keep you very long mr wrayson she said louise has been talking to me about you she is happy i think to have found a friend so chivalrous and so discerning  wrayson smiled doubtfully as he answered  it is very little that i have been able to do for her he said my complaint is that she will not give me the opportunity of doing more  you are too modest madame de melbain said slowly louise has told me a good deal i think that you have been a very faithful friend  wrayson bowed but said nothing if madame de melbain had anything to say to him he preferred to afford her the opportunity of an attentive silence  louise and i madame de melbain continued were school friends so you see that i have known her all my life she has had her troubles as i have only mine are a righteous judgment upon me and hers she has done nothing to deserve it is the burden of others which she fastens upon her back  wrayson felt instinctively that his continued silence was what she most desired she was speaking to him but her eyes had travelled far away it was as though she had come into touch with other and greater things  louise has not told me everything she continued there is much that she will not confess so it is necessary mr wrayson that i ask you a question do you care for her  i do wrayson answered simply  you wish to marry her  tomorrow if she would  madame de melbain leaned a little forward her cheeks were still entirely colourless but some spark of emotion glittered in her full dark eyes  you will be alone with her presently try and persuade her to marry you at once there is nothing but an absurd scruple between you remember that always  it is a scruple which up till now has been too strong for me wrayson remarked quietly  she measured him with her eyes as though making a deliberate estimate of his powers  a man she said should be able to do much with the woman whom he cares forthe woman who cares for him  if i could believe that he murmured  she shrugged her shoulders slightly he understood the gesture  you are right he declared with more confidence i will do my best  she moved her head slowly a sign of assent also of dismissal he rose to his feet  louise is on the terrace she said will you give me your arm the baron is there also we will join them  they stepped through the high french windows on to the carpeted terrace it seemed to wrayson that they had passed into a veritable land of enchantment the service of dinner had been a somewhat leisurely affair and the hour was already late the moon was slowly rising behind the trees but the landscape was at present wrapped in the soft doubtful obscurity of a late twilight the flowers with whose perfume the air was faintly fragrant remained unseen or visible only in blurred outline the tall trees whose tops were unstirred by even the slightest breeze stood out like silent sentinels against the violet sky madame de melbain stopped short upon the threshold of the terrace with head slightly thrown back and halfclosed eyes  suzanne was right she murmured there is peace herepeace if only it would last  the baron came hastily forward he seemed to be eyeing wrayson a little doubtfully madame de melbain pointed down the avenue  i think she said that it would be pleasant to walk for a little way give me your arm baron we will go first mr wrayson will follow with louise  they descended the steps crossed the lawn and through a gate into the broad grassgrown avenue cut through the woods to the road wrayson at first was silent and louise seemed a little nervous more than once she started at the sound of a rabbit scurrying through the undergrowth there was something a little mysterious about the otherwise profound silence of the impenetrable woods even their footsteps fell noiselessly upon the spongy turf  wrayson spoke at last they had fallen sufficiently far behind the others to be out of earshot  do you know what madame de melbain has been saying to me he asked  louise turned her head a little there was the faintest flicker of a smile about her lips  i cannot imagine she declared looking once more straight ahead  she has been inciting me to bold deeds wrayson said how should you like to be carried off in mediaeval fashionmarried willing or unwilling  is that what madame de melbain has been recommending you to do she asked  he nodded  yes and i am thinking of taking her advice he said coolly  she laughed quietly yet his ears were quick and he caught the note of sadness which a moment later crept into her eyes  it would solve so much that is troublesome wouldnt it she remarked may i ask if that has been the sole topic of your conversation  absolutely louise dear  she turned a little towards him his voice was compelling the fingers of her hand closed readily enough upon his and the soft touch thrilled him  you have some fancy in your brain he said in a low passionate whisper it is nothing but a fancy i am assured you have heard what your own friend has advised you dont doubt that i love you louise that i want to make you happy  she leaned a little towards him a sudden wave of abandonment seemed to have swept over her he drew her face to his and kissed her with a sudden passion her lips met his soft and unresisting already he felt the song of triumph in his heart she was his she could never be anybody elses now very softly she disengaged herself the other two were still in sight and already the curve of the moon was creeping over the trees  dont spoil it she murmured dont talk of tomorrow or the future we have tonight  there followed minutes of which he took no count and then of a sudden her hand clutched his arm  listen she whispered hoarsely  he came suddenly down to earth they were walking in the shadow of the trees close to the side of the wood and their footsteps upon the soft turf were noiseless wrayson almost held his breath as he leaned towards the dark chaos of the thickly planted trees only a few yards away he could distinctly hear the dry snapping of twigs some one was keeping pace with them inside the wood now he could see the stooping figure of a man creeping stealthily along a little exclamation broke from louises lips  it is a spy after all she muttered they said that every entrance to the place was guarded  wrayson had time to take only one quick step towards the wood when a shrill cry rang out upon the still night then there was the trampling under foot of bushes and undergrowth the sound of mens voices one english and threatening the other guttural and terrified madame de melbain and her escort had paused and were looking back louise was moving towards them and wrayson was on the point of entering the wood into the little semicircle formed by these four people there suddenly strode wraysons friend from the inn grasping by the collar a shrinking and protesting figure in a much dishevelled tweed suit  we were right mr wrayson the former remarked quietly this fellow has been spying round all day you had better ask your friends what they wish done with him     chapter xxviii  the scene in the avenue   there followed a few minutes of somewhat curious silence at the first sound of the voice of the man who had made so startling an appearance in their midst a cry only half suppressed had broken from madame de melbains lips she had moved impulsively a little forward the moon visible now from over the tree tops was shining faintly upon her absolutely colourless face and dilated eyes for some reason she seemed terrorstricken both she and louise who was clinging now to her arm neither of them seemed even to have glanced at the cowering figure of the man who had relapsed now into a venomous silence both of them were gazing at his captor and upon their faces was the strangest expression which wrayson had ever seen on any human features it was as though they stood upon the edge of the world and peered downwards into the forbidden depths as though they suddenly found themselves in the presence of a thing so wonderful that thought and speech alike were chained wrayson involuntarily followed the direction of their rapt gaze the stranger certainly presented a somewhat formidable appearance he was standing upon slightly higher ground and the massive proportions of his tall powerful figure stood out with almost startling distinctness against the empty background his face was half in the shadow yet it seemed to wrayson that some touch of the mystery which was quivering in the drawn face of the two women was also reflected in his dimly seen features something indefinable was in the air something so mysterious and wonderful that voices seemed stricken dumb and life itself suspended an owl flew slowly out from the wood with ponderous flapping of wings and sailed over their heads every one started madame de melbain gave a halfstifled shriek the strain was over louise and she were half sobbing now in one anothers arms  i will leave this fellow to be dealt with as the owners of the chateâu may direct the stranger said stiffly turning to wrayson you can tell them all that we know about him  he turned on his heel but the baron laid his hand upon his shoulder and peered into his face inquisitively  we should like to know he said whom we have to thank for the capture of this intruder  i am a stranger here and to all of you was the quiet answer you owe me no thanks i have seen something of this fellow before he added pointing to his captive who was now standing sullenly in the centre of the group i felt sure that he was up to no good and i watched him  for the first time the fairhaired little tourist who had been dragged so submissively into their midst suffered a gleam of intelligence to appear in his face he changed his position so that he could see his captor better  ah he muttered you have seen me before eh and i you perhaps let me think was it  wraysons friend leaned a little forwards and with the careless ease of one flicking away a fly he struck the speaker with the back of his hand across the face the blow was not a particularly severe one but its victim collapsed upon the turf  look here his assailant said standing for a moment over him you can go on and finish your sentence if you like i only want to warn you that if you do i will break every bone in your body one by one the next time we meet go on if you think it worth while  the man on the ground was dumb because he was afraid but the same thought presented itself to all of them the baron who was least of all affected expressed it  perhaps sir he said you will not object to telling methe baron de courcelleswhom we have to thank for the discovery of thisintruder  wraysons friend edged a little away there was no response in his manner to the courtesy with which the baron had sought to introduce himself  you have nothing to thank me for he said shortly my name would be quite unknown to you and i am leaving this part of the world at once permit me to wish you good evening  he had already turned on his heel when madame de melbains voice arrested him clear and peremptory the first words which had passed her lips since the surprise had come to them seemed somehow to introduce a new note into an atmosphere from which an element of tragedy had never been lacking  please stop  he turned and faced her with obvious unwillingness she stretched out her hand as though forbidding him to go but addressed at the same time the two men apparently gamekeepers who had suddenly emerged from the wood  monsieur robert she said we have caught this man trespassing in the woods here notwithstanding the precautions which i understood you had taken take him away at once if you please i trust that you will be able to hand him over to the gendarmes  monsieur robert the steward of the estates an elderly man whose face was twitching with anxiety stepped forward with a low bow  madame he said we had word of this intrusion we were even now upon the track of this ruffian there was another also who climbed the wallah i see him the englishman there  he is our friend madame de melbain said you must not interfere with him  as madame wills come you rascal he added gripping his prisoner by the shoulder we will show you what it means to climb over walls and trespass on the estate of madame la baronne come then  the intruder accepted the situation with the most philosophic calm only one remark he ventured to make as he was led off  it is not hospitable this i only wished to see the chateâu by moonlight  wraysons fellow guest at the lion dor turned to follow them  the fellow might try to escape he muttered but again madame de melbain called to him  you must not go away she said yet  then she moved forward with smooth deliberate footsteps yet with something almost supernatural in her white face and set dilated eyes it was as though she were looking once more through the windows of the world as though she could see the figures of dead men playing once more their part in the game of life and she looked always at the englishman  listen she said there is something about you sir which i do not understand who are you and where do you come from  he made no answer only he held out his hand as though to keep her away and drew a little further back  you shall not escape she continued the words leaving her lips with a sort of staccato incisiveness crisp and emotional no you are here and you shall answer who are you who come here to mock us all because it is a dead man who speaks with your voice and looks with your eyes you will not dare to say that you are duncan fitzmaurice  the figure in the shadows seemed to loom larger and larger he was no longer shrinking away  i know nothing of the man of whom you speak he declared i am a wanderer i have no name and no home  madame de melbain reeled and would have fallen then for a moment events seemed to leap forward white and fainting she lay in the arms of the man who had sprung to her succour yet through her halfopened eyes there flashed a strange and wonderful lighta light of passionate and amazing content he held her almost roughly for several moments yet his lips were pressed to hers with a tenderness almost indescribable no one of the little group moved wrayson felt simply that events impossible for him to understand had marched too quickly for him he stood like a man in a dream whose limbs are rigid whose brain alone is working and the others too seemed to have become part of a silent and wonderful tableau for years after wrayson carried with him the memory of those few minutesthe perfume from the woods faint but penetrating the shadowy light the passionate faces of the man and the woman the woman yielding to a beautiful dream and the man to a moment of divine madness movement when it came came from the principal actors in that wonderful scene madame de melbain was alone supported in louises arms the englishmans heavy footsteps were already audible crashing through the undergrowth louise pointed to the wood and called out to wrayson  follow him dont let him out of your sight quick  wrayson turned and sped down the avenue when he reached the wall he stood there and waited presently duncan came crashing through the wood and vaulted the wall wrayson met him in the middle of the hard white road  we will walk back to the lion dor together he said calmly i have a few things to say to you     chapter xxix  a substantial ghost   monsieur jules of the lion dor was in a state of excitement bordering upon frenzy events were happening indeed with him this placid august weather first the occupancy of the château by the mysterious lady and the subsequent edict of the steward against all strangers then the coming of this tourist yesterday who had gone for an evening stroll without paying his bill and was now a prisoner of the law heaven only knew on what charge added to thisa matter of excitement enough surelythe giant englishman who had been his guest for nearly three weeksa model guest toohad departed at a minutes notice though not the saints be praised without paying his bill and now though the hour was yet scarcely nine oclock a carriage with steaming horses was standing at his door and the beautiful young english lady was herself inside his inn he was indeed conducting her down the grey stone passage out on to the rosebordered garden which was the pride of his heart and where monsieur the remaining englishman was smoking his morning cigarette  she barely waited until monsieur jules had bowed himself out of hearing distance she looked at wrayson at the table laid for one only and at the empty garden  where is heyour friend she demanded breathlessly  gone wrayson answered i am sorry but i did my best he went away at daylight i saw him off but i could not keep him  where to she asked you know that at least  he pointed towards the distant coast line  in that direction that is all i know  he told you nothing before he went she asked eagerly  nothing at all he answered he refused to discuss what had happened sit down louise he added firmly i want to talk to you  he placed a chair for her under the trees she sank into it a little wearily  a certain measure of ignorance he said i am willing to put up with but when you exhibit such extraordinary interest in another man i really feel that my limit has been reached who is he louise you must tell me please  i wish i could tell you she answered i wish i could say that i knew half the night the three of us have talked and wondered i have heard plenty of theories as to a second life on some imaginary planet but i never heard of the dead who lived again here in this world  he looked puzzled  do you mean he asked that he was like some one whom you believed to be dead  she was silent for a moment the sun was hot even where they sat but he fancied that he saw her shiver she looked into his face and something of the terror of the night before was in her eyes  to us she said slowly to madame de melbain and to me he was a ghost an actual apparition he spoke to us with the voice of one whom we know to be dead he came to us in his form  wrayson looked across at her with a quiet smile  there was nothing of the ghost about duncan he remarked i should consider him a remarkably substantial person dont you think that we were all a little overwrought last night a strong likeness and a little imagination will often work wonders  if it was a likeness only she said why did he leave us so abruptly why has he left this place at a moments notice to avoid us  wrayson was silent for a few seconds  look here he said this is a matter of common sense after all if you were not deceived by a likeness it was the man himself that goes without saying what reasons had you for supposing that he was dead  the newspapers the war office even the return of his effects  from where wrayson asked  from south africa he was shot through the lungs in natal  men have turned up before after having been reported dead he remarked sententiously  but he was in the army she replied dont you see that if he was alive now he would be a deserter he has never rejoined he was certified as having died in the hospital at ladysmith  wrayson looked steadily into her agitated face  supposing he said that he turned out to be the man whom you have in your mind what is he to you  my brother she answered simply  wraysons first impulse was of surprise then he drew a long breath of relief he looked back upon his long hours of anxiety and cursed himself for a fool  what an idiot i have been he declared of course i know that you lost a brother in south africa butbut what about madame de melbain  madame de melbain and my brother were friends she said quietly there were obstacles or they would have been more than friends  wrayson nodded  now supposing he said that by some miracle your brother still lived that this was he is there any reason why he should avoid you both  she thought for a moment  yes she said slowly there is  i suppose he continued tentatively you couldnt tell me all about it  i couldnt she answered it isnt my secret  wrayson looked for a moment away from her across the valley with its flowerspangled meadows parted by that sinuous poplarfringed line of silver the lazy slowflowing river stealing through the quiet land to the sea the full summer heat was scarcely yet in the air but already a faint blue haze was rising from the lowlands up on the plateau where they were sitting a slight breeze stirred amongst the trees monsieur jules had indeed some ground for his pride in this tiny sylvan paradise  i think he said that for one day we will forget all this tangle of secrets and unaccountable doings what do you say louise he whispered taking her unresisting hand into his may i tell monsieur jules to serve breakfast for two in the arbour there  she laughed softly into his face there was the look in her eyes which he loved to see half wistful half content almost happy  but you are never satisfied she declared if i give you a day a whole precious day out of my valuable life  they belong to me all of them he declared bending over her till his lips touched her cheek some day i am very sure that i shall take them all into my charge  she disengaged herself from his embrace with a sudden start wrayson turned his head within a yard or two of them madame de melbain had paused in the centre of the little plot of grass she was looking at them from underneath her lace parasol with faintly uplifted eyebrows and the dawn of a smile upon her beautiful lips louise sprang to her feet and wrayson followed her example madame de melbain lowered her parasol as though to shut out the sight of the two  may i come on she asked i want to speak to louise although i am afraid i am shockingly de trop  wrayson had an idea and acted upon it promptly  madame de melbain he said i believe that you have some influence with louise i am sure that you are one of those who sympathize with the unfortunate cant i bespeak your good offices  she lowered her parasol to the ground and leaned a little forward upon it her eyes were fixed steadily upon wrayson  go on she said briefly  i love louise wrayson said and i believe she cares for me nevertheless she refuses to marry me and will give no intelligible reason my first meeting with her was of an extraordinary nature i assisted her to leave a house in which a murder had been committed since which time i think we have both run a risk of trouble with the authorities louise lives always in the shadow of some mystery and when i who surely have the right to know her secrets beg for her confidence she refuses it  and what is it that you wish me to do madame de melbain asked softly  to use your influence with louise wrayson pleaded let her give me her confidence and let her accept from me the shelter of my name  madame de melbain was silent for several moments she seemed to be thinking louises face was expressionless she had made one attempt to check wrayson but recognizing its futility she had at once abandoned it from below in the valley came the faint whir of the reaping machines from the rose garden a murmur of bees but between the two women and the man there was silencesilence which lasted so long that monsieur jules who was watching from a window called softly upon all the saints of his acquaintance to explain to him of what nature was this mystery which seemed to be developing as it were under his own surveillance  at last madame de melbain appeared to come to a decision she moved slowly forward until she stood within a few feet of him then she raised her eyes to his and looked him long and earnestly in the face  you look she said half under her breath like a man who might be trusted i will trust you i will be kinder to you than louise for i will tell you all that you want to know but when i have told you you will have in your keeping the honour of an unfortunate woman whose name alone is great  wrayson looked her for a moment in the eyes then he bowed low  madame he said that trust will be to me my most sacred possession  she smiled at him faintly nodding her head as though to keep pace with her thoughts  i believe you mr wrayson she said yes i believe you let me tell you this then i count it amongst my misfortunes that my own troubles have become in so large a manner the troubles of my friends you will appreciate that the more perhaps when i tell you that madame de melbain is not the name by which i am generally known i am that unfortunate woman the queen of mexonia     chapter xxx  the queen of mexonia   wrayson who had been prepared for something surprising was yet startled out of his composure the affairs of the unhappy royal house of mexonia were the property of the world he half rose to his feet but madame de melbain instantly waved him back again  my friends she said deem it advisable that my whereabouts should not be known i certainly am very anxious that my incognita should be preserved  she paused and wrayson without hesitation answered her unspoken question unconsciously too he found himself using the same manner of address as the others  madame he said whatever you choose to tell me will be sacred  she bowed her head slightly  i am going to tell you a good deal she said glancing across at louise  louise opened her lips as though about to intervene madame de melbain continued however without a break  i am going to tell you more than may seem necessary she said because i believe that i am one of those unfortunate persons whose evil lot it is to bring unhappiness upon their friends so far as i can avoid this mr wrayson i mean to furtherit is possible that i may ask youpresentlyto render me a service  wrayson bowed low he felt that she was already well aware of his willingness  first then let me tell you she continued leaning back in her chair and looking away across the valley with eyes whose light was wholly reminiscent that we three were schoolgirls together louise amywhom you know better perhaps as the baroness de sturmand myself we were at a convent near brussels there were not many pupils and we three were friends  we had a great deal of libertymore liberty perhaps than our friends would have approved of we worked it is true in the mornings but in the afternoons we rode or played tennis in the bois it was there that i met prince frederick who afterwards became my husband  i was only sixteen years old and just as silly i suppose as a girl brought up as i had been brought up was certain to be i was very much flattered by prince fredericks attentions and quite ready to respond to them my own family was noble and the match was not considered a particularly unequal one for though frederick was of the royal house he was a long way from the succession still there was a good deal of trouble when a messenger from frederick went to my father he declared that i was altogether too young my mother on the other hand was just as anxious to conclude the match eventually it was arranged that the betrothal should take place in six monthsand frederick went back to mexonia  madame de melbain paused for a moment wrayson felt from her slightly altered attitude and a significant lowering of her voice that she was reaching the part of her narrative which she found the most difficult  we girls she continued went back to school and just at that time louises brother came over to brussels i think that i have already told you that the supervision over us was far from strict there was nothing to prevent captain fitzmaurice being a good deal with us we had picnics tennis parties rides long before the six months were up i understood how foolish i had been i wrote to prince frederick and begged him to release me from our uncompleted engagement his answer was to appear in person he made a scene my mother and father were now wholly on his side within a few weeks he had lost both a cousin and a brother his succession to the throne was almost a certainty his own people were just as anxious to have him married i did not know why then but i found out later on they had their way i believe that things are different in an english home in mine i can assure you that i never had any chance i entered upon my married life without the least possibility of happiness needless to say i never realized any for the last four years my husband has been trying for a divorce very soon it is possible that he will succeed  wrayson leaned a little towards her  is it permitted madame to ask a question  why not  you have fought against this divorce you and your friends so zealously yet your life has been unhappy release could scarcely have been anything but a relief to you  madame de melbain raised her head slightly her brows were a little contracted from her eyes there flashed the silent fire of a queens disdain  release yes i would welcome that if it were death it would be very welcome but divorcehe to divorce me he whose brutality and infidelities are the scandal of every court in europe no a divorce i never shall accept separation i have insisted upon  wrayson hesitated for a moment  may i be pardoned he said if i repeat to you what i saw in print latelyin a famous english paper they spoke of this divorce case which has lasted so long they spoke of it as about to be finally decided there was some fresh evidence about to be produced a special court was to be held  madame de melbain turned if possible a shade paler  yes she said slowly i have heard of that we have all heard of that i want to tell you mr wrayson what that fresh evidence consists of  wrayson bowed and waited somehow he felt that he was on the eve of a great discovery  both before my marriage and afterwards madame de melbain said quietly i wrote tocaptain fitzmaurice i was always impulsivewhen i was younger and my letters especially one written on the eve of my marriage would no doubt decide the case against me captain fitzmaurice was killedin natal but in a mysterious way news has reached me of the letters since his death  in what way wrayson asked  for the first time madame de melbain glanced a little nervously about her against listeners however they seemed absolutely secure there was no hidingplace nor any one within sight upon the land was everywhere the silence of a great heat even in the shade where they sat the still air was hot and breathless down in the valley the cows stood knee deep in the stream and a blue haze hung over the vineyards  nearly eighteen months ago madame de melbain continued i received a letter signed by the name of morris barnes the writer said that he had just arrived from south africa and had picked up on one of the battlefields there a bundle of letters which he had come to the conclusion must have been written by me he did not mince matters in the least he was a blackmailer pure and simple he had given me the first chance of buying these letters what was my offer  a sharp ejaculation broke from wraysons lips louise signed to him to be silent  amy was with me when the letters came madame de melbain continued she left at once for england to see this man the sum he demanded was impossible all that she could do was to ask for time and to arrange to pay him so much a month whilst we were considering how to raise the money he accepted this and promised to keep silence he kept his word but for a time only he made inquiries and he seems to have come to the conclusion that the money was on the other side at any rate he approached the advisers of my husband he was in treaty with them for the letterswhen hewhen he met with his death  wrayson had a feeling that the heat was becoming intolerable he dared not look at louise his eyes were fixed upon the still expressionless face of the woman whose story was slowly unfolding its tragic course  a rumour of this madame de melbain continued reached us in mexonia i telegraphed to amy she and louise were at their wits ends louise decided to go and see this man barnes to make her way if she could into his flat to search for and if she could find them to steal these letters she carried out her purpose or rather her attempted purpose the rest you know for it was you who saved her  the man wrayson said hoarsely was murdered  madame de melbain inclined her head  so i have understood she remarked  he was murdered wrayson continued in a harsh unnatural voice on that very night the night when he was to have made over these letters to yourenemies the message was telephoned to me he was to go to the hotel francis he was warned that there was danger and there was he was murderedwhile the cab waitedto take him there  her eyes held hisshe did not flinch  the man who telephoned to mebentham his name was the agent of your enemieshe too was murdered  so i have heard she said calmly  the letters he faltered where are they  no one knows she answered that is why i live always on the brink of a volcano many people are searching for them no one as yet has succeeded but that may come at any moment  madame he said can you tell me who killed these men  she raised her eyebrows  i cannot she answered coldly  madame he declared the man barnes was a pitiful blackmailing little jew for all i know he deserved death a dozen times overay and bentham too but the law does not look upon it like that whoever killed these men will assuredly be hanged if they are caught dont you think that your friends are a little too zealous  she met his gaze unflinchingly  if friends of mine have done these things she said they are at least unknown to me  he drew a short choking breath of relief yet even now the mystery was deeper than ever he began to think out loud  a friend of yours it must have been he declared barnes was murdered when in a few hours he would have parted with those letters to your enemies bentham was murdered when he was on the point of discovering them there is some one working for you guarding you who desires to remain unknown i wonder  he stopped short a sudden illumining idea flashed through his mind he looked at madame de melbain fixedly  this man duncan who has disappeared so suddenly he said thickly whom did you saywho was it that he reminded you of  madame de melbain lost at last her composure she was white to the lips her eyes seemed suddenly lit with a horrible dread she pushed out her hands as though to thrust it from her  he was killed she cried it was not he he is dead dont dare to speak of anything so horrible  then before they could realize that he was actually amongst them he was there they heard only a crashing of boughs the parting of the hedge he was there on his knees with his arms around the terrified woman who had sobbed out his name louise too swayed upon her feet her fascinated eyes fixed upon the newcomer wrayson understood then that in some way this man had indeed come back from the dead  illustration he was there on his knees with his arms around the terrified woman     chapter xxxi  returned from the tomb   the intervention which a few seconds later abruptly terminated an emotional crisis was in itself a very commonplace one monsieur the proprietor deemed the moment advisable for solving a question which was beginning to distract his better half in the kitchen he advanced towards them all smiles and bows and gestures  monsieur would pardon his inquiringwould monsieur and the ladies be taking dejeuner a fowl of excellence unusual was then being roasted the saladmonsieur could see it growing and madame had thought of an omelet there was no cooler place in all france on a day of heat so extraordinary as the table under the trees yonder and as for strawberrieswell monsieur could see them grow for himself or if it was fraises de bois that madame preferred the children had brought in baskets full only that morning fresh and juicy and of a wonderful size  wrayson interrupted him at last  let luncheon be served as you suggest he directed in the meantime  monsieur jules understood and withdrew with more bows and smiles the significance of his brief appearance upon the lawn was a thing of which he had not the least idea yet after his departure the strain to a certain extent had passed away only madame de melbains eyes seemed scarcely to leave the face of the man who stood still by her chair  alive she murmured grasping his hand in hers you alive  louise had taken his other hand he was imprisoned between the two  yes he said i made what they called a wonderful recovery i suppose it was almost a miracle  but your death louise declared was never contradicted  a good deal of news went astray about that time he remarked grimly i was left and forgotten when i found what had been done i let it go it seemed to me to be better i went up to rhodesia and of course i had the devils luck ive come back to europe simply because i couldnt stand it any longer i was not coming to england and i had no idea of seeing you emilie i travelled here on a little pilgrimage  it was fate she murmured  but since i am here he continued and since we have met again i must ask you this your husband is trying to divorce you  yes she murmured  and why  because he is a brute she answered quietly we have been separated for more than a year i think that he wants to marry again  and you permit this he asked  no she answered i contest it up to now the courts have been in my favour  up to now they must always be in your favour he declared vehemently what can they say against a saint like you  she smiled up at him tenderly a little wistfully  they would say a good deal she whispered if they could see you here now  he drew abruptly away  i am a thoughtless brute he declared it was for that that i decided to remain dead i will go away at once  her fingers closed over his she drew him a little nearer with glad recklessness  you shall not she murmured it is worth a little risk this  wrayson touched louise on the arm and they turned away he found her a seat in a quiet corner of the fruit garden where a tall row of hollyhocks shielded them from observation she was very white and in a semihysterical state  i cant believe she said that that is really duncanduncan himself it is too wonderful  there is no doubt about it being your brother he answered what i dont quite understand is why he has kept away so long  it is because of her she answered if they had been on the same continent i believe that nothing could have kept them apart  and now he asked  i cannot tell she answered i nor any one else god made them for one another i am very sure  he took her hand and held it tightly in his  and you for me dearest he whispered shall i tell you why i am sure of it  she leaned back with halfclosed eyes endurance has its limits and the mesmeric influence of the drowsy summer day was in her veins  if you like she murmured simply  and only a few yards away the man from the dead and the woman who had loved him seemed to have drifted into a summer daydream the strangeness of this thing held them bothordinary intercourse seemed impossible what they spoke about they scarcely knew there were days golden days to be whispered about and lived again treasured minutes to be recalled looks and words remembered of the future of the actual present save of their two selves they scarcely spoke it was an hour snatched from paradise for her she would not let it go lightly she would not suffer even a cloud to pass across it  in time monsieur jules found himself constrained to announce that dejeuner was served he found it useless to try to attract the attention of either madame de melbain or duncan so he went in search of wrayson  monsieur is served he announced looking blandly upwards at a passing cloud there remains the wine only  chablis of the best and ice and mineral water wrayson ordered come louise  she sighed a little as she rose and followed him along the narrow path where the rosebushes brushed against her skirt and the air was fragrant with lavender it had been an interlude only after all though the man whose hand she still held would never have admitted it buthe did not know she prayed to heaven that he never might  luncheon after all with a waiter within hearing and monsieur jules hovering round banished in a great measure the curious sense of unreality from which none of them were wholly free and when coffee came madame leaned a little towards duncan and with her hand upon his arm whispered a question  my letters duncan what became of them  he sighed  i was a little rash perhaps he said butthey were all i had left they were with me at colenso in an envelope sealed and addressed to be burnt unopened when i was hit i got a red cross man to cut them out of my coat and destroy them  madame de melbain looked at him for a moment and her eyes were soft with unshed tears then she turned away though her hand still rested upon his  duncan she said quietly dont think that i mind you did all that you could and indeed i would rather that you cared so much but the letters were not destroyed  for a moment he failed to realize the import of her words  not destroyed he repeated a little vaguely  no she answered they came into the hands of some one in london terrible things have happened in connexion with them duncan if you will listen to me quietly i will tell you about it sit down dear  she saw the gathering storm the mans face was black with anger he was still a little dazed however  you meanthat the man to whom i trusted them  he kept them for his own purpose she said softly  dont look like that duncan he has paid his debt he is dead  and the letters  we do not know my husbands advisers are trying to get possession of them that is why the courts have not yet pronounced their judgment  he had risen to his feet but she drew him gently down again  remember duncan that the man is dead be calm and i will tell you all about it  he looked at her wonderingly  you are not angry with me  angry why should i be i am only happy to know that you never forgotthat you could not bear to destroy the only link that was left between us do you know i am almost sorry that i spoke to you about this we seem to have snatched an hour or two out of paradise and it is i who have stirred up the dark waters let us forget it for a few more minutes  he drew her away with him towards their seat under the trees wrayson looked across at louise with a smile  you too he said may we not forget a little longer  she smiled at him sadly and shook her head  no she answered with them it is different i can scarcely yet realize that i have a brother think what it must be to emilie to have the man whom she loved come back from the grave listen  outside they heard the sound of galloping horses a moment later the baron de courcelles issued from the inn and crossed the lawn towards madame de melbain  madame he said the man who was caught in the park last night is without doubt a spy from mexonia he can be charged with nothing more serious than trespass and in a few minutes he will be free should he return thishe glanced towards duncanwould be the end i have a carriage waiting for you  madame de melbain rose at once with a little gesture of excuse she drew duncan on one side  wait here she begged until you hear from me baron de courcelles is my one faithful friend at court i am going to consult with him  i shall see you again he asked  she hesitated  is it wise she murmured if my enemies knew that you were alive that i had seen you here what chance should i have do you think before the courts  he bent over her hands  i have brought enough trouble upon you he said simply i will wait only i hope that there will be work for me to do     chapter xxxii  at the hÔtel splendide   i asked you the baron remarked helping himself to hors doeuvres to dine with me here because i fancy that the little inn at st Étarpe is being closely watched always when one has private matters to discuss i believe in a certain amount of publicity here we are in a quiet corner it is true but we are surrounded by several hundreds of other people they are far too occupied with their own affairs to watch us it is the last place for instance where our friend from mexonia would dream of looking for us  the three men were seated at a small round table in the great diningroom of the hôtel splendide of dinantonsea the season was at its height and the room was full on every side they were surrounded by chattering groups of english tourists and french holiday makers outside on the promenade a band was playing and a leisurely crowd was passing back and forth  the lady whom we will continue if you please to call madame de melbain the baron continued has desired me to take you two gentlemen into our entire confidence you are both aware that for eighteen months the suit for divorce brought by that ladys husband has been before a special court  one understands wrayson remarked that the sympathies of all europe are withthe lady  the baron bowed  entirely her cause too is the popular one in mexonia it is the ministry and the aristocracy who are on the other side these are anxious for an alliance which will safeguard mexonia from certain dangers to which she is at present exposed madame de melbain as you are both aware comes from one of the oldest families of europe but it is a family without any political significance the betrothal was completed before frederick stood so near to the throne if his accession had seemed even a likely thing at the time it would not have been sanctioned i speak as the staunch friend of the lady whose cause is so dear to us but i wish you to grasp the facts  there was a brief pause whilst a fresh course was served by an apologetic and breathless waiter the three men spoke together for a while on some chance subject then when they were alone the baron continued  the court although powerful influences were at work found itself unable to pronounce the decree which those in authority so much desired all that those who were behind the scenes could do was to keep the case open hoping that while living apart from her husband some trifling indiscretion on the part of madame would afford them a pretext for giving the desired verdict i need not say that up to the present no such indiscretion has occurred but all the time we have been on the brink of a volcano  the letters duncan muttered  the baron nodded  about a year ago he said madame de melbain received a terrifying letter from the miscreant into whose hands they had fallen madame very wisely made a confidant of me and with the baroness de sturm i left at once for london and saw this man i very soon persuaded myself that he had the letters and that he knew their value he asked a sum for them which it was utterly unable for us to pay  did he explain duncan asked how they came into his hands  he said that they were picked up on the battlefield of colenso at first the baron declared afterwards he was brutally frank you see your death was gazetted a fact of which he was no doubt aware he admitted that they had been given to him to destroy  duncan leaned across the table  baron he said who killed that man he cheated me of my task but i should like to know who it was  so would a great many more of us the baron answered the fact is we are in the curious position of having an unknown friend  an unknown friend duncan repeated  the baron nodded  we paid that man two thousand a year he said but he was not satisfied he communicated secretly with the other side and they agreed to buy the letters for ten thousand pounds we knew the very night when he had arranged to hand them over to a man named bentham in london but we were powerless we could not have found the half of ten thousand pounds one thing only was tried and that very nearly ended in disaster an attempt was made to steal the letters mr wrayson will tell you about thatpresently  a maître dhôtel paused at their table to hope that messieurs were well served in a season so busy it was not possible to give the attention to every one they would like was there anything he could do messieurs were drinking he noticed the best wine in the cellars he trusted that they approved of it the young lady there with the diamond collar and the wonderful eyes he bent a little lower over the table that was mademoiselle diane of the folies bergères and the gentleman he had registered under another name but he was well known as the baron x a great capitalist in paris  the maître dhôtel passed on well satisfied that he had interested the three distinguished looking gentlemen who dined alone wrayson as soon as he was out of hearing leaned over the table  it is on that night he said to duncan that i come into touch with the affairs of which our friend has spoken the man barnes had a flat corresponding to mine on the floor above i returned home about midnight and found a young lady who was a complete stranger to me engaged in searching my desk i turned up the lights and demanded an explanation she was apparently quite as much surprised to see me as i was to see her it appeared that she had imagined herself in barnes flat whilst i was talking to her the telephone bell rang some unknown person asked me to convey a message to barnes when i had finished she was gone i sat down and tried to make head or tail of the affair i couldnt barnes was a disreputable little bounder this girl was a lady what connexion could there be between the two i fancied what might happen if she were surprised by barnes and i determined not to go to bed until i heard her come down i fell asleep over my fire and i woke with a start to find her once more upon the threshold of my room she was faintingalmost on the point of collapse i gave her some brandy and helped her downstairs at the door of the flat was a cab and in it was the man barnes deadmurdered  the breath came through duncans teeth with a little hiss one could fancy that he was wishing that his had been the hand to strike the blow the baron glanced round casually he called a waiter and complained of the slow service sent for another bottle of wine and lit a cigarette  i think he said that we will pause for a moment or so mr wraysons narrative is a little dramatic ah mademoiselle la danseuse goes what a toilet  mademoiselle favoured their table with her particular regard as she passed out and accepted with a delightful smile the fan which she dropped in passing and which the baron as speedily restored he resumed his seat stroking his grey moustache  a very handsome young lady he remarked i think that now we may continue  the girl duncan asked quickly  was your sister wrayson answered  there was a moments intense silence duncan was doing his best to look unconcerned but the hand which played with his wineglass shook  howwas he murdered  strangled with a fine cord wrayson answered  in the cab  there or inside the building it is impossible to say  and no one was ever tried for the murder no one wrayson answered  duncan swallowed a glassful of wine  but my sister he said was in his roomsshe might have seen him  your sisters name was never mentioned in the matter wrayson said i was the only witness who knew anything about herandi said nothing  duncan drew a little breath  why he asked  an impulse wrayson answered i felt that she could not have been concerned in such a deed and i felt that if i told all that i knew she would have been suspected so i said nothing i saved her a good deal of trouble and anxiety i dare say and i do not believe that i interfered in any way with the course of justice  duncan looked across the table and raised his glass  i should like to shake hands with you mr wrayson he said only the baron would have fits you acted like a brick i only hope that louise is as grateful as she ought to be  my silence wrayson said was really an impulse there have been times since when i have wondered whether i was wise there are people now at work in london trying to solve the mystery of this murder i acted upon the supposition that no one had seen your sister leave the flat except myself i found afterwards that i was mistaken  the baron leaned forward  one moment mr wrayson he interrupted you have said that there are people in london who are trying to solve the mystery of barnes death who are they  one is the mans brother wrayson answered if possible a more contemptible little cur than the man himself was his only interest is to discover the source of his brothers income he wants money nothing but money the other is a much more dangerous person his name is heneage and he is an acquaintance of my own a barrister and a man of education  why does he interest himself in such an affair duncan asked  because the solution of such matters is a hobby of his wrayson answered it was he who saw your sister and i come out from the flat that morning it was he who warned us both to leave england  the baron leaned forward in his chair  forgive me mr wrayson he said but there is alady at your right who seems anxious to attract your attention we are none of us anxious to advertise our presence here is she by any chance a friend of yours  wrayson looked quickly round he understood at once the barons slight pause the ladies of the french halfworld are skilled enough when necessary in concealing their profession their english sister if she attempts it at all attempts a hopeless task overpowdered overrouged with hair at least two shades nearer copper coloured than last time he had seen her badly but showily dressed it was his friend from the alhambra whose welcoming smile wrayson received with a thrill of interest she was seated at a small table with a slightly less repulsive edition of herself and her smile changed at once into a gesture of invitation wrayson rose to his feet almost eagerly  this is a coincidence he said under his breath she too holds a hand in the game     chapter xxxiii  a hand in the game   the diners at the hotel splendide were a little surprised to see the tall distinguishedlooking englishman leave his seat and accost with quiet deference the elder of the two women whose entrance a few minutes before had occasioned a good many not very flattering comments the lady who called herself blanche meant to make the most of her opportunity  fancy meeting you here she remarked flo this is a friend of mine mrs harrigod gentlemans name doesnt matter does it she added laughing  wrayson bowed and murmured something inaudible blanches friend regarded him with unconcealed and flattering approval  over here for a little flutter i suppose she remarked it is so hot in town we had to get away somewhere are you alone with your friends  quite alone wrayson answered we are only staying for a day or two  the lady nodded  we shall stay for a week if we like it she said if not we shall go on to dieppe did you get my letter  letter wrayson repeated no have you written to me  she nodded  i wrote to you a week ago  i have been staying near here wrayson said and my letters have not been forwarded  he bent a little lower over the table the perfume of violet scent was almost unbearable but he did not flinch  you had some news for me he asked eagerly  yes she answered im not going to tell you now we are going to sit outside after dinner you must come to us there no good having smart friends unless you make use of them she added with a shrill little laugh  i shall take some chairs and order coffee wrayson said in the meantime  if you like to order us a bottle of champagne and tell the waiter to put it on your bill we shant be offended blanche declared we were just wondering whether we could run to it  you must do me the honour of being my guests for dinner also wrayson declared calling a waiter it was very good of you to remember to write  the friend murmured something about it being very kind of the gentleman blanche shrugged her shoulders  oh i remember right enough she said it wasnt that but there wait until ive told you about it its an odd story and sometimes i wish id never had anything to do with it i get a cold shiver every time i think of that old man who took me to dine at luigis outside in threequarters of an hour then  i will keep some chairs and order coffee wrayson said turning away  and bring one of your friends blanche added it wont do him any harm we shant bite him  i will bring them both wrayson promised  he went back to his own table and people watched him curiously  i believe he said quietly as he sat down that if there is a person in the world who can put us on the track of those letters it is the lady with whom i have just been talking  the baron looked across at the two women with new interest  what on earth have they got to do with it wrayson he asked  the fair one was a friend of barnes wrayson answered it was at her flat that he called the night he was murdered  you are sure duncan asked that the letters have not been found yet by the other side  quite sure the baron answered we have agents in mexonia even about the kings person and we should hear in an hour if they had the letters  presuming then duncan said thoughtfully that barnes was murdered for the sake of these lettersand as he was murdered on the very night he was going to hand them over to the other side i dont see what else we can supposethe crime would appear to have been committed by some one on our side  it certainly does seem so the baron admitted  and this man bentham he was the agent forthe kings people he too was murdered baron  well  who killed barnes he robbed me of my right but i want to know  the baron shook his head  i have no idea he said gravely we have agents in london of course but no one who would go to such lengths i do not know who killed barnes nor do i know who killed bentham  there was a short silence the barons words were impressively spoken it was impossible to doubt their veracity yet both to wrayson and to duncan they had a serious import the same thought was present in the mind of all three of themand each avoided the others eyes wrayson however was not disposed to let the matter go without one more effort the corners of his mouth tightened and he looked the baron steadily in the face  baron he said i have told you that there is a man in london who has set himself to solve the mystery of barnes death the two people whom he would naturally suspect are miss fitzmaurice and myself there is strong presumptive evidence against us owing to my silence at the inquest and at any moment we might either of us have to face this charge knowing this do i understand you to say that if the necessity arose you would be absolutely unable to throw any light upon the matter  absolutely the baron declared both those murders are as complete an enigma to me as to you  you have agents in london  agents yes the baron declared but they are in the nature of detectives only they would not dream of going to such lengths either with instructions or without them neither i am sure would any one who was employed to collect evidence upon the other side  there was no more to be said wrayson rose to his feet a little abruptly  the air is stifling here he said let us go outside and take our coffee  they found seats on the veranda looking out upon the promenade the baron looked a little dubiously at the stream of people passing backwards and forwards  are we not a little conspicuous he remarked  does it really matter wrayson asked it is only for this evening i shall leave for london tomorrow in any event besides it is part of the bargain that we take coffee with these ladies here they are  wrayson introduced his friends with perfect gravity chairs were found and coffee and liqueurs ordered wrayson contrived to sit on the outside and next to his copperhaired friend  now for our little talk he said will you have a cigarette youll find these all right  she threw a sidelong glance at him and sighed what an exceedingly earnest young man this was  well she said i know youll give me no peace till ive told you there may be nothing in it thats for you to find out i think myself there is it was last thursday night in the promenade at the alhambra that i saw her  saw whom wrayson interrupted  im coming to that she declared let me tell you my own way i was talking to a friend and i overheard all that she said she was quietly dressed and she looked frightened a poor palefaced little thing she was anyway and she was walking up and down like a stagedoll peering round corners and looking everywhere as though shed lost somebody presently she went up to one of the attendants and i heard her ask him if he knew a mr augustus howard who came there often the man shook his head and then she tried to describe him it was a bit flattering but an idea jumped into my head all of a sudden that it was barnes she was looking for  by jove wrayson muttered under his breath did you speak to her  she nodded  i waited till she was alone and then i made her sit down with me and describe him all over again by the time shed finished i was jolly well sure that it was barnes she was after  did you tell her wrayson asked  not i she answered i didnt want a scene there and besides its your little show not mine i told her that i felt sure i recognized him and that if she would be in the same place at nine oclock a week from that night i could send some one whom i thought would be able to tell her about her friend that was last thursday you want to be just outside the refreshmentroom at nine oclock tomorrow night and you cant mistake her she looks as though shed blown in from an a b c shop  wrayson possessed himself of her hand for a moment in an impulse of apparent gallantry something which rustled pleasantly was instantly and safely transferred to the metal purse which hung from her waistband  you will allow me he murmured  rather she answered with a little laugh what a stroke of luck it was meeting you here flo and i were both stony we hadnt a sovereign between us when wed paid for our tickets  have you seen anything of barnes brother he asked  once or twice at the alhambra she answered  he was wearing his brothers clothes but he looked pretty dicky  you didnt mention this young woman to him i suppose he asked  she shook her head  not i youre the only person ive told hope it brings you luck  wrayson rose to his feet the baron and duncan followed his example they took leave of the ladies and turned towards the promenade  im going to london by the morning boat wrayson announced i believe im on the track of those letters  they walked up and down for a few moments talking as they passed the front of the hotel they heard a shrill peal of laughter blanche and her friend were talking to a little group of men the baron smiled  we have broken the ice for them he said but i am afraid that we are already forgotten     chapter xxxiv  an illassorted couple   wrayson looked anxiously at his watch it was already ten minutes past nine and although he was standing on the precise spot indicated there was no one about who in the least resembled the young woman of whom he was in search the overture to the ballet was being played a good many people were strolling about or seated at the small round tables but they were all of the usual class the ladies ornate and obvious and all having the air of habitués in vain wrayson scanned the faces of the passersby and even the occupants of the back seats there was no sign of the young woman of whom he was in search  presently he began to stroll somewhat aimlessly about still taking note of every one amongst the throng and in a little while he caught sight of a familiar figure sitting alone at one of the small round tables he accosted him at once  how are you heneage he said quietly what are you doing in town at this time of the year  heneage started when he was addressed and his manner when he recognized wrayson lacked altogether its usual composure  im all right he answered beastly hot in town though isnt it im off in a day or two where have you been to  north of france wrayson answered you look as though you wanted a change  im going to scotland directly i can get away  the two men looked at one another for a moment heneage was certainly looking ill there were dark lines under his eyes and his face seemed thinner then too he was still in his morning clothes his tie was ill arranged and his linen not unexceptionable wrayson was puzzled something had gone wrong with the man  you see he said quietly i have been forced to disregard your warning i shall be in england for some little time at any rate may i ask am i in any particular danger  heneage shook his head  not from me at any rate  wrayson looked at him for a moment steadily  do you mean that heneage he asked  yes  you are satisfied then that neither i nor the young lady had anything to do with the death of morris barnes heneage moved in his chair uneasily  yes he answered dont talk to me about that damned business he added with a little burst of halfsuppressed passion ive done with it come and have a drink  wrayson drew a sigh of relief perhaps for the first time he realized how great a weight this thing had been upon his spirits he had feared heneagenot this man but the cold capable stephen heneage of his earlier acquaintance feared him not only for his own sake but hers after all his visit to the alhambra had brought some good to him  heneage had risen to his feet  well go into the american bar he said not here the women fuss round one so im glad youve turned up wrayson ive got the hump  the bar was crowded but they found a quiet corner heneage ordered a large brandy and soda and drunk half of it at a gulp  hows every one wrayson asked i havent been in the club yet  all right i believe i havent been in myself for a week heneage answered  wrayson looked at him in surprise  havent been in the club for a week he repeated thats rather unusual isnt it  damn it all im not obliged to go there am i heneage exclaimed testily  wrayson looked at him in amazement heneage as a rule was one of the most deliberate and eventempered of men  of course not he answered you wont mind telling me how the colonel is though will you  i believe he is very well heneage answered more calmly he doesnt come up to town so often this hot weather forgive me for being a bit impatient old fellow ive got a fit of nerves i think  you want a change wrayson said earnestly theres no doubt about that  i am going away very soon heneage answered as soon as i can get off i dont mind telling you wrayson that ive had a shock and it has upset me  wrayson nodded sympathetically  all right old chap he said im beastly sorry but if you take my advice youll get out of london as soon as you can go to trouville or dinard or some place where theres plenty of life i shouldnt busy myself in the country if i were you by the bye he added there is one more question i should like to ask you if you dont mind  heneage called a waiter and ordered more drinks then he turned to wrayson  well he said go on  about that little brute barnes brother is he about still  heneages face darkened he clenched his fist but recovered himself with a visible effort  yes he answered shortly he is about he is everywhere the little brute haunts me he dogs my footsteps wrayson sometimes i wonder that i dont sweep him off the face of the earth  but why wrayson asked what does he want with you  i will tell you heneage answered when he first turned up i was interested in his story as you know we commenced working at the thing together you understand wrayson  perfectly  wellafter a while it suited meto drop it perhaps i told him so a little abruptly at any rate he was disappointed now he has got an idea in his brain he believes that i have discovered something which i will not tell him he follows me about he pesters me to death he is a slave to that one ideaa hideous almost unnatural craving to get his hands on the source of his brothers money i think that he will very soon be mad to tell you the truth i came in here tonight because i thought i should be safe from him i dont believe he has five shillings to get in the place  wrayson lit a cigarette and smoked for a moment in silence then he turned towards his companion  heneage he said i dont want to annoy you but you must remember that this matter means a good deal to me i am forced to ask you a question and you must answer it have you really found anything out you dont often give a thing up without a reason  heneage answered him with greater composure than he had expected though perhaps to less satisfactory effect  look here wrayson he said you appreciate plain speaking dont you  wrayson nodded heneage continued  you can go to hell with your questions you understand that its plain english  admirably simple wrayson answered and perfectly satisfactory  what do you mean  it answers my question wrayson declared quietly  heneage shrugged his shoulders  you can get what satisfaction you like out of it he said doggedly  it isnt much wrayson admitted i wish i could induce you to treat me a little more generously  heneage looked at him with a curious gleam in his eyes  look here he said take my advice drop the whole affair you see what its made of me itll do the same to you i shant tell you anything you can swear to that ive done with it wrayson done with it you understand that talk about something else or leave me alone  wrayson looked at the man whom he had once called his friend  youre in a queer sort of mood heneage he said  let it go at that heneage answered every man has a right to his moods hasnt he no right to inflict them upon his friends youd say perhaps not but you know im a reasonable person as a rule dontdont  he broke off abruptly in his sentence his eyes were fixed upon a distant corner of the room their expression was unfathomable but wrayson shuddered as he looked away and followed their direction then he too started he recognized the miserable little figure whose presence a group just broken up left revealed heneage rose softly to his feet  let us go before he sees us he whispered hurriedly look sharp  but they were too late already he was on his way towards them shambling rather than walking down the room an unwholesome unattractive even repulsive figure he seemed to have shrunken in size since his arrival in england and his brothers clothes always too large hung about him loose and ungraceful his tie was grimy his shirt frayed his trousers turned up but still falling over his heels his hat too large for him came almost to his ears in the increased pallor and thinness of his face his dark eyes seemed to have come nearer together he would have been a ludicrous object but for the intense earnestness of his expression he came towards them with rapidly blinking eyes he took no notice of heneage but he insisted upon shaking hands with wrayson  mr wrayson he said i am glad to see you again sir you always treated me like a gentleman not like him he added motioning with his head towards heneage hes a thief he is  steady wrayson interrupted you mustnt call people names like that  why not barnes asked he is a thief he knows it he knows who robbed me of my money and he wont tell thats what i call being a thief  wrayson glanced towards heneage and was amazed at his demeanour he had shrunk back in his chair and he was sitting with his hands in his pockets and his eyes fixed upon the table of the two his miserable little accuser was the dominant figure  hes very likely spending it nowmy money barnes continued here am i living on crusts and fourpenny dinners and begging my way in here and some one else is spending my money never mind it may be my turn yet it may be only a matter of hours he added leaning over towards them and showing his yellow teeth and i may have the laugh on both of you  heneage looked up quickly he was obviously discomposed  what do you mean he asked  sydney barnes indulged in the graceless but expressive proceeding of sticking his tongue in his cheek after which he turned to wrayson  mr wrayson he said lend me a quid ive got the flat to sleep in for a few more weeks but i havent got money enough for a meal ill pay you back some dayperhaps before you expect it  wrayson produced a sovereign and handed it over silently  if i were you he said id spend my time looking for a situation instead of hunting about for this supposed fortune of your brothers  barnes took the sovereign with hot trembling fingers and deposited it carefully in his waistcoat pocket then he smiled in a somewhat mysterious manner  mr wrayson he said perhaps im not so far off after all other people can find out what he knows he added pointing at heneage he aint the only one who can see through a brick wall say mr wrayson youve always treated me fair and square he added leaning towards him and dropping his voice can you tell me this did morry ever go swaggering about calling himself by any other namebit more tony eh  wrayson started for a moment he did not reply thoughts were rushing through his brain was he forestalled in his search for this girl meanwhile barnes watched him with a cunning gleam in his deepset eyes  such as augustus howard eh real tony name that for morry  wrayson with a sudden instinctive knowledge brushed him on one side and half standing up gazed across the room at the corner from which his questioner had come with her back against the wall her cheap prettiness marred by her red eyes her illarranged hair and ugly hat sat beyond a doubt the girl for whom he had waited in the promenade     chapter xxxv  his wife   wrayson drew a little breath and looked back at sydney barnes  you asked me a question he said i believe i have heard of your brother calling himself by some such name  barnes grasped him by the arm  look here he said come and repeat that to the young lady over there shes with me it wont do you any harm  wrayson rose to his feet but before he could move he felt heneages hand fall upon his arm  where are you going wrayson he asked  barnes looked up at him anxiously his pale face seemed twisted into a scowl  dont you interfere he exclaimed youve done me enough harm you have you let mr wrayson pass hes coming with me  heneage took no more notice of him than he would of a yapping terrier he looked over his head into wraysons eyes  wrayson he said dont have anything more to do with this business take my advice i know more than you do about it if you go on i swear to you that there is nothing but misery at the end  i know more than you think i do wrayson answered quietly i know more indeed than you have any idea of if the end were in hell i should not hold back  heneage hesitated for a moment he stood there with darkening face an obstinate almost a threatening figure passersby looked with a gleam of interest at the oddly assorted trio whose conversation was obviously far removed from the ordinary chatter of the loungers about the place one or two made an excuse to linger byit seemed possible that there might be developments heneage however disappointed them he turned suddenly upon his heel and left the room those who had the curiosity to follow along the corridor saw him without glancing to the right or to the left descend the stairs and walk out of the building he had the air of a man who abandons finally a hopeless task  the look of relief in barnes face as he saw him go was a ludicrous thing he drew wrayson at once towards the corner  queer thing about this girl he whispered in his ear she aint like the others about here she just comes to make inquiries about a friend whos given her the chuck and whose name she says was howard i believe its morry she means just like him to take a toffs name  wait a moment before we speak to her wrayson said how did you find her out  she spoke to me barnes answered asked me if my name was howard said i was a bit like the man she was looking for then i palled up to her and im pretty certain morry was her man i want her to go to the flat with me and see his clothes and picture but shes scared mr wrayson you might do me a good turn shell come if youd go too  do you know why i am here tonight wrayson asked  no why  to meet that young woman of yours wrayson answered  barnes looked at him in amazement  what do you mean he asked quickly you dont know her do you  his sallow cheeks were paler than ever his narrow eyes furtively raised to wraysons were full of inquisitive fear  no i dont know her wrayson answered but i rather fancy all the same that she is the young person whom i came here to meet tonight  barnes waited breathlessly for an explanation he did not say a word but his whole attitude was an insistent interrogation point  you remember wrayson said that when you and i were pursuing these investigations together i made some inquiries of the woman at whose flat your brother called on the night of his murder i saw her again at dinant yesterday and she told me of this young person she also evidently believed that the man for whom she was inquiring was your brother  barnes nodded  she told me that she was to have met a gentleman tonight he said here we must go and speak to her now or shell think that somethings up  he performed something that was meant for an introduction  friend of mine miss he said indicating wrayson knew my brother well lived in the flat just below him in fact perhaps youd like to ask him a few questions  there is only one question i want answered the girl replied with straining eyes fixed upon wraysons face and a little break in her tone shall i see him again if augustus was reallyhis brotherwhere is he what has happened to him  there was a moments silence sydney barnes had evidently said nothing as to his brothers tragic end wrayson could see too that the girl was on the brink of hysterics and needed careful handling  we will tell you everything he said presently but first of all we have to decide whether your augustus howard and morris barnes were the same person i think that the best way for you to decide this would be to come home to my flat mr barnes is just above and i dare say you can recognize some of his brothers belongings if he really wasyour friend  she rose at once she was perfectly willing to go they left the place together and entered a fourwheeler during the drive she scarcely opened her lips she sat in a corner looking absently out of the window and nervously clasping and unclasping her hands she answered a remark of sydney barnes without turning her head  i always watch the people she said wherever i am i always look out of the window i have always hopedthat i might see augustus again that way  wrayson from his seat in the opposite corner of the cab watched her with growing sympathy in her very conformity to type she represented so naturally a real and living unit of humanity her poor commonplace prettiness was already on the wane stamped out by the fear and trouble of the last few months yet inane though her features lacking altogether strength or distinction there was stamped into them something of that dumb doglike fidelity to some object which redeemed them from utter insignificance wrayson as he watched her found himself thinking more kindly of the dead man himself in his vulgar selfish way he had probably been kind to her he must have done something to have kindled this flame of dogged persevering affection already he scarcely doubted that morris barnes and augustus howard had been the same person within a very few minutes of her entering the flats there remained no doubt at all with a low moan like a dumb animal mortally hurt she sank down upon the nearest chair clasping the photograph which sydney barnes had passed her in her hands  for a few moments there was silence then she looked upat wrayson her lips moved but no words came she began again this time he was able to catch the indistinct whisper  where is he  wrayson took a seat by her side upon the sofa  you do not read the newspapers he asked  she shook her head  not much my eyes are not very good and it tires me to read  i am afraid he said gently that it will be bad news  a little sob caught in her throat  go on she faltered  he is dead wrayson said simply  she fainted quietly away  wrayson hurried downstairs to his own flat for some brandy when he returned the girl was still unconscious her pocket was turned inside out and the front of her dress was disordered sydney barnes was bending close over her wrayson pushed him roughly away  you can wait at least until she is well he said contemptuously  sydney barnes was wholly unabashed he watched wrayson pour brandy between the girls lips bathe her temples and chafe her hands all the time he stood doggedly waiting close by no considerations of decency or humanity would weigh with him for one single second the fever of his great desire still ran like fire through his veins he did not think of the girl as a human creature at all simply there was a pair of lips there which might point out to him the way to his paradise  she opened her eyes at last sydney barnes came a step nearer but wrayson pushed him once more roughly away  you are feeling better he asked kindly  she nodded and struggled up into a sitting posture  tell me she said how did he die it must have been quite sudden was it an accidentoror  he saw the terror in her eyes and he spoke quickly all the time he found himself wondering how it was that she was guessing at the truth  we are afraid he said that he was murdered it is surprising that you did not read about it in the papers  she shook her head  i do not read much she said and the name was different who was itthat killed him  no one knows he answered  when was it she asked  he told her the date she repeated it tearfully  he was down with me the day before she said he was terribly excited all the time and i know that he was a little afraid of something happening to him he had been threatened  do you know by whom wrayson asked  she shook her head  he never told me she answered he didnt tell me much but he was very very good to me i was at the refreshmentroom at london bridge when i first met him he used to come in and see me every day then he began to take me out and at last he found me a little house down at putney and i was so happy i had been so tired all my life she added with a little sigh and down there i did nothing but rest and rest and wait for him to come it was too good to last of course but i didnt think it would end like this  quietly but very persistently sydney barnes insisted on being heard  its my turn now he said standing by wraysons side look here miss im his brother you can see that cant you  you are something like him she admitted only he was much much nicer to look at than you  never mind that he continued eagerly im his brother his nearest relative everything he left behind belongs to me  notquite everything she protested  what do you mean he asked sharply  you may be his brother she answered but i holding out her left hand a little nervously i was his wife     chapter xxxvi  the murdered mans effects   both men had been totally unprepared for the girls timid avowal to wrayson however after the first mild shock of surprise it was of no special import to sydney barnes although he made a speedy effort to grapple with the situation it came very much as a thunderclap  you have your certificate he asked sharply you were married properly in a church  she nodded we were married at dulwich parish church she answered it was nearly a year ago  very well sydney barnes said it is lucky that i am here to look after your interests we divide everything you know  she seemed about to cry  i want augustus she murmured he was very good to me  look here he said augustus always seemed to have plenty of oof didnt he  she nodded  he was very generous with it too she declared he gave me lots and lots of beautiful things  his eyes travelled over her hands and neck destitute of ornaments  where are they he asked sharply  ive had to sell them she answered to get along at all i hated to but i couldnt starve  the young mans face darkened  come he said wed better have no secrets from one another you know how to get at his money i suppose  she shook her head  indeed i dont know anything about it she declared  you must know where it came from he persisted  i dont she repeated indeed i dont he never told me and i never asked him i understood that he had made it in south africa  sydney barnes wiped the perspiration from his forehead  look here he said in a voice which notwithstanding his efforts to control it trembled a little this is a very serious matter for us you dont want to go back to the refreshment bar again do you  i dont care what i do she answered dully i hated that but i shall hate everything now that he is gone  its only for a day or two youll feel like that he declared weve got a right you and i to whatever morry left behind and whatever happens i mean to have my share look around you  it was not an inspiring spectacle the room was dirty and almost devoid of furniture  all that ive had out of it so far he declared is free quarters here the rents paid up to the end of the year ive had to sell the furniture bit by bit to keep alive it was a cheap lot cheap and showy and it fetched jolly little morry always did like to have things that looked worth more than he gave for them even his jewellery was shamevery bally bit of it there wasnt a real pearl or a real diamond amongst the lot but theres no doubt about the money ive had the bankbook he was worth a cool two thousand a year was morrythats five hundred each quarter day you understand and somewhere or other there must be the bonds or securities from which this money came he never kept them here ill swear to that therefore they must be somewhere that you ought to know about  she nodded wearily  very likely she said i have a parcel he gave me to take care of  the effect of her simple words on barnes was almost magical the dull colour streamed into his sallow cheeks he shook all over with excitement his voice when he spoke was almost hysterical he had been so near to despair this indeed had been almost his last hope  a parcel he gasped a parcel what sort of a parcel did he say that it was important  its just a long envelope tied up with red tape and sealed she answered yes he made a great fuss about leaving it with me  tell us all about it he demanded greedily oh lord oh lord be quick  it must have been almost the very day it happened she said with a little shudder he came down in the afternoon and he seemed a bit queer as though he had something on his mind he took out the envelope once or twice and looked at it once he said to me agnes he said there are men in london who if they knew that i carried this with me would kill me for it i was frightened and i begged him to leave it somewhere i think he said that he had to have it always with him because he couldnt think of a safe hidingplace for it just as he was going though he came back and took it out of his pocket once more  he left it with you barnes exclaimed you have it safe  she nodded  i was going to tell you look here agnes he said im nervous tonight i dont want to carry this about with me i shall want it tomorrow and ill come down for it tonights a dangerous night for me to be carrying it about those were just about his last words he gave me the packet and i begged him to be careful then he kissed me and off he went smoking a cigar and as cheerful as though he were going to a wedding  she began to cry again but barnes broke in upon her grief  didnt he tell you anything more about it he demanded  he told meif anything happened to him she sobbed to open it  we must do so he declared we must do so at once there must be a quarters dividends overdue we can get the money tomorrow and thenoh my god he exclaimed as though the very anticipation made him faint where is the packet  at the bottom of my tin trunk in my rooms she answered i had to leave the house i couldnt pay the rent any longer  where are the rooms he demanded well go there now  in labrador street she answered its a poor part but ive only a few shillings in the world  well have a cab he declared rising mr wrayson will lend us the money perhaps  i will come with you wrayson said quietly  we neednt bother you to do that sydney barnes declared with a suspicious glance  the young woman looked towards him appealingly he nodded reassuringly  i think he said that it will be better for me to come i am concerned in this business after all you know  i dont see how barnes declared sullenly if this young lady is my sisterinlaw surely she and i can settle up our own affairs  wrayson stood with his back to the door facing them  i hope he said that you will not either of you be disappointed in what you find in that packet but i think it is only right to warn you i have reason to believe that you will not find any securities or bonds there at all i believe that you will find that packet to consist of merely a bundle of old letters and a photograph  barnes spat upon the floor he was shaking with fright and anger  i dont believe it he declared what can you know about it  wrayson shrugged his shoulders  look here he said the matter is easily settled we will put this young lady in a cab and she shall bring the packet to my flat below you and she shall open it and if you find securities there i have no more to say except to wish you both luck if on the other hand you find the letters it will be a different matter  the girl had risen to her feet  i would rather go alone she said if you will pay my cab i will bring the packet straight back  wrayson and barnes waited in the formers flat barnes drank two brandy and sodas and walked restlessly up and down the room wrayson was busy at the telephone and carried on a conversation for some moments in french directly he had finished barnes turned upon him  whom were you talking to he demanded  a friend of yours he answered i have asked her to come round for a few minutes  a friend of mine  the baroness  the colour burned once more in his cheeks he looked down at his attire with dissatisfaction  i didnt want to see her again just yet he muttered wrayson smiled  she wont look at your clothes he remarked and i rather want her here  barnes was suddenly suspicious  what for he demanded what has she got to do with the affair i wont have strangers present  my young friend wrayson said i may just as well warn you that i think you are going to be disappointed i am almost certain that i know the contents of that packet you will find that it consists as i told you before not of securities at all but simply a few old letters  barnes eyes narrowed  whatever they are he said they meant a couple of thousand a year to morry and they were worth his life to somebody how do you account for that eh  you want the truth wrayson asked  yes  your brother was a blackmailer  the breath came through barnes teeth with a little hiss he realized his position almost at once he was trapped  he walked up to wraysons side his voice shook but he was in deadly earnest  look here he said the contents of that packet whatever they may be are minemine and hers you have nothing to do with the matter at all i will not have you in the room when they are opened  wrayson shrugged his shoulders  the packet will be opened here he said and i shall certainly be present  barnes ground his teeth  if you touch one of those papers or letters or whatever they may be you shall be prosecuted for theft he declared i swear it  wrayson smiled  i will run the risk he declared ah baroness this is kind of you he added throwing open the door and ushering her in there is a young friend of yours here who is dying to renew his acquaintance with you  she smiled delightfully at sydney barnes and threw back her cloak she had just come in from the opera and diamonds were flashing from her neck and bosom her gown was exquisite the touch of her fingers an enchantment it was impossible for him to resist the spell of her presence  you have been very unkind she declared you have not been to see me for a very long time i do not think that i shall forgive you what do you say mr wrayson do you think that he deserves it  wrayson smiled as he threw open the door once more he felt that the next few minutes might prove interesting     chapter xxxvii  the widows ultimatum   sydney barnes stepped quickly forward if wrayson had permitted it he would have snatched the packet from the girls fingers wrayson however saw his intent and intervened he stepped forward and led her to his writing table  i want you to sit down here quietly and open the envelope he said switching on the electric lamp that is what he told you to do isnt it there may be a message for you inside  she looked round a little fearfully the presence of the baroness evidently discomposed her  i thought she said that we were going to be alone that there would have been no one here but him and you  the lady is a friend of mine wrayson said and it is very likely that she may be interested in the contents of this envelope  she untied the string with trembling fingers wrayson handed her a paperknife and she cut open the top of the envelope then she looked up at him appealingly  ii dont want to look inside she half sobbed  wrayson took up the envelope and shook out its contents before her there was a letter addressed simply to agnes and a small packet wrapped in brown oilcloth and secured with darkgreen ribbon sydney barnes hand stole out but wrayson was too quick for him he changed his position so as to interpose his person between the packet and any one in the room  read the letter he told the girl it is addressed to you  she handed it to him her eyes were blinded with tears  read it for me please she said  he tore open the envelope and read the few lines scrawled upon a half sheet of notepaper he read them very softly into her ear but the words were audible enough to all of them  my dear agnesi have just discovered that there are some people on my track who mean mischief i have a secret they want to rob me of i seem to be followed about everywhere i go what they want is the little packet in this envelope im leaving it with you because i darent carry it about with me ive had two narrow escapes already  now youll never read this letter unless anything happens to me ive made up my mind to sell this packet for what i can get for it and take you with me out of the country itll be a matter of ten thousand quid and i only wish i had my fingers on it now and was well out of the country but this is where the rub comes in if anything happens to me before i can bring this off im hanged if i know what to tell you to do with the packet its worth its weight in banknotes to more persons than one but theres a beastly risk in having anything to do with it i think youd better burn it theres money in it but i dont see how you could handle it burn it agnes its too risky a business for you i only hope that in a week or so i shall burn this letter myself and you and i will be on our way to america  so long nessie  from your loving husband  psby the bye my real name is morris barnes  there was an instants pause as wrayson finished reading then there came a longdrawnout whisper from sydney barnes he was close to the girl and his eyes were riveted upon the little packet  tenthousandpounds ah five thousand each give me the packet sisterinlaw  she stretched out her hand as though to obey wrayson checked her  remember he said what your husband told you you were to burn that packet he was right your husband was a blackmailer mrs barnes and he paid the penalty of his infamous career with his life i shall not allow either you or your brotherinlaw to follow in his footsteps  she flashed an indignant glance upon him  who are you calling names she demanded he was my husband and he was good to me  i beg your pardon and his wrayson said i was wrong to use such a word but i want you to understand that to attempt to make money by the contents of that packet is a crime your husband paid the penalty he knew what he was doing when he commanded you to burn it  she looked towards sydney barnes  what do you say she asked  the words leaped from his mouth he was half beside himself  i say let us open the packet and look it through ourselves before we decide what the devil business is it of anybody elses he was my brother and your husband these people werent even his friends theyve no right to poke their noses into our affairs you tell them so sisterinlaw give me the packet come away with me somewhere where we can look it through quietly im fair and straight it shall be halves i swear i say sisterinlaw agnes you dont want to go back to the refreshment bar do you  no she moaned no no  nor do i want to go back to the gutter he declared fiercely but money isnt to be had for the picking up ten thousand pounds morris expected to get for that packet its hard if we cant make half of that  she looked up at wrayson as though for advice  mrs barnes he said gravely i can tell you what is in that packet you can see for yourself then whether it is anything by means of which you can make money it consists of the letters of a very famous woman to the man whom she loved they were stolen from him on the battlefield i do not wish to pain you but the thief was morris barnes the friends of the lady who wrote them paid your brother two thousand pounds a year her enemies offered himten thousand pounds down there is the secret of morris barnes wealth  sydney barnes leaned over the back of her chair his hot whisper seemed to burn her cheek  keep the packet sisterinlaw dont part  your brotherinlaw wrayson remarked is evidently disposed to continue your husbands operations remember you are not at liberty to do as he asks your husbands words are plain he orders you to burn the packet  how do i know that you are telling me the truth she asked abruptly  undo the packet he suggested a glance inside should show you  for some reason or other she seemed dissatisfied she pointed towards the baroness  what is she doing here she asked  she is a friend of the woman who wrote those letters wrayson answered i want her to see them destroyed  there was silence for several moments the girls fingers closed upon the packet she turned round and faced them all she faced them all but she addressed more particularly wrayson  you are wondering why i hesitate she said slowly augustus said destroy the packet and i suppose i ought to do it  by god you shant sydney barnes broke in fiercely morry didnt know that i should be here to look after things  she waited until he had finished but she seemed to take very little if any notice of his intervention  it isnt she continued that im afraid to go back to the bar ill have to go to work some where i suppose but it isnt that i want to know she leaned a little forwardi want to know who it is that has robbed me of my husband i dont care what he was to other people he was very good to me and i loved him i should like to see the person who killed him hanged  wrayson for a moment was discomposed  but that he said has nothing to do with obeying your husbands directions about that packet  she looked at him with tired eyes and changeless expression  hasnt it she asked i am not so sure you have explained about these letters it is quite certain that my husband was killed by either the friends or the enemies of the woman who wrote these letters i think that if i take this packet to the police it will help them to find the murderer  her new attitude was a perplexing one wrayson glanced at the baroness as though for counsel she stepped forward and laid her hand upon the girls shoulder  there is one thing which you must not forget mrs barnes she said quietly your husband knew that he was running a great risk in keeping these letters and making a living out of them his letter to you shows that he was perfectly aware of it of course it is a very terrible a very inexcusable thing that he should have been killed but he knew perfectly well that he was in danger cant you sympathize a little with the poor woman whose life he made so miserable let her have her letters back you will not find her ungrateful  the girl turned slowly round and faced the baroness they might indeed have represented the opposite poles in femininity from the tips of her perfectly manicured fingers to the crown of her admirably coiffured hair the baroness stood for all that was elegant and refined in the innermost circles of her sex agnes would have looked more in place behind the refreshment bar from which morris barnes had brought her her dress of cheap shiny silk was ill fitting and hopeless her hat with its faded flowers and crushed shape an atrocity boots and gloves and brooch of artificial gemsall were shocking little was left of her palefaced prettiness the tragedy which had stolen into her life had changed all that yet she faced the baroness without flinching she seemed sustained by the suppressed emotion of the moment  he was my man she said fiercely and no one had any right to take him away from me he was my husband and he was brutally murdered you tell me that i must give up the letters for the sake of the woman who wrote them what do i care about her is she as unhappy as i am i wonder i will not give up the letters she added clasping them in her hand excepton one condition  if it is a reasonable one the baroness said smiling there will be no difficulty  agnes faced her a little defiantly  it depends upon what you call reasonable she said find out for me who it was that killed my husband you or any one of you and you shall have the letters  sydney barnes smiled and left off nervously tugging at his moustache if this was not exactly according to his own ideas it was at any rate a step in the right direction wrayson was evidently perplexed the baroness adopted a persuasive attitude  my dear girl she said we dont any of us know who killed your husband after all what does it matter it is terribly sad of course but he cant be brought back to life again you have yourself to think of and how you are to live in the future give me that packet i will destroy it before your eyes and i promise you that you shall have no more anxiety about your future  the girl rose to her feet the packet was already transferred to the bosom of her dress  i have told you my terms she said some of you know all about it i dare say tell me the truth and you shall have the packet any one of you  wrayson leaned forward  the truth is simple he said earnestly we do not know i can answer for myself i think that i can answer for the others  then the packet shall help me to find out she declared  the baroness shook her head  it will not do my dear girl she said quietly the packet is not yours  the girl faced her defiantly  who says that it is not mine she demanded  i do the baroness replied  and i wrayson echoed  and i say that it is hershers and mine sydney barnes declared she shall do what she likes with it she shall not be made to give it up  mrs barnes the baroness declared briskly you must try to be reasonable we will buy the packet from you  sydney barnes nodded his head approvingly  that he said is what i call talking common sense  we will give you a thousand pounds for it the baroness continued  its not enough not near enough barnes called out hastily dont you listen to them agnes  i shall not she answered ten thousand pounds would not buy it i have said my last word i am going now in three days time i shall return i will give up the letters then in exchange for the name of my husbands murderer if i do not get that i shall go to the police  she rose and walked out of the room they all followed her the baroness whispered in wraysons ear but he shook his head  it is impossible he said firmly we cannot take them from her by force  the baroness shrugged her shoulders she caught the girl up upon the stairs and they descended together wrayson and sydney barnes followed the latter biting his nails nervously and maintaining a gloomy silence at the entrance wrayson whistled for a cab and handed agnes in sydney barnes attempted to follow her  i will see my sisterinlaw home he declared but wraysons hand fell upon his arm  no he said mrs barnes can take care of herself she is not to be interfered with  she nodded back at him from the cab  i dont want him she said i dont want any one in three days time i will return  and until then you will not part with the letters wrayson said  until then she answered i promise  the cab drove off sydney barnes turned upon wrayson white and venomous  where do i come in here he demanded fiercely  i sincerely trust wrayson answered suavely that you are not coming in at all but you too can return in three days     chapter xxxviii  ineffectual wooing   at last wrayson said to himself almost under his breath shall we have a hansom louise or do you care for a walk  a walk by all means she answered hurriedly  it is not far is it  a milea little more perhaps he answered  you are sure that you are not tired  tired only of sitting still she answered we had a delightful crossing this way isnt it  they left the grosvenor hotel where louise with madame de melbain had arrived about an hour ago and turned towards battersea louise began to talk nervously and with a very obvious desire to keep the conversation to indifferent subjects wrayson humoured her for some time they spoke of the journey suddenly determined upon by madame de melbain on receipt of his telegram of the beauty of st Étarpe of the wonderful reappearance of her brother  i can scarcely realize even now she said that he is really alive he is so altered he seems a different person altogether  he has gone through a good deal wrayson remarked  she sighed  poor duncan she murmured  he is very much to be pitied wrayson said seriously i at any rate can feel for him  he turned towards her as he spoke and his words were charged with meaning she began quickly to speak of something else but he interrupted her  louise he said is london so far from st Étarpe  what do you mean she asked  i think that you know very well he answered i am sure that you do at st Étarpe you were content to accept what believe me is quite inevitable herewell you have been doing all you can to avoid me havent you  perhaps she admitted st Étarpe was an interlude i told you so you ought to have understood that  they entered the park and wrayson was silent for a few minutes he led the way towards an empty seat  let us sit down he said and talk this out  she hesitated  i think she began but he interrupted her ruthlessly  if you prefer it i will come to the baroness with you he declared  she shrugged her shoulders and sat down  very well she said but i warn you that i am in a bad temper i am hot and tired and dusty we shall probably quarrel  he looked at her critically she was a little pale perhaps but there was nothing else to indicate that she had just arrived from a journey her dress of dull black glace silk was cool and spotless her hat and veil were immaculate always she had the air of having just come from the hands of an experienced maid from the tips of her patent shoes to the fall of her veil she was orderly and correct  it takes two he said to quarrel i shall not quarrel with you all that i ask from you is a realization of the fact that we are engaged to be married  she withdrew the hand which he had calmly possessed himself of  we are nothing of the sort she declared  he looked puzzled  perhaps he remarked i forgot to mention the matter last time i saw you but i quite thought that you would take it for granted in case i was forgetful please let me impress the fact upon you now we are going to be married and very shortly in fact the sooner the better  of her own free will she laid her hand upon his he fancied that behind her veil the tears had gathered in her eyes  dear friend she said softly i cannot marry you i shall never marry any one will you please believe that it will make it so much easier for me  he was a little taken aback she had changed her methods suddenly and he had had no time to adapt himself to them  dont hate me please she murmured indeed it would make me very happy if we could be friends  he laughed a little unnaturally and turned in his seat until he was facing her  would you mind lifting your veil for a moment louise he asked her  she obeyed him with fingers which trembled a little he saw then that the tears had indeed been in her eyes her lips quivered she looked at him sadly but very wistfully  thank you he said now would you mind asking yourself whether friendship between us is possible remember st Étarpe and ask yourself that remember our seat amongst the rosesremember what you will of that long golden day  she covered her face with her hands  ah no he went on you know yourself that only one thing is possible i cannot force you into my arms louise if you care to take up my life and break it in two you can do it but think what it means i am not rich but i am rich enough to take you where you will to live with you in any country you desire i dont know what your scruples arei shall never ask you again but dear you must not you must not send me away  she was silent she had dropped her veil and her head had sunk a little  if i believed that there was anybody else he continued i would go away and leave you alone if i doubted for a single moment that i could make you happy i would not trouble you any more but you belong to me louise you have taken up your place in my life in my heart i cannot live without you i do not think that you can live without me you mustnt try dear you mustnt  he held her unresisting hand but her face was hidden from him  what it is that you fancy comes between us i cannot tell he continued more gravely only let me tell you this we are no longer in any danger from stephen heneage he has abandoned his quest altogether he has told me so with his own lips  you are sure of that she asked softly  absolutely he answered  she hesitated for a moment he remained purposely silent he was anxious to try and comprehend the drift of her thoughts  do you know why she asked did he find the task too difficult or did he relinquish it from any other motive  i am not sure wrayson answered i met him the night before last he was very much altered he had the appearance of a man altogether unnerved perhaps it was my fancy but i got the idea  well she demanded eagerly  that he had come across something in the course of his investigations which had given him a shock he said he seemed all broken up of course it may have been something else altogether at any rate i have his word for it he has ceased his investigations altogether and broken with sydney barnes  the afternoon was warm but she shivered as she rose a little abruptly to her feet he laid his hand upon her arm  not without my answer he begged  she shook her head sadly  my very dear friend she said sadly you must always be that is all  he took his place by her side  your very dear friend he repeated well it is a relationship i dont know much about i havent had many friendships amongst your sex tell me exactly what my privileges would be  you will learn that she said in time  he shook his head  i think not he declared friendship to be frank with you would not satisfy me in the least  then i must lose you altogether she murmured in a low tone  i dont think so he affirmed coolly i consider that you belong to me already you are only postponing the time when i shall claim you  she made no remark and behind her veil her face told him little a moment later they issued from the park and stood on the pavement before the baroness flat she held out her hand without a word  i think he said that i should like to come in and see the baroness  not now she begged we shall meet again at dinnertime  where he asked eagerly  madame desired me to ask you to join us at the grosvenor she answered at halfpast eight  i shall be delighted he answered promptly you nearly forgot to tell me  she shook her head  no i didnt she said i should not have let you go away without giving you her message  and you will let me bring you home afterwards  we shall be delighted she answered i shall be with amy of course  he smiled as he raised his hat and let her pass in  the baroness he said is always kind  he stood for a moment on the pavement then he glanced at his watch and hailed a cab  the sheridan club he told the man he had decided to appeal to the colonel     chapter xxxix  the colonels mission   wrayson was greeted enthusiastically as he entered the club billiardroom by a little circle of friends unbroken except for the absence of stephen heneage the colonel came across and laid his hand affectionately on his arm  how goes it herbert he asked the seabreezes havent tanned you much  im all right wrayson declared had a capital time  youll dine here tonight herbert  wrayson shook his head  i meant to he declared but another engagements turned up no i dont want to play pool mason cant stop colonel do me a favour  the colonel who was always ready to do any one a favour signified his willingness promptly enough but even then wrayson hesitated  i want to talk to you for a few minutes he said without all these fellows round should you mind coming down into the smokingroom  the colonel rose promptly from his seat  not a bit in the world he declared well go into the smokingroom scarcely a soul there much cooler too bring your drink see you boys later  they found two easychairs in the smokingroom of which they were the sole occupants the colonel cut off the end of his cigar and made himself comfortable  now my young friend he said proceed  wrayson did not beat about the bush  its about your daughter louise colonel he said she wont marry me  the colonel pinched his cigar reflectively  she always was a most peculiar girl he affirmed does she give any reasons  thats just what she wont do wrayson explained thats just why ive come to you iicolonel im fond of her i never expected to feel like it about any woman  the colonel nodded sympathetically  and although it may sound conceited to say so wrayson continued i believeno im sure that shes fond of me shes admitted it there  the colonel smiled understandingly  well he said then wheres the trouble you dont want my consent you know that  louise wont marry me wrayson repeated thats the trouble she wont explain her attitude she simply declares that marriage for her is an impossibility  the colonel sighed  im afraid he murmured regretfully that my daughter is a fool  she is anything but that wrayson declared she has some scruple what it is i cant imagine of course at first i thought it was because we were both of us involved in that morris barnes affair but i know now that it isnt that heneage who threatened me and indirectly her has chucked the whole business such danger as there was is over i  interrupting you for one moment the colonel said quietly what has become of heneage  hes in a very queer way wrayson answered you know he started on hot to solve this morris barnes business he warned us both to get out of the country well i saw him last night and he was a perfect wreck he looked like a man just recovering from a bout of dissipation or something of the sort  did you speak to him the colonel asked  i was with him some time wrayson answered his manner was just as changed as his appearance  the colonel was looking for him quite grave his cigar had gone out and he forgot to relight it  dear me he said i am sorry to hear this did he allude to the morris barnes affair at all  he did wrayson answered he gave me to understand in fact that he had discovered a little more than he wanted to  the colonel stretched out his hand for a match and relit his cigar  you believe then he said that heneage has succeeded in solving the mystery of barnes murder and is keeping the knowledge to himself  that was the conclusion i came to wrayson admitted  the colonel smoked for a moment or two in thoughtful silence  well he said it isnt like heneage i always looked upon him as a man without nerves a man who would carry through any purpose he set himself to without going to pieces about it shows how difficult it is to understand the most obvious of us  wrayson nodded  but after all he said it wasnt to talk about heneage that i brought you down here what i want to know colonel is if you can help me at all with louise  the colonels forehead was furrowed with perplexity  my dear herbert he declared there is no man in the world i would sooner have for a soninlaw but what can i do louise wouldnt listen to me in any case i havent any authority or any influence over her i say it to my sorrow but its the truth if it were my little girl down at home now it would be a different matter but louise has taken her life into her own hands she has not spoken to me for years she certainly would not listen to my advice  then if you cannot help me directly colonel wrayson continued can you help me indirectly i have asked you a question something like this before but i want to repeat it i have told you that louise refuses to marry me she has something on her mind some scruple some fear can you form any idea as to what it may be  the colonel was silent for an unusually long time he was leaning back in his chair looking up through the cloud of blue tobacco smoke to the ceiling in reflection his features seemed to have assumed a graver and somewhat weary expression  yes he said at last i think that i can  wrayson felt his heart jump his eyes were brighter an influx of new life seemed to have come to him he leaned forward eagerly  you will tell me what it is colonel he begged  the colonel looked at him with a queer little smile  i am not sure that i can do that herbert he said i am not sure that it would help you if i did and you are asking me rather more than you know  wrayson felt a little chill of discouragement  colonel he said i am in your hands but i love your daughter and i swear that i would make her happy  the colonel looked at his watch  do you know where louise is he asked quietly  number 17 frederic mansions battersea wrayson answered  the colonel rose to his feet  i will go down and see her he said simply you had better wait here for me i will come straight back  colonel youre a brick wrayson declared walking with him towards the door  ill do my best herbert he answered quietly but i cant promise i cant promise anything  wrayson watched him leave the club and step into a hansom he walked a little more slowly than usual his head was a little bent and he passed a club acquaintance in the hall without his customary greeting wrayson retraced his steps and ascended towards the billiardroom with his first enthusiasm a little damped was his errand he wondered so grievously distasteful to his old friend or was the colonel losing at last the magnificent elasticity and vigour which had kept him so long independent of the years  there were others besides wrayson who noticed a certain alteration in the colonel when he reentered the billiardroom an hour or so later his usual greeting was unspoken he sank a little heavily into a chair and he called for a drink without waiting for some one to share it with him they gathered round him sympathetically  feeling the heat a bit colonel  anything wrong downstairs  the colonel recovered himself promptly he beamed upon them all affectionately and set down an empty tumbler with a little sigh of satisfaction  im all right boys he declared i couldnt find a cabhad to walk further than i meant and i wanted a drink badly wrayson come over here i want to talk to you  wrayson sat down by his side  ive done the best i could the colonel said things may not come all right for you quite at once but within a week i fancy itll be all squared up ive found out why she refused to marry you and you can take my word for it that within a week the cause will be removed  youre a brick colonel wrayson declared heartily theres only one thing more id love to have you to tell me  im afraid the colonel began  that you and louise were reconciled wrayson declared colonel there cant be anything between you two of all the people in the world there cant be anything sufficient to keep you and her father and daughter completely apart  you are quite right wrayson the colonel assented a little more cheerfully well you may find that all will come right very soon now by the by ive been talking to the baroness i want you to let me be at your rooms tomorrow night  wrayson hesitated for a moment  you know how we stand he asked  exactly the colonel answered i only wish that i had known before you will have no objection to my coming i suppose  none at all wrayson declared but colonel there is one more question that i must ask you did louise speak to you about her brother  the colonel nodded  she blamed me of course he said slowly because i had never told her it was his own desire and i think that he was right i have telegraphed for him to come over he will be here tonight or tomorrow  wrayson left the club feeling almost lighthearted it was the old story over againthe colonel to the rescue     chapter xl  blackmail   sydney barnes staggered into his apartment with a little exclamation of relief which was almost a groan he slammed the door and sank into an easychair with both his hands he was grasping it so that his fingers were hot and wet with perspiration at last he had obtained his souls desire  he sat there for several minutes without moving the blinds were close drawn and the room was in darkness gradually he began to be afraid he rose and with trembling fingers struck a match on the corner of the tablefortunately he knew exactly where to find itwas a candle he lit it and holding it over his head peered fearfully around convinced at last that he was alone he set it down again wiped the perspiration from his forehead and opening a cupboard in the chiffonnier produced a bottle and a glass  he poured out some spirits and drank it then after rummaging for several moments in his coat pocket he produced several crumpled cigarettes of a cheap variety one of these he proceeded to smoke whilst with trembling fingers he undid the packet which he had been carrying and began a painstaking study of its contents a delicate perfume stole out into the room from those closely pressed sheets so eagerly clutched in his yellowstained fingers a little bunch of crushed violets slipped to the floor unheeded ghoullike he bent over the pages of delicate writing the intimate passionate cry of a soul seeking for its mate they were no ordinary loveletters mostly they were beyond the comprehension of the creature who spelt them out word for word seeking all the time to appraise their exact monetary value to himself but for what he had heard he would have found them disappointing as it was he gloated over them two thousand pounds a year his clever brother had earned by merely possessing them he looked at them almost reverently then he suddenly remembered what else his brother had earned by their possession and he shivered a moment later the electric bell outside pealed and there came a soft knocking at the door  a little cryhalf stifledbroke from his lips with numbed and trembling fingers he began tying up the letters the perspiration had broken out upon his forehead some one to see him who could it be he was quite determined not to go to the door he would let no one in again the bell soon they would get tired of ringing and go away he was quite safe so long as he remained quiet quite safe he told himself feverishly then his pulses seemed to stop beating there was a rush of blood to his head he clutched at the sides of his chair but to rise was a sheer impossibility  the thing which was terrifying him was a small thing in itselfthe turning of a latchkey in the door before him on the table was his ownhe knew of no other yet some one was opening had opened his front door he sprang to his feet at last with something which was almost a shriek the door of the room in which he was was slowly being pushed open by the dim candlelight he could distinguish the figure of his visitor standing upon the threshold and peering into the room  his impulse was without doubt one of relief the figure was the figure of a complete stranger nor was there anything the least threatening about his appearance he saw a tall whitehaired gentleman carefully dressed with military exactitude regarding him with a benevolent and apologetic smile  i really must apologize he said for such an unceremonious entrance i felt sure that you were in but i am a trifle deaf and i could not be sure whether or not the bell was ringing so i ventured to use my own latchkey with as you are doubtless observing complete success  who are you and what do you want barnes asked finding his voice at last  my name is colonel fitzmaurice was the courteous reply you will allow me to sit down i have the pleasure of conversing i believe with mr sydney barnes  thats my name barnes answered what do you want with me  despite his visitors urbanity he was still a little nervous the colonel had a somewhat purposeful air and he had seated himself directly in front of the door  i want the colonel said calmly that packet which you have just stolen from mrs morris barnes and which you have in your pocket there  barnes rose at once trembling to his feet his beadlike eyes were bright and venomous he was terrified but he had the courage of despair  i have stolen nothing he declared i dont know what youre talking about i wont listen to you you have no right to force your way into my flat colonel or no colonel i wont have it ill send for the police  the colonel smiled  no he said dont do that besides i know what im talking about i mean the packet which i think i can see sticking out of your coat pocket you have just stolen that from mrs barnes tin trunk you know  i have stolen nothing the young man declared nothing at all i am not a thief i am not afraid of the police  the colonel smiled tolerantly  that is good he said i hate cowards but i am going to make you very much afraid of meunless you are wise and give me that packet  barnes breathed thickly for a moment coward he knew that he was to the marrow of his bones but other of the evil passions were stirring in him then his narrow eyes were alight with greed he had the animal courage of vermin hard pressed  the packet is mine he said fiercely its nothing to do with you get out of my room  he rose to his feet the colonel awaited him with equable countenance he made however no advance  young man the colonel said quietly do you know what happened to your brother  sydney barnes stood still and shivered he could say nothing his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth  your brother was another of your breed the colonel continued a blackmailer a lowliving evilminded brute do you know how he came by those letters  i dont know and i dont care barnes answered with a weak attempt at bluster theyre mine now and im going to stick to them  the colonel shook his head  he broke his trust to a dying man he said softlyto a man who lay on the veldt at colenso with three great wounds in his body and his lifes blood staining the ground he had carried those letters into action with him because they were precious to him his last thought was that they should be destroyed your brother swore to do this he broke his word he turned blackmailer  youre very fond of that word barnes muttered how do you know so much  the soldier was my son the colonel answered and he did not die you see i have a right to those letters will you give them to me  give them up give up all his hopes of affluence his dreams of an easy life of the cheap luxuries and riches which formed the heaven of his desire no he was not coward enough for that he did not believe that this mildlooking old gentleman would use force besides he could not be very strong he ought to be able to push him over and escape  no he answered bluntly i wont  the colonel looked thoughtful  it is a pity he said quietly i am sorry to hear you say that your brother when i asked him made the same reply  barnes felt himself suddenly grow hot and then cold the perspiration stood out upon his forehead  i called upon your brother a few days before his death the colonel continued calmly i explained my claim to the letters and i asked him for them he too refused do you remember by the by what happened to your brother  sydney barnes did not answer but his cheeks were like chalk his mouth was a little open disclosing his yellow teeth he stared at the colonel with frightened fascinated eyes  i can see the colonel continued that you remember young man he added with a curious alteration in his tone be wiser than your brother give me the packet  you killed him the young man gasped it was you who killed morris  the colonel nodded gravely  he had his chance he said even as you have it  there was a dead silence the colonel was waiting sydney barnes was breathing hard he was alone then with a murderer he tried to speak but found a difficulty in using his voice it was a situation which might have abashed a bolder ruffian  the colonel rose to his feet  i am sorry to hurry you he said but we are already late for our appointment with wrayson and his friends  sydney barnes snatched up the packet and retreated behind the table the colonel leaned forward and blew out the candle  i can see better in the dark he remarked calmly you are a very foolish young man     chapter xli  the colonel speaks   wrayson glanced at the clock for the twentieth time  i am afraid he said gravely that mr sydney barnes has been one too many for us  do you think louise asked that he has persuaded the girl to give him the packet  it looks like it wrayson confessed  louise frowned  of course she said i think that you were mad to let her go before she had the letters here in the room you would have been perfectly justified in taking them from her  i suppose so wrayson assented doubtfully somehow she seemed to get the upper hand of us towards the end i think she suspected that some of us knew more than we cared to tell her abouther husbands death  louise shivered a little and remained silent wrayson walked to the window and back  to tell you the truth he said i expected some one else here tonight who has failed to turn up  who is that the baroness asked  wrayson hesitated for a moment and glanced towards louise  colonel fitzmaurice he said  louise seemed to turn suddenly rigid she looked at him steadfastly for a moment without speaking  my father she murmured at last  wrayson nodded  yes he said  butwhat has he to do with this louise asked with her eyes fixed anxiously almost fearfully upon his  i went to him for advice wrayson said quietly he has been always very kind and i thought it possible that he might be able to help us he promised to be here at the same hour as the others listen there is the bell at last  the colonel entered the room louise half rose to her feet wrayson hastened to meet him  herbert he said with an affectionate smile forgive me for being a little late baroness i am delighted to see youand louise  the baroness held out both her hands which the colonel raised gallantly to his lips louise he greeted with a fatherly and unembarrassed smile  i must apologize to all of you he said but perhaps this will be my best excuse  he took the packet from his breast pocket and handed it over to the baroness the room seemed filled with exclamations the colonel beamed upon them all  quite simple he declared i have just taken them from mr sydney barnes upstairs he in his turn took them from  the door was suddenly opened mrs morris barnes rushed into the room and gazed wildly around  where is he she exclaimed he has robbed me the little beast he got into my rooms while i was out  the colonel led her gallantly to a chair  calm yourself my dear young lady he said  where is he she cried has he been here  the colonel shook his head  he is in his room upstairs but he said i should not advise you to go to him  he has my packetaugustus packet she cried springing up  the colonel laid his hand upon her arm  no he said that packet has been restored to its rightful owner  she rose to her feet trembling with anger the colonel motioned her to resume her seat  come he said so far as you are concerned you have nothing to complain of you offered i believe to give it up yourself on one condition  she looked at him with sudden eagerness  well she cried impatiently  that condition he said shall be complied with  she looked into his face with strange intentness  you mean she said slowly that i shall know who it was that killed my husband  yes the colonel answered  a sudden cry rang through the room louise was on her feet she came staggering towards them her hands outstretched  no she screamed no father you are mad send the woman away  he smiled at her deprecatingly  my dear louise he exclaimed our word has been passed to this young woman besides he added circumstances which have occurred within the last hour with our young friend upstairs would probably render an explanation imperative i am sorry for your sake my dear young lady he continued turning to mrs barnes to have to tell you this but if you insist upon knowing it was i who killed your husband  louise fell back into her chair and covered her face with her hands the baroness looked shocked but not surprised wrayson dumb and unnerved had staggered back and was leaning against the table mrs barnes had already taken a step towards the door she was very pale but her eyes were ablaze incredulity struggled with her passionate desire for vengeance  you she exclaimed what should you want to kill him for  the colonel sighed regretfully  my dear young lady he said it is very painful for me to have to be so explicit but the situation demands it i killed him because he was unfit to livebecause he was a blackmailer of women an unclean liver a foul thing upon the face of the earth  its a damned lie the girl hissed he was good to me and you shall swing for it  the colonel looked genuinely distressed  i am afraid he said that you are prejudiced if he was as you say kind to you it was for his own pleasure believe me i made a careful study of his character before i decided that he must go  she looked at him with fierce curiosity  are you a god she demanded that you should have power of life or death who are you to set yourself up as a judge  pray do not believe he begged that i arrogate to myself any such position only unfortunately as regards your late husbands character there could be no mistake and concerning such men as he i have very strong convictions  wrayson who had recovered himself a little laid his hand upon the colonels shoulder  colonel he said hoarsely youre not serious you cant be be careful this woman means mischief she will take you at your word  how else should she take me the colonel asked calmly i suppose her prejudice in favour of this man was natural but all i can say is that under similar circumstances i should act today precisely as i did on the night when i found him about to sell a womans honour for money to minister to the degraded pleasures of his life  the woman leaned towards him venomous and passionate  youre a nice one to preach you are she cried hysterically you with a mans blood upon your hands you a murderer degraded indeed what were his poor sins compared with yours  the colonel shook his head sadly  i am afraid my dear young lady he said that i should never be able to convert you to my point of view you are naturally prejudiced and when i consider that i have failed to convince my own daughterhe glanced towards louiseof the soundness of my views it goes without saying that i should find you also unsympathetic you are anxious i see to leave us permit me  he held open the door for her with grave courtesy but wrayson pushed him aside he had recovered himself to some extent but he still felt as though he were moving in some horrible dream  colonel he exclaimed hoarsely you know what this means you know where she will go  illustration to the nearest police station thats where im off  if he dont let me tell him she interrupted to the nearest police station thats where im off  wrayson glanced quickly at the colonel who seemed in no way discomposed  naturally he assented no one my dear young lady will interfere with you in your desire to carry out your painfully imperfect sense of justice pray pass out  she hesitated for a moment her poor little brain was struggling perhaps for the last time to adapt itself to his point of viewto understand why at a moment so critical he should treat her with the easy composure and tolerant goodnature of one who gives to a spoilt child its own way then she saw signs of further interference on wraysons part and she delayed no longer  the colonel closed the door after her and stood for a moment with his back against it for wrayson had shown signs of a desire to follow the woman whose egress he had just permitted he looked into their faces white with horrorfull of dread of what was to come and he smiled reassuringly  amy he said turning to the baroness surely you and wrayson here are possessed of some grains of common sense louise i know is too easily swayed by sentiment but you wrayson surely i can rely on you  for anything wrayson answered with trembling lips but what can i do what is there to be done  the colonel smiled gently  simply to listen intelligentlysympathetically if you can he declared i want to make my position clear to you if i can you heard what that poor young woman called me probably you would have used the same word yourself a murderer  yes wrayson muttered i heard  when i came back from the soudan twelve years ago i had been instrumental in killing some thousands of brave men i dare say i had killed a score or so with my own hand was i a murderer then  no wrayson answered it was a different thing  then killing is not necessarily murder the colonel remarked good now take the case of a man like morris barnes he belonged to the class of humanity which you can call by no other name than that of vermin whatever he touched he defiled he was without a single good instinct a single passable quality wherever he lived he bred contamination whoever touched him was the worse for it his influence upon the world was an unchanging one for evil put aside sentiment for one moment false sentiment i should say and ask yourself what possible sin can there be in taking the life of such a one if he had gone on four legs instead of two his breed would have been exterminated centuries ago  we are not the judges wrayson began weakly enough  we are sir the colonel thundered for what else have we been given brains the moral sense the knowledge of good or evil there are those amongst us who become decadents whose presence amongst us breeds corruption whose dirty little lives are like the trail of a foul insect across the page of life i hold it a just and moral thing to rid the world of such a creature the sanctity of human life is the canting cry of the falsely sentimental human life is sacred or not according to its achievements such a one as morris barnes i would brush away like a poisonous fly  bentham wrayson faltered  i killed him sir the colonel answered and others of his kidney before him louise knew it i argued with her as i am doing with you but it was useless nevertheless i have lived as seemed good to me  there is the law wrayson said with a horrified glance towards louise he understood now  the colonel bowed his head  i am prepared the colonel answered to pay the penalty of all reformers  there was a ring at the bell wrayson threw open the door a small boy stood there he held a piece of paper in his hand  the lidy said he declared that the whiteheaded gentleman would give me arf a crown for this ere  wrayson gave him the money and stepped back into the room he gave the paper to the colonel who read it calmly first to himself and then aloud                                       i leave you to your conshens he may have been bad but he was good to me  agnes b                                       the colonels eyes grew very soft  poor little woman he said to himself wrayson youll look after her youll see she doesnt come to grief  there was the sound of a heavy fall in the room above the colonels face assumed an air of intense irritation  its that infernal window pole he declared i had doubts about it all the time  wrayson looked at him in horror  what do you mean he demanded  perhaps you had better go up and see the colonel answered taking up his hat a very commonplace tragedy after all i dont quite see what else he could have done he was penniless half mad with disappointment hed been smoking too many cigarettes and drinking too much cheap liquor and he was in danger of arrest for selling the landlords furniture no other end for him i am afraid  wrayson threw open the door  dont hurry the colonel declared youll probably find that he has hanged himself but he must have been dead for some time  wrayson tore up the stairs the colonel watched him for a moment then with a little sigh he began to descend  false sentiment he murmured to himself sadly the worlds full of it     chapter xlii  love remains   wrayson rode slowly up the great avenue and paused at the bend to see for the first time at close quarters the house which from the valley below had seemed little more than a speck of white set in a deep bower of green seen at close quarters its size amazed him with its cluster of outbuildings it occupied nearly the whole of the plateau which was like a jutting tableland out from the side of the mountain it was of two stories only and encircled with a great veranda supported by embowered pillars free at last from the densely growing trees wrayson for the first time during his long climb caught an uninterrupted view of the magnificent panorama below a land of hills of black forests and shining rivers a land uncultivated but rich in promise magnificent in its primitivism it was a wonderful dwelling this of which the owner springing down from the veranda was now on his way to meet his guest  the two men shook hands with unaffected heartiness duncan fitzmaurice in his white linen riding clothes seemed taller than ever a little gaunt and thin too from a recent attack of fever there was no doubt about the pleasure with which he received his guest  where is louise he asked looking behind down the valley  coming up in the wagons wrayson answered she has been riding all day and was tired  a kaffir boy came out with a tray and glasses wrayson helped himself to a whisky and soda and lit a cigar  ill get my pony and ride back with you to meet them duncan said  wrayson detained him  one moment he said i have something to say to you first  duncan glanced at him a little anxiously wrayson answered the look  nothingdisturbing he said you learnt the end of everything from my letters  i think so duncan answered  the verdict on your fathers death was absolutely unanimous wrayson said he was seen to stagger on the platform just as the train came in and he seemed to make every effort to save himself he was killed quite instantaneously i do not think that any one had a suspicion that it was not entirely accidental  duncan nodded  and the other affair  you mean the death of sydney barnes no one has ever doubted that he committed suicide everything seemed to point to it there is only one man who knew about morris barnes and probably guesses the rest his name was heneage and he was your fathers friend he did not speak when he was alive so he is not likely to now there is the young woman of course mrs morris barnes she has married again and gone to canada louise looked after her  duncan took up his ridingwhip from the table  now tell me he said what it is that you have to say to me  do you read the papers wrayson asked abruptly  only so far as they treat of matters connected with this country duncan answered  you have not read then of the mexonian divorce  the mans eyes were lit with fire the handle of the ridingwhip snapped in his hands  they have never granted it he cried  not in its first form wrayson answered hastily the whole suit fell to the ground for want of evidence  it is abandoned then duncan demanded  on the contrary the courts have granted the decree wrayson answered but on political grounds only every material charge against the queen was withdrawn and the divorce became a matter of arrangement  she is free from that brute then duncan said quietly i am glad  wrayson glanced down towards the valley a couple of wagons and several kaffir boys with led horses were just entering the valley  yes he said she is free  something in his intonation some change in his face gripped hold of duncan he caught his visitor by the shoulder roughly  what the devil do you mean he demanded what difference does it make she would never dareto  you can never tell wrayson said with a little sigh what a woman will dare to do tell me the truth duncan you care for her still  god knows it he answered fiercely there has never been another woman there never could be  jump on your pony then and ride down and meet them gently man dont break your neck   later on they sat out upon the veranda the swift darkness was falling already upon the land the colour was fading fast from the gorgeous fragments of piledup clouds in the western sky almost as they watched the outline faded away from the distant mountains the rolling woods lost their shape  its a wonderful country yours duncan wrayson said  it is gods own country duncan answered quietly what we shall make of it he only knows it is the country of eternal mysteries  he pointed northwards  think he said beneath those forests are the ruins of cities magnificent in civilization and art before a stone of babylon was built when nineveh was unknown what a heritage what a splendid heritage if only we can prove ourselves worthy of it  why not wrayson asked quietly our day of decline is not yet even the historians admit that  it is the moneygrabbers of the world who belittle empire duncan answered it is from the moneygrabbers of the transvaal that we have most to fear only those can know what africa is what it might mean to us who shake the dust of civilization from their feet and creep a little way into its heart it is here in the quiet places that one begins to understand one has the sense of coming into a virgin country strong fresh and wonderful think of the race who might be bred here they would rejuvenate the world  and yet the woman at his side murmured the woman who had been a queen it is not a virgin country after all a little further northwards and the forests have in their keeping the secrets of ages shall we ever possess them i wonder  in the darkness she felt his arms about her louise and her husband had wandered away  one thing at least remains changeless and eternal as history itself he murmured as their lips met thank god for it
