87845153	candida  bernard shaw  1898    act i  a fine october morning in the north east suburbs of london a vast district many miles away from the london of mayfair and st jamess much less known there than the paris of the rue de rivoli and the champs elysees and much less narrow squalid fetid and airless in its slums strong in comfortable prosperous middle class life widestreeted myriadpopulated wellserved with ugly iron urinals radical clubs tram lines and a perpetual stream of yellow cars enjoying in its main thoroughfares the luxury of grassgrown front gardens untrodden by the foot of man save as to the path from the gate to the hall door but blighted by an intolerable monotony of miles and miles of graceless characterless brick houses black iron railings stony pavements slaty roofs and respectably ill dressed or disreputably poorly dressed people quite accustomed to the place and mostly plodding about somebody elses work which they would not do if they themselves could help it the little energy and eagerness that crop up show themselves in cockney cupidity and business push even the policemen and the chapels are not infrequent enough to break the monotony the sun is shining cheerfully there is no fog and though the smoke effectually prevents anything whether faces and hands or bricks and mortar from looking fresh and clean it is not hanging heavily enough to trouble a londoner  this desert of unattractiveness has its oasis near the outer end of the hackney road is a park of 217 acres fenced in not by railings but by a wooden paling and containing plenty of greensward trees a lake for bathers flower beds with the flowers arranged carefully in patterns by the admired cockney art of carpet gardening and a sandpit imported from the seaside for the delight of the children but speedily deserted on its becoming a natural vermin preserve for all the petty fauna of kingsland hackney and hoxton a bandstand an unfinished forum for religious antireligious and political orators cricket pitches a gymnasium and an old fashioned stone kiosk are among its attractions wherever the prospect is bounded by trees or rising green grounds it is a pleasant place where the ground stretches far to the grey palings with bricks and mortar sky signs crowded chimneys and smoke beyond the prospect makes it desolate and sordid  the best view of victoria park is from the front window of st dominics parsonage from which not a single chimney is visible the parsonage is a semidetached villa with a front garden and a porch visitors go up the flight of steps to the porch tradespeople and members of the family go down by a door under the steps to the basement with a breakfast room used for all meals in front and the kitchen at the back upstairs on the level of the hall door is the drawingroom with its large plate glass window looking on the park in this room the only sittingroom that can be spared from the children and the family meals the parson the reverend james mavor morell does his work he is sitting in a strong round backed revolving chair at the right hand end of a long table which stands across the window so that he can cheer himself with the view of the park at his elbow at the opposite end of the table adjoining it is a little table only half the width of the other with a typewriter on it his typist is sitting at this machine with her back to the window the large table is littered with pamphlets journals letters nests of drawers an office diary postage scales and the like a spare chair for visitors having business with the parson is in the middle turned to his end within reach of his hand is a stationery case and a cabinet photograph in a frame behind him the right hand wall recessed above the fireplace is fitted with bookshelves on which an adept eye can measure the parsons divinity and casuistry by a complete set of brownings poems and maurices theological essays and guess at his politics from a yellow backed progress and poverty fabian essays a dream of john ball marxs capital and half a dozen other literary landmarks in socialism opposite him on the left near the typewriter is the door further down the room opposite the fireplace a bookcase stands on a cellaret with a sofa near it there is a generous fire burning and the hearth with a comfortable armchair and a japanned flower painted coal scuttle at one side a miniature chair for a boy or girl on the other a nicely varnished wooden mantelpiece with neatly moulded shelves tiny bits of mirror let into the panels and a travelling clock in a leather case the inevitable wedding present and on the wall above a large autotype of the chief figure in titians virgin of the assumption is very inviting altogether the room is the room of a good housekeeper vanquished as far as the table is concerned by an untidy man but elsewhere mistress of the situation the furniture in its ornamental aspect betrays the style of the advertised drawingroom suite of the pushing suburban furniture dealer but there is nothing useless or pretentious in the room the paper and panelling are dark throwing the big cheery window and the park outside into strong relief  the reverend james mavor morell is a christian socialist clergyman of the church of england and an active member of the guild of st matthew and the christian social union a vigorous genial popular man of forty robust and goodlooking full of energy with pleasant hearty considerate manners and a sound unaffected voice which he uses with the clean athletic articulation of a practised orator and with a wide range and perfect command of expression he is a first rate clergyman able to say what he likes to whom he likes to lecture people without setting himself up against them to impose his authority on them without humiliating them and to interfere in their business without impertinence his wellspring of spiritual enthusiasm and sympathetic emotion has never run dry for a moment he still eats and sleeps heartily enough to win the daily battle between exhaustion and recuperation triumphantly withal a great baby pardonably vain of his powers and unconsciously pleased with himself he has a healthy complexion a good forehead with the brows somewhat blunt and the eyes bright and eager a mouth resolute but not particularly well cut and a substantial nose with the mobile spreading nostrils of the dramatic orator but like all his features void of subtlety  the typist miss proserpine garnett is a brisk little woman of about 30 of the lower middle class neatly but cheaply dressed in a black merino skirt and a blouse rather pert and quick of speech and not very civil in her manner but sensitive and affectionate she is clattering away busily at her machine whilst morell opens the last of his mornings letters he realizes its contents with a comic groan of despair  proserpine another lecture  morell yes the hoxton freedom group want me to address them on sunday morning great emphasis on sunday this being the unreasonable part of the business what are they  proserpine communist anarchists i think  morell just like anarchists not to know that they cant have a parson on sunday tell them to come to church if they want to hear me it will do them good say i can only come on mondays and thursdays have you the diary there  proserpine taking up the diary yes  morell have i

at him relatives of yours  morell yes we have the same fatherin heaven  proserpine relieved oh is that all  morell with a sadness which is a luxury to a man whose voice expresses it so finely ah you dont believe it everybody says it nobody believes itnobody briskly getting back to business well well come miss proserpine cant you find a date for the costers what about the 25th that was vacant the day before yesterday  proserpine referring to diary engagedthe fabian society  morell bother the fabian society is the 28th gone too  proserpine city dinner youre invited to dine with the founders company  morell thatll do ill go to the hoxton group of freedom instead she enters the engagement in silence with implacable disparagement of the hoxton anarchists in every line of her face morell bursts open the cover of a copy of the church reformer which has come by post and glances through mr stewart hendlams leader and the guild of st matthew news these proceedings are presently enlivened by the appearance of morells curate the reverend alexander mill a young gentleman gathered by morell from the nearest university settlement whither he had come from oxford to give the east end of london the benefit of his university training he is a conceitedly well intentioned enthusiastic immature person with nothing positively unbearable about him except a habit of speaking with his lips carefully closed for half an inch from each corner a finicking arthulation and a set of horribly corrupt vowels notably ow for o this being his chief means of bringing oxford refinement to bear on hackney vulgarity morell whom he has won over by a doglike devotion looks up indulgently from the church reformer as he enters and remarks well lexy late again as usual  lexy im afraid so i wish i could get up in the morning  morell exulting in his own energy ha ha whimsically watch and pray lexy watch and pray  lexy i know rising wittily to the occasion but how can i watch and pray when i am asleep isnt that so miss prossy  proserpine sharply miss garnett if you please  lexy i beg your pardonmiss garnett  proserpine youve got to do all the work today  lexy why  proserpine never mind why it will do you good to earn your supper before you eat it for once in a way as i do come dont dawdle you should have been off on your rounds half an hour ago  lexy perplexed is she in earnest morell  morell in the highest spiritshis eyes dancing yes i am going to dawdle today  lexy you you dont know how  morell heartily ha ha dont i im going to have this day all to myselfor at least the forenoon my wifes coming back shes due here at 1145  lexy surprised coming back alreadywith the children i thought they were to stay to the end of the month  morell so they are shes only coming up for two days to get some flannel things for jimmy and to see how were getting on without her  lexy anxiously but my dear morell if what jimmy and fluffy had was scarlatina do you think it wise  morell scarlatinarubbish german measles i brought it into the house myself from the pycroft street school a parson is like a doctor my boy he must face infection as a soldier must face bullets he rises and claps lexy on the shoulder catch the measles if you can lexy shell nurse you and what a piece of luck that will be for youeh  lexy smiling uneasily its so hard to understand you about mrs morell  morell tenderly ah my boy get marriedget married to a good woman and then youll understand thats a foretaste of what will be best in the kingdom of heaven we are trying to establish on earth that will cure you of dawdling an honest man feels that he must pay heaven for every hour of happiness with a good spell of hard unselfish work to make others happy we have no more right to consume happiness without producing it than to consume wealth without producing it get a wife like my candida and youll always be in arrear with your repayment he pats lexy affectionately on the back and is leaving the room when lexy calls to him  lexy oh wait a bit i forgot morell halts and turns with the door knob in his hand your fatherinlaw is coming round to see you morell shuts the door again with a complete change of manner  morell surprised and not pleased mr burgess  lexy yes i passed him in the park arguing with somebody he gave me good day and asked me to let you know that he was coming  morell half incredulous but he hasnt called here fori may almost say for years are you sure lexy youre not joking are you  lexy earnestly no sir really  morell thoughtfully hm time for him to take another look at candida before she grows out of his knowledge he resigns himself to the inevitable and goes out lexy looks after him with beaming foolish worship  lexy what a good man what a thorough loving soul he is he takes morells place at the table making himself very comfortable as he takes out a cigaret  proserpine impatiently pulling the letter she has been working at off the typewriter and folding it oh a man ought to be able to be fond of his wife without making a fool of himself about her  lexy shocked oh miss prossy  proserpine rising busily and coming to the stationery case to get an envelope in which she encloses the letter as she speaks candida here and candida there and candida everywhere she licks the envelope its enough to drive anyone out of their senses thumping the envelope to make it stick to hear a perfectly commonplace woman raved about in that absurd manner merely because shes got good hair and a tolerable figure  lexy with reproachful gravity i think her extremely beautiful miss garnett he takes the photograph up looks at it and adds with even greater impressiveness extremely beautiful how fine her eyes are  proserpine her eyes are not a bit better than minenow he puts down the photograph and stares austerely at her and you know very well that you think me dowdy and second rate enough  lexy rising majestically heaven forbid that i should think of any of gods creatures in such a way he moves stiffly away from her across the room to the neighbourhood of the bookcase  proserpine thank you thats very nice and comforting  lexy saddened by her depravity i had no idea you had any feeling against mrs morell  proserpine indignantly i have no feeling against her shes very nice very goodhearted im very fond of her and can appreciate her real qualities far better than any man can he shakes his head sadly and turns to the bookcase looking along the shelves for a volume she follows him with intense pepperiness you dont believe me he turns and faces her she pounces at him with spitfire energy you think im jealous oh what a profound knowledge of the human heart you have mr lexy mill how well you know the weaknesses of woman dont you it must be so nice to be a man and have a fine penetrating intellect instead of mere emotions like us and to know that the reason we dont share your amorous delusions is that were all jealous of one another she abandons him with a toss of her shoulders and crosses to the fire to warm her hands  lexy ah if you women only had the same clue to mans strength that you have to his weakness miss prossy there would be no woman question  proserpine over her shoulder as she stoops holding her hands to the blaze where did you hear morell say that you didnt invent it yourself youre not clever enough  lexy thats quite true i am not ashamed of owing him that as i owe him so many other spiritual truths he said it at the annual conference of the womens liberal federation allow me to add that though they didnt appreciate it i a mere man did he turns to the bookcase again hoping that this may leave her crushed  proserpine putting her hair straight at the little panel of mirror in the mantelpiece well when you talk to me give me your own ideas such as they are and not his you never cut a poorer figure than when you are trying to imitate him  lexy stung i try to follow his example not to imitate him  proserpine coming at him again on her way back to her work yes you do you imitate him why do you tuck your umbrella under your left arm instead of carrying it in your hand like anyone else why do you walk with your chin stuck out before you hurrying along with that eager look in your eyesyou who never get up before half past nine in the morning why do you say knoaledge in church though you always say knolledge in private conversation bah do you think i dont know she goes back to the typewriter here come and set about your work weve wasted enough time for one morning heres a copy of the diary for today she hands him a memorandum  lexy deeply offended thank you he takes it and stands at the table with his back to her reading it she begins to transcribe her shorthand notes on the typewriter without troubling herself about his feelings mr burgess enters unannounced he is a man of sixty made coarse and sordid by the compulsory selfishness of petty commerce and later on softened into sluggish bumptiousness by overfeeding and commercial success a vulgar ignorant guzzling man offensive and contemptuous to people whose labor is cheap respectful to wealth and rank and quite sincere and without rancour or envy in both attitudes finding him without talent the world has offered him no decently paid work except ignoble work and he has become in consequence somewhat hoggish but he has no suspicion of this himself and honestly regards his commercial prosperity as the inevitable and socially wholesome triumph of the ability industry shrewdness and experience in business of a man who in private is easygoing affectionate and humorously convivial to a fault corporeally he is a podgy man with a square clean shaven face and a square beard under his chin dust colored with a patch of grey in the centre and small watery blue eyes with a plaintively sentimental expression which he transfers easily to his voice by his habit of pompously intoning his sentences  burgess stopping on the threshold and looking round they told me mr morell was here  proserpine rising hes upstairs ill fetch him for you  burgess staring boorishly at her youre not the same young lady as used to typewrite for him  proserpine no  burgess assenting no she was younger miss garnett stolidly stares at him then goes out with great dignity he receives this quite obtusely and crosses to the hearthrug where he turns and spreads himself with his back to the fire startin on your rounds mr mill  lexy folding his paper and pocketing it yes i must be off presently  burgess momentously dont let me detain you mr mill what i come about is private between me and mr morell  lexy huffily i have no intention of intruding i am sure mr burgess good morning  burgess patronizingly oh good morning to you morell returns as lexy is making for the door  morell to lexy off to work  lexy yes sir  morell patting him affectionately on the shoulder take my silk handkerchief and wrap your throat up theres a cold wind away with you  lexy brightens up and goes out  burgess spoilin your curates as usul james good mornin when i pay a man an is livin depens on me i keep him in his place  morell rather shortly i always keep my curates in their places as my helpers and comrades if you get as much work out of your clerks and warehousemen as i do out of my curates you must be getting rich pretty fast will you take your old chair  he points with curt authority to the arm chair beside the fireplace then takes the spare chair from the table and sits down in front of burgess  burgess without moving just the same as hever james  morell when you last calledit was about three years ago i thinkyou said the same thing a little more frankly your exact words then were just as big a fool as ever james  burgess soothingly well perhaps i did but with conciliatory cheerfulness i meant no offence by it a clergyman is privileged to be a bit of a fool you know its ony becomin in his profession that he should anyhow i come here not to rake up hold differences but to let bygones be bygones suddenly becoming very solemn and approaching morell james three year ago you done me a hill turn you done me hout of a contrac an when i gev you arsh words in my natral disappointment you turned my daughrter again me well ive come to act the part of a cherischin offering his hand i forgive you james  morell starting up confound your impudence  burgess retreating with almost lachrymose deprecation of this treatment is that becomin language for a clergyman jamesand you so particlar too  morell hotly no sir it is not becoming language for a clergyman i used the wrong word i should have said damn your impudence thats what st paul or any honest priest would have said to you do you think i have forgotten that tender of yours for the contract to supply clothing to the workhouse  burgess in a paroxysm of public spirit i acted in the interest of the ratepayers james it was the lowest tender you cant deny that  morell yes the lowest because you paid worse wages than any other employerstarvation wagesaye worse than starvation wagesto the women who made the clothing your wages would have driven them to the streets to keep body and soul together getting angrier and angrier those women were my parishioners i shamed the guardians out of accepting your tender i shamed the ratepayers out of letting them do it i shamed everybody but you boiling over how dare you sir come here and offer to forgive me and talk about your daughter and  burgess easy james easy easy dont git hinto a fluster about nothink ive howned i was

nothing have you raised the wages  burgess triumphantly yes  morell stopping dead what  burgess unctuously ive turned a moddle hemployer i dont hemploy no women now theyre all sacked and the work is done by machinery not a man as less than sixpence a hour and the skilled ands gits the trade union rate proudly what ave you to say to me now  morell overwhelmed is it possible well theres more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth going to burgess with an explosion of apologetic cordiality my dear burgess i most heartily beg your pardon for my hard thoughts of you grasps his hand and now dont you feel the better for the change come confess youre happier you look happier  burgess ruefully well praps i do i spose i must since you notice it at all events i git my contrax asseppit accepted by the county council savagely they dussentave nothink to do with me unless i paid fair wagescurse em for a parcel o meddlin fools  morell dropping his hand utterly discouraged so that was why you raised the wages he sits down moodily  burgess severely in spreading mounting tones why else should i do it what does it lead to but drink and huppishness in workin men he seats himself magisterially in the easy chair its hall very well for you james it gits you hinto the papers and makes a great man of you but you never think of the arm you do puttin money into the pockets of workin men that they dont know ow to spend and takin it from people that might be makin a good huse on it  morell with a heavy sigh speaking with cold politeness what is your business with me this morning i shall not pretend to believe that you are here merely out of family sentiment  burgess obstinately yes i hamjust family sentiment and nothink else  morell with weary calm i dont believe you  burgess rising threateningly dont say that to me again james mavor morell  morell unmoved ill say it just as often as may be necessary to convince you that its true i dont believe you  burgess collapsing into an abyss of wounded feeling oh well if youre determined to be unfriendly i spose id better go he moves reluctantly towards the door morell makes no sign he lingers i didnt hexpect to find a hunforgivin spirit in you james morell still not responding he takes a few more reluctant steps doorwards then he comes back whining we huseter git on well enough spite of our different opinions why are you so changed to me i give you my word i come here in pyorr pure frenliness not wishin to be on bad terms with my hown daughrters usban come james be a cherishin and shake ands he puts his hand sentimentally on morells shoulder  morell looking up at him thoughtfully look here burgess do you want to be as welcome here as you were before you lost that contract  burgess i do james i dohonest  morell then why dont you behave as you did then  burgess cautiously removing his hand ow dymean  morell ill tell you you thought me a young fool then  burgess coaxingly no i didnt james i  morell cutting him short yes you did and i thought you an old scoundrel  burgess most vehemently deprecating this gross selfaccusation on morells part no you didnt james now you do yourself a hinjustice  morell yes i did well that did not prevent our getting on very well together god made you what i call a scoundrel as he made me what you call a fool the effect of this observation on burgess is to remove the keystone of his moral arch he becomes bodily weak and with his eyes fixed on morell in a helpless stare puts out his hand apprehensively to balance himself as if the floor had suddenly sloped under him morell proceeds in the same tone of quiet conviction it was not for me to quarrel with his handiwork in the one case more than in the other so long as you come here honestly as a selfrespecting thorough convinced scoundrel justifying your scoundrelism and proud of it you are welcome but and now morells tone becomes formidable and he rises and strikes the back of the chair for greater emphasis i wont have you here snivelling about being a model employer and a converted man when youre only an apostate with your coat turned for the sake of a county council contract he nods at him to enforce the point then goes to the hearthrug where he takes up a comfortably commanding position with his back to the fire and continues no i like a man to be true to himself even in wickedness come now either take your hat and go or else sit down and give me a good scoundrelly reason for wanting to be friends with me burgess whose emotions have subsided sufficiently to be expressed by a dazed grin is relieved by this concrete proposition he ponders it for a moment and then slowly and very modestly sits down in the chair morell has just left thats right now out with it  burgess chuckling in spite of himself well you are a queer bird james and no mistake but almost enthusiastically one carnt elp likin you besides as i said afore of course one dont take all a clorgyman says seriously or the world couldnt go on could it now he composes himself for graver discourse and turning his eyes on morell proceeds with dull seriousness well i dont mind tellin you since its your wish we should be free with one another that i did think you a bit of a fool once but im beginnin to think that praps i was beind the times a bit  morell delighted  aha youre finding that out at last are you  burgess portentously yes times as changed morn i could a believed five yorr year ago no sensible man would a thought o takin up with your ideas i hused to wonder you was let preach at all why i know a clorgyman that as bin kep hout of his job for yorrs by the bishop of london although the pore fellers not a bit more religious than you are but today if henyone was to offer to bet me a thousan poun that youll end by bein a bishop yourself i shouldnt venture to take the bet you and yore crew are gettin hinfluential i can see that theyll ave to give you something someday if its only to stop yore mouth you ad the right instinc arter all james the line you took is the payin line in the long run fur a man o your sort  morell decisivelyoffering his hand shake hands burgess now youre talking honestly i dont think theyll make me a bishop but if they do ill introduce you to the biggest jobbers i can get to come to my dinner parties  burgess who has risen with a sheepish grin and accepted the hand of friendship you will ave your joke james our quarrels made up now isnt it  a womans voice say yes james  startled they turn quickly and find that candida has just come in and is looking at them with an amused maternal indulgence which is her characteristic expression she is a woman of 33 well built well nourished likely one guesses to become matronly later on but now quite at her best with the double charm of youth and motherhood her ways are those of a woman who has found that she can always manage people by engaging their affection and who does so frankly and instinctively without the smallest scruple so far she is like any other pretty woman who is just clever enough to make the most of her sexual attractions for trivially selfish ends but candidas serene brow courageous eyes and well set mouth and chin signify largeness of mind and dignity of character to ennoble her cunning in the affections a wisehearted observer looking at her would at once guess that whoever had placed the virgin of the assumption over her hearth did so because he fancied some spiritual resemblance between them and yet would not suspect either her husband or herself of any such idea or indeed of any concern with the art of titian  just now she is in bonnet and mantle laden with a strapped rug with her umbrella stuck through it a handbag and a supply of illustrated papers  morell shocked at his remissness candida whylooks at his watch and is horrified to find it so late my darling hurrying to her and seizing the rug strap pouring forth his remorseful regrets all the time i intended to meet you at the train i let the time slip flinging the rug on the sofa i was so engrossed byreturning to heri forgotoh he embraces her with penitent emotion  burgess a little shamefaced and doubtful of his reception how ors you candy she still in morells arms offers him her cheek which he kisses james and me is come to a unnerstandina honourable unnerstandin ain we james  morell impetuously oh bother your understanding youve kept me late for candida with compassionate fervor my poor love how did you manage about the luggagehow  candida stopping him and disengaging herself  there there there i wasnt alone eugene came down yesterday and we traveled up together  morell pleased eugene  candida yes hes struggling with my luggage poor boy go out dear at once or he will pay for the cab and i dont want that morell hurries out candida puts down her handbag then takes off her mantle and bonnet and puts them on the sofa with the rug chatting meanwhile well papa how are you getting on at home  burgess the ouse aint worth livin in since you left it candy i wish youd come round and give the gurl a talkin to whos this eugene thats come with you  candida oh eugenes one of jamess discoveries he found him sleeping on the embankment last june havent you noticed our new picture pointing to the virgin he gave us that  burgess incredulously garn dyou mean to tell

isnt a cab tout  burgess then wot is he sarcastically a nobleman i spose  candida delightednodding yes his uncles a peera real live earl  burgess not daring to believe such good news no  candida yes he had a seven day bill for 55 pounds in his pocket when james found him on the embankment he thought he couldnt get any money for it until the seven days were up and he was too shy to ask for credit oh hes a dear boy we are very fond of him  burgess pretending to belittle the aristocracy but with his eyes gleaming hm i thort you wouldnt git a piorrs peers nevvy visitin in victoria park unless he were a bit of a flat looking again at the picture of course i dont old with that pictur candy but still its a igh class fust rate work of art i can see that be sure you hintroduce me to him candy he looks at his watch anxiously i can only stay about two minutes  morell comes back with eugene whom burgess contemplates moisteyed with enthusiasm he is a strange shy youth of eighteen slight effeminate with a delicate childish voice and a hunted tormented expression and shrinking manner that show the painful sensitiveness that very swift and acute apprehensiveness produces in youth before the character has grown to its full strength yet everything that his timidity and frailty suggests is contradicted by his face he is miserably irresolute does not know where to stand or what to do with his hands and feet is afraid of burgess and would run away into solitude if he dared but the very intensity with which he feels a perfectly commonplace position shows great nervous force and his nostrils and mouth show a fiercely petulant wilfulness as to the quality of which his great imaginative eyes and fine brow are reassuring he is so entirely uncommon as to be almost unearthly and to prosaic people there is something noxious in this unearthliness just as to poetic people there is something angelic in it his dress is anarchic he wears an old blue serge jacket unbuttoned over a woollen lawn tennis shirt with a silk handkerchief for a cravat trousers matching the jacket and brown canvas shoes in these garments he has apparently lain in the heather and waded through the waters but there is no evidence of his having ever brushed them  as he catches sight of a stranger on entering he stops and edges along the wall on the opposite side of the room  morell as he enters come along you can spare us quarter of an hour at all events this is my fatherinlaw mr burgessmr marchbanks  marchbanks nervously backing against the bookcase glad to meet you sir  burgess crossing to him with great heartiness whilst morell joins candida at the fire glad to meet you im shore mr morchbanks forcing him to shake hands ow do you find yoreself this weather ope you aint lettin james put no

folgit beforeabashed at his own noisiness goodbye mr morchbanks i know yore too ighbred to take my pleasantry in bad part he again offers his hand  marchbanks taking it with a nervous jerk not at all  burgess bye bye candy ill look in again later on so long james  morell must you go  burgess dont stir he goes out with unabated heartiness  morell oh ill see you out he follows him out eugene stares after them apprehensively holding his breath until burgess disappears  candida laughing well eugene he turns with a start and comes eagerly towards her but stops irresolutely as he meets her amused look what do you think of my father  marchbanks ii hardly know him yet he seems to be a very nice old gentleman  candida with gentle irony and youll go to the freeman founders to dine with him wont you  marchbanks miserably taking it quite seriously yes if it will please you  candida touched do you know you are a very nice boy eugene with all your queerness if you had laughed at my father i shouldnt have minded but i like you ever so much better for being nice to him  marchbanks ought i to have laughed i noticed that he said something funny but i am so ill at ease with strangers and i never can see a joke im very sorry he sits down on the sofa his elbows on his knees and his temples between his fists with an expression of hopeless suffering  candida bustling him goodnaturedly oh come you great baby you you are worse than usual this morning why were you so melancholy as we came along in the cab  marchbanks oh that was nothing i was wondering how much i ought to give the cabman i know its utterly silly but you dont know how dreadful such things are to mehow i shrink from having to deal with strange people quickly and reassuringly but its all right he beamed all over and touched his hat when morell gave him two shillings i was on the point of offering him ten candida laughs heartily morell comes back with a few letters and newspapers which have come by the midday post  candida oh james dear he was going to give the cabman ten shillingsten shillings for a three minutes driveoh dear  morell at the table glancing through the letters never mind her marchbanks the overpaying instinct is a generous one better than the underpaying instinct and not so common  marchbanks relapsing into dejection no cowardice incompetence mrs morells quite right  candida of course she is she takes up her handbag and now i must leave you to james for the present i suppose you are too much of a poet to know the state a woman finds her house in when shes been away for three weeks give me my rug eugene takes the strapped rug from the couch and gives it to her she takes it in her left hand having the bag in her right now hang my cloak across my arm he obeys now my hat he puts it into the hand which has the bag now open the door for me he hurries up before her and opens the door thanks she goes out and marchbanks shuts the door  morell still busy at the table youll stay to lunch marchbanks of course  marchbanks scared i mustnt he glances quickly at morell but at once avoids his frank look and adds with obvious disingenuousness i cant  morell over his shoulder you mean you wont  marchbanks earnestly no i should like to indeed thank you very much butbut  morell breezily finishing with the letters and coming close to him butbutbutbutbosh if youd like to stay stay you dont mean to persuade me you have anything else to do if youre shy go and take a turn in the park and write poetry until half past one and then come in and have a good feed  marchbanks thank you i should like that very much but i really mustnt the truth is mrs morell told me not to she said she didnt think youd ask me to stay to lunch but that i was to remember if you did that you didnt really want me to plaintively she said id understand but i dont please dont tell her i told you  morell drolly oh is that all wont my suggestion that you should take a turn in the park meet the difficulty  marchbanks how  morell exploding goodhumoredly why you dufferbut this boisterousness jars himself as well as eugene he checks himself and resumes with affectionate seriousness no i wont put it in that way my dear lad in a happy marriage like ours there is something very sacred in the return of the wife to her home marchbanks looks quickly at him half anticipating his meaning an old friend or a truly noble and sympathetic soul is not in the way on such occasions but a chance visitor is the hunted horrorstricken expression comes out with sudden vividness in eugenes face as he understands morell occupied with his own thought goes on without noticing it candida thought i would rather not have you here but she was wrong im very fond of you my boy and i should like you to see for yourself what a happy thing it is to be married as i am  marchbanks happyyour marriage you think that you believe that  morell buoyantly i know it my lad la rochefoucauld said that there are convenient marriages but no delightful ones you dont know the comfort of seeing through and through a thundering liar and rotten cynic like that fellow ha ha now off with you to the park and write your poem half past one sharp mind we never wait for anybody  marchbanks wildly no stop you shant ill force it into the light  morell puzzled eh force what  marchbanks i must speak to you there is something that must be settled between us  morell with a whimsical glance at the clock now  marchbanks passionately now before you leave this room he retreats a few steps and stands as if to bar morells way to the door  morell without moving and gravely perceiving now that there is something serious the matter im not going to leave it my dear boy i thought you were eugene baffled by his firm tone turns his back on him writhing with anger morell goes to him and puts his hand on his shoulder strongly and kindly disregarding his attempt to shake it off come sit down quietly and tell me what it is and remember we are friends and need not fear that either of us will be anything but patient and kind to the other whatever we may have to say  marchbanks twisting himself round on him oh i am not forgetting myself i am only covering his face desperately with his hands full of horror then dropping his hands and thrusting his face forward fiercely at morell he goes on threateningly you shall see whether this is a time for patience and kindness morell firm as a rock looks indulgently at him dont look at me in that selfcomplacent way you think yourself stronger than i am but i shall stagger you if you have a heart in your breast  morell powerfully confident stagger me my boy out with it  marchbanks first  morell first  marchbanks i love your wife  morell recoils and after staring at him for a moment in utter amazement bursts into uncontrollable laughter eugene is taken aback but not disconcerted and he soon becomes indignant and contemptuous  morell sitting down to have his laugh out why my dear child of course you do everybody loves her they cant help it i like it but looking up whimsically at him i say eugene do you think yours is a case to be talked about youre under twenty shes over thirty doesnt it look rather too like a case of calf love  marchbanks vehemently you dare say that of her you think that way of the love she inspires it is an insult to her  morell rising quickly in an altered tone to her eugene take care i have been patient i hope to remain patient but there are some things i wont allow dont force me to show you the indulgence i should show to a child be a man  marchbanks with a gesture as if sweeping something behind him oh let us put aside all that cant it horrifies me when i think of the doses of it she has had to endure in all the weary years during which you have selfishly and blindly sacrificed her to minister to your selfsufficiencyyou turning on him who have not one thoughtone sensein common with her  morell philosophically she seems to bear it pretty well looking him straight in the face eugene my boy you are making a fool of yourselfa very great fool of yourself theres a piece of wholesome plain speaking for you  marchbanks oh do you think i dont know all that do you think that the things people make fools of themselves about are any less real and true than the things they behave sensibly about morells gaze wavers for the first time he instinctively averts his face and stands listening startled and thoughtful they are more true they are the only things that are true you are very calm and sensible and moderate with me because you can see that i am a fool about your wife just as no doubt that old man who was here just now is very wise over your socialism because he sees that you are a fool about it morells perplexity deepens markedly eugene follows up his advantage plying him fiercely with questions does that prove you wrong does your complacent superiority to me prove that i am wrong  morell turning on eugene who stands his ground marchbanks some devil is putting these words into your mouth it is easyterribly easyto shake a mans faith in himself to take advantage of that to break a mans spirit is devils work take care of what you are doing take care  marchbanks ruthlessly i know im doing it on purpose i told you i should stagger you  they confront one another threateningly for a moment then morell recovers his dignity  morell with noble tenderness eugene listen to me some day i hope and trust you will be a happy man like me eugene chafes intolerantly repudiating the worth of his happiness morell deeply insulted controls himself with fine forbearance and continues steadily with great artistic beauty of delivery you will be married and you will be working with all your might and valor to make every spot on earth as happy as your own home you will be one of the makers of the kingdom of heaven on earth andwho knowsyou may be a pioneer and master builder where i am only a humble journeyman for dont think my boy that i cannot see in you young as you are promise of higher powers than i can ever pretend to i well know that it is in the poet that the holy spirit of manthe god within himis most godlike it should make you tremble to think of thatto think that the heavy burthen and great gift of a poet may be laid upon you  marchbanks unimpressed and remorseless his boyish crudity of assertion telling sharply against morells oratory it does not make me tremble it is the want of it in others that makes me tremble  morell redoubling his force of style under the stimulus of his genuine feeling and eugenes obduracy then help to kindle it in themin menot to extinguish it in the futurewhen you are as happy as i ami will be your true brother in the faith i will help you to believe that god has given us a world that nothing but our own folly keeps from being a paradise i will help you to believe that every stroke of your work is sowing happiness for the great harvest that alleven the humblestshall one day reap and last but trust me not least i will help you to believe that your wife loves you and is happy in her home we need such help marchbanks we need it greatly and always there are so many things to make us doubt if once we let our understanding be troubled even at home we sit as if in camp encompassed by a hostile army of doubts will you play the traitor and let them in on me  marchbanks looking round him is it like this for her here always a woman with a great soul craving for reality truth freedom and being fed on metaphors sermons stale perorations mere rhetoric do you think a womans soul can live on your talent for preaching  morell stung marchbanks you make it hard for me to control myself my talent is like yours insofar as it has any real worth at all it is the gift of finding words for divine truth  marchbanks impetuously its the gift of the gab nothing more and nothing less what has your knack of fine talking to do with the truth any more than playing the organ has ive never been in your church but ive been to your political meetings and ive seen you do whats called rousing the meeting to enthusiasm that is you excited them until they behaved exactly as if they were drunk and their wives looked on and saw clearly enough what fools they were oh its an old story youll find it in the bible i imagine king david in his fits of enthusiasm was very like you stabbing him with the words but his wife despised him in her heart  morell wrathfully leave my house do you hear he advances on him threateningly  marchbanks shrinking back against the couch let me alone dont touch me morell grasps him powerfully by the lapel of his coat he cowers down on the sofa and screams passionately stop morell if you strike me ill kill myself i wont bear it almost in hysterics let me go take your hand away  morell with slow emphatic scorn you little snivelling cowardly whelp releasing him go before you frighten yourself into a fit  marchbanks on the sofa gasping but relieved by the withdrawal of morells hand im not afraid of you its you who are afraid of me  morell quietly as he stands over him it looks like it doesnt it  marchbanks with petulant vehemence yes it does morell turns away contemptuously eugene scrambles to his feet and follows him you think because i shrink from being brutally handledbecause with tears in his voice i can do nothing but cry with rage when i am met with violencebecause i cant lift a heavy trunk down from the top of a cab like youbecause i cant fight you for your wife as a navvy would all that makes you think that im afraid of you but youre wrong if i havent got what you call british pluck i havent british cowardice either im not afraid of a clergymans ideas ill fight your ideas ill rescue her from her slavery to them ill pit my own ideas against them you are driving me out of the house because you darent let her choose between your ideas and mine you are afraid to let me see her again morell angered turns suddenly on him he flies to the door in involuntary dread let me alone i say im going  morell with cold scorn wait a moment i am not going to touch you dont be afraid when my wife comes back she will want to know why you have gone and when she finds that you are never going to cross our threshold again she will want to have that explained too now i dont wish to distress her by telling her that you have behaved like a blackguard  marchbanks coming back with renewed vehemence you shallyou must if you give any explanation but the true one you are a liar and a coward  tell her what i said and how you were strong and manly and shook me as a terrier shakes a rat and how i shrank and was terrified and how you called me a snivelling little whelp and put me out of the house if you dont tell her i will ill write to her  morell taken aback why do you want her to know this  marchbanks with lyric rapture because she will understand me and know that i understand her if you keep back one word of it from herif you are not ready to lay the truth at her feet as i amthen you will know to the end of your days that she really belongs to me and not to you goodbye going  morell terribly disquieted stop i will not tell her  marchbanks turning near the door either the truth or a lie you must tell her if i go  morell temporizing marchbanks it is sometimes justifiable  marchbanks cutting him short i knowto lie it will be useless goodbye mr clergyman  as he turns finally to the door it opens and candida enters in housekeeping attire  candida are you going eugenelooking more observantly at him well dear me just look at you going out into the street in that state you are a poet certainly look at him james she takes him by the coat and brings him forward to show him to morell look at his collar look at his tie look at his hair one would think somebody had been throttling you the two men guard themselves against betraying their consciousness here stand still she buttons his collar ties his neckerchief in a bow and arranges his hair there now you look so nice that i think youd better stay to lunch after all though i told you you mustnt it will be ready in half an hour she puts a final touch to the bow he kisses her hand dont be silly  marchbanks i want to stay of courseunless the reverend gentleman your husband has anything to advance to the contrary  candida shall he stay james if he promises to be a good boy and to help me to lay the table marchbanks turns his head and looks steadfastly at morell over his shoulder challenging his answer  morell shortly oh yes certainly he had better he goes to the table and pretends to busy himself with his papers there  marchbanks offering his arm to candida come and lay the tableshe takes it and they go to the door together as they go out he adds i am the happiest of men  morell so was ian hour ago    act ii  the same day the same room late in the afternoon the spare chair for visitors has been replaced at the table which is if possible more untidy than before marchbanks alone and idle is trying to find out how the typewriter works hearing someone at the door he steals guiltily away to the window and pretends to be absorbed in the view miss garnett carrying the notebook in which she takes down morells letters in shorthand from his dictation sits down at the typewriter and sets to work transcribing them much too busy to notice eugene unfortunately the first key she strikes sticks  proserpine bother youve been meddling with my typewriter mr marchbanks and theres not the least use in your trying to look as if you hadnt  marchbanks timidly im very sorry miss garnett i only tried to make it write  proserpine well youve made this key stick  marchbanks earnestly i assure you i didnt touch the keys i didnt indeed i only turned a little wheel he points irresolutely at the tension wheel  proserpine oh now i understand she sets the machine to rights talking volubly all the time i suppose you thought it was a sort of barrelorgan nothing to do but turn the handle and it would write a beautiful love letter for you straight off eh  marchbanks seriously i suppose a machine could be made to write loveletters theyre all the same arent they  proserpine somewhat indignantly any such discussion except by way of pleasantry being outside her code of manners how do i know why do you ask me  marchbanks i beg your pardon i thought clever peoplepeople who can do business and write letters and that sort of thingalways had love affairs  proserpine rising outraged mr marchbanks she looks severely at him and marches with much dignity to the bookcase  marchbanks approaching her humbly i hope i havent offended you perhaps i shouldnt have alluded to your love affairs  proserpine plucking a blue book from the shelf and turning sharply on him i havent any love affairs how dare you say such a thing  marchbanks simply really oh then you are shy like me isnt that so  proserpine certainly i am not shy what do you mean  marchbanks secretly you must be that is the reason there are so few love affairs in the world we all go about longing for love it is the first need of our natures the loudest cry of our hearts but we dare not utter our longing we are too shy very earnestly oh miss garnett what would you not give to be without fear without shame  proserpine scandalized well upon my word  marchbanks with petulant impatience ah dont say those stupid things to me they dont deceive me what use are they why are you afraid to be your real self with me i am just like you  proserpine like me pray are you flattering me or flattering yourself i dont feel quite sure which she turns to go back to the typewriter  marchbanks stopping her mysteriously hush i go about in search of love and i find it in unmeasured stores in the bosoms of others but when i try to ask for it this horrible shyness strangles me and i stand dumb or worse than dumb saying meaningless thingsfoolish lies and i see the affection i am longing for given to dogs and cats and pet birds because they come and ask for it almost whispering it must be asked for it is like a ghost it cannot speak unless it is first spoken to at his normal pitch but with deep melancholy all the love in the world is longing to speak only it dare not because it is shy shy shy that is the worlds tragedy with a deep sigh he sits in the spare chair and buries his face in his hands  proserpine amazed but keeping her wits about herher point of honor in encounters with strange young men wicked people get over that shyness occasionally dont they  marchbanks scrambling up almost fiercely wicked people means people who have no love therefore they have no shame they have the power to ask love because they dont need it they have the power to offer it because they have none to give he collapses into his seat and adds mournfully but we who have love and long to mingle it with the love of others we cannot utter a word timidly you find that dont you  proserpine look here if you dont stop talking like this ill leave the room mr marchbanks i really will its not proper she resumes her seat at the typewriter opening the blue book and preparing to copy a passage from it  marchbanks hopelessly nothing thats worth saying is proper he rises and wanders about the room in his lost way saying i cant understand you miss garnett what am i to talk about  proserpine snubbing him talk about indifferent things talk about the weather  marchbanks would you stand and talk about indifferent things if a child were by crying bitterly with hunger  proserpine i suppose not  marchbanks well i cant talk about indifferent things with my heart crying out bitterly in its hunger  proserpine then hold your tongue  marchbanks yes that is what it always comes to we hold our tongues does that stop the cry of your heartfor it does cry doesnt it it must if you have a heart  proserpine suddenly rising with her hand pressed on her heart oh its no use trying to work while you talk like that she leaves her little table and sits on the sofa her feelings are evidently strongly worked on its no business of yours whether my heart cries or not but i have a mind to tell you for all that  marchbanks you neednt i know already that it must  proserpine but mind if you ever say i said so ill deny it  marchbanks compassionately yes i know and so you havent the courage to tell him  proserpine bouncing up him who  marchbanks whoever he is the man you love it might be anybody the curate mr mill perhaps  proserpine with disdain mr mill a fine man to break my heart about indeed id rather have you than mr mill  marchbanks recoiling no reallyim very sorry but you mustnt think of that i  proserpine testily crossing to the fire and standing at it with her back to him oh dont be frightened its not you its not any one particular person  marchbanks i know you feel that you could love anybody that offered  proserpine exasperated anybody that offered no i do not what do you take me for  marchbanks discouraged no use you wont make me real answersonly those things that everybody says he strays to the sofa and sits down disconsolately  proserpine nettled at what she takes to be a disparagement of her manners by an aristocrat oh well if you want original conversation youd better go and talk to yourself  marchbanks that is what all poets do they talk to themselves out loud and the world overhears them but its horribly lonely not to hear someone else talk sometimes  proserpine wait until mr morell comes hell talk to you marchbanks shudders oh you neednt make wry faces over him he can talk better than you with temper hed talk your little head off she is going back angrily to her place when suddenly enlightened he springs up and stops her  marchbanks ah i understand now  proserpine reddening what do you understand  marchbanks your secret tell me is it really and truly possible for a woman to love him  proserpine as if this were beyond all bounds well  marchbanks passionately no answer me i want to know i must know i cant understand it i can see nothing in him but words pious resolutions what people call goodness you cant love that  proserpine attempting to snub him by an air of cool propriety i simply dont know what youre talking about i dont understand you  marchbanks vehemently you do you lie  proserpine oh  marchbanks you do understand and you know determined to have an answer is it possible for a woman to love him  proserpine looking him straight in the face yes he covers his face with his hands whatever is the matter with you he takes down his hands and looks at her frightened at the tragic mask presented to her she hurries past him at the utmost possible distance keeping her eyes on his face until he turns from her and goes to the childs chair beside the hearth where he sits in the deepest dejection as she approaches the door it opens and burgess enters on seeing him she ejaculates praise heaven heres somebody and sits down reassured at her table she puts a fresh sheet of paper into the typewriter as burgess crosses to eugene  burgess bent on taking care of the distinguished visitor well so this is the way they leave you to yourself mr morchbanks ive come to keep you company marchbanks looks up at him in consternation which is quite lost on him james is

loftily  marchbanks miserably nervous and disconcerted hadnt we better change the subject ii dont think miss garnett meant anything  proserpine with intense conviction oh didnt i though just  burgess i wouldnt demean myself to take notice on her  an electric bell rings twice  proserpine gathering up her notebook and papers  thats for me she hurries out  burgess calling after her oh we can spare you somewhat relieved by the triumph of having the last word and yet half inclined to try to improve on it he looks after her for a moment then subsides into his seat by eugene and addresses him very confidentially now were alone mr morchbanks let me give you a friendly int that i wouldnt give to everybody ow long ave you known my soninlaw james here  marchbanks i dont know i never can remember

harm thats the question for you eh of course it hasnt think no more of it he dismisses the subject by going to his place at the table and setting to work at his correspondence  burgess aside to marchbanks what did i tell you mad as a atter he goes to the table and asks with the sickly civility of a hungry man whens dinner james  morell not for half an hour yet  burgess with plaintive resignation gimme a nice book to read over the fire will you james thurs a good chap  morell what sort of book a good one  burgess with almost a yell of remonstrance nahoo summat pleasant just to pass the time morell takes an illustrated paper from the table and offers it he accepts it humbly thank yer james he goes back to his easy chair at the fire and sits there at his ease reading  morell as he writes candida will come to entertain you presently she has got rid of her pupil she is filling the lamps  marchbanks starting up in the wildest consternation but that will soil her hands i cant bear that morell its a shame ill go and fill them he makes for the door  morell youd better not marchbanks stops irresolutely shed only set you to clean my boots to save me the trouble of doing it myself in the morning  burgess with grave disapproval dont you keep a servant now james  morell yes but she isnt a slave and the house looks as if i kept three that means that everyone has to lend a hand its not a bad plan prossy and i can talk business after breakfast whilst were washing up washing ups no trouble when there are two people to do it  marchbanks tormentedly do you think every woman is as coarsegrained as miss garnett  burgess emphatically thats quite right mr morchbanks thats quite right she is corsegrained  morell quietly and significantly marchbanks  marchbanks yes  morell how many servants does your father keep  marchbanks oh i dont know he comes back uneasily to the sofa as if to get as far as possible from morells questioning and sits down in great agony of mind thinking of the paraffin  morell very gravely so many that you dont know more aggressively anyhow when theres anything coarsegrained to be done you ring the bell and throw it on to somebody else eh thats one of the great facts in your existence isnt it  marchbanks oh dont torture me the one great fact now is that your wifes beautiful fingers are dabbling in paraffin oil and that you are sitting here comfortably preaching about iteverlasting preaching preaching words words words  burgess intensely appreciating this retort ha ha devil a better radiantly ad you there james straight  candida comes in well aproned with a reading lamp trimmed filled and ready for lighting she places it on the table near morell ready for use  candida brushing her finger tips together with a slight twitch of her nose if you stay with us eugene i think i will hand over the lamps to you  marchbanks i will stay on condition that you hand over all the rough work to me  candida thats very gallant but i think i should like to see how you do it first turning to morell james youve not been looking after the house properly  morell what have i doneor not donemy love  candida with serious vexation my own particular pet scrubbing brush has been used for blackleading a heartbreaking wail bursts from marchbanks burgess looks round amazed candida hurries to the sofa whats the matter are you ill eugene  marchbanks no not

its only poetic horror isnt it eugene petting him  burgess abashed oh poetic orror is it i beg your pordon im shore he turns to the fire again deprecating his hasty conclusion  candida what is it eugenethe scrubbing brush he shudders well there never mind she sits down beside him wouldnt you like to present me with a nice new one with an ivory back inlaid with motherofpearl  marchbanks softly and musically but sadly and longingly no not a scrubbing brush but a boata tiny shallop to sail away in far from the world where the marble floors are washed by the rain and dried by the sun where the south wind dusts the beautiful green and purple carpets or a chariotto carry us up into the sky where the lamps are stars and dont need to be filled with paraffin oil every day  morell harshly and where there is nothing to do but to be idle selfish and useless  candida jarred oh james how could you spoil it all  marchbanks firing up yes to be idle selfish and useless that is to be beautiful and free and happy hasnt every man desired that with all his soul for the woman he loves thats my ideal whats yours and that of all the dreadful people who live in these hideous rows of houses sermons and scrubbing brushes with you to preach the sermon and your wife to scrub  candida quaintly he cleans the boots eugene you will have to clean them tomorrow for saying that about him  marchbanks oh dont talk about boots your feet should be beautiful on the mountains  candida my feet would not be beautiful on the hackney road without boots  burgess scandalized come candy dont be vulgar mr morchbanks aint accustomed to it youre givin him the orrors again i mean the poetic ones  morell is silent apparently he is busy with his letters really he is puzzling with misgiving over his new and alarming experience that the surer he is of his moral thrusts the more swiftly and effectively eugene parries them to find himself beginning to fear a man whom he does not respect affects him bitterly  miss garnett comes in with a telegram  proserpine handing the telegram to morell reply paid the boys waiting to candida coming back to her machine and sitting down maria is ready for you now in the kitchen mrs morell candida rises the onions have come  marchbanks convulsively onions  candida yes onions not even spanish onesnasty little red onions you shall help me to slice them come along  she catches him by the wrist and runs out pulling him after her burgess rises in consternation and stands aghast on the hearthrug staring after them  burgess candy didnt oughter andle a peers nevvy like that its

he blots the telegram and goes out  proserpine used you to make the fairy stories up out of your own head  burgess not deigning to reply strikes an attitude of the haughtiest disdain on the hearthrug  proserpine calmly i should never have supposed you had it in you by the way id better warn you since youve taken such a fancy to mr marchbanks hes mad  burgess mad wot im too  proserpine mad as a march hare he did frighten me i can tell you just before you came in that time havent you noticed the queer things he says  burgess so thats wot the poetic orrors means blame me if it didnt come into my head once or twyst that he must be off his chump he crosses the room to the door lifting up his voice as he goes well this is a pretty sort of asylum for a man to be in with no one but you to take care of him  proserpine as he passes her yes what a dreadful thing it would be if anything happened to you  burgess loftily dont you address no remarks to me tell your hemployer that ive gone into the garden for a smoke  proserpine mocking oh  before burgess can retort morell comes back  burgess sentimentally goin for a turn in the garden to smoke james  morell brusquely oh all right all right burgess goes out pathetically in the character of the weary old man morell stands at the table turning over his papers and adding across to proserpine half humorously half absently well miss prossy why have you been calling my fatherinlaw names  proserpine blushing fiery red and looking quickly up at him half scared half reproachful i she bursts into tears  morell with tender gaiety leaning across the table towards her and consoling her oh come come come never mind pross he is a silly old fathead isnt he  with an explosive sob she makes a dash at the door and vanishes banging it morell shaking his head resignedly sighs and goes wearily to his chair where he sits down and sets to work looking old and careworn  candida comes in she has finished her household work and taken of the apron she at once notices his dejected appearance and posts herself quietly at the spare chair looking down at him attentively but she says nothing  morell looking up but with his pen raised ready to resume his work well where is eugene  candida washing his hands in the sculleryunder the tap he will make an excellent cook if he can only get over his dread of maria  morell shortly ha no doubt he begins writing again  candida going nearer and putting her hand down softly on his to stop him as she says come here dear let me look at you he drops his pen and yields himself at her disposal she makes him rise and brings him a little away from the table looking at him critically all the time turn your face to the light she places him facing the window my boy is not looking well has he been overworking  morell nothing more than usual  candida he looks very pale and grey and wrinkled and old his melancholy deepens and she attacks it with wilful gaiety here pulling him towards the easy chair youve done enough writing for today leave prossy to finish it and come and talk to me  morell but  candida yes i must be talked to sometimes she makes him sit down and seats herself on the carpet beside his knee now patting his hand youre beginning to look better already why dont you give up all this tiresome overworkinggoing out every night lecturing and talking of course what you say is all very true and very right but it does no good they dont mind what you say to them one little bit of course they agree with you but whats the use of people agreeing with you if they go and do just the opposite of what you tell them the moment your back is turned look at our congregation at st dominics why do they come to hear you talking about christianity every sunday why just because theyve been so full of business and moneymaking for six days that they want to forget all about it and have a rest on the seventh so that they can go back fresh and make money harder than ever you positively help them at it instead of hindering them  morell with energetic seriousness you know very well candida that i often blow them up soundly for that but if there is nothing in their churchgoing but rest and diversion why dont they try something more amusingmore selfindulgent there must be some good in the fact that they prefer st dominics to worse places on sundays  candida oh the worst places arent open and even if they were they darent be seen going to them besides james dear you preach so splendidly that its as good as a play for them why do you think the women are so enthusiastic  morell shocked candida  candida oh i know you silly boy you think its your socialism and your religion but if it was that theyd do what you tell them instead of only coming to look at you they all have prossys complaint  morell prossys complaint what do you mean candida  candida yes prossy and all the other secretaries you ever had why does prossy condescend to wash up the things and to peel potatoes and abase herself in all manner of ways for six shillings a week less than she used to get in a city office shes in love with you james thats the reason theyre all in love with you and you are in love with preaching because you do it so beautifully and you think its all enthusiasm for the kingdom of heaven on earth and so do they you dear silly  morell candida what dreadful what souldestroying cynicism are you jesting orcan it beare you jealous  candida with curious thoughtfulness yes i feel a little jealous sometimes  morell incredulously what of prossy  candida laughing no no no no not jealous of anybody jealous for somebody else who is not loved as he ought to be  morell me  candida you why youre spoiled with love and worship you get far more than is good for you no i mean eugene  morell startled eugene  candida it seems unfair that all the love should go to you and none to him although he needs it so much more than you do a convulsive movement shakes him in spite of himself whats the matter am i worrying you  morell hastily not at all looking at her with troubled intensity you know that i have perfect confidence in you candida  candida you vain thing are you so sure of your irresistible attractions  morell candida you are shocking me i never thought of my attractions i thought of your goodnessyour purity that is what i confide in  candida what a nasty uncomfortable thing to say to me oh you are a clergyman jamesa thorough clergyman  morell turning away from her heartstricken so eugene says  candida with lively interest leaning over to him with her arms on his knee eugenes always right hes a wonderful boy i have grown fonder and fonder of him all the time i was away do you know james that though he has not the least suspicion of it himself he is ready to fall madly in love with me  morell grimly oh he has no suspicion of it himself hasnt he  candida not a bit she takes her arms from his knee and turns thoughtfully sinking into a more restful attitude with her hands in her lap some day he will know when he is grown up and experienced like you and he will know that i must have known i wonder what he will think of me then  morell no evil candida i hope and trust no evil  candida dubiously that will depend  morell bewildered depend  candida looking at him yes it will depend on what happens to him he look vacantly at her dont you see it will depend on how he comes to learn what love really is i mean on the sort of woman who will teach it to him  morell quite at a loss yes no i dont know what you mean  candida explaining if he learns it from a good woman then it will be all right he will forgive me  morell forgive  candida but suppose he learns it from a bad woman as so many men do especially poetic men who imagine all women are angels suppose he only discovers the value of love when he has thrown it away and degraded himself in his ignorance will he forgive me then do you think  morell forgive you for what  candida realizing how stupid he is and a little disappointed though quite tenderly so dont you understand he shakes his head she turns to him again so as to explain with the fondest intimacy i mean will he forgive me for not teaching him myself for abandoning him to the bad women for the sake of my goodnessmy purity as you call it ah james how little you understand me to talk of your confidence in my goodness and purity i would give them both to poor eugene as willingly as i would give my shawl to a beggar dying of cold if there were nothing else to restrain me put your trust in my love for you james for if that went i should care very little for your sermonsmere phrases that you cheat yourself and others with every day she is about to rise  morell his words  candida checking herself quickly in the act of getting up so that she is on her knees but upright whose words  morell eugenes  candida delighted he is always right he understands you he understands me he understands prossy and you jamesyou understand nothing she laughs and kisses him to console him he recoils as if stung and springs up  morell how can you bear to do that whenoh candida with anguish in his voice i had rather you had plunged a grappling iron into my heart than given me that kiss  candida rising alarmed my dear whats the matter  morell frantically waving her off dont touch me  candida amazed james  they are interrupted by the entrance of marchbanks with burgess who stops near the door staring whilst eugene hurries forward between them  marchbanks is anything the matter  morell deadly white putting an iron constraint on himself nothing but this that either you were right this morning or candida is mad  burgess in loudest protest wot candy mad too oh come come come he crosses the room to the fireplace protesting as he goes and knocks the ashes out of his pipe on the bars morell sits down desperately leaning forward to hide his face and interlacing his fingers rigidly to keep them steady  candida to morell relieved and laughing oh youre only shocked is that all how conventional all you unconventional people are  burgess come beave yourself candy whatll mr morchbanks think of you  candida this comes of james teaching me to think for myself and never to hold back out of fear of what other people may think of me it works beautifully as long as i think the same things as he does but now because i have just thought something differentlook at himjust look  she points to morell greatly amused eugene looks and instantly presses his band on his heart as if some deadly pain had shot through it and sits down on the sofa like a man witnessing a tragedy  burgess on the hearthrug well james you certainly aint as himpressive lookin as usul  morell with a laugh which is half a sob i suppose not i beg all your pardons i was not conscious of making a fuss pulling himself together well well well well well he goes back to his place at the table setting to work at his papers again with resolute cheerfulness  candida going to the sofa and sitting beside marchbanks still in a bantering humor well eugene why are you so sad did the onions make you cry  morell cannot prevent himself from watching them  marchbanks aside to her it is your cruelty i hate cruelty it is a horrible thing to see one person make another suffer  candida petting him ironically poor boy have i been cruel did i make it slice nasty little red onions  marchbanks earnestly oh stop stop i dont mean myself you have made him suffer frightfully i feel his pain in my own heart i know that it is not your faultit is something that must happen but dont make light of it i shudder when you torture him and laugh  candida incredulously i torture james nonsense eugene how you exaggerate silly she looks round at morell who hastily resumes his writing she goes to him and stands behind his chair bending over him dont work any more dear come and talk to us  morell affectionately but bitterly ah no i cant talk i can only preach  candida caressing him well come and preach  burgess strongly remonstrating aw no candy ang it all lexy mill comes in looking anxious and important  lexy hastening to shake hands

to have spoken for them tonight theyve taken the large hall in mare street and spent a lot of money on posters morells telegram was to say he couldnt come it came on them like a thunderbolt  candida surprized and beginning to suspect something wrong given up an engagement to speak  burgess first time in his life ill bet ain it candy  lexy to morell they decided to send an urgent telegram to you asking whether you could not change your mind have you received it  morell with restrained impatience yes yes i got it  lexy it was reply paid  morell yes i know i answered it i cant go  candida but why james  morell almost fiercely because i dont choose these people forget that i am a man they think i am a talking machine to be turned on for their pleasure every evening of my life may i not have one night at home with my wife and my friends  they are all amazed at this outburst except eugene his expression remains unchanged  candida oh james you know youll have an attack of bad conscience tomorrow and i shall have to suffer for that  lexy intimidated but urgent i know of course that they make the most unreasonable demands on you but they have been telegraphing all over the place for another speaker and they can get nobody but the president of the agnostic league  morell promptly well an excellent man what better do they want  lexy but he always insists so powerfully on the divorce of socialism from christianity he will undo all the good we have been doing of course you know best buthe hesitates  candida coaxingly oh do go james well all go  burgess grumbling look ere

eugene terrified oh please dont let us go on the platform noeveryone will stare at usi couldnt ill sit at the back of the room  candida dont be afraid theyll be too busy looking at james to notice you  morell turning his head and looking meaningly at her over his shoulder prossys complaint candida eh  candida gaily yes  burgess mystified prossys complaint wot are you talking about james  morell not heeding him rises goes to the door and holds it open shouting in a commanding voice miss garnett  proserpine in the distance yes mr morell coming they all wait except burgess who goes stealthily to lexy and draws him aside  burgess listen here mr mill wots prossys complaint wots wrong with er  lexy confidentially well i dont exactly know but she spoke very strangely to me this morning im afraid shes a little out of her mind sometimes  burgess overwhelmed why it must be catchin four in the same ouse he goes back to the hearth quite lost before the instability of the human intellect in a clergymans house  proserpine appearing on the threshold what is it mr morell  morell telegraph to the guild of st matthew that i am coming  proserpine surprised dont they expect you  morell peremptorily do as i tell you  proserpine frightened sits down at her typewriter and obeys morell goes across to burgess candida watching his movements all the time with growing wonder and misgiving  morell burgess you dont want to come  burgess in deprecation oh dont put it like that james its only that it aint sunday you know  morell im sorry i thought you might like to be introduced to the chairman hes on the works committee of the county council and has some influence in the matter of contracts burgess wakes up at once morell expecting as much waits a moment and says will you come  burgess with enthusiasm course ill come james ain it always a pleasure to ear you  morell turning from him i shall want you to take some notes at the meeting miss garnett if you have no other engagement she nods afraid to speak you are coming lexy i suppose  lexy certainly  candida we are all coming james  morell no you are not coming and eugene is not coming you will stay here and entertain himto celebrate your return home eugene rises breathless  candida but james  morell authoritatively i insist you do not want to come and he does not want to come candida is about to protest oh dont concern yourselves i shall have plenty of people without you your chairs will be wanted by unconverted people who have never heard me before  candida troubled eugene wouldnt you like to come  morell i should be afraid to let myself go before eugene he is so critical of sermons looking at him he knows i am afraid of him he told me as much this morning well i shall show him how much afraid i am by leaving him here in your custody candida  marchbanks to himself with vivid feeling thats brave thats beautiful he sits down again listening with parted lips  candida with anxious misgiving butbutis anything the matter james greatly troubled i cant understand  morell ah i thought it was i who couldnt understand dear he takes her tenderly in his arms and kisses her on the forehead then looks round quietly at marchbanks    act iii  late in the evening past ten the curtains are drawn and the lamps lighted the typewriter is in its case the large table has been cleared and tidied everything indicates that the days work is done  candida and marchbanks are seated at the fire the reading lamp is on the mantelshelf above marchbanks who is sitting on the small chair reading aloud from a manuscript a little pile of manuscripts and a couple of volumes of poetry are on the carpet beside him candida is in the easy chair with the poker a light brass one upright in her hand she is leaning back and looking at the point of it curiously with her feet stretched towards the blaze and her heels resting on the fender profoundly unconscious of her appearance and surroundings  marchbanks breaking off in his recitation every poet that ever lived has put that thought into a sonnet he must he cant help it he looks to her for assent and notices her absorption in the poker havent you been listening no response mrs morell  candida starting eh  marchbanks havent you been listening  candida with a guilty excess of politeness oh yes its very nice go on eugene im longing to hear what happens to the angel  marchbanks crushedthe manuscript dropping from his hand to the floor i beg your pardon for boring you  candida but you are not boring me i assure you please go on do eugene  marchbanks i finished the poem about the angel quarter of an hour ago ive read you several things since  candida remorsefully im so sorry eugene i think the poker must have fascinated me she puts it down  marchbanks it made me horribly uneasy  candida why didnt you tell me id have put it down at once  marchbanks i was afraid of making you uneasy too it looked as if it were a weapon if i were a hero of old i should have laid my drawn sword between us if morell had come in he would have thought you had taken up the poker because there was no sword between us  candida wondering what with a puzzled glance at him i cant quite follow that those sonnets of yours have perfectly addled me why should there be a sword between us  marchbanks evasively oh never mind he stoops to pick up the manuscript  candida put that down again eugene there are limits to my appetite for poetryeven your poetry youve been reading to me for more than two hoursever since james went out i want to talk  marchbanks rising scared no i mustnt talk he looks round him in his lost way and adds suddenly i think ill go out and take a walk in the park making for the door  candida nonsense its shut long ago come and sit down on the hearthrug and talk moonshine as you usually do i want to be amused dont you want to  marchbanks in half terror half rapture yes  candida then come along she moves her chair back a little to make room he hesitates then timidly stretches himself on the hearthrug face upwards and throws back his head across her knees looking up at her  marchbanks oh ive been so miserable all the evening because i was doing right now im doing wrong and im happy  candida tenderly amused at him yes im sure you feel a great grown up wicked deceiverquite proud of yourself arent you  marchbanks raising his head quickly and turning a little to look round at her take care im ever so much older than you if you only knew he turns quite over on his knees with his hands clasped and his arms on her lap and speaks with growing impulse his blood beginning to stir may i say some wicked things to you  candida without the least fear or coldness quite nobly and with perfect respect for his passion but with a touch of her wisehearted maternal humor no but you may say anything you really and truly feel anything at all no matter what it is i am not afraid so long as it is your real self that speaks and not a mere attitudea gallant attitude or a wicked attitude or even a poetic attitude i put you on your honor and truth now say whatever you want to  marchbanks the eager expression vanishing utterly from his lips and nostrils as his eyes light up with pathetic spirituality oh now i cant say anything all the words i know belong to some attitude or otherall except one  candida what one is that  marchbanks softly losing himself in the music of the name candida candida candida candida candida i must say that now because you have put me on my honor and truth and i never think or feel mrs morell it is always candida  candida of course and what have you to say to candida  marchbanks nothing but to repeat your name a thousand times dont you feel that every time is a prayer to you  candida doesnt it make you happy to be able to pray  marchbanks yes very happy  candida well that happiness is the answer to your prayer do you want anything more  marchbanks in beatitude no i have come into heaven where want is unknown  morell comes in he halts on the threshold and takes in the scene at a glance  morell grave and selfcontained i hope i dont disturb you candida starts up violently but without the smallest embarrassment laughing at herself eugene still kneeling saves himself from falling by putting his hands on the seat of the chair and remains there staring open mouthed at morell  candida as she rises oh james how you startled me i was so taken up with eugene that i didnt hear your latchkey how did the meeting go off did you speak well  morell i have never spoken better in my life  candida that was first rate how much was the collection  morell i forgot to ask  candida to eugene he must have spoken splendidly or he would never have forgotten that to morell where are all the others  morell they left long before i could get away i thought i should never escape i believe they are having supper somewhere  candida in her domestic business tone oh in that case maria may go to bed ill tell her she goes out to the kitchen  morell looking sternly down at marchbanks well  marchbanks squatting crosslegged on the hearthrug and actually at ease with morelleven impishly humorous well  morell have you anything to tell me  marchbanks only that i have been making a fool of myself here in private whilst you have been making a fool of yourself in public  morell hardly in the same way i think  marchbanks scrambling upeagerly the very very very same way i have been playing the good man just like you when you began your heroics about leaving me here with candida  morell involuntarily candida  marchbanks oh yes ive got that far heroics are infectious i caught the disease from you i swore not to say a word in your absence that i would not have said a month ago in your presence  morell did you keep your oath  marchbanks suddenly perching himself grotesquely on the easy chair i was ass enough to keep it until about ten minutes ago up to that moment i went on desperately reading to herreading my own poemsanybodys poemsto stave off a conversation i was standing outside the gate of heaven and refusing to go in oh you cant think how heroic it was and how uncomfortable then  morell steadily controlling his suspense then  marchbanks prosaically slipping down into a quite ordinary attitude in the chair then she couldnt bear being read to any longer  morell and you approached the gate of heaven at last  marchbanks yes  morell well fiercely speak man have you no feeling for me  marchbanks softly and musically then she became an angel and there was a flaming sword that turned every way so that i couldnt go in for i saw that that gate was really the gate of hell  morell triumphantly she repulsed you  marchbanks rising in wild scorn no you fool if she had done that i should never have seen that i was in heaven already repulsed me you think that would have saved mevirtuous indignation oh you are not worthy to live in the same world with her he turns away contemptuously to the other side of the room  morell who has watched him quietly without changing his place do you think you make yourself more worthy by reviling me eugene  marchbanks here endeth the thousand and first lesson morell i dont think much of your preaching after all i believe i could do it better myself the man i want to meet is the man that candida married  morell the man that do you mean me  marchbanks i dont mean the reverend james mavor morell moralist and windbag i mean the real man that the reverend james must have hidden somewhere inside his black coatthe man that candida loved you cant make a woman like candida love you by merely buttoning your collar at the back instead of in front  morell boldly and steadily when candida promised to marry me i was the same moralist and windbag that you now see i wore my black coat and my collar was buttoned behind instead of in front do you think she would have loved me any the better for being insincere in my profession  marchbanks on the sofa hugging his ankles oh she forgave you just as she forgives me for being a coward and a weakling and what you call a snivelling little whelp and all the rest of it dreamily a woman like that has divine insight she loves our souls and not our follies and vanities and illusions or our collars and coats or any other of the rags and tatters we are rolled up in he reflects on this for an instant then turns intently to question morell what i want to know is how you got past the flaming sword that stopped me  morell meaningly perhaps because i was not interrupted at the end of ten minutes  marchbanks taken aback what  morell man can climb to the highest summits but he cannot dwell there long  marchbanks its false there can he dwell for ever and there only its in the other moments that he can find no rest no sense of the silent glory of life where would you have me spend my moments if not on the summits  morell in the scullery slicing onions and filling lamps  marchbanks or in the pulpit scrubbing cheap earthenware souls  morell yes that too it was there that i earned my golden moment and the right in that moment to ask her to love me i did not take the moment on credit nor did i use it to steal another mans happiness  marchbanks rather disgustedly trotting back towards the fireplace i have no doubt you conducted the transaction as honestly as if you were buying a pound of cheese he stops on the brink of the hearthrug and adds thoughtfully to himself with his back turned to morell i could only go to her as a beggar  morell starting a beggar dying of coldasking for her shawl  marchbanks turning surprised thank you for touching up my poetry yes if you like a beggar dying of cold asking for her shawl  morell excitedly and she refused shall i tell you why she refused i can tell you on her own authority it was because of  marchbanks she didnt refuse  morell not  marchbanks she offered me all i chose to ask for her shawl her wings the wreath of stars on her head the lilies in her hand the crescent moon beneath her feet  morell seizing him out with the truth man my wife is my wife i want no more of your poetic fripperies i know well that if i have lost her love and you have gained it no law will bind her  marchbanks quaintly without fear or resistance catch me by the shirt collar morell she will arrange it for me afterwards as she did this morning with quiet rapture i shall feel her hands touch me  morell you young imp do you know how dangerous it is to say that to me or with a sudden misgiving has something made you brave  marchbanks im not afraid now i disliked you before that was why i shrank from your touch but i saw todaywhen she tortured youthat you love her since then i have been your friend you may strangle me if you like  morell releasing him eugene if that is not a heartless lieif you have a spark of human feeling left in youwill you tell me what has happened during my absence  marchbanks what happened why the flaming swordmorell stamps with impatience well in plain prose i loved her so exquisitely that i wanted nothing more than the happiness of being in such love and before i had time to come down from the highest summits you came in  morell suffering deeply so it is still unsettledstill the misery of doubt  marchbanks misery i am the happiest of men i desire nothing now but her happiness with dreamy enthusiasm oh morell let us both give her up why should she have to choose between a wretched little nervous disease like me and a pigheaded parson like you let us go on a pilgrimage you to the east and i to the west in search of a worthy lover for hersome beautiful archangel with purple wings  morell some fiddlestick oh if she is mad enough to leave me for you who will protect her who will help her who will work for her who will be a father to her children he sits down distractedly on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his head propped on his clenched fists  marchbanks snapping his fingers wildly she does not ask those silly questions it is she who wants somebody to protect to help to work forsomebody to give her children to protect to help and to work for some grown up man who has become as a little child again oh you fool you fool you triple fool i am the man morell i am the man he dances about excitedly crying you dont understand what a woman is send for her morell send for her and let her choose betweenthe door opens and candida enters he stops as if petrified  candida amazed on the threshold what on earth are you at eugene  marchbanks oddly james and i are having a preaching match and he is getting the worst of it candida looks quickly round at morell seeing that he is distressed she hurries down to him greatly vexed speaking with vigorous reproach to marchbanks  candida you have been annoying him now i wont have it eugene do you hear putting her hand on morells shoulder and quite forgetting her wifely tact in her annoyance my boy shall not be worried i will protect him  morell rising proudly protect  candida not heeding himto eugene what have you been saying  marchbanks appalled nothing  candida eugene nothing  marchbanks piteously i meaniim very sorry i wont do it again indeed i wont ill let him alone  morell indignantly with an aggressive movement towards eugene let me alone you young  candida stopping him shno let me deal with him james  marchbanks oh youre not angry with me are you  candida severely yes i amvery angry i have a great mind to pack you out of the house  morell taken aback by candidas vigor and by no means relishing the sense of being rescued by her from another man gently candida gently i am able to take care of myself  candida petting him yes dear of course you are but you mustnt be annoyed and made miserable  marchbanks almost in tears turning to the door ill go  candida oh you neednt go i cant turn you out at this time of night vehemently shame on you for shame  marchbanks desperately but what have i done  candida i know what you have doneas well as if i had been here all the time oh it was unworthy you are like a child you cannot hold your tongue  marchbanks i would die ten times over sooner than give you a moments pain  candida with infinite contempt for this puerility much good your dying would do me  morell candida my dear this altercation is hardly quite seemingly it is a matter between two men and i am the right person to settle it  candida two men do you call that a man to eugene you bad boy  marchbanks gathering a whimsically affectionate courage from the scolding if i am to be scolded like this i must make a boys excuse he began it and hes bigger than i am  candida losing confidence a little as her concern for morells dignity takes the alarm that cant be true to morell you didnt begin it james did you  morell contemptuously no  marchbanks indignant oh  morell to eugene you began itthis morning candida instantly connecting this with his mysterious allusion in the afternoon to something told him by eugene in the morning looks quickly at him wrestling with the enigma morell proceeds with the emphasis of offended superiority but your other point is true i am certainly the bigger of the two and i hope the stronger candida so you had better leave the matter in my hands  candida again soothing him yes dear buttroubled i dont understand about this morning  morell gently snubbing her you need not understand my dear  candida but james ithe street bell rings oh bother here they all come she goes out to let them in  marchbanks running to morell  oh morell isnt it dreadful shes angry with us she hates me what shall i do  morell with quaint desperation clutching himself by the hair eugene my head is spinning round i shall begin to laugh presently he walks up and down the middle of the room  marchbanks following him anxiously no no shell think ive thrown you into hysterics dont laugh boisterous voices and laughter are heard approaching lexy mill his eyes sparkling and his bearing denoting unwonted elevation of spirit enters with burgess who is greasy and selfcomplacent but has all his wits about him miss garnett with her smartest hat and jacket on follows them but though her eyes are brighter than before she is evidently a prey to misgiving she places herself with her back to her typewriting table with one hand on it to rest herself passes the other across her forehead as if she were a little tired and giddy marchbanks relapses into shyness and edges away into the corner near the window where morells books are  mill exhilaratedly morell i must congratulate you grasping his hand what a noble splendid inspired address you gave us you surpassed yourself  burgess so you did james it fair kep me awake to the last word didnt it miss garnett  proserpine worriedly oh i wasnt minding you i was trying to make notes she takes out her notebook and looks at her stenography which nearly makes her cry  morell did i go too fast pross  proserpine much too fast you know i cant do more than a hundred words a minute she relieves her feelings by throwing her notebook angrily beside her machine ready for use next morning  morell soothingly oh well well never mind never mind never mind have you all had supper  lexy mr burgess has been kind enough to give us a really splendid supper at the belgrave  burgess with effusive magnanimity dont mention it mr mill modestly youre arty welcome to my little treat  proserpine we had champagne i never tasted it before i feel quite giddy  morell surprised a champagne supper that

fellow the chairman is morell he came to supper with us  morell with long drawn significance looking at burgess oooh the chairman now i understand  burgess covering a lively satisfaction in his diplomatic cunning with a deprecatory cough retires to the hearth lexy folds his arms and leans against the cellaret in a highspirited attitude candida comes in with glasses lemons and a jug of hot water on a tray  candida who will have some lemonade you know our rules total abstinence she puts the tray on the table and takes up the lemon squeezers looking enquiringly round at them  morell no

courage before he rises timidly and puts his hand appealingly on morells forearm stand by me wont you  morell casting him off gently but resolutely each for himself eugene she must choose between us now he goes to the other side of the room as candida returns eugene sits down again on the sofa like a guilty schoolboy on his best behaviour  candida between them addressing eugene are you sorry  marchbanks earnestly yes heartbroken  candida well then you are forgiven now go off to bed like a good little boy i want to talk to james about you  marchbanks rising in great consternation oh i cant do that morell i must be here ill not go away tell her  candida with quick suspicion tell me what his eyes avoid hers furtively she turns and mutely transfers the question to morell  morell bracing himself for the catastrophe i have nothing to tell her except here his voice deepens to a measured and mournful tenderness that she is my greatest treasure on earthif she is really mine  candida coldly offended by his yielding to his orators instinct and treating her as if she were the audience at the guild of st matthew i am sure eugene can say no less if that is all  marchbanks discouraged morell shes laughing at us  morell with a quick touch of temper there is nothing to laugh at are you laughing at us candida  candida with quiet anger eugene is very quickwitted james i hope i am going to laugh but i am not sure that i am not going to be very angry she goes to the fireplace and stands there leaning with her arm on the mantelpiece and her foot on the fender whilst eugene steals to morell and plucks him by the sleeve  marchbanks whispering stop morell dont let us say anything  morell pushing eugene away without deigning to look at him i hope you dont mean that as a threat candida  candida with emphatic warning take care james eugene i asked you to go are you going  morell putting his foot down he shall not go i wish him to remain  marchbanks ill go ill do whatever you want he turns to the door  candida stop he obeys didnt you hear james say he wished you to stay james is master here dont you know that  marchbanks flushing with a young poets rage against tyranny by what right is he master  candida quietly tell him james  morell taken aback my dear i dont know of any right that makes me master i assert no such right  candida with infinite reproach you dont know oh james james to eugene musingly i wonder do you understand eugene no youre too young well i give you leave to stayto stay and learn she comes away from the hearth and places herself between them now james whats the matter come tell me  marchbanks whispering tremulously across to him dont  candida come out with it  morell slowly i meant to prepare your mind carefully candida so as to prevent misunderstanding  candida yes dear i am sure you did but never mind i shant misunderstand  morell wellerhe hesitates unable to find the long explanation which he supposed to be available  candida well  morell baldly eugene declares that you are in love with him  marchbanks frantically no no no no never i did not mrs morell its not true i said i loved you and that he didnt i said that i understood you and that he couldnt and it was not after what passed there before the fire that i spoke it was not on my word it was this morning  candida enlightened this morning  marchbanks yes he looks at her pleading for credence and then adds simply that was what was the matter with my collar  candida after a pause for she does not take in his meaning at once his collar she turns to morell shocked oh james did youshe stops  morell ashamed you know candida that i have a temper to struggle with and he said shuddering that you despised me in your heart  candida turning quickly on eugene did you say that  marchbanks terrified no  candida severely then james has just told me a falsehood is that what you mean  marchbanks no no ii blurting out the explanation desperately it was davids wife and it wasnt at home it was when she saw him dancing before all the people  morell taking the cue with a debaters adroitness dancing before all the people candida and thinking he was moving their hearts by his mission when they were only suffering fromprossys complaint she is about to protest he raises his hand to silence her exclaiming dont try to look indignant candida  candida interjecting try  morell continuing eugene was right as you told me a few hours after he is always right he said nothing that you did not say far better yourself he is the poet who sees everything and i am the poor parson who understands nothing  candida remorsefully do you mind what is said by a foolish boy because i said something like it again in jest  morell that foolish boy can speak with the inspiration of a child and the cunning of a serpent he has claimed that you belong to him and not to me and rightly or wrongly i have come to fear that it may be true i will not go about tortured with doubts and suspicions i will not live with you and keep a secret from you i will not suffer the intolerable degradation of jealousy we have agreedhe and ithat you shall choose between us now i await your decision  candida slowly recoiling a step her heart hardened by his rhetoric in spite of the sincere feeling behind it oh i am to choose am i i suppose it is quite settled that i must belong to one or the other  morell firmly quite you must choose definitely  marchbanks anxiously morell you dont understand she means that she belongs to herself  candida turning on him i mean that and a good deal more master eugene as you will both find out presently and pray my lords and masters what have you to offer for my choice i am up for auction it seems what do you bid james  morell reproachfully cand he breaks down his eyes and throat fill with tears the orator becomes the wounded animal i cant speak  candida impulsively going to him ah dearest  marchbanks in wild alarm stop its not fair you mustnt show her that you suffer morell i am on the rack too but i am not crying  morell rallying all his forces yes you are right it is not for pity that i am bidding he disengages himself from candida  candida retreating chilled i beg your pardon james i did not mean to touch you i am waiting to hear your bid  morell with proud humility i have nothing to offer you but my strength for your defence my honesty of purpose for your surety my ability and industry for your livelihood and my authority and position for your dignity that is all it becomes a man to offer to a woman  candida quite quietly and you eugene what do you offer  marchbanks my weakness my desolation my hearts need  candida impressed thats a good bid eugene now i know how to make my choice  she pauses and looks curiously from one to the other as if weighing them morell whose lofty confidence has changed into heartbreaking dread at eugenes bid loses all power of concealing his anxiety eugene strung to the highest tension does not move a muscle  morell in a suffocated voicethe appeal bursting from the depths of his anguish candida  marchbanks aside in a flash of contempt coward  candida significantly i give myself to the weaker of the two  eugene divines her meaning at once his face whitens like steel in a furnace that cannot melt it  morell bowing his head with the calm of collapse i accept your sentence candida  candida do you understand eugene  marchbanks oh i feel im lost he cannot bear the burden  morell incredulously raising his bead with prosaic abruptness do you mean me candida  candida smiling a little let us sit and talk comfortably over it like three friends to morell sit down dear morell takes the chair from the firesidethe childrens chair bring me that chair eugene she indicates the easy chair he fetches it silently even with something like cold strength and places it next morell a little behind him she sits down he goes to the sofa and sits there still silent and inscrutable when they are all settled she begins throwing a spell of quietness on them by her calm sane tender tone you remember what you told me about yourself eugene how nobody has cared for you since your old nurse died how those clever fashionable sisters and successful brothers of yours were your mothers and fathers pets how miserable you were at eton how your father is trying to starve you into returning to oxford how you have had to live without comfort or welcome or refuge always lonely and nearly always disliked and misunderstood poor boy  marchbanks faithful to the nobility of his lot i had my books i had nature and at last i met you  candida never mind that just at present now i want you to look at this other boy heremy boyspoiled from his cradle we go once a fortnight to see his parents you should come with us eugene and see the pictures of the hero of that household james as a baby the most wonderful of all babies james holding his first school prize won at the ripe age of eight james as the captain of his eleven james in his first frock coat james under all sorts of glorious circumstances you know how strong he is i hope he didnt hurt youhow clever he ishow happy with deepening gravity ask jamess mother and his three sisters what it cost to save james the trouble of doing anything but be strong and clever and happy ask me what it costs to be jamess mother and three sisters and wife and mother to his children all in one ask prossy and maria how troublesome the house is even when we have no visitors to help us to slice the onions ask the tradesmen who want to worry james and spoil his beautiful sermons who it is that puts them off when there is money to give he gives it when there is money to refuse i refuse it i build a castle of comfort and indulgence and love for him and stand sentinel always to keep little vulgar cares out i make him master here though he does not know it and could not tell you a moment ago how it came to be so with sweet irony and when he thought i might go away with you his only anxiety was what should become of me and to tempt me to stay he offered me leaning forward to stroke his hair caressingly at each phrase his strength for my defence his industry for my livelihood his position for my dignity his relenting ah i am mixing up your beautiful sentences and spoiling them am i not darling she lays her cheek fondly against his  morell quite overcome kneeling beside her chair and embracing her with boyish ingenuousness its all true every word what i am you have made me with the labor of your hands and the love of your heart you are my wife my mother my sisters you are the sum of all loving care to me  candida in his arms smiling to eugene am i your mother and sisters to you eugene  marchbanks rising with a fierce gesture of disgust ah never out then into the night with me  candida rising quickly and intercepting him you are not going like that eugene  marchbanks with the ring of a mans voiceno longer a boysin the words i know the hour when it strikes i am impatient to do what must be done  morell rising from his knee alarmed candida dont let him do anything rash  candida confident smiling at eugene oh there is no fear he has learnt to live without happiness  marchbanks i no longer desire happiness life is nobler than that parson james i give you my happiness with both hands i love you because you have filled the heart of the woman i loved goodbye he goes towards the door  candida one last word he stops but without turning to her how old are you eugene  marchbanks as old as the world now this morning i was eighteen  candida going to him and standing behind him with one hand caressingly on his shoulder eighteen will you for my sake make a little poem out of the two sentences i am going to say to you and will you promise to repeat it to yourself whenever you think of me  marchbanks without moving say the sentences  candida when i am thirty she will be fortyfive when i am sixty she will be seventyfive  marchbanks turning to her in a hundred years we shall be the same age but i have a better secret than that in my heart let me go now the night outside grows impatient  candida goodbye she takes his face in her hands and as he divines her intention and bends his knee she kisses his forehead then he flies out into the night she turns to morell holding out her arms to him ah james they embrace but they do not know the secret in the poets heart
