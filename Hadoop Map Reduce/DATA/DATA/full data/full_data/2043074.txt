among the marble figures of the parthenon frieze that one can find the ideal representation of the marvellous beauty of that face which laughed through the leaves last night as hester grazebrook  pure greek it is with the grave low forehead the exquisitely arched brow the noble chiselling of the mouth shaped as if it were the mouthpiece of an instrument of music the supreme and splendid curve of the cheek the augustly pillared throat which bears it all  it is greek because the lines which compose it are so definite and so strong and yet so exquisitely harmonized that the effect is one of simple loveliness purely  greek because its essence and its quality as is the quality of music and of architecture is that of beauty based on absolutely mathematical laws  but while art remains dumb and immobile in its passionless serenity with the beauty of this face it is different  the grey eyes lighten into blue or deepen into violet as fancy succeeds fancy the lips become flowerlike in laughter or tremulous as a birds wing mould themselves at last into the strong and bitter moulds of pain or scorn  and then motion comes and the statue wakes into life  but the life is not the ordinary life of common days it is life with a new value given to it the value of art and the charm to me of hester grazebrooks acting in the first scene of the play last night was that mingling of classic grace with absolute reality which is the secret of all beautiful art of the plastic work of the greeks and of the pictures of jean francois millet equally  i do not think that the sovereignty and empire of womens beauty has at all passed away though we may no longer go to war for them as the greeks did for the daughter of leda  the greatest empire still remains for themthe empire of art  and indeed this wonderful face seen last night for the first time in america has filled and permeated with the pervading image of its type the whole of our modern art in england  last century it was the romantic type which dominated in art the type loved by reynolds and gainsborough of wonderful contrasts of colour of exquisite and varying charm of expression but without that definite plastic feeling which divides classic from romantic work  this type degenerated into mere facile prettiness in the hands of lesser masters and in protest against it was created by the hands of the preraphaelites a new type with its rare combination of greek form with florentine mysticism  but this mysticism becomes over strained and a burden rather than an aid to expression and a desire for the pure hellenic joy and serenity came in its place and in all our modern work in the paintings of such men as albert moore and leighton and whistler we can trace the influence of this single face giving fresh life and inspiration in the form of a new artistic ideal    slaves of fashion    miss lefflerarnims statement in a lecture delivered recently at st saviours hospital that she had heard of instances where ladies were so determined not to exceed the fashionable measurement that they had actually held on to a crossbar while their maids fastened the fifteeninch corset has excited a good deal of incredulity but there is nothing really improbable in it  from the sixteenth century to our own day there is hardly any form of torture that has not been inflicted on girls and endured by women in obedience to the dictates of an unreasonable and monstrous fashion  in order to obtain a real spanish figure says montaigne what a gehenna of suffering will not women endure drawn in and compressed by great coches entering the flesh nay sometimes they even die thereof  a few days after my arrival at school mrs somerville tells us in her memoirs although perfectly straight and well made i was enclosed in stiff stays with a steel busk in front while above my frock bands drew my shoulders back till the shoulderblades met  then a steel rod with a semicircle which went under my chin was clasped to the steel busk in my stays  in this constrained state i and most of the younger girls had to prepare our lessons and in the life of miss edgeworth we read that being sent to a certain fashionable establishment she underwent all the usual tortures of back boards iron collars and dumbs and also because she was a very tiny person the unusual one of being hung by the neck to draw out the muscles and increase the growth a signal failure in her case indeed instances of absolute mutilation and misery are so common in the past that it is unnecessary to multiply them but it is really sad to think that in our own day a civilized woman can hang on to a crossbar while her maid laces her waist into a fifteen inch circle  to begin with the waist is not a circle at all but an oval nor can there be any greater error than to imagine that an unnaturally small waist gives an air of grace or even of slightness to the whole figure  its effect as a rule is simply to exaggerate the width of the shoulders and the hips and those whose figures possess that stateliness which is called stoutness by the vulgar convert what is a quality into a defect by yielding to the silly edicts of fashion on the subject of tightlacing  the fashionable english waist also is not merely far too small and consequently quite out of proportion to the rest of the figure but it is worn far too low down  i use the expression worn advisedly for a waist nowadays seems to be regarded as an article of apparel to be put on when and where one likes  a long waist always implies shortness of the lower limbs and from the artistic point of view has the effect of diminishing the height and i am glad to see that many of the most charming women in paris are returning to the idea of the directoire style of dress  this style is not by any means perfect but at least it has the merit of indicating the proper position of the waist  i feel quite sure that all english women of culture and position will set their faces against such stupid and dangerous practices as are related by miss lefflerarnim  fashions motto is  il faut souffrir pour etre belle but the motto of art and of commonsense is  il faut etre bete pour souffrir  talking of fashion a critic in the pall mall gazelle expresses his surprise that i should have allowed an illustration of a hat covered with the bodies of dead birds to appear in the first number of the womans world and as i have received many letters on the subject it is only right that i should state my exact position in the matter  fashion is such an essential part of the mundus muliebris of our day that it seems to me absolutely necessary that its growth development and phases should be duly chronicled and the historical and practical value of such a record depends entirely upon its perfect fidelity to fact  besides it is quite easy for the children of light to adapt almost any fashionable form of dress to the requirements of utility and the demands of good taste  the sarah bernhardt teagown for instance figured in the present issue has many good points about it and the gigantic dressimprover does not appear to me to be really essential to the mode and though the postillion costume of the fancy dress ball is absolutely detestable in its silliness and vulgarity the socalled late georgian costume in the same plate is rather pleasing  i must however protest against the idea that to chronicle the development of fashion implies any approval of the particular forms that fashion may adopt    womans dress    the girl graduate must of course have precedence not merely for her sex but for her sanity  her letter is extremely sensible  she makes two points  that high heels are a necessity for any lady who wishes to keep her dress clean from the stygian mud of our streets and that without a tight corset the ordinary number of petticoats and etceteras cannot be properly or conveniently held up  now it is quite true that as long as the lower garments are suspended from the hips a corset is an absolute necessity the mistake lies in not suspending all apparel from the shoulders  in the latter case a corset becomes useless the body is left free and unconfined for respiration and motion there is more health and consequently more beauty  indeed all the most ungainly and uncomfortable articles of dress that fashion has ever in her folly prescribed not the tight corset merely but the farthingale the vertugadin the hoop the crinoline and that modern monstrosity the socalled dress improver also all of them have owed their origin to the same error the error of not seeing that it is from the shoulders and from the shoulders only that all garments should be hung  and as regards high heels i quite admit that some additional height to the shoe or boot is necessary if long gowns are to be worn in the street but what i object to is that the height should be given to the heel only and not to the sole of the foot also the modern highheeled boot is in fact merely the clog of the time of henry vi with the front prop left out and its inevitable effect is to throw the body forward to shorten the steps and consequently to produce that want of grace which always follows want of freedom  why should clogs be despised  much art has been expended on clogs they have been made of lovely woods and delicately inlaid with ivory and with motherofpearl  a clog might be a dream of beauty and if not too high or too heavy most comfortable also but if there be any who do not like clogs let them try some adaptation of the trouser of the turkish lady which is loose round the limb and tight at the ankle  the girl graduate with a pathos to which i am not insensible entreats me not to apotheosize that awful befringed beflounced and bekilted divided skirt  well i will acknowledge that the fringes the flounces and the kilting do certainly defeat the whole object of the dress which is that of ease and liberty but i regard these things as mere wicked superfluities tragic proofs that the divided skirt is ashamed of its own division  the principle of the dress is good and though it is not by any means perfection it is a step towards it  here i leave the girl graduate with much regret for mr wentworth huyshe  mr huyshe makes the old criticism that greek dress is unsuited to our climate and to me the somewhat new assertion that the mens dress of a hundred years ago was preferable to that of the second part of the seventeenth century which i consider to have been the exquisite period of english costume  now as regards the first of these two statements i will say to begin with that the warmth of apparel does not depend really on the number of garments worn but on the material of which they are made  one of the chief faults of modern dress is that it is composed of far too many articles of clothing most of which are of the wrong substance but over a substratum of pure wool such as is supplied by dr jaeger under the modern german system some modification of greek costume is perfectly applicable to our climate our country and our century  this important fact has already been pointed out by mr e w godwin in his excellent though too brief handbook on dress contributed to the health exhibition  i call it an important fact because it makes almost any form of lovely costume perfectly practicable in our cold climate  mr godwin it is true points out that the english ladies of the thirteenth century abandoned after some time the flowing garments of the early renaissance in favour of a tighter mode such as northern europe seems to demand  this i quite admit and its significance but what i contend and what i am sure mr godwin would agree with me in is that the principles the laws of greek dress may be perfectly realized even in a moderately tight gown with sleeves  i mean the principle of suspending all apparel from the shoulders and of relying for beauty of effect not on the stiff readymade ornaments of the modern millinerthe bows where there should be no bows and the flounces where there should be no flouncesbut on the exquisite play of light and line that one gets from rich and rippling folds  i am not proposing any antiquarian revival of an ancient costume but trying merely to point out the right laws of dress laws which are dictated by art and not by archaeology by science and not by fashion and just as the best work of art in our days is that which combines classic grace with absolute reality so from a continuation of the greek principles of beauty with the german principles of health will come i feel certain the costume of the future  and now to the question of mens dress or rather to mr huyshes claim of the superiority in point of costume of the last quarter of the eighteenth century over the second quarter of the seventeenth  the broadbrimmed hat of 1640 kept the rain of winter and the glare of summer from the face the same cannot be said of the hat of one hundred years ago which with its comparatively narrow brim and high crown was the precursor of the modern chimneypot  a wide turneddown collar is a healthier thing than a strangling stock and a short cloak much more comfortable than a sleeved overcoat even though the latter may have had three capes a cloak is easier to put on and off lies lightly on the shoulder in summer and wrapped round one in winter keeps one perfectly warm  a doublet again is simpler than a coat and waistcoat instead of two garments one has one by not being open also it protects the chest better  short loose trousers are in every way to be preferred to the tight kneebreeches which often impede the proper circulation of the blood and finally the soft leather boots which could be worn above or below the knee are more supple and give consequently more freedom than the stiff hessian which mr huyshe so praises i say nothing about the question of grace and picturesqueness for i suppose that no one not even mr huyshe would prefer a maccaroni to a cavalier a lawrence to a vandyke or the third george to the first charles but for ease warmth and comfort this seventeenthcentury dress is infinitely superior to anything that came after it and i do not think it is excelled by any preceding form of costume  i sincerely trust that we may soon see in england some national revival of it    more radical ideas upon dress reform    i have been much interested at reading the large amount of correspondence that has been called forth by my recent lecture on dress  it shows me that the subject of dress reform is one that is occupying many wise and charming people who have at heart the principles of health freedom and beauty in costume and i hope that h b t and materfamilias will have all the real influence which their lettersexcellent letters both of them certainly deserve  i turn first to mr huyshes second letter and the drawing that accompanies it but before entering into any examination of the theory contained in each i think i should state at once that i have absolutely no idea whether this gentleman wears his hair long or short or his cuffs back or forward or indeed what he is like at all  i hope he consults his own comfort and wishes in everything which has to do with his dress and is allowed to enjoy that individualism in apparel which he so eloquently claims for himself and so foolishly tries to deny to others but i really could not take mr wentworth huyshes personal appearance as any intellectual basis for an investigation of the principles which should guide the costume of a nation  i am not denying the force or even the popularity of the eave arf a brick school of criticism but i acknowledge it does not interest me  the gamin in the gutter may be a necessity but the gamin in discussion is a nuisance  so i will proceed at once to the real point at issue the value of the late eighteenthcentury costume over that worn in the second quarter of the seventeenth  the relative merits that is of the principles contained in each  now as regards the eighteenthcentury costume mr wentworth huyshe acknowledges that he has had no practical experience of it at all in fact he makes a pathetic appeal to his friends to corroborate him in his assertion which i do not question for a moment that he has never been guilty of the eccentricity of wearing himself the dress which he proposes for general adoption by others  there is something so naive and so amusing about this last passage in mr huyshes letter that i am really in doubt whether i am not doing him a wrong in regarding him as having any serious or sincere views on the question of a possible reform in dress still as irrespective of any attitude of mr huyshes in the matter the subject is in itself an interesting one i think it is worth continuing particularly as i have myself worn this late eighteenthcentury dress many times both in public and in private and so may claim to have a very positive right to speak on its comfort and suitability  the particular form of the dress i wore was very similar to that given in mr godwins handbook from a print of northcotes and had a certain elegance and grace about it which was very charming still i gave it up for these reasons after a further consideration of the laws of dress i saw that a doublet is a far simpler and easier garment than a coat and waistcoat and if buttoned from the shoulder far warmer also and that tails have no place in costume except on some darwinian theory of heredity from absolute experience in the matter i found that the excessive tightness of kneebreeches is not really comfortable if one wears them constantly and in fact i satisfied myself that the dress is not one founded on any real principles  the broadbrimmed hat and loose cloak which as my object was not of course historical accuracy but modern ease i had always worn with the costume in question i have still retained and find them most comfortable  well although mr huyshe has no real experience of the dress he proposes he gives us a drawing of it which he labels somewhat prematurely an ideal dress  an ideal dress of course it is not passably picturesque he says i may possibly think it well passably picturesque it may be but not beautiful certainly simply because it is not founded on right principles or indeed on any principles at all  picturesqueness one may get in a variety of ways ugly things that are strange or unfamiliar to us for instance may be picturesque such as a late sixteenthcentury costume or a georgian house  ruins again may be picturesque but beautiful they never can be because their lines are meaningless  beauty in fact is to be got only from the perfection of principles and in the ideal dress of mr huyshe there are no ideas or principles at all much less the perfection of either  let us examine it and see its faults they are obvious to any one who desires more than a fancydress ball basis for costume  to begin with the hat and boots are all wrong  whatever one wears on the extremities such as the feet and head should for the sake of comfort be made of a soft material and for the sake of freedom should take its shape from the way one chooses to wear it and not from any stiff stereotyped design of hat or boot maker  in a hat made on right principles one should be able to turn the brim up or down according as the day is dark or fair dry or wet but the hat brim of mr huyshes drawing is perfectly stiff and does not give much protection to the face or the possibility of any at all to the back of the head or the ears in case of a cold east wind whereas the bycocket a hat made in accordance with the right laws can be turned down behind and at the sides and so give the same warmth as a hood  the crown again of mr huyshes hat is far too high a high crown diminishes the stature of a small person and in the case of any one who is tall is a great inconvenience when one is getting in and out of hansoms and railway carriages or passing under a street awning in no case is it of any value whatsoever and being useless it is of course against the principles of dress  as regards the boots they are not quite so ugly or so uncomfortable as the hat still they are evidently made of stiff leather as otherwise they would fall down to the ankle whereas the boot should be made of soft leather always and if worn high at all must be either laced up the front or carried well over the knee  in the latter case one combines perfect freedom for walking together with perfect protection against rain neither of which advantages a short stiff boot will ever give one and when one is resting in the house the long soft boot can be turned down as the boot of 1640 was  then there is the overcoat  now what are the right principles of an overcoat  to begin with it should be capable of being easily put on or off and worn over any kind of dress consequently it should never have narrow sleeves such as are shown in mr huyshes drawing  if an opening or slit for the arm is required it should be made quite wide and may be protected by a flap as in that excellent overall the modern inverness cape secondly it should not be too tight as otherwise all freedom of walking is impeded  if the young gentleman in the drawing buttons his overcoat he may succeed in being statuesque though that i doubt very strongly but he will never succeed in being swift his supertotus is made for him on no principle whatsoever a super totus or overall should be capable of being worn long or short quite loose or moderately tight just as the wearer wishes he should be able to have one arm free and one arm covered or both arms free or both arms covered just as he chooses for his convenience in riding walking or driving an overall again should never be heavy and should always be warm  lastly it should be capable of being easily carried if one wants to take it off in fact its principles are those of freedom and comfort and a cloak realizes them all just as much as an overcoat of the pattern suggested by mr huyshe violates them  the kneebreeches are of course far too tight any one who has worn them for any length of timeany one in fact whose views on the subject are not purely theoreticalwill agree with me there like everything else in the dress they are a great mistake  the substitution of the jacket for the coat and waistcoat of the period is a step in the right direction which i am glad to see it is however far too tight over the hips for any possible comfort whenever a jacket or doublet comes below the waist it should be slit at each side  in the seventeenth century the skirt of the jacket was sometimes laced on by points and tags so that it could be removed at will sometimes it was merely left open at the sides in each case it exemplified what are always the true principles of dress i mean freedom and adaptability to circumstances  finally as regards drawings of this kind i would point out that there is absolutely no limit at all to the amount of passably picturesque costumes which can be either revived or invented for us but that unless a costume is founded on principles and exemplified laws it never can be of any real value to us in the reform of dress  this particular drawing of mr huyshes for instance proves absolutely nothing except that our grandfathers did not understand the proper laws of dress  there is not a single rule of right costume which is not violated in it for it gives us stiffness tightness and discomfort instead of comfort freedom and ease  now here on the other hand is a dress which being founded on principles can serve us as an excellent guide and model it has been drawn for me most kindly by mr godwin from the duke of newcastles delightful book on horsemanship a book which is one of our best authorities on our best era of costume  i do not of course propose it necessarily for absolute imitation that is not the way in which one should regard it it is not i mean a revival of a dead costume but a realization of living laws  i give it as an example of a particular application of principles which are universally right  this rationally dressed young man can turn his hat brim down if it rains and his loose trousers and boots down if he is tiredthat is he can adapt his costume to circumstances then he enjoys perfect freedom the arms and legs are not made awkward or uncomfortable by the excessive tightness of narrow sleeves and kneebreeches and the hips are left quite untrammelled always an important point and as regards comfort his jacket is not too loose for warmth nor too close for respiration his neck is well protected without being strangled and even his ostrich feathers if any philistine should object to them are not merely dandyism but fan him very pleasantly i am sure in summer and when the weather is bad they are no doubt left at home and his cloak taken out  the value of the dress is simply that every separate article of it expresses a law  my young man is consequently apparelled with ideas while mr huyshes young man is stiffened with facts the latter teaches one nothing from the former one learns everything  i need hardly say that this dress is good not because it is seventeenth century but because it is constructed on the true principles of costume just as a square lintel or pointed arch is good not because one may be greek and the other gothic but because each of them is the best method of spanning a certainsized opening or resisting a certain weight the fact however that this dress was generally worn in england two centuries and a half ago shows at least this that the right laws of dress have been understood and realized in our country and so in our country may be realized and understood again  as regards the absolute beauty of this dress and its meaning i should like to say a few words more  mr wentworth huyshe solemnly announces that he and those who think with him cannot permit this question of beauty to be imported into the question of dress that he and those who think with him take practical views on the subject and so on  well i will not enter here into a discussion as to how far any one who does not take beauty and the value of beauty into account can claim to be practical at all  the word practical is nearly always the last refuge of the uncivilized  of all misused words it is the most evilly treated  but what i want to point out is that beauty is essentially organic that is it comes not from without but from within not from any added prettiness but from the perfection of its own being and that consequently as the body is beautiful so all apparel that rightly clothes it must be beautiful also in its construction and in its lines  i have no more desire to define ugliness than i have daring to define beauty but still i would like to remind those who mock at beauty as being an unpractical thing of this fact that an ugly thing is merely a thing that is badly made or a thing that does not serve it purpose that ugliness is want of fitness that ugliness is failure that ugliness is uselessness such as ornament in the wrong place while beauty as some one finely said is the purgation of all superfluities  there is a divine economy about beauty it gives us just what is needful and no more whereas ugliness is always extravagant ugliness is a spendthrift and wastes its material in fine uglinessand i would commend this remark to mr wentworth huysheugliness as much in costume as in anything else is always the sign that somebody has been unpractical  so the costume of the future in england if it is founded on the true laws of freedom comfort and adaptability to circumstances cannot fail to be most beautiful also because beauty is the sign always of the rightness of principles the mystical seal that is set upon what is perfect and upon what is perfect only  as for your other correspondent the first principle of dress that all garments should be hung from the shoulders and not from the waist seems to me to be generally approved of although an old sailor declares that no sailors or athletes ever suspend their clothes from the shoulders but always from the hips  my own recollection of the river and running ground at oxfordthose two homes of hellenism in our little gothic townis that the best runners and rowers and my own college turned out many wore always a tight jersey with short drawers attached to it the whole costume being woven in one piece  as for sailors it is true i admit and the bad custom seems to involve that constant hitching up of the lower garments which however popular in transpontine dramas cannot i think but be considered an extremely awkward habit and as all awkwardness comes from discomfort of some kind i trust that this point in our sailors dress will be looked to in the coming reform of our navy for in spite of all protests i hope we are about to reform everything from torpedoes to tophats and from crinolettes to cruises  then as regards clogs my suggestion of them seems to have aroused a great deal of terror  fashion in her highheeled boots has screamed and the dreadful word anachronism has been used  now whatever is useful cannot be an anachronism  such a word is applicable only to the revival of some folly and besides in the england of our own day clogs are still worn in many of our manufacturing towns such as oldham  i fear that in oldham they may not be dreams of beauty in oldham the art of inlaying them with ivory and with pearl may possibly be unknown yet in oldham they serve their purpose  nor is it so long since they were worn by the upper classes of this country generally  only a few days ago i had the pleasure of talking to a lady who remembered with affectionate regret the clogs of her girlhood they were according to her not too high nor too heavy and were provided besides with some kind of spring in the sole so as to make them the more supple for the foot in walking  personally i object to all additional height being given to a boot or shoe it is really against the proper principles of dress although if any such height is to be given it should be by means of two props not one but what i should prefer to see is some adaptation of the divided skirt or long and moderately loose knickerbockers  if however the divided skirt is to be of any positive value it must give up all idea of being identical in appearance with an ordinary skirt it must diminish the moderate width of each of its divisions and sacrifice its foolish frills and flounces the moment it imitates a dress it is lost but let it visibly announce itself as what it actually is and it will go far towards solving a real difficulty i feel sure that there will be found many graceful and charming girls ready to adopt a costume founded on these principles in spite of mr wentworth huyshes terrible threat that he will not propose to them as long as they wear it for all charges of a want of womanly character in these forms of dress are really meaningless every right article of apparel belongs equally to both sexes and there is absolutely no such thing as a definitely feminine garment  one word of warning i should like to be allowed to give  the overtunic should be made full and moderately loose it may if desired be shaped more or less to the figure but in no case should it be confined at the waist by any straight band or belt on the contrary it should fall from the shoulder to the knee or below it in fine curves and vertical lines giving more freedom and consequently more grace  few garments are so absolutely unbecoming as a belted tunic that reaches to the knees a fact which i wish some of our rosalinds would consider when they don doublet and hose indeed to the disregard of this artistic principle is due the ugliness the want of proportion in the bloomer costume a costume which in other respects is sensible    costume    are we not all weary of him that venerable impostor fresh from the steps of the piazza di spagna who in the leisure moments that he can spare from his customary organ makes the round of the studios and is waited for in holland park  do we not all recognize him when with the gay insouciance of his nation he reappears on the walls of our summer exhibitions as everything that he is not and as nothing that he is glaring at us here as a patriarch of canaan here beaming as a brigand from the abruzzi  popular is he this poor peripatetic professor of posing with those whose joy it is to paint the posthumous portrait of the last philanthropist who in his lifetime had neglected to be photographedyet he is the sign of the decadence the symbol of decay  for all costumes are caricatures  the basis of art is not the fancy ball  where there is loveliness of dress there is no dressing up  and so were our national attire delightful in colour and in construction simple and sincere were dress the expression of the loveliness that it shields and of the swiftness and motion that it does not impede did its lines break from the shoulder instead of bulging from the waist did the inverted wineglass cease to be the ideal of form were these things brought about as brought about they will be then would painting be no longer an artificial reaction against the ugliness of life but become as it should be the natural expression of lifes beauty nor would painting merely but all the other arts also be the gainers by a change such as that which i propose the gainers i mean through the increased atmosphere of beauty by which the artists would be surrounded and in which they would grow up  for art is not to be taught in academies  it is what one looks at not what one listens to that makes the artist  the real schools should be the streets  there is not for instance a single delicate line or delightful proportion in the dress of the greeks which is not echoed exquisitely in their architecture  a nation arrayed in stovepipe hats and dressimprovers might have built the pantechnichon possibly but the parthenon never  and finally there is this to be said  art it is true can never have any other claim but her own perfection and it may be that the artist desiring merely to contemplate and to create is wise in not busying himself about change in others  yet wisdom is not always the best there are times when she sinks to the level of commonsense and from the passionate folly of thoseand there are manywho desire that beauty shall be confined no longer to the bricabrac of the collector and the dust of the museum but shall be as it should be the natural and national inheritance of all from this noble unwisdom i say who knows what new loveliness shall be given to life and under these more exquisite conditions what perfect artist born  le milieu se renouvelant lart se renouvelle    the american invasion    a terrible danger is hanging over the americans in london  their future and their

buffalo bill is going to bring to london and we have no doubt that london will fully appreciate his show  with regard to mrs brownpotter as acting is no longer considered absolutely essential for success on the english stage there is really no reason why the pretty brighteyed lady who charmed us all last june by her merry laugh and her nonchalant ways should not to borrow an expression from her native languagemake a big boom and paint the town red  we sincerely hope she will for on the whole the american invasion has done english society a great deal of good  american women are bright clever and wonderfully cosmopolitan  their patriotic feelings are limited to an admiration for niagara and a regret for the elevated railway and unlike the men they never bore us with bunkers hill  they take their dresses from paris and their manners from piccadilly and wear both charmingly  they have a quaint pertness a delightful conceit a native selfassertion  they insist on being paid compliments and have almost succeeded in making englishmen eloquent  for our aristocracy they have an ardent admiration they adore titles and are a permanent blow to republican principles  in the art of amusing men they are adepts both by nature and education and can actually tell a story without forgetting the pointan accomplishment that is extremely rare among the women of other countries  it is true that they lack repose and that their voices are somewhat harsh and strident when they land first at liverpool but after a time one gets to love those pretty whirlwinds in petticoats that sweep so recklessly through society and are so agitating to all duchesses who have daughters  there is something fascinating in their funny exaggerated gestures and their petulant way of tossing the head  their eyes have no magic nor mystery in them but they challenge us for combat and when we engage we are always worsted  their lips seem made for laughter and yet they never grimace  as for their voices they soon get them into tune  some of them have been known to acquire a fashionable drawl in two seasons and after they have been presented to royalty they all roll their rs as vigorously as a young equerry or an old ladyinwaiting  still they never really lose their accent it keeps peeping out here and there and when they chatter together they are like a bevy of peacocks  nothing is more amusing than to watch two american girls greeting each other in a drawingroom or in the row  they are like children with their shrill staccato cries of wonder their odd little exclamations  their conversation sounds like a series of exploding crackers they are exquisitely incoherent and use a sort of primitive emotional language  after five minutes they are left beautifully breathless and look at each other half in amusement and half in affection  if a stolid young englishman is fortunate enough to be introduced to them he is amazed at their extraordinary vivacity their electric quickness of repartee their inexhaustible store of curious catchwords  he never really understands them for their thoughts flutter about with the sweet irresponsibility of butterflies but he is pleased and amused and feels as if he were in an aviary  on the whole american girls have a wonderful charm and perhaps the chief secret of their charm is that they never talk seriously except about amusements  they have however one grave faulttheir mothers  dreary as were those old pilgrim fathers who left our shores more than two centuries ago to found a new england beyond the seas the pilgrim mothers who have returned to us in the nineteenth century are drearier still  here and there of course there are exceptions but as a class they are either dull dowdy or dyspeptic  it is only fair to the rising generation of america to state that they are not to blame for this  indeed they spare no pains at all to bring up their parents properly and to give them a suitable if somewhat late education  from its earliest years every american child spends most of its time in correcting the faults of its father and mother and no one who has had the opportunity of watching an american family on the deck of an atlantic steamer or in the refined seclusion of a new york boardinghouse can fail to have been struck by this characteristic of their civilization  in america the young are always ready to give to those who are older than themselves the full benefits of their inexperience  a boy of only eleven or twelve years of age will firmly but kindly point out to his father his defects of manner or temper will never weary of warning him against extravagance idleness late hours unpunctuality and the other temptations to which the aged are so particularly exposed and sometimes should he fancy that he is monopolizing too much of the conversation at dinner will remind him across the table of the new childs adage parents should be seen not heard  nor does any mistaken idea of kindness prevent the little american girl from censuring her mother whenever it is necessary  often indeed feeling that a rebuke conveyed in the presence of others is more truly efficacious than one merely whispered in the quiet of the nursery she will call the attention of perfect strangers to her mothers general untidiness her want of intellectual boston conversation immoderate love of iced water and green corn stinginess in the matter of candy ignorance of the usages of the best baltimore society bodily ailments and the like  in fact it may be truly said that no american child is ever blind to the deficiencies of its parents no matter how much it may love them  yet somehow this educational system has not been so successful as it deserved  in many cases no doubt the material with which the children had to deal was crude and incapable of real development but the fact remains that the american mother is a tedious person the american father is better for he is never seen in london  he passes his life entirely in wall street and communicates with his family once a month by means of a telegram in cipher  the mother however is always with us and lacking the quick imitative faculty of the younger generation remains uninteresting and provincial to the last  in spite of her however the american girl is always welcome  she brightens our dull dinner parties for us and makes life go pleasantly by for a season  in the race for coronets she often carries off the prize but once she has gained the victory she is generous and forgives her english rivals everything even their beauty  warned by the example of her mother that american women do not grow old gracefully she tries not to grow old at all and often succeeds  she has exquisite feet and hands is always bien chaussee et bien gantee and can talk brilliantly upon any subject provided that she knows nothing about it  her sense of humour keeps her from the tragedy of a grande passion and as there is neither romance nor humility in her love she makes an excellent wife  what her ultimate influence on english life will be it is difficult to estimate at present but there can be no doubt that of all the factors that have contributed to the social revolution of london there are few more important and none more delightful than the american invasion    sermons in stones at bloomsbury the new sculpture room at the british museum    through the exertions of sir charles newton to whom every student of classic art should be grateful some of the wonderful treasures so long immured in the grimy vaults of the british museum have at last been brought to light and the new sculpture room now opened to the public will amply repay the trouble of a visit even from those to whom art is a stumblingblock and a rock of offence  for setting aside the mere beauty of form outline and mass the grace and loveliness of design and the delicacy of technical treatment here we have shown to us what the greeks and romans thought about death and the philosopher the preacher the practical man of the world and even the philistine himself cannot fail to be touched by these sermons in stones with their deep significance their fertile suggestion their plain humanity  common tombstones they are most of them the work not of famous artists but of simple handicraftsmen only they were wrought in days when every handicraft was an art  the finest specimens from the purely artistic point of view are undoubtedly the two stelai found at athens  they are both the tombstones of young greek athletes  in one the athlete is represented handing his strigil to his slave in the other the athlete stands alone strigil in hand  they do not belong to the greatest period of greek art they have not the grand style of the phidian age but they are beautiful for all that and it is impossible not to be fascinated by their exquisite grace and by the treatment which is so simple in its means so subtle in its effect  all the tombstones however are full of interest  here is one of two ladies of smyrna who were so remarkable in their day that the city voted them honorary crowns here is a greek doctor examining a little boy who is suffering from indigestion here is the memorial of xanthippus who probably was a martyr to gout as he is holding in his hand the model of a foot intended no doubt as a votive offering to some god  a lovely stele from rhodes gives us a family group  the husband is on horseback and is bidding farewell to his wife who seems as if she would follow him but is being held back by a little child  the pathos of parting from those we love is the central motive of greek funeral art  it is repeated in every possible form and each mute marble stone seems to murmur greek text  roman art is different  it introduces vigorous and realistic portraiture and deals with pure family life far more frequently than greek art does  they are very ugly those sternlooking roman men and women whose portraits are exhibited on their tombs but they seem to have been loved and respected by their children and their servants  here is the monument of aphrodisius and atilia a roman gentleman and his wife who died in britain many centuries ago and whose tombstone was found in the thames and close by it stands a stele from rome with the busts of an old married couple who are certainly marvellously illfavoured the contrast between the abstract greek treatment of the idea of death and the roman concrete realization of the individuals who have died is extremely curious  besides the tombstones the new sculpture room contains some most fascinating examples of roman decorative art under the emperors the most wonderful of all and this alone is worth a trip to bloomsbury is a basrelief representing a marriage scene juno pronuba is joining the hands of a handsome young noble and a very stately lady  there is all the grace of perugino in this marble all the grace of raphael even  the date of it is uncertain but the particular cut of the bridegrooms beard seems to point to the time of the emperor hadrian  it is clearly the work of greek artists and is one of the most beautiful basreliefs in the whole museum  there is something in it which reminds one of the music and the sweetness of propertian verse  then we have delightful friezes of children  one representing children playing on musical instruments might have suggested much of the plastic art of florence  indeed as we view these marbles it is not difficult to see whence the renaissance sprang and to what we owe the various forms of renaissance art  the frieze of the muses each of whom wears in her hair a feather plucked from the wings of the vanquished sirens is extremely fine there is a lovely little bas relief of two cupids racing in chariots and the frieze of recumbent amazons has some splendid qualities of design  a frieze of children playing with the armour of the god mars should also be mentioned  it is full of fancy and delicate humour   we hope that some more of the hidden treasures will shortly be catalogued and shown  in the vaults at present there is a very remarkable basrelief of the marriage of cupid and psyche and another representing the professional mourners weeping over the body of the dead  the fine cast of the lion of chaeronea should also be brought up and so should the stele with the marvellous portrait of the roman slave  economy is an excellent public virtue but the parsimony that allows valuable works of art to remain in the grim and gloom of a damp cellar is little short of a detestable public vice    lenvoi    amongst the many young men in england who are seeking along with me to continue and to perfect the english renaissancejeunes guerriers du drapeau romantique as gautier would have called us there is none whose love of art is more flawless and fervent whose artistic sense of beauty is more subtle and more delicatenone indeed who is dearer to myselfthan the young poet whose verses i have brought with me to america verses full of sweet sadness and yet full of joy for the most joyous poet is not he who sows the desolate highways of this world with the barren seed of laughter but he who makes his sorrow most musical this indeed being the meaning of joy in artthat incommunicable element of artistic delight which in poetry for instance comes from what keats called sensuous life of verse the element of song in the singing made so pleasurable to us by that wonder of motion which often has its origin in mere musical impulse and in painting is to be sought for from the subject never but from the pictorial charm onlythe scheme and symphony of the colour the satisfying beauty of the design  so that the ultimate expression of our artistic movement in painting has been not in the spiritual vision of the preraphaelites for all their marvel of greek legend and their mystery of italian song but in the work of such men as whistler and albert moore who have raised design and colour to the ideal level of poetry and music  for the quality of their exquisite painting comes from the mere inventive and creative handling of line and colour from a certain form and choice of beautiful workmanship which rejecting all literary reminiscence and all metaphysical idea is in itself entirely satisfying to the aesthetic senseis as the greeks would say an end in itself the effect of their work being like the effect given to us by music for music is the art in which form and matter are always onethe art whose subject cannot be separated from the method of its expression the art which most completely realizes for us the artistic ideal and is the condition to which all the other arts are constantly aspiring  now this increased sense of the absolutely satisfying value of beautiful workmanship this recognition of the primary importance of the sensuous element in art this love of art for arts sake is the point in which we of the younger school have made a departure from the teaching of mr ruskina departure definite and different and decisive  master indeed of the knowledge of all noble living and of the wisdom of all spiritual things will he be to us ever seeing that it was he who by the magic of his presence and the music of his lips taught us at oxford that enthusiasm for beauty which is the secret of hellenism and that desire for creation which is the secret of life and filled some of us at least with the lofty and passionate ambition to go forth into far and fair lands with some message for the nations and some mission for the world and yet in his art criticism his estimate of the joyous element of art his whole method of approaching art we are no longer with him for the keystone to his aesthetic system is ethical always  he would judge of a picture by the amount of noble moral ideas it expresses but to us the channels by which all noble work in painting can touch and does touch the soul are not those of truths of life or metaphysical truths  to him perfection of workmanship seems but the symbol of pride and incompleteness of technical resource the image of an imagination too limitless to find within the limits of form its complete expression or of love too simple not to stammer in its tale  but to us the rule of art is not the rule of morals in an ethical system indeed of any gentle mercy good intentions will one is fain to fancy have their recognition but of those that would enter the serene house of beauty the question that we ask is not what they had ever meant to do but what they have done their pathetic intentions are of no value to us but their realized creations only  pour moi je prefere les poetes qui font des vers les medecins qui sachent guerir les peintres qui sanchent peindre  nor in looking at a work of art should we be dreaming of what it symbolises but rather loving it for what it is  indeed the transcendental spirit is alien to the spirit of art  the metaphysical mind of asia may create for itself the monstrous and manybreasted idol but to the greek pure artist that work is most instinct with spiritual life which conforms most closely to the perfect facts of physical life also  nor in its primary aspect has a painting for instance any more spiritual message or meaning for us than a blue tile from the wall of damascus or a hitzen vase  it is a beautifully coloured surface nothing more and affects us by no suggestion stolen from philosophy no pathos pilfered from literature no feeling filched from a poet but by its own incommunicable artistic essenceby that selection of truth which we call style and that relation of values which is the draughtsmanship of painting by the whole quality of the workmanship the arabesque of the design the splendour of the colour for these things are enough to stir the most divine and remote of the chords which make music in our soul and colour indeed is of itself a mystical presence on things and tone a kind of sentiment    all these poems aim as i said at producing a purely artistic effect and have the rare and exquisite quality that belongs to work of that kind and i feel that the entire subordination in our aesthetic movement of all merely emotional and intellectual motives to the vital informing poetic principle is the surest sign of our strength  but it is not enough that a work of art should conform to the aesthetic demands of the age  there should be also about it if it is to give us any permanent delight the impress of a distinct individuality  whatever work we have in the nineteenth century must rest on the two poles of personality and perfection  and so in this little volume by separating the earlier and more simple work from the work that is later and stronger and possesses increased technical power and more artistic vision one might weave these disconnected poems these stray and scattered threads into one fierycoloured strand of life noting first a boys mere gladness of being young with all its simple joy in field and flower in sunlight and in song and then the bitterness of sudden sorrow at the ending by death of one of the brief and beautiful friendships of ones youth with all those unanswered lodgings and questionings unsatisfied by which we vex so uselessly the marble face of death the artistic contrast between the discontented incompleteness of the spirit and the complete perfection of the style that expresses it forming the chief element of the aesthetic charm of these particular poemsand then the birth of love and all the wonder and the fear and the perilous delight of one on whose boyish brows the little wings of love have beaten for the first time and the lovesongs so dainty and delicate little swallowflights of music and full of such fragrance and freedom that they might all be sung in the open air and across moving water and then autumn coming with its choirless woods and odorous decay and ruined loveliness love lying dead and the sense of the mere pity of it  one might stop there for from a young poet one should ask for no deeper chords of life than those that love and friendship make eternal for us and the best poems in the volume belong clearly to a later time a time when these real experiences become absorbed and gathered up into a form which seems from such real experiences to be the most alien and the most remote when the simple expression of joy or sorrow suffices no longer and lives rather in the stateliness of the cadenced metre in the music and colour of the linked words than in any direct utterance lives one might say in the perfection of the form more than in the pathos of the feeling  and yet after the broken music of love and the burial of love in the autumn woods we can trace that wandering among strange people and in lands unknown to us by which we try so pathetically to heal the hurts of the life we know and that pure and passionate devotion to art which one gets when the harsh reality of life has too suddenly wounded one and is with discontent or sorrow marring ones youth just as often i think as one gets it from any natural joy of living and that curious intensity of vision by which in moments of overmastering sadness and despair ungovernable artistic things will live in ones memory with a vivid realism caught from the life which they help one to forget an old grey tomb in flanders with a strange legend on it making one think how perhaps passion does live on after death a necklace of blue and amber beads and a broken mirror found in a girls grave at rome a marble image of a boy habited like eros and with the pathetic tradition of a great kings sorrow lingering about it like a purple shadowover all these the tired spirit broods with that calm and certain joy that one gets when one has found something that the ages never dull and the world cannot harm and with it comes that desire of greek things which is often an artistic method of expressing ones desire for perfection and that longing for the old dead days which is so modern so incomplete so touching being in a way the inverted torch of hope which burns the hand it should guide and for many things a little sadness and for all things a great love and lastly in the pinewood by the sea once more the quick and vital pulse of joyous youth leaping and laughing in every line the frank and fearless freedom of wave and wind waking into fire lifes burntout ashes and into song the silent lips of painhow clearly one seems to see it all the long colonnade of pines with sea and sky peeping in here and there like a flitting of silver the open place in the green deep heart of the wood with the little mossgrown altar to the old italian god in it and the flowers all about cyclamen in the shadowy places and the stars of the white narcissus lying like snowflakes over the grass where the quick brighteyed lizard starts by the stone and the snake lies coiled lazily in the sun on the hot sand and overhead the gossamer floats from the branches like thin tremulous threads of goldthe scene is so perfect for its motive for surely here if anywhere the real gladness of life might be revealed to ones youththe gladness that comes not from the rejection but from the absorption of all passion and is like that serene calm that dwells in the faces of the greek statues and which despair and sorrow cannot touch but intensify only  in some such way as this we could gather up these strewn and scattered petals of song into one perfect rose of life and yet perhaps in so doing we might be missing the true quality of the poems ones real life is so often the life that one does not lead and beautiful poems like threads of beautiful silks may be woven into many patterns and to suit many designs all wonderful and all different  and romantic poetry too is essentially the poetry of impressions being like that latest school of painting the school of whistler and albert moore in its choice of situation as opposed to subject in its dealing with the exceptions rather than with the types of life in its brief intensity in what one might call its fierycoloured momentariness it being indeed the momentary situations of life the momentary aspects of nature which poetry and painting new seek to render for us  sincerity and constancy will the artist indeed have always but sincerity in art is merely that plastic perfection of execution without which a poem or a painting however noble its sentiment or human its origin is but wasted and unreal work and the constancy of the artist cannot be to any definite rule or system of living but to that principle of beauty only through which the inconstant shadows of his life are in their most fleeting moment arrested and made permanent  he will not for instance in intellectual matters acquiesce in that facile orthodoxy of our day which is so reasonable and so artistically uninteresting nor yet will he desire that fiery faith of the antique time which while it intensified yet limited the vision still less will he allow the calm of his culture to be marred by the discordant despair of doubt or the sadness of a sterile scepticism for the valley perilous where ignorant armies clash by night is no restingplace meet for her to whom the gods have assigned the clear upland the serene height and the sunlit air rather will he be always curiously testing new forms of belief tinging his nature with the sentiment that still lingers about some beautiful creeds and searching for experience itself and not for the fruits of experience when he has got its secret he will leave without regret much that was once very precious to him  i am always insincere says emerson somewhere as knowing that there are other moods  les emotions wrote theophile gautier once in a review of arsene houssaye les emotions ne se ressemblent pas mais etre emuvoila limportant  now this is the secret of the art of the modern romantic school and gives one the right keynote for its apprehension but the real quality of all work which like mr rodds aims as i said at a purely artistic effect cannot be described in terms of intellectual criticism it is too intangible for that  one can perhaps convey it best in terms of the other arts and by reference to them and indeed some of these poems are as iridescent and as exquisite as a lovely fragment of venetian glass others as delicate in perfect workmanship and as single in natural motive as an etching by whistler is or one of those beautiful little greek figures which in the olive woods round tanagra men can still find with the faint gilding and the fading crimson not yet fled from hair and lips and raiment and many of them seem like one of corots twilights just passing into music for not merely in visible colour but in sentiment alsowhich is the colour of poetrymay there be a kind of tone  but i think that the best likeness to the quality of this young poets work i ever saw was in the landscape by the loire  we were staying once he and i at amboise that little village with its grey slate roofs and steep streets and gaunt grim gateway where the quiet cottages nestle like white pigeons into the sombre clefts of the great bastioned rock and the stately renaissance houses stand silent and apartvery desolate now but with some memory of the old days still lingering about the delicatelytwisted pillars and the carved doorways with their grotesque animals and laughing masks and quaint heraldic devices all reminding one of a people who could not think life real till they had made it fantastic  and above the village and beyond the bend of the river we used to go in the afternoon and sketch from one of the big barges that bring the wine in autumn and the wood in winter down to the sea or lie in the long grass and make plans pour la gloire et pour ennuyer les philistins or wander along the low sedgy banks matching our reeds in sportive rivalry as comrades used in the old sicilian days and the land was an ordinary land enough and bare too when one thought of italy and how the oleanders were robing the hillsides by genoa in scarlet and the cyclamen filling with its purple every valley from florence to rome for there was not much real beauty perhaps in it only long white dusty roads and straight rows of formal poplars but now and then some little breaking gleam of broken light would lend to the grey field and the silent barn a secret and a mystery that were hardly their own would transfigure for one exquisite moment the peasants passing down through the vineyard or the shepherd watching on the hill would tip the willows with silver and touch the river into gold and the wonder of the effect with the strange simplicity of the material always seemed to me to be a little like the quality of these the verses of my friend
